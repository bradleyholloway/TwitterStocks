Twitter Stock Trading

The concept of this project is to use public data from twitter tags of stock tickers.
This is then used to determine if a stock is potentially a good investment.
It should automate all the trading in order to earn a profit given initial capital.
This project oriniated as a Science Fair Project at The Academey of Science and
Technology at the Woodlands College Park High School by two seniors.
We will do our best to document changes as we go and hopefully keep it updated.
