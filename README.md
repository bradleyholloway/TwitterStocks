Twitter Stock Trading

The concept of this project is to use public data from twitter tags of stock tickers.
This is then used to determine if a stock is potentially a good investment.
It should automate all the trading in order to earn a profit given initial capital.
This project oriniated as a Science Fair Project at The Academey of Science and
Technology at the Woodlands College Park High School by two seniors.
We will do our best to document changes as we go and hopefully keep it updated.

Edit: As the project progressed we realized that limited our data to twitter would not give us comprehensive data because we would not have an effective way to sift through what was considered "unbias" for our project. Therefore; the end goal of the project changed. The project now sought to find correlateing trends between word frequencies and time as well as any given set of (numerical) data and time.
