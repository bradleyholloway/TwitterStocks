 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Selwyn Feinstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1989  New York this month is telling all employees, including the governor, they can't receive payments for speeches and the like from anybody they do business with. Where payments are permitted, the officials can't speak on state time or use state transportation. South Carolina plans to propose legislation in a couple of weeks. Legislators in California and Utah already are debating tighter regulations, but proponents acknowledge they face uphill fights.  Some other states don't understand the fuss. Alabama says it has banned honorariums for years. Among municipal governments, the pattern also is mixed. New York City, which has been wracked in recent years by a series of scandals, plans a tighter rein. The city last year told employees they couldn't receive any compensation outside their city pay without permission from the Board of Ethics. Now the board is mulling newer guidelines.  A.T. Mollegen Jr., chief executive of Analysis & Technology Inc., says an M.B.A. might have been useful. Also, he would have started with a small company; his initial job at a big firm was "too narrow," he says. As for Michael Losh, who heads General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac division, he is quite satisfied with what he's done. Still, if he could start all over again, he thinks he might have liked to have become a theoretical physicist or maybe a rock musician.
