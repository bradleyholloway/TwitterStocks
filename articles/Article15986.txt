 Excite@Home Cancels Plans to Combine Its International Businesses With Chello   By By Mylene Mangalindan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2000  Excite@Home, which provides high-speed Internet access through cable-television lines, announced in July that it would merge its assets with Chello, an international broadband Internet service provider, to create a new venture called Excite Chello. The new venture was billed as creating the largest cable-based ISP outside the U.S. with 300,000 broadband, or high-speed, subscribers.  Excite@Home said those companies blamed market conditions as the reason for not being able to move forward with the transaction. The two companies asked Excite@Home to consider other alternative transaction proposals, the company added.  Mr. Moran of Jefferies said the two sides couldn't agree on how to manage the new venture and Excite didn't want to tie up its international assets any longer. Excite Chello would have married Excite@Home's Asia-Pacific and European subscriber and media businesses with United Group's assets.
