 United Satellite Ends Broadcasts To Subscribers   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1985  United Satellite Commmunications Inc. ceased operations over the weekend, and prospects for its rescue by a potential acquirer, Tele-Communications Inc., appear dim.  United Satellite's president, Nathaniel Kwit, couldn't be reached for comment, and apparently isn't any longer directly involved in negotiations. A spokesman for Prudential Insurance Co. of America, the largest investor in United Satellite, confirmed reports that New York-based United Satellite had ceased beaming programs to its roughly 9,000 subscribers equipped with rooftop dishes. The spokesman added, however, that "we're still negotiating (with Tele-Communications) and hope something will come of it."
