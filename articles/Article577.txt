The San Diego Sockers joined the Major Indoor Soccer League yesterday - without quitting the North American Soccer League. At the M.I.S.L. annual meetings in Baltimore, the Sockers' principal owner, Robert W. Bell, announced that his team would play the full outdoor schedule of the N.A.S.L., but during the winter the team would join the M.I.S.L., whose teams played a 44-game schedule each last season.  The N.A.S.L. has an indoor season, but it will comprise 20 games. The outdoor season is 32 games long.  ''This is a beginning to an eventual merger of professional soccer leagues,'' said Earl Foreman, the commissioner of the M.I.S.L. Calling the action a ''minimerger,'' Bell said economic factors prompted the move.  ''We've developed a tremendous following for indoor soccer in San Diego,'' said Bell, whose team won the N.A.S.L. indoor championship for 1981-82. ''And the N.A.S.L. plays half as many games as the M.I.S.L., so this gives me the opportunity to present my product on a much grander scale, and to generate more income, which I can use to improve the outdoor product.''  Bell said that the Sockers' average crowds at the San Diego Sports Arena last winter were between 7,000 and 8,000 and that the team had ''several sellouts'' of 12,840 during the playoffs. Their average crowd for outdoor games at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium last year was 14,802, almost exactly the N.A.S.L. average figure (14,674). This year, the Sockers average is 8,294 after 13 home games.  The N.A.S.L. outdoor season this year began on April 3, and the 1981-82 M.I.S.L. playoffs did not end until May 26.
