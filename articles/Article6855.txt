 Campaign Tool: Tracking Ads; Bush, Kerry Run 'Pre-Buttals' Ahead of Each Other's Appearances   By Murray, Shailagh, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2004  The Kerry campaign, meanwhile, produced a series of ads that shadowed Mr. Bush after the Republican Convention, noting the president's promises to local residents when he ran four years ago. One ad that ran in Scranton, Pa., featured 2000 campaign footage of Mr. Bush, as the announcer declared, "Four years ago, George Bush came to Scranton promising quality health insurance for every senior," the announcer said, then noting the president's failure to follow through on the pledge.  The spots are hardly slick. Mr. Bush's West Virginia ad, for instance, recounted Mr. Kerry's vote against the Iraq funding and said it deprived troops of body armor and higher combat pay. But Mr. Mandel says aesthetics don't matter.  Reed Dickens, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said of the Democrats' local ad effort, "we don't see any evidence that it's working." He blames Mr. Kerry's muddled message, rather than the concept or "the size of the buy."
