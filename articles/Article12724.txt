 AOL, News Corp. Seek Broadcast Rights in China   By By Leslie Chang, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2001  Two of the world's biggest media names, AOL Time Warner Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., confirmed yesterday that they are in talks with Beijing to set up separate, officially sanctioned channels that would broadcast in the southern province of Guangdong. In return, said executives familiar with the deal and one Chinese official, the two companies would carry programs from state-owned China Central Television to overseas markets.  That such talks are going on at all may seem a surprising reversal. After a decade of attempting to crack down on reception of foreign satellite broadcasts, Beijing finally appears ready to accommodate them. Through limiting their initial operations to Guangdong, a wealthy province that abuts Hong Kong, officials apparently feel they can open up the market gradually, as they have with sectors such as insurance.
