MOSCOW, June 18â€” The Soviet press agency Tass said today that President Reagan's speech to the United Nations disarmament session was a disappointment to a majority of the delegates, who, it said, had hoped Mr. Reagan would respond to a Soviet pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.  Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko announced the pledge in an address Tuesday.  When President Reagan spoke Thursday he did not refer to it.  White House officials dismissed the Soviet move as meaningless. But Tass said today that other delegations at the United Nations had greeted it as an important step.  The commentary took issue with Mr. Reagan's criticism of the Soviet Union. However, except for expressing indignation at his accusations that Moscow was developing and using chemical weapons, the commentary was in relatively mild terms.  President Reagan accused Moscow of aggression, repression, tyranny and atrocities around the world. The Tass commentary said he had made crude attacks and had falsely tried to portray Moscow as responsible for the nuclear arms race. It ignored most of his other accusations.  The commentary said Mr. Reagan charges that Moscow was developing and using chemical weapons were intended only to divert attention from American activities in that field.
