 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Political Ineptitude   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1990  The President finds himself going into the mid-term elections at war with his own party, giving up the issues that won him the presidency, and in fact sounding the themes of his opposition. He is currently at the mercy of the Congressional Democrats, and unless he somehow manages to seize the initiative, our bet is that the damage is only starting. As the scenario unfolds, he's likely to find himself hamstrung about not only the budget but the Middle East, crippled the next two years of his presidency.  In the budget negotiations, the Darman-Brady team stumbled from failure to failure: First the original notion of a big backstage deal with the Democrats. Then the decision to accept the static-analysis revenue estimates that resurrected income-distribution arguments and put growth arguments on the back burner. Then the abandonment of the no-tax pledge. Then the demand that since the President had abandoned his principles, the House Republicans were duty-bound to do the same. For all his concessions, the President has to show only a continuing resolution to keep the government open until October 19.
