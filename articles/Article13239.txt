 Hearings to Air Issue of Wartime Powers; Lawmakers Consider Extent of President's Authority in Fight Against Terrorism   By McKinnon, John D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2006  Defending the administration's domestic wiretaps, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has noted that the president's "inherent authority" under the Constitution to intercept communications dates back more than a century. "Signals intelligence has been a fundamental aspect of waging war since the Civil War, where we intercepted telegraphs, [and] during the world wars, as we intercepted telegrams in and out of the United States." Such intercepts allow the government "to know what the enemy is doing, to know what the enemy is about to do."  Even some conservatives sympathetic to Mr. [Bush]'s goals have expressed concern. The administration's view of the war on terrorism "does have a ring of '1984': permanent war for permanent peace," says William S. Lind, of the Free Congress Foundation, which describes itself as a politically and culturally conservative think tank, in a reference to George Orwell's novel about totalitarianism.  Mr. Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan, denies that there is a conflict between protecting Americans' safety and protecting their rights. "We are engaged in a different kind of war against a deadly and sophisticated enemy," he says, and adds that Mr. Bush "made a commitment to do everything within his lawful power to protect the American people and prevent attacks from happening. That means staying a step ahead of the enemy." But, he emphasizes, Mr. Bush "takes very seriously the importance of safeguarding people's civil liberties. We can do both."
