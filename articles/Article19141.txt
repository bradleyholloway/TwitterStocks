 Jakarta's Inaction Intensifies Ethnic Suspicions --- Chinese Bankers Contend Delays on IMF Reforms Favor Indigenous Firms   By By Jay Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1999  JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The government's decision to delay the reform of Indonesia's banking system as required by the International Monetary Fund has taken on heated political and ethnic overtones.  Indeed, one problem-plagued bank controlled by a Habibie confidante announced yesterday it had raised the needed funding to avoid being shut. PT Bank Nusa Nasional's president commissioner is Aburizal Bakrie, an indigenous Indonesian, or pribumi, businessman who serves both on Mr. Habibie's economic advisory board and as the chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. Indonesia has a history of sometimes violent tension between its indigenous pribumi population and ethnic-Chinese Indonesians who have dominated commerce on the archipelago for hundreds of years.  A member of IBRA, the government agency tasked with recapitalizing Indonesian banks, openly charged that politics, rather than economics, is guiding Indonesian policy. "It's war in the government" right now over the banking issue, said another official working with the agency. "There are so many different factors at play that it's difficult to tell who's right and who's wrong."
