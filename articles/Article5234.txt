 Forest Products Firms to Post Weak Results --- Recession, Rising Capacity Bring Pressure on Prices; Slump Seen Continuing   By By G. Pierre Goad, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1991  Prices and profits in the North American paper and forest products industry tumbled in the first quarter -- and the second quarter will likely be even worse, analysts and company executives say.  Overall, "Canadian companies will be in the red and U.S. companies are approaching the red," said Sherman Chao, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Prices for most paper and forest products fell during the quarter and "prices haven't bottomed out yet," he said, adding that second-quarter earnings "will almost certainly" be lower than first quarter earnings.  Mr. Diverio expects Kimberly-Clark Corp. of Dallas to report that first-quarter earnings were about flat at $1.40 a share, compared with $1.46 a share. The remaining 16 companies he tracks will all post lower earnings, Mr. Diverio said. Overall, he expects that combined first-quarter earnings for the entire group fell 47% from a year earlier, excluding special items.
