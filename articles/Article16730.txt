 Style & Substance: GQ Jr.: Menswear Brands Launch Lines for Younger Buyers   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2007  Last fall, the Joseph Abboud brand launched Joe Joseph Abboud, a line aimed at 22- to 30-year-olds. Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. introduced Joseph. Hartmarx Corp.'s Hickey Freeman started selling hickey. Hartmarx's Hart Schaffner Marx and Oxxford Clothes also have lines aimed at young guys who don't want to look like their dads or grandfathers.  Z Zegna's runway show is another way to generate buzz. "It's a big attraction and builds excitement around Z Zegna at a good time for the men's market," says Gildo Zegna, chief executive of Ermenegildo Zegna and grandson of the firm's founder. Its choice of New York as the venue for its Z Zegna show recognizes that American men "have responded very well" to the label, Mr. Zegna says. The young label generated close to 15% of Ermenegildo Zegna's $1 billion in revenue last year, with much of that coming from North America and Asia.  He adds that he is appealing to a different customer than the traditional Ermenegildo Zegna customer. "The gentleman who buys Ermenegildo Zegna is in love with the best product and the best make and then after, the look and the silhouette," says Mr. [Alessandro Sartori]. "The Z Zegna guy is looking at the style and the silhouette first and then afterwards, the product. He likes the jacket's look even before touching it."
