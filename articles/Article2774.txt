 Unisys Profit Fell 69% in 3rd Period On Revenue Drop   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 2000  Mr. [Lawrence Weinbach] said Unisys needs to redesign most of its "repeatable solutions" -- industry-specific software and hardware installations -- so they can handle Internet transactions. To free development funds, Unisys will stop improving about half of its 30 such systems in order to focus on the 15 most-profitable business areas, he said.  Unisys also will try to improve profitability by avoiding low-margin commodity-hardware business, which amounts to about $500 million a year, Mr. Weinbach said. He declined to specify which lines will be dropped. One possibility, according to people familiar with the industry: Hewlett-Packard Co. personal computers, which Unisys resells to certain customers.  Unisys declined to say how many of the 1,500 U.S. employees who are offered early retirement it expects to take the offer. It currently has 36,000 employees, including 18,000 in the U.S.
