Hilder, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1988  Financial Corp. of America, former parent of the nation's second-largest thrift, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Financial Corp.'s petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., just before 4 p.m. PDT Friday, listed assets of $77.2 million and liabilities of $1.43 billion. However, the liabilities included about $1.2 billion of claims under about 75 lawsuits pending against Financial Corp.  After the seizure of American Savings, Financial Corp. has one remaining operating unit, a securities broker-dealer firm known as American Group Financial Corp. The unit, which has about 100 employees, sells mutual-fund and insurance products through brokers located in about 80 of the 186 American Savings branches.
