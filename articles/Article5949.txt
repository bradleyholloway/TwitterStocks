 A Special News Report About Life On the Job -- and Trends Taking Shape There   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  About a third of 492 terminated workers in a survey by Barry Goldman, a University of Arizona assistant professor, said they contacted an agency or court about potential discrimination claims. Of the 56 white workers terminated, 52% claimed discrimination. About 31% of the 407 dismissed black participants made that claim. Mr. Goldman, who would like to see litigation reduced, theorizes that whites might have more faith in the system or more personal resources to pursue a claim. White workers also "now understand the statutes don't just protect minorities," he says.  The New York City-based Fighter's Institute for Survival and Training, or Fist, helps boxers with a life outside the ring. But the group, founded by boxer Gerry Cooney, also hopes someday to become a union for boxers. Goals could include minimum standards, as with actors, says Joe Sano, Fist's president and an official at an Office and Professional Employees International Union local. "The whole idea is to crawl, walk, run," Mr. Sano says.  Traditionally, locum tenens physicians, who work on a temporary basis, are older doctors. In 1998, doctors just out of residencies were 1% of the 3,700 physicians on the rolls of Staff Care Inc., an Irving, Texas, staffing concern. Last year, they were 5% of 5,000. Numbers are hard to come by, but younger physicians are expressing more interest, says Carl Unsicker, a medical director for Vista Staffing Solutions Inc. in Salt Lake City.
