 U.S., Saudi Arabia to Freeze Assets Of 2 Branches of an Islamic Charity   By By Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2002  The move to freeze the assets of two branches of Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation signaled enhanced U.S.-Saudi cooperation over the sensitive issue of Muslim charities that straddle the line between legitimate and illicit activities.  Saudi officials have expressed skepticism about U.S. charges that charities often serve as financial conduits for terror groups, and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was careful yesterday to distinguish the Islamic educational efforts of the foundation's Saudi headquarters from the Somali and Bosnian branches, which "have been engaged in supporting terrorist activities and organizations," he said.  Al-Haramain employees in Somalia and Bosnia have been connected to terrorism for years, according to Treasury officials. The Somali Al-Haramain branch employed members of a local terrorist organization, Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya, and funneled money to the group by pretending the funds were going to build orphanages, Islamic schools or mosques, the Treasury Department said.
