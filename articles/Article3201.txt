 The Economy: Confidence in Recovery Is Building; Economists Surveyed See Growth Rate in 1st Quarter At 4.1% Annualized Rate   By Cindy Perman and Jon E. Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2003  In a separate aspect of the survey, economists weighed in for the first time on the economic policies of presidential contenders in the Democratic Party. While Howard Dean, who has called for the repeal of the Bush administration's tax cuts, is widely seen as a front-runner for the party's nomination, he wasn't a favorite among the business economists who participate in the survey. Only one economist surveyed said Mr. Dean's policies were best suited, when compared with those of the other Democratic candidates, to increase employment, incomes and growth.  Among 53 economists who participated in s November forecasting survey, the average projection for the inflation-adjusted annualized growth rate of the nation's gross domestic product during the first quarter of 2004 was 4.1%. That was revised upward from 3.9% when the group was last surveyed in October. The average estimate for the second-quarter growth rate was 3.9%, revised upward from 3.8% a month ago. The group put growth for the fourth quarter of 2003 at 4%, unchanged from their predictions in both the September and October surveys. Gross domestic product is a broad measure of the nation's output of goods and services.
