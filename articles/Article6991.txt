 Return of the Rust Belt   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2005  The [Jennifer Granholm] strategy of chasing smoke stacks with a fistful of dollars isn't likely to yield much in the way of an economic rebirth in Michigan. A version of this corporate-welfare strategy was first tried by former Governor John Engler, who was otherwise a highly successful reformer and tax cutter over three terms. But after spending $3 billion over 10 years, there was "no improvement in Michigan's per capita income, jobs, or unemployment," according to a study by the Mackinac Center, the state's leading think tank.  This week Republicans are expected to pass their tax cut package once again. But Ms. Granholm, after agreeing to the tax relief in negotiations, is now threatening another veto. Her latest excuse is that the Republicans in Washington, D.C., are cutting $1 billion in federal cash that goes to Michigan's "needy farmers, families and students," and thus the state will have to make up the difference. A veto would be an act of political bad faith, but in any case these nickel-and-dime tax cuts aren't enough to help the state's economy.
