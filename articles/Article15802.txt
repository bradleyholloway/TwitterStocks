 Road Warrior Senator Gets Day in Wash. Court   By By Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1999  The West Seattle Democrat who urged Washingtonians not to vote for Referendum 49, the road-project initiative handily approved last year, is contesting its constitutionality. Initially viewed as something of a joke, Sen. [Mike] Heavey's legal challenge, filed in March with the Washington Supreme Court, is suddenly being taken seriously in Olympia. The high court recently agreed to hear the case.  Referendum 49 authorizes the state treasurer to issue bonds to fund $1.9 billion of road projects over the next five years, from the extension of high-occupancy-vehicle lanes on Interstate 5 in Seattle to the widening of Interstate 90 in Spokane. The ballot initiative was approved by 57% of voters, no doubt in part because it also reduced, by an average of $30 a car, the unpopular motor-vehicle excise tax that Washingtonians pay every year. In addition, it redirects a portion of the revenue from that tax -- about $156 million over two years -- to the state's road fund. Before Referendum 49, that money went into the general fund.  Sen. Heavey's contention is that the redirection is illegal. He is asking that all money transferred, including Referendum 49 funds as well as previous transfers totaling about $350 million every two years, be restored to the general fund. His case rests on two words in a proviso to the 18th Amendment to the Washington Constitution. The amendment, which was approved by voters in 1944, created a fund dedicated to highway projects, and the proviso reads (with emphasis added), "This section shall not be construed to include revenue from general or special taxes or excise taxes not levied primarily for highway purposes or apply to vehicle operators license fees or any excise tax imposed on motor vehicles."
