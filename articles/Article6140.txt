 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1998  Scheduling meetings a year ahead grows common. More overseas trips are a factor; so are set weekly and monthly staff meetings. Honeywell Inc. says its Chairman Michael R. Bonsignore has some meetings booked for every month of 1999, but adds: "He's flexible." And Frederick Copeland, president of Aetna Inc.'s Aetna International unit, says his meeting load has gotten heavier over the past five years -- six a day is typical -- as the unit has grown and now includes 15 countries.  Alan Kirshner, chairman of Markel Corp., a specialty-insurance underwriter in Glen Allen, Va., has about 15 meetings a week with managers, but makes a point of keeping time open for others. "It doesn't have to be a VIP," he says. William Antle III, chairman of Oak Industries, an electronic components maker in Waltham, Mass., says he is filling in his calendar earlier than when he became a senior executive nine years ago, partly because those he meets with are booked farther ahead.  Mr. [Robert] Brawer was a literature professor at the University of Wisconsin and spent 20 years at Maidenform Inc., where he retired as CEO in 1995. His book examines the human problems encountered in business in works as diverse as "The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer and "Glengarry Glen Ross" by David Mamet. So, what book might help today's corporate manager? He picks "Point of No Return" by John Marquand, a 1949 tale of a successful investment banker who feels trapped in his career and seeks his true identity.
