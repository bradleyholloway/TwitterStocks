 Letters to the Editor: Back Israel Proudly, And Don't Apologize   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 2001  I disagree with Mr. [Gerald Seib]'s comparison of the Iran-Iraq war to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Arafat's PLO has consistently refused to come to terms with the very existence of Israel. Just last year it refused generous terms offered by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Instead, the PLO reverted to random murders of civilians in an attempt to achieve its true goal, the destruction of the only democratic country in the Middle East.
