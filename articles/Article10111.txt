 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Television: Back to the '60s   By Nancy deWolf Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2007  This is not entirely Mr. [Tom Brokaw]'s fault (and in a way it may be his point -- more about that later). Take the soundtrack, including such classics as "Magic Carpet Ride," "All Along the Watchtower" and "Jumpin' Jack Flash." The latter, which accompanies footage of brawling protesters and Chicago cops at the 1968 Democratic Convention, accidentally made me laugh.You could picture an editing room where everybody said, "Hey, cool, this Stones tune will set the mood." Yet the music of the era has been replayed so often and become such a routine part of the culture -- including advertising for everything from cars to retirement financial planners -- that it has lost its punch and is veering toward kitsch.  Amid nonsense from token figures like Jerry Garcia and footnotes like Mr. [Mark Rudd], some voices stand out. The Journal's Dorothy Rabinowitz tartly observes that for all the hoopla then (and wait for 2008) about the idealistic youth and their counterculture, "Most of the time, it was a wild excess of self-glorification and narcissism . . ." by "an incredibly spoiled, self-indulgent generation . . . ." Stewart Brand, founder of "The Whole Earth Catalogue," is less trenchant, but you get the feeling that he thinks a lot of the beautiful people were poseurs, too. This doesn't come across so strongly in the film as it does in Mr. Brokaw's new book "Boom! Voices of the Sixties." There we learn that Internet pioneer Mr. Brand supports nuclear power, and that when people tell him they read "Whole Earth" in their youth, he asks them "Why?" Few have a good answer.
