 New Rules for Banks to Clear Checks Could Prompt Some to Delay Interest   By By Karen Slater, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1988  New federal rules limiting the holds banks and thrifts can place on deposited checks went into effect last week. But while the new law will mean speedier access to deposited funds for many customers, some may find that it comes at a price.  Citing the new check-clearing rules as one factor, a few institutions have decided to stop the immediate crediting of interest on deposits. Others are talking about taking the same step.  Banks that are dropping immediate crediting of interest are taking a couple of different approaches. At University Savings Association in Houston, for instance, most checks deposited after Dec. 1 will start earning interest on the next business day. On the other hand, BankWest in Pierre, S.D., plans -- probably beginning Nov. 1 -- to credit interest on most deposited checks when the bank actually receives the funds, usually a day or two after a check is deposited.
