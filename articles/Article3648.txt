 Taste -- de gustibus: At Last! It's OK To Bash Away With Stereotypes   By By Tunku Varadarajan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  The earliest records of stereotyping are Egyptian hieroglyphs about Assyrians and Babylonians. The Lydian tablets (from present-day Izmir), which are just being translated, speak harshly of piratical seamen called Achaeans (Greeks). Or think of the Old Testament and the Israelite stereotyping of Philistines. The Greeks standardized all aliens as barbarians because they couldn't speak Greek but went baa-baa, like sheep. Not that such views necessarily carry the day. Alexander the Great had the first idea of a universal imperium where ethnic differences were subsumed in the greater whole -- thus Alexandria, the New York of the ancient world.  Of course, the stereotypist nation par excellence is England, which caricatures its nearest and dearest as well as its enemies. The Scots and the French have, through history, been Albion's favorite targets. The Scots have been seen as "wild" ever since their James VI became James I of England in 1603 and brought south thousands of thuggish Scots on the make. Suspicion of France has been rampant ever since the Norman Conquest.
