 In Russia, an Uncomfortable Draft --- Conscription's Objectors Challenge a Tradition Dating Back Centuries   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2002  NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia -- Twenty orderlies working in a hospital in this Volga River city have become poster boys in a campaign to overhaul Russia's demoralized military.

In doing so, they have triggered an unprecedented public debate on the future of the armed forces.
