 LAB NOTES   By By Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1988  A few years ago researchers discovered that the hypothalamus in the brain produces a chemical that triggers the pituitary gland to make growth hormone. This led to the finding that many slow-growing children had normal pituitaries but a deficiency in "growth hormone releasing factor," or GHRF, produced by the hypothalamus.  GHRF is a simple chemical and is being made by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a Nutley, N.J., unit of the big Swiss drug maker of the same name. Because GHRF is synthetically produced, it should be considerably cheaper than the genetically engineered growth hormone, says a Hoffmann-La Roche researcher. In addition, he says, when the pituitary is stimulated by GHRF, it automatically produces only as much growth hormone as the body needs, whereas injections of genetically engineered growth hormone are somewhat arbitrary. (The genetically engineered growth hormone is produced by Genentech Inc., San Francisco.)  Early trials in slow-growing children whose pituitaries are normal showed only minor, temporary side effects such as a flushed face. Trials are now under way to confirm that GHRF can increase the rate of growth to near-normal levels. But neither GHRF nor growth hormone can make a child taller than he would have been with normal growth, the Roche researcher cautions.
