 Utilities Prevail as House Panel Rejects Plan to Speed Tax Refunds to Customers   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Brooks Jackson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1989  The utilities prevailed after their political action committees poured a total of $610,000 into the campaigns of Ways and Means committee members since Jan. 1, 1987, according to a computer-aided tabulation of Federal Election Commission records. Those contributions were part of $10.3 million given by those PACs to all House and Senate candidates during that period.  Some who got the biggest donations turned against the utilities in yesterday's committee vote, including the sponsor of the refund proposal, Rep. Robert Matsui (D.,Calif.). But when the long-awaited vote was tallied, the utilities prevailed, 22-13.  During an extraordinary drafting session held to dispose of the Matsui controversy, the tax-writing panel bowed to what bill co-sponsor Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) described as "intensive lobbying" by the electric, telephone and gas utilities.
