 Genentech Reports Positive Results For Growth Drug   By By Ralph T. King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1999  Genentech Inc. said a new form of human-growth hormone requiring monthly or biweekly shots proved as effective as the current once-a-day version in a test of children who lack the hormone.  The biotechnology company announced the results at a medical conference yesterday sunNo and plans to seek regulatory approval shortly. If approved, the drug's added convenience could boost Genentech's share of the market for growth hormone, its top-selling product last year, where it faces stiff competition from Eli Lilly & Co. and others.  The six-month trial involved 74 children who got equal doses in shots either once or twice a month. The children, all of them growth-hormone deficient, grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 inches, which is comparable to the rate seen with daily therapy, Genentech said.
