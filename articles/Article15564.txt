 Quantum Is Selling Control of Business In Recording Heads   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1997  Quantum is the second-largest independent disk drive company behind Seagate Technology Inc. Unlike most of its competitors, which do their own manufacturing, Quantum in recent years has increasingly come to rely on MKE, the contract manufacturing arm of Matsushita, to build its products for it. MKE has made Quantum's entry-level disk drives since 1984, and the relationship was widened last year to include Quantum's high-end drives.
