 Taliban John Lindh Faces New Charges   By By Jess Bravin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  Then, "blindfolded and bound with plastic cuffs so tight that his hands turned blue," Mr. Lindh was flown to Camp Rhino, a U.S. Marine base near Kandahar. "Soldiers transporting him threatened him with death and torture," the papers claim. After three days in which Mr. Lindh was kept naked in a "metal shipping container," he was brought before a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent. "Mr. Lindh believed that the only way to escape the torture of his current circumstance was to do whatever the agent wanted," the papers assert, and that was when he "allegedly voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and his right to counsel and answered questions."  Mr. [John Ashcroft] said Mr. Lindh had "betrayed" his country and conspired "with international terrorist groups whose agenda is to kill Americans." Nonetheless, Mr. Lindh hasn't been charged with treason, a capital offense. U.S. Attorney Paul McNulty, however, said additional counts are possible.
