 Tax report: The Onassis auction   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1996  Owners of memorabilia associated with Jack Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis should consider donating them to charity, tax lawyers say, given the astronomical prices such items drew at the Onassis auction at Sotheby's. A donor might be able to cite the Onassis results as a "comparable sale" for tax purposes.
