 Dinosaur industry: Bush's new solution for problems of S&Ls could kill them off   By Murray, Alan; Thomas, Paulette; Duke, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1989  The Bush administration's new plan to bailout the savings and loan industry could eliminate the distinctions between banks and savings and loans. The new plan calls for: 1) a new government agency to issue $50 billion of long-term bonds to pay for the bailout; 2) the government to take over 350 thrifts; 3) the Treasury to control the FHLBB; 4) higher federal insurance premiums to be paid by thrifts and banks; and 5) the Justice Department to be given $50 million to prosecute illegal operations conducted by thrifts. Thrifts would also have more rigid capital requirements.
