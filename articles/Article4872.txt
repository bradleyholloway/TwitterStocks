 U.S., European Cars Flood into Taiwan As Consumers Shun Shoddy Local Models   By By James McGregor, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1988  TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Standing behind the counter of his cluttered drug store in a Taipei suburb, Wu Teng-tsung peers past the Green Oil for headaches and the Essence of Chicken for fatigue. He is keeping a watchful eye on his most prized possession: the dark-gray 1988 Oldsmobile Firenza parked across the street.  For the country's domestic auto makers, Mr. Wu's enthusiasm for foreign cars reflects the disappearance of another kind of protective cover. Taiwan is opening its market to U.S. and European autos, forcing the domestic auto industry to grapple with the new competition.  Local auto makers are flush with cash because of a continuing car-buying frenzy. But they are worried because U.S. and European cars are gobbling up ever-larger segments of the market, and consumers are complaining about the quality of vehicles made in Taiwan. Authorized foreign-car dealers are losing market share as well to a growing black market.
