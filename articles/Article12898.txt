 China to Rely on Deficit Spending to Spur Growth   By By Charles Hutzler, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2003  Outlining government plans at the start of the national legislature's annual session yesterday, Premier Zhu Rongji said economic development is "the key to solving all problems China is facing."
