 Microsoft Advances on Game, TV Fronts   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2001  Each of the Microsoft-designed machines has new features that are likely to have an impact. Ultimate TV, for example, has two TV tuners as well as a hard disk. It can pause live programs and fast-forward through commercials, like existing hard-disk recorders, but also simultaneously record two programs while playing back a third from its disk. Ultimate TV can store about 35 hours of satellite-TV programming, and can access the Internet using Microsoft's WebTV or another service provider.  Microsoft tried and failed to get other companies to build the Xbox, later deciding to design the console itself and have it manufactured by Flextronics International Ltd. of Singapore. Robbie Bach, the Microsoft executive who calls himself "chief Xbox officer," now says the company's own brand name and resources were essential to get game developers and retailers to support the system.  "We wouldn't support Xbox if we didn't think Microsoft had the potential to sell upwards of 20 million or 30 million units," says Brian Farrell, chief executive of THQ Inc., a large game maker in Calabasas Hills, Calif., that is supporting both Xbox and PlayStation 2.
