 Oil Stocks May Keep Barreling Along   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2004  "Forty-two dollars or $43 a barrel is still very healthy for oil companies," says Doug Leggate, an oil-stock analyst at Citigroup. "The bottom line is that [even] $30 oil is still a good place to be for a lot of these companies."  "If oil falls by $10 a barrel, Exxon and other oil stocks may do nothing, as the overall market rallies" thanks to the falling oil price, says Citigroup's Mr. Leggate.  Mr. Leggate frets about ConocoPhillips (COP), which is close to a 52-week high. He thinks it is more susceptible to lower oil prices than major energy companies with exposure to other areas, such as the chemical business. In a move that some shareholders fear might weigh on Conoco's debt load, the company is hoping to increase its stake in Russian oil giant OAO Lukoil Holdings, according to a Russian government official running an auction for the shares; a Conoco spokesman has declined comment. Mr. Leggate argues that any profit from Russia could disappoint because of high taxes there.
