 The Big Guys' Burden --- '60s Slugger Frank Howard Pulls for Mark McGwire In Home-Run Title Race   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  The main contenders: Mark McGwire, who had 47 homers at the close of business yesterday, Sammy Sosa, who had 46, and Ken Griffey Jr., who had 41. But the evidence of our senses makes Mr. McGwire the clear favorite to succeed to the Sultanate of Swat.  His most obvious advantage was captured in a television shot of him and Mr. Sosa standing side by side during a game last weekend between his St. Louis Cardinals and Mr. Sosa's Chicago Cubs. Mr. Sosa is 6 feet tall and a deep-chested 200 pounds, but looked small next to the 6-foot-5, 250-pound Mr. McGwire.  The fact is, though, great size never has been considered an asset in baseball, a game of reflexes and coordination in which the prototypical slugger is built along the lines of Mr. Sosa, not Mr. McGwire. Mr. (Roger) Maris, for instance, measured 6 feet tall and weighed 205 pounds, while Hank Aaron, the career home-run leader (with 755), stood 6-foot-0 and weighed less than 200 pounds for most of his tenure. Babe Ruth, the game's greatest power hitter, was a bigger man at 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, but still within the classic range.
