 For Rubin, Pressure's On   By Enrich, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  Citigroup's board yesterday accepted the resignation of Charles Prince as chairman and chief executive officer and named Mr. [Robert Rubin], 69 years old, chairman. Mr. Rubin said he was reluctant to take the chairman's post but ultimately agreed to out of "concern for the company and concern for the people of the company and the importance of the company in the global economy."  Until now, Mr. Rubin's job at Citigroup largely entailed attending -- and offering advice at -- weekly meetings of business heads, helping to orchestrate acquisitions and tapping his contacts to win business for the New York bank. "If you need somebody to call somebody and get the phone answered, Bob can do it," says a senior Citigroup executive, noting that Mr. Rubin enjoys "unencumbered access" to leaders and executives around the world.  Similar sentiments have been festering within Citigroup's investment bank. A former trading executive at Goldman, Mr. Rubin regularly visits Citigroup's investment-banking headquarters and every few weeks eats dinner with a group of traders, say people familiar with the matter. But his role in luring Vikram Pandit, a high-profile Morgan Stanley alumnus, to Citigroup this year irked employees who felt Mr. Pandit's skill set overlapped with that of Thomas Maheras, a well- regarded trader and co-head of the investment bank. Last month, Mr. Pandit was promoted to oversee the investment bank, and Mr. Maheras resigned. Other senior traders are expected to follow Mr. Maheras to the exits.
