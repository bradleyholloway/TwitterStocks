 Abbott Studies Show Drug Delays Prostate Cancer   By Rosenberg, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2004  Although Mr. [Glenn Novarro] conservatively estimates approval of the drug in early 2006, he said it could come as early as the first half of 2005. Mr. Novarro rates Abbott a buy and doesn't own shares. Banc of America Securities does have an investment-banking relationship with Abbott.  "The original study just missed the mark for delay of disease progression," said Michael Carducci, principal investigator for the study and an associate professor of oncology and urology at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. "So the real significance comes in with a larger body of data. This data suggests that for patients with asymptomatic metastatic disease, this would provide benefit in delaying time to progression." The study was funded by Abbott, of North Chicago, Ill.
