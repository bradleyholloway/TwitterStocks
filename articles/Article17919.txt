 Chemical Bank's Texas Commerce Unit To Post an Unexpected Profit for 1988   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1989  MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- In an announcement that surprised and puzzled banking analysts, Chemical Banking Corp. said its troubled Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. unit made a profit last year.  Asked if Texas Commerce had turned the corner, Mr. Shipley said: "The state is turning the corner. Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans peaked in June. Both the September and December figures were slightly lower, but that's not to say that they might not rise in March. We think that the loan loss level has peaked as well."  When Chemical acquired Texas Commerce in May 1987 for $1.19 billion without federal assistance, the Texas bank was saddled with bad loans stemming from the depressed Texas economy. Turning the unit around has been a slow, arduous process, and Chemical had led investors to believe that Texas Commerce would post a small loss for 1988.
