 How White House Crafted Win --- Bush Team Chose Messages, Candidates; Now It Reaps Benefits With Congress   By By Jeanne Cummings and Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2002  Mr. [Laura Bush]'s frantic, final days on the campaign trail, which included stops in Minnesota and 14 other states in the final weekend, represent only the most public aspect of his administration's investment in the midterm campaign. For the White House, it began in the spring of 2001, when Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords abandoned the GOP and gave control of the Senate to the Democrats. After that, Mr. Bush and the GOP worked nimbly and ruthlessly to retake control of their political destiny -- one recruiting pitch, one fund-raiser, and one presidential initiative at a time.  Mr. Bush capped off his efforts with high-profile appearances at GOP pep rallies. He brought an extraordinary level of popularity among the GOP base, moderates and conservatives alike. On the eve of the 1990 midterm election, the first President Bush enjoyed a 79% approval rating among Republicans; the current president's intraparty approval is 93%.  Mr. Bush also helped fuel the party's upgraded machinery for mobilizing support in low-turnout midterm contests. The GOP's get-out-the-vote program was augmented after the Bush team concluded the Democrats far outperformed them on the ground in 2000. It partly involved a return to old-fashioned political tactics, such as using volunteers in addition to hired staffers to telephone Republican voters.
