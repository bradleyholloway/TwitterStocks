 Career Journal: The Jungle   By By Kris Maher, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2002  "I'm thinking it probably could have helped, but I'll never know," says Margie Clark, a 51-year-old former senior collections representative for a Global Crossing unit who was laid off Dec. 31. She hadn't received any outplacement assistance at the time of Global Crossing's Jan. 28 filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Ms. Clark, a Denver resident now working as a part-time consultant, says the bankruptcy cost her $62,000 in severance benefits. "Personally, I felt betrayed," she says.  Before the filing, all laid-off Global Crossing staffers were eligible for some outplacement aid. The fact that employees terminated prior to Jan. 28 stopped getting outplacement counseling "is a common but unfortunate occurrence when a company files for bankruptcy," says Tisha Kresler, a spokeswoman for the telecommunications company based in Hamilton, Bermuda. Its North American operations are run from Madison, N.J.
