 PURSUITS; Books: Democracy's Cautious Fan   By Willcox, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2007  Although [Alexis de Tocqueville]'s most celebrated work, "Democracy in America," focused on the fledgling republic, Mr. [Joseph Epstein] says that the book is "only secondarily about America." Tocqueville's real subject is "to show the perils of thoughtless democracy and its most beneficent possibilities."  Mr. Epstein does offer a few demurrals: Tocqueville's lack of serious attention to education and to the rise of industrial technology (e.g., the railroad) weakens "Democracy in America." Other critics, he notes, have lamented Tocqueville's failure to offer empirical support for pithy generalizations in passages such as: "In democratic ages men rarely sacrifice themselves for another, but they show a general compassion for all the human race."
