 Getting Going: My Advice Isn't Bad, It's Just the Timing   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  What about REITs? Valuations have only gotten worse. Consider equity REITs, which make their money by buying and then renting out offices, apartments, shopping malls and other real estate. In late 1999, equity REITs were yielding over 9%. Not long after, I devoted an entire column to REITs, describing them as "compelling."  Today, equity REITs yield less than 4%. Faced with such meager dividends, I would limit REITs to no more than 5% of a stock portfolio, and I would be more comfortable with a 3% allocation. What if you don't own REITs? I wouldn't be in a big rush to build up a full 3% or 5% position.  Let's suppose you had stashed money in Google or in a gold fund. In all likelihood, you wouldn't have invested more than 5% of your portfolio. That 5% stake would have helped your portfolio's performance. But the gains wouldn't have made that much difference to your total wealth.
