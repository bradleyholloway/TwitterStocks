 Looking a Gift Horse in the Mouth   By By William McGurn, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2003  That's precisely the claim Lauren Arnold will make tomorrow in a lecture at the University of San Francisco's Ricci Institute. Ms. Arnold intends to demonstrate that a painting in the British Museum said to depict an old Chinese legend is in fact a sophisticated allegory referring to a landmark event in the annals of East-West relations: the arrival in Beijing in 1342 of a delegation from Pope Benedict XII bearing a gift horse to the last Mongol emperor, Shundi.  At issue is a painting called "Bole Judging a Horse." Bole was the name given to a seventh-century man whose keen judgment of horseflesh was transformed by Chinese folklore into a metaphor for an ability to recognize superior men -- a crucial attribute for any leader. Like so many other things in Chinese history, however, Ms. Arnold says the real story is even more complicated. While researching a 1999 book on the influence of Chinese art on early Renaissance painters such as Giotto, she became intrigued with the idea that "Bole Judging a Horse" was in fact a sophisticated parody of "Heavenly Horse," a Chinese painting that did in fact commemorate the 1342 ceremony.  It is this Franciscan interlude that provides the backdrop to the Heavenly Horse. After [Fra Giovanni]'s death, the Christians around Shundi (including his hereditary guard) pressed the young emperor to write the pope to ask for a new bishop. The pope complied, and included a horse, led into the court with much pomp and circumstance in a beautiful procession. "The emperor rejoiced with great joy," wrote one Franciscan in attendance, believing this heralded the emperor's imminent embrace of Christ.
