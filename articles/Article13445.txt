 The Buzz: China Digital TV Energizes IPOs With a Gain of 75%   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  China Digital TV closed at $28 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up from its IPO price of $16. The 75% gain ranks it as the third-best IPO debut of the year, after medical software firm Athenahealth Inc.'s 97% gain in September and software firm VMware Inc.'s 76% rise in August.  The company's chief financial officer, Liang Xu, said the market for digital television in China began about a decade ago but didn't grow rapidly until recent years. "We're definitely confident in the business process and the growth of this industry," said Mr. Xu in a telephone interview.
