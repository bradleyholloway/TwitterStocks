 Love & Money: A TV in the Kid's Room? Well, Maybe...   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  Between parents and kids, [Alex] says, "TV is all about socializing and spending time together. [Grace] and I have this thing where we watch DVDs of 'Dawson's Creek' and 'Gilmore Girls' together, and it's a way to build a common framework and to talk about things that come up. One episode brought up sex, and I asked her if any of her friends were having sex yet, and, yes, she freaked out, but it was a way into that conversation that was not totally out of the blue. TV lets you use pop culture as the backdrop to talk about stuff with your kids."  "When my friend heard my views, she strongly disagreed," my friend says. "She pointed out that I have a television in my bedroom, and I like to lie in bed and watch TV because it's comfortable. Kids like the same thing. And often kids want to watch TV shows that parents aren't interested in, while parents want to watch shows like the news that kids don't care about. With channel-blocking technology, you don't have to worry about them watching things they shouldn't see."  "I'm still not there, yet," my friend says, "and I'm not comfortable with having a TV in my daughter's room because I worry she could still end up watching too much. But I'm also reconsidering it because I do strongly believe that if you make something forbidden fruit -- whether it's candy, soda or television -- it becomes more desirable to kids. So when she's older, and can understand rules about TV viewing a little better, then maybe I'll consider it."
