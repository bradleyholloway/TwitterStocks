 Politics & People: Should It Be Washington's Reagan Airport?   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1998  The controversy over whether to rename Washington's National Airport for Ronald Reagan involves two separate issues: What's appropriate as a tribute to the former president, and in naming important buildings and landmarks.  Virginia Gov. George Allen and conservative activist Grover Norquist are spearheading the movement for a Reagan Airport. It has been embraced by leading Republicans, who argue it would be a more fitting tribute than the massively expensive downtown Washington building that is named after the 40th president and will house, among other offices, the Environmental Protection Agency.  This isn't the most profound of debates, as some arguments demonstrate. Rep. Bob Barr (R., Ga.), in an interview with U.S. News and World Report's Gloria Borger, argued: "There is something very special about the freedom to travel, which Reagan understood, and nothing symbolizes that more than this airport." The Gipper as the father of frequent flyers?
