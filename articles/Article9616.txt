 A Nimble Fiscal Two-Step in Brazil; Renewal of IMF Pact Shows Brasilia's Finesse and Boosts Lender's Dim Latin Image [1]  By Karp, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2003  The prospect of Brazil's emerging from economic recession offers a bright spot for the IMF in a troubled region that largely resents the fund's traditional prescription of budget austerity and free markets. Despite the worst economic crisis in its history, Argentina resisted IMF demands and secured a weak accord that doesn't reassure many investors. Ecuador is struggling to meet its IMF targets to qualify for the next tranche of its loan, unrest in Bolivia ousted its pro-IMF president last month, and thousands of Hondurans protested recently against a visiting IMF mission by blocking highways and going on strike.  Brazil, racked by a string of international and domestic financial shocks, has been under successive -- and arguably successful -- IMF plans since 1998. Last year, investor fears that a victory by the leftist Workers Party in general elections would lead to a debt default prompted an emergency $30 billion IMF lifeline, the biggest in the fund's history. The gamble paid off. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, by toeing a centrist economic line, has restored Brazil's market credibility.  Reinforcing the need for further IMF protection in the event of a shock, Brazil's foreign-reserves situation is less solid than it appears. Excluding IMF money, net reserves stand at between $16 billion and $19 billion, depending on the calculation. Next year, Brazil's external debt amortizations exceed $30 billion.
