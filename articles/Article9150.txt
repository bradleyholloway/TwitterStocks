 Advertising Spending to Get Big Boost From Internet Companies Next Year   By By Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1999  "New technologies are helping all media," said Robert Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting for the unit of Interpublic Group, predicting magazine advertising will rise 7.5% to $11.9 billion and newspaper advertising to jump 8% to $6.4 billion in 2000. Advertising on the Internet itself is expected to jump 75% in 2000 to $3.2 billion, he said.  On television, where Internet firms have been spending furiously recently, revenue also is expected to rise. Mr. Coen's predictions call for a 9% increase in ad spending on the Big Four networks to more than $16 billion. Internet companies are so hungry for national exposure that Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, which will televise the Super Bowl next year, has sold 30-second commercials to several dot-com companies for a record $3 million each.
