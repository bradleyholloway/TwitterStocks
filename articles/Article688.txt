 Beatrice's Directors Are Said to Accept Sweetened Buyout Offer From Kohlberg   By By Daniel Hertzberg and Betsy Morris, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1985  Beatrice Cos.'s board accepted a sweetened acquisition offer by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. of $50 a share, or $5.45 billion, a member of the Kohlberg Kravis buyout group and Wall Street sources said last night.  Beatrice's board had rejected Kohlberg Kravis's original offer of $40 in cash and $5 in preferred. Late last month, after Kohlberg Kravis sweetened its bid for the first time, the Beatrice board said it would negotiate with Kohlberg Kravis on the terms of its proposed buyout.  The group member of Kohlberg Kravis, a New York-based investment partnership, said the Dart-Hutton group hadn't made a formal offer but promised it would have, if it had been given enough time. However, the Wall Street sources insisted the Dart-Hutton group had made the $48-a-share offer, subject to financing, and told Beatrice it might go higher if given more time to review Beatrice's financial data. The Dart-Hutton group was said to be upset because it wasn't given more time to work on its offer. Beatrice sent out detailed financial information to potential bidders only late last week.
