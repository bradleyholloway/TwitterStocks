 Region's Stocks Do Relatively Well Amid Turmoil in High-Tech Sector   By By Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2000  Mr. [Ron Saba], the Charlotte portfolio manager, picked another of the region's big winners: CBRL Group, Lebanon, Tenn., which rose 60% from late March through Friday to $14.0625. The restaurant operator, which has more than 420 Cracker Barrel combination stores and restaurants in 40 states, fell to about $8 in January after peaking in the low $40s in 1998.  It wasn't long before investors were dumping tech darlings to embrace staid old companies that still push out profits, especially "value" plays that looked too cheap to pass up. As a result, since the regional indexes peaked on March 24, the Southeast and Florida have been moving up on the performance list. "In the first two months of the year, if it wasn't in the technology sector, most people just didn't want to own it," says Pete Verdu, a portfolio manager at AmSouth Bancorp. in Birmingham.  The Southeast's rebound echoes what's going on in the broader market, says AmSouth's Mr. Verdu. Of the 15 industry sectors he follows, technology, which is more concentrated on the West Coast, was down 11% in May, and consumer durables, more dominant in the Midwest, were down 14%. The two best performers? Energy and financial services, with the latter making up 24% of Wilshire's Southeast index.
