 Group Seeks Federal Help for Broadband   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2002  The Bells have said they would invest billions in broadband technologies if the rules were dropped. But rivals say that doing so would merely cement the Bells' hold over the nascent digital subscriber line services, or DSL. The FCC already is expected to launch a separate review later during the year that could lead to broadband being almost entirely deregulated.  Elsewhere in the report, TechNet asks state and federal lawmakers for legislation limiting local governments' ability to impose conditions and fees on companies that need access to public rights of way to build wireless transmission towers or lay underground optical fiber. Such a move likely would trigger opposition from state and local governments concerned about quality of life and aesthetic issues.
