 Molson Coors Is Focus of SEC Inquiry; Regulators Ask Big Brewer For Additional Information On Merger, Quarterly Results   By Mike Esterl and Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2005  The North American brewing titan, created from the February merger of Adolph Coors Co. of Golden, Colo., and Molson Inc. of Montreal, said the SEC has asked it to provide further information related to the merger, its first-quarter financial results and "other information." The regulatory agency has advised it that the inquiry "should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred," added the company, which said it is cooperating. Company representatives in the U.S. and Canada declined to comment further. An SEC spokesman also declined to comment.
