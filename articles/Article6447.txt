 Letters to the Editor: Destroying Lives `for Their Own Good'   The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 2001  I was shocked by Dr. [Sally Satel]'s commentary. Here we have an actor, a really fine actor, who was given drugs by his hippie father when he was only six. He grew up in the world of show business where drugs are widely used. In spite of several attempts at rehab and jail sentences, Mr. [Robert Downey Jr.] cannot shake his drug habit. Dr. Satel suggests that he should leave the drug-ridden world of Hollywood or he will never recover.  Most of us have friends or family members whose initial efforts to overcome tobacco or alcohol were just as futile as Mr. Downey's to overcome cocaine. Tobacco and alcohol are two addictive agents even more destructive to health, but deemed "legal." Some of those addicts eventually succeed after years of failure; others will die with their addictions still in control. What Dr. Satel can't explain is why the introduction of police, judges and the threat of imprisonment into the treatment equation is so essential for some addictions, but unnecessary for others.
