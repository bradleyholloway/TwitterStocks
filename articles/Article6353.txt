 Gore, Lieberman Campaign in the Deep South   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 2000  Yesterday's Southern stand underscored one of the most important goals of the [Al Gore] campaign: to crack into the Republicans' Southern stronghold. The Democrats hope to pick off at least a few states besides Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee, despite Texas Gov. George W. Bush's generally strong standing in the region.  Georgia Rep. Calvin Smyre, a leader of the state's black community, calls Mr. [Joseph Lieberman]'s pick a "bold move" and a necessary one. Mr. Gore "needed a wave to ride and now he's got one," he says.  Here in Georgia, and in North Carolina as well, the presidential ticket may benefit from statewide races. Georgia has former Gov. Zell Miller running to finish the term of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell, a Republican. In North Carolina, a competitive governor's race and the candidacy of an African-American running to head the state Supreme Court may spur black turnout to the Democrats' advantage. "The statewide ticket will help the national ticket," says Gov. [James Hunt].
