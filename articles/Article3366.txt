 France's Spie Sues Over Payments; Fraud Allegation Is Linked To German Former Partner And Adviser to Nigerians   By Fleming, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2005  Spie Batignolles paid 1.5 million euros ($2 million) to Mr. [Jeffrey Tesler] in 1996 to 1998 on Bilfinger Berger's request, half of the total 3 million euros in payments made by the joint venture, Mr. [Francis Vuillemin] said. In April 1998 Spie Batignolles halted further payments to Mr. Tesler because the German company hadn't responded to requests for explanation of why Mr. Tesler was receiving the money, he added.  Spie Batignolles and Bilfinger Berger then took their dispute to the Paris-based International Court of Arbitration, which ruled against Spie Batignolles, ordering the company to contribute its share of subsequent payments to Mr. Tesler, Mr. Vuillemin said. Those further payments amounted to several hundred thousand euros, but Mr. Vuillemin gave no precise figure. He said Spie Batignolles' legal action is intended to obtain reimbursement of the money paid to Mr. Tesler.
