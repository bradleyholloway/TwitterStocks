 UPS Net Rose 22% for Period; Shares Gain 13%   By By Rick Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  The overnight-delivery surge is the latest sign that UPS is taking away market share in that business from FedEx and Airborne, which saw express-package volumes grow far slower in their most recent quarters.

UPS kept a tight lid on expenses, which helped it overcome the slightly slower volume growth. UPS also benefited from a two-month-old fuel surcharge of 1.25% on all packages, which made up for a 29% jump in fuel expenses to $224 million in the third quarter.
