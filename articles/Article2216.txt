 Yeltsin to step up tax collection, an issue in budget   By McKay, Betsy, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1996  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has vowed to crack down on tax evasion and said he has appointed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to head a new commission to enforce tax payments and apprehend tax dodgers. Meanwhile, parliament leaders say they have rejected a 1997 draft budget in part because they believe the government's tax-collection projections are too optimistic.
