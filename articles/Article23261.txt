 Getting Going: Fight Back Against Lower Returns   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2005  How much lower will returns be? Jeremy Siegel, author of "The Future for Investors" and a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, is considered a stock-market optimist. Yet even he thinks "stock returns before taxes will be about 1% a year lower."  "The widespread availability of tax-sheltered vehicles is a recent phenomenon," notes William Bernstein, author of "Four Pillars of Investing." "Fifty years ago, no one had them except for pensions and philanthropies."  After the devastating 2000-2002 crash, it would be difficult to argue that stocks are less risky. "There's not much evidence that the stock market has become more stable," Prof. Siegel says. "But people can better diversify, and that lowers the risk of their own portfolio."
