 IBM Group Seeks Public's Help In Vetting Patent Applications   By Forelle, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2006  IBM received 2,941 U.S. patents in 2005, for the 13th year more than any other company, although below its 2004 total, according to the patent office's preliminary tally to be released today. Mr. [Jim Stallings] says the Armonk, N.Y., company thinks its own patents "are all at the quality level we'd like them to be at," but he says he welcomes any improvement that comes from the open-source process. By and large, the effort is directed at patents filed by other, particularly smaller, companies. Several, known to detractors as "patent trolls" and to their supporters as the aggrieved little guys, have won large infringement verdicts against bigger companies.
