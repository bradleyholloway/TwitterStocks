 Letters to the Editor: Cancer Science vs. Archaic Bureaucracy   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2002  The real scandal is the mismatch between outmoded FDA regulations and scientific progress, especially in solid cancer. In the war against cancer we have progressed from B-52s (non-specific cytotoxics) to laser-guided missiles (specific, safer, mechanism-based cytostatics). In this transition, FDA regulations have not undergone revision. Efficacy criteria place more emphasis on tumor shrinkage (acres flattened) than a delay in progression, or reversal of disease (targets destroyed). Current guidances necessitate that agents should demonstrate efficacy when administered alone, as well as an additive effect with standard regimens in advanced metastatic cancer. However, it is well known that when cytostatics are used alone, resistance is the rule, and when added to standard cytotoxic regimens in advanced disease, the demonstration of incremental tumor shrinkage is unlikely. To force newer cytostatic anticancer drugs into an older cytotoxic evaluatory framework is an exercise in Procrustean futility, with negative outcomes to all interested groups....
