 Britain to Begin Review of BSkyB, May Ease Curbs   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2000  The Office of Fair Trading said the decision was prompted by major changes in Britain's broadcasting industry that have created a new competitive landscape, including consolidation in the cable-TV industry and the advent of digital broadcasting. The agency's review will look at whether these developments have strengthened BSkyB's competitors enough to keep BSkyB's satellite-based pay-TV network in check without regulatory intervention.  The agency had promised to conduct such a review when it forced BSkyB in 1996 to make some concessions in its broadcasting operations to meet competition concerns, including allowing cable-TV operators to carry programs distributed by BSkyB's satellites.
