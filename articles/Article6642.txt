 Sprint Rivals Exploit Its Vulnerability   By Cheng, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2007  Late Monday, Sprint said it expects to post 2006 revenue of $41 billion, below analysts' average estimate, and said that revenue this year will stay relatively flat. It also warned that its 2007 operating income, adjusted for depreciation and write-offs, would fall to $11 billion to $11.5 billion from 2006's figure, which is expected to range between $12.6 billion and $12.9 billion, depending on the company's actual fourth-quarter results.  Sprint has primarily blamed the slower growth on its strategy of improving its customer mix by tightening its credit policy. But the company has also struggled with running two networks -- Sprint's existing system that uses a standard known as code division multiple access, and Nextel's iDEN technology, which allows for a walkie-talkie feature. Sprint acquired Nextel in August 2005.
