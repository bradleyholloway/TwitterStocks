 Deals & Deal Makers -- IPO Outlook: Big Deals Like KPMG Consulting Could Help Salvage IPO Market   By By Raymond Hennessey, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2001  It is a trend that actually started last year, when the market showed signs of strain. Total proceeds raised from the U.S. IPO market stood at $75.8 billion as 2000 ended, well above the $64.3 billion raised in 1999, according to Richard Peterson, chief market strategist at Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark, N.J., and the author of the recent book "Inside IPOs."  Already, more large offerings are in the works. KPMG Consulting's 30% first-day gain will almost certainly help the chances for other large consultancies, notably Accenture, the former Andersen Consulting, which is considering an IPO. Accenture would likely have an IPO at least equal to that of its rival KPMG.  Likewise, Cingular Wireless, the wireless joint venture of SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp., is widely expected to file for its own IPO in the coming weeks. Both wireless offerings are expected to be multibillion-dollar IPOs.
