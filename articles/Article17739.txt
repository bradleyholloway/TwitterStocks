 Bond Prices Rise as Dollar Strengthens, Employment Report Shows Small Gains   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1987  If the economy remains in a rut, the Federal Reserve System is likely to nudge short-term interest rates slightly lower in an effort to spark faster growth, according to Mr. Lieberman and several other analysts. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee is scheduled to meet in Washington next Tuesday and Wednesday to review credit policy.  Some analysts wonder if the Fed already is adopting an easier credit stance. "It is conceivable that the Fed already has begun to become more accommodative," said Mr. Lieberman. He said Fed figures released yesterday afternoon showed the Fed was "quite generous" in supplying reserves to the banking system during the two weeks ended Wednesday. But he added that "it still is too early to be confident that a change in policy has occurred."  The federal funds rate, which traders watch closely for clues to changes in Fed policy, averaged 6.61% in the week ended Wednesday. That was down from 6.79% the previous week and was the lowest since the week ended April 29, when it averaged 6.5%. The rate on funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other, averaged 6.69% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc.
