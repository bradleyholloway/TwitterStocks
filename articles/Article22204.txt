 World Wire   By Compiled by Joe Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1996  The Lloyd's of London insurance market as expected declared that its #3.2 billion ($4.99 billion) settlement offer to individual investors, or Names, is unconditional. As of last week, about 91% of the Names had agreed to the offer, which is intended to end litigation over losses totaling #8 billion. Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is expected shortly to approve the start of business of Equitas, the reinsurer taking over Lloyd's unprofitable activities under the plan.  General Electric Co. PLC of Britain, bowing to shareholder pressure, modified the compensation package of incoming Managing Director George Simpson. For Mr. Simpson to earn #1 million ($1.6 million) under the new plan, GEC's stock will have to outperform the London Stock Exchange's FT-SE 100 index by 10% for three years, instead of just six months. Mr. Simpson will still receive a "golden hello" payment of #500,000 plus an annual salary of #600,000, plus bonuses. GEC isn't related to General Electric Co. of the U.S.  Net income at Telefonica de Espana, Spain's 20% state-owned telecommunications group, surged 19.5% in the first half, boosted by revenue from new services and a sharp drop in financial costs. Consolidated net climbed to 71.88 billion pesetas ($573.7 million) from 60.2 billion pesetas a year earlier, despite a 25% drop in international telephone rates in the period. The lower prices helped spur a 16% rise in long-distance calls.
