 Samsung, Hynix Post Lower Profits, Upbeat Outlooks   By Evan Ramstad and Yun-Hee Kim, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2005  Hynix, the world's second-largest maker of memory chips by revenue after Samsung, said net profit in the third quarter was 511.5 billion won ($490.2 million), down from 530 billion won a year earlier. In the second quarter, Hynix reported net profit of 238.4 billion won.  Samsung's profit was reduced by a 200 billion won provision to help pay a $300 million fine announced yesterday by the U.S. Justice Department after Samsung pleaded guilty to illegal price-fixing of memory chips from 1999 to 2002. Samsung last year set aside $100 million to cover costs related to the antitrust case. It may now face further claims from companies that were unfairly charged high prices for memory chips.  Without the penalty, Samsung would have beaten analysts' expectation for 1.97 trillion won in profit, the average of a survey of 10 analysts by Dow Jones Newswires. Even with the penalty, the performance was the company's best since the year-ago period, and executives said they expected profitability to continue climbing slowly. "The outlook of our respective businesses is even better in Q- 4," said Chu Woosik, Samsung's chief of investor relations.
