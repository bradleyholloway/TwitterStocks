A Union County jury awarded $2.8 million on Monday to a former Essex County sheriff's officer who said she had suffered sexual harassment from other officers because she is gay. Karen Caggiano, 43, of Bridgewater, testified that she had to use the same bathroom and locker room as male officers in the late 1990's, and that pictures of naked women were posted on lockers. Her lawyers said one sheriff's officer repeatedly exposed himself to her. Sheriff Armando B. Fontoura said yesterday that his office had tried to respond to her complaints and that he expected portions of the verdict would be appealed. The trial was held in Union County instead of Essex to avoid conflicts of interest.
