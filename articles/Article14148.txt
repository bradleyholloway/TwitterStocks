 Bolster Productivity With Tax Cuts   By By Jim LeMunyon, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1985  Supporters of supply-side economics have long insisted that marginal tax rates on income are of primary importance in determining the economic health of a nation. In the current tax-reform debate, this notion has gained wide currency. It makes sense, then, to examine the effects of marginal tax rates on productivity.  The experiment examined the relationship between the marginal tax rate on the median household income for the years 1961 to 1982 and non-farm business productivity in the U.S. in that period. Yearly averages were used, and tax rates include the effects of the Social Security tax. Prior to 1974 the maximum Social Security tax base was less than the median household income, and so the effect of the Social Security tax rate was averaged over the entire year. State and local taxes were not included in the analysis, because of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate national estimate. Since only a tax rate on median income is used, the effects of progressivity were not considered.  I used a linear regression with data from 1961 to 1982 to determine the relationship between tax rates and productivity. The probability that the tax rate and productivity changes are related was found to be 99.7%. In addition, 33% of the change in productivity could be accounted for by the change in the tax rate. A line indicating the best "rule of thumb" relationship between tax rates and productivity is shown on the chart nearby. {See accompanying illustration -- WSJ August 5, 1985.}
