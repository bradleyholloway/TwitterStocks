 WEEKEND JOURNAL; GIFT OF THE WEEK: Doctor Writes Rx For $105 Million   By Bernstein, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2005  Under Dr. [Jan T. Vilcek]'s arrangement with NYU, the gift has been divided into three portions. The first part consists of ongoing quarterly payments to the school from the drug's maker, Centocor, a division of Johnson & Johnson. To date, NYU has received approximately $5 million under this component of the gift. The other two portions involve the sales of rights to future royalties. Dr. Vilcek assigned these rights to two trusts, which in turn sold them to a company that buys these rights. The proceeds of the sales -- one of which netted about $20 million and the other about $46 million -- will eventually benefit NYU.  Dr. Vilcek says he made the gift to NYU because the university has long supported his work and he wants to help the school attract future scientists. "I feel that NYU gave me the opportunity to prove myself," he says. The university says it will name several programs and laboratories after Dr. Vilcek and his wife. They include the Jan T. Vilcek Professorship in the Department of Microbiology, the Jan T. and Marica F. Vilcek Laboratory Floor for Research in Microbial Pathogenesis and the Marica F. Vilcek Research Laboratories in the otolaryngology department.
