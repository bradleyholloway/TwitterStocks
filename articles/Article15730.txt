 Measures You Can Adopt Now If You're Facing Large Losses In Your Retirement Account   By By Ellen E. Schultz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  The more meaningful question is: How healthy were your funds before the market turned cold? What is their average annual return over the past one, three, five and 10 years? That is what really counts -- not what you experience quarter to quarter. After all, we have been in the biggest bull market in the history of the planet. Getting a 20% annual return was a no-brainer even for crummy money managers. It's been fun. But realistically, you can't expect to earn more than about 10% over time in stocks. That is what stocks return historically. It is what you reasonably shoot for. As long as your stock holdings appear to have delivered something above that range, you are on the right track.  Compare It to Similar Funds. While the market may account for the recent sickly performance, you still have to rule out poor management. Your funds may be chronically ill, but you won't know unless you compare the funds' return with the proper benchmarks. To do that, you have to see whether the fund is as good as other funds that invest in a similar way. Here are the types of funds that people have put most of their 401(k) money into:  Say you have Fidelity Equity-Income. You want to compare it with other equity-income funds, which are funds that invest in stocks with higher-than-average dividends. The dividends help offset losses in the stock's underlying value, which means that these types of funds are somewhat more insulated from the stock market than other stock funds. The trade-off is that the returns tend to be lower than the S&P; the upside is that the returns tend not to fall as much when the market does.
