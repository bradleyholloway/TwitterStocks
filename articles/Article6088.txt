 China's Road From Serfdom   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1998  Maybe Marx was on to something. History, he suggested, was a series of cycles, with each thesis eventually spawning its antithesis. That may explain the new translation of F.A. Hayek's "The Constitution of Liberty," a primer of classical liberalism whose Chinese translation is already in its second printing -- the first 20,000 copies having immediately sold out. . . . What makes the public debut of Hayek so extraordinary is that his stress is not simply on the inefficiencies of socialism but the inhumanity of the premises upon which it rests. Conceive if you will of a new edition of "The Communist Manifesto" finding favor in the Vatican and you have some notion of the magnitude of the implications here.  Those who suspect us of exaggerating might wish to consider China's experience this century. When in 1949 Mao declared that China had finally "stood up," it was the triumph of an idea. Over the ensuing five decades, ideas were central in China: People who held the wrong ones could be punished viciously, and when a new idea emerged victorious, as with Deng Xiaoping's 1978 opening, all China felt it. On a recent visit to Beijing, a friend referred us to a line by Mao: "Who controls a man's ideas controls the man."
