 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: Waffling on Breakfast   By Kalis, Lisa, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2005  The key to a good waffle iron is temperature control. Can the plates get hot enough (but not too hot), and can they cook the batter evenly enough? The Cuisinart model, for $40 at Tabletools.com, was our smallest, and was a nonrotating model. The waffles made from Mr. [Peter Davis]'s malted waffle batter turned out nicely browned and tasty, though they were a little doughy in the middle. The Krups Flip Waffle Maker, for $80 from Chef's Catalog, was a rotating model, but made waffles that were browner on one side than the other. (A green light on top of the iron goes on when they're done, but it's hard to see, since the iron faces down during cooking.) The $80 Waring Pro maker, a rotating model from Kitchen Collection, did a great job of browning, and our chef liked the final product, but with a long, skinny turning rod, he also thought it didn't seem quite as sturdy as our others.
