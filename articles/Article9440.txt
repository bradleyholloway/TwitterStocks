 NYSE Female Governor Files Bias Suit Against ING Barings   By By Colleen DeBaise, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2002  In the suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, Ms. [Karen Hackett] contends one trader on ING's trading desk made vulgar remarks and forcibly tried to kiss her on more than one occasion. Ms. Hackett also claims that she was paid less and stripped of her managerial duties because of her gender.  ING Barings was a unit of Dutch financial-services giant ING Group NV until substantially all of the operations were sold to ABN Amro Holding NV in May 2001. An ING spokeswoman and an ABN Amro spokesman couldn't be reached to comment on Ms. Hackett's suit.
