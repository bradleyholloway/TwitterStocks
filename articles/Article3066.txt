 Major Chinese Firms Carry Debt Loads On a Par With Currency-Crisis Victims   By By Erik Guyot, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1998  Among the companies are shipping giant Cosco (Hong Kong) Group Ltd., Shanghai Industrial Investment (Holdings) Co. and Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd. All three are parents of some of the biggest and most popular "red chips," or Hong Kong-listed companies controlled by mainland firms.  The steep debt levels at these government-owned corporations have recently come to light from bond-offering documents that were issued only to institutional investors. The documents disclose that the three parent firms have debt-to-equity ratios well above 200% -- a level that is higher than that of many companies in South Korea and Thailand near the crest of the economic crisis in those countries. In addition, these Chinese companies have heavy short-term borrowings, which they often used to finance investments in property and stocks. Now, they are trying to refinance this short-term debt.  Shanghai Industrial, the sole investment arm of China's largest city, has taken on short-term loans to transform itself from a cigarette maker into a conglomerate with a stake in a highway in Shanghai, among other holdings. Shanghai Industrial's listed red-chip unit in Hong Kong, Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd., is the 20th-largest-capitalization stock trading there. The parent's short-term debt has jumped eightfold in the past three years to US$752 million earlier this year. Shanghai Industrial had a net debt-to-equity ratio of 380% earlier this year.
