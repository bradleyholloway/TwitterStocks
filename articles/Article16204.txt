 Tax Report: IRS Phone Centers Are Wrong, Incomplete With Many Answers   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2002  The report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which oversees the IRS, finds the IRS gets it completely right only 78% of the time. As bad as that may seem, it is four percentage points higher than the 74% grade the IRS gave itself for all of last year's tax-filing season. The report is based on monitoring 736 taxpayer calls to the IRS from mid-January through mid-March.  If you get bum advice from the IRS, you might assume you wouldn't get in trouble for following it. No such luck. The IRS isn't bound by its own phone advice. However, the IRS will waive penalties if you can show you acted "reasonably and in good faith, or relied on the incorrect advice of an IRS employee." That is why tax advisers recommend callers jot down the name and badge number of the IRS helper -- and take careful notes.  IRS officials have been aware of the accuracy problem -- and vowed to improve the quality of their help -- for decades. For the record, the IRS says its own tests show significant improvement: Its own "tax-law quality rate" improved to more than 81% this year from 74% last year, says John Dalrymple, IRS commissioner of the wage and investment division. He calls that a "noteworthy accomplishment" and adds: "While we are pleased with our progress, we will continue our efforts to improve the accuracy and quality of toll-free telephone customer service."
