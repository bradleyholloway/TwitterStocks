 Creditors Approve UAL Plan to Exit From Bankruptcy   By Carey, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2006  Several hurdles remain before United, the nation's No. 2 airline by traffic, after AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, can step out of Chapter 11. Its unions and the committee representing unsecured creditors object to a management equity-incentive plan that would award 11% of the new stock in the reorganized UAL to 400 top management employees, down from the initial 15% award envisioned. The creditors committee also objects to the size of the unsecured claim lodged by the government Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which took over the airline's four underfunded pension plans, and to United's plan to give $56 million in convertible notes to its salaried and management employees to compensate them for pay and benefit cuts.
