 World News: World Watch   By Anonymous, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2011  Between 1.2 million and 4.5 million firearms are estimated to be in circulation in Switzerland, putting the Alpine country behind only the U.S. and Yemen in guns per capita, according to a survey by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. Because guns weren't registered until 1999, the exact number of firearms in circulation is disputed, but about one in four Swiss households is estimated to own a gun.
