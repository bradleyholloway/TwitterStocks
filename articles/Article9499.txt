 Probe at Syncor Puts Sale in Peril --- Cardinal Health Uncovered Possibly Illegal Payments By Officials of Target Firm   By By Thomas M. Burton, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2002  Syncor Chief Executive Robert Funari said the payments took place without his knowledge. "I don't think there are adequate words to describe the anger, the betrayal I feel," he said. Syncor supplies chemicals used in diagnostic imaging to public hospitals in China, and to public and private hospitals in Taiwan.  The payments were turned up in recent days as staffers from Cardinal Health, of Dublin, Ohio, sought to do due diligence on the planned acquisition of Syncor. Cardinal, a leading wholesaler of prescription drugs with more than $44 billion in 2001 sales, has a track record of extensive successful acquisitions and consistent earnings growth. Cardinal said that once it confirmed the details it reported the matter the same day to the Syncor board.  In June, Cardinal announced the planned purchase of Syncor for what now is valued at about $980 million in Cardinal stock, plus the assumption of nearly $200 million in Syncor debt, bringing the value of the deal to nearly $1.18 billion.
