 Oman Is Seen As a Key Ally In U.S. Effort --- With the Saudis Wary, Sultanate May Emerge As Vital Staging Area   By By Yaroslav Trofimov, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  Though Oman is nearer Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia houses a state-of-the-art U.S. command-and-control center near Riyadh that Washington wants to use for the Afghan campaign.

The agreement forbids offensive missions, but the Saudis have been known to look the other way when the U.S. launches such flights from Saudi territory.
