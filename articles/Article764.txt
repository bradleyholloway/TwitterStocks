 Laidlaw Launches $225.2 Million Offer For Mayflower Group   The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1986  Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. began a tender offer of $29.25 a share, or $225.2 million, for Carmel, Ind.-based Mayflower Group Inc.  Laidlaw, a school bus operator and waste-management concern based in Burlington, Ontario, said last week that it had planned to offer $28 a share, or $215.6 million, for the home products distributor and school bus and trucking concern.  Laidlaw said it made the higher-than-intended bid for all of Mayflower's 7.7 million shares outstanding "because of the price levels of trading in shares of Mayflower" since Laidlaw announced its plan to offer $28 a share.
