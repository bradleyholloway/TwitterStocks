 German Bank Sets Sights on Oppenheimer --- Takeover Would Help Meet Demands for More Services   By By Greg Steinmetz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1995  Three months after taking the reins as chief executive officer, the admittedly impatient Mr. Schmidt opened 60 branches in the former East Germany. A month later, he led one of the largest takeovers in the bank's history with the acquisition of Hamburg's Vereinsund Westbank. Since then, Mr. Schmidt has plunged the bank into Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Poland.  Now Mr. Schmidt, 57 years old, has his eyes set on Oppenheimer & Co., a midsize U.S. brokerage firm. If his record holds up, the proposed $400 million to $500 million takeover will be a winner. Mr. Schmidt's expansionist ambitions, which have boosted the bank's assets to 338 billion marks ($238.63 billion) from 205 billion marks in five years, have so far been achieved without any slippage in loan quality or in profits.  In an interview, Bayerische Vereinsbank corporate-finance chief Dieter Rampl said he wants Oppenheimer for the same reason rival Deutsche Bank AG bought Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner Bank AG bought Kleinwort Benson. The domestic banking business in Germany isn't as profitable as it used to be, and German corporate customers are demanding that their banks offer more investment-banking services.
