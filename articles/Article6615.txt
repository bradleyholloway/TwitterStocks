 Teacher Quality, Not a Year-End Bonus, Produces Quality Students   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2006  Despite Terry Moe's enthusiastic endorsement ("Management 101 for Our Public Schools," editorial page, Oct. 31), there is nothing "revolutionary" about an idea that has been around since the 19th century. England tried it, Canada tried it and several U.S. school districts have tried it -- linking teacher pay to test scores has never worked.  The "Management 101" philosophy advanced by Mr. Moe is grounded in assumptions about pay that are misleading and incorrect. Southwest Airlines has never used individual incentives, and it is the cost and productivity leader in its industry. After surveying companies that experimented with different ways to tie pay to individual performance, consulting firm William M. Mercer concluded that "most individual merit or performance-based pay plans share two attributes: They absorb vast amounts of time and resources, and they make everybody unhappy."  Teachers' unions are not the cause of eroding standards; those are the result of a design flaw that asks government to both provide and produce the product in question. This government factory approach short-circuits the necessary connection between the "producer" and the "consumer." The consumer (i.e. the parent) has no natural recourse when confronted with an unsatisfactory product, in this case: poor quality education.
