 Loose Audit Rules Keep Debt Defaults Off Books for Now   By By Jonathan Weil and Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2003  For example, some CDOs, which commonly have a 12-year maturity period, are classified as long-term investments held to maturity, depending on a company's declared intentions of how long it plans to own the CDO. In that case, prevailing U.S. accounting rules may let the CDO's value sit untouched on a company's balance sheet for years without being written down. That is because the CDO doesn't have to be written down unless it has permanently declined in value.  How much room for disagreement abounds? Consider MBIA Inc.'s book of business guaranteeing CDO tranches totaling a net of about $66 billion. The financial-services concern last year became the target of New York hedge fund Gotham Partners Management Co., which had bearish bets on MBIA's stock and credit. To date, MBIA has reported $36 million in losses related to its CDO guarantees. (Gotham now is winding down its principal funds.) But based on information provided by MBIA about the guaranteed CDO slices as of Aug. 30, Gotham sought estimates from two dealers on the mark-to-market losses the MBIA-guaranteed CDOs faced. One dealer estimated the losses at $5.3 billion, another said $7.7 billion, according to a report published by Gotham.
