 Call Centers Fill Wage Gap In Pensacola   By By Darv Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  Other cities in Florida are starting to snub call centers because of their relatively low wages, high stress and tendency to pack up and leave after losing a big client. Pensacola, on the other hand, accommodates the centers. Depending on the size of the operation, the city might offer a new center a break on local taxes and discounted office space in addition to incentives the state provides.  Meanwhile, Pensacola is happy with its track record of attracting -- and keeping -- call centers. The chamber's Mr. [Cliff Krut] says, "We haven't lost a call center yet."  Tucked into the western Panhandle, Pensacola generally relies on tourists and the nearly 24,000 military personnel stationed at Eglin Air Force Base, the Pensacola Naval Air Station and three other nearby naval bases to drive its economy. Garment factories, timber companies and cattle farms located in the rural areas north of Interstate 10 account for the rest.
