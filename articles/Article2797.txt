 Election 2000: U.S. High-Court Decision May Yet Bring More Turns --- One Possibility: More Votes Registered by Minorities Under New Standards   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  Of course, not everyone agrees with this assessment. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that the high court's decision isn't a sharp departure from its past actions. During the past 20 years, he said, the justices have handed down a number of rulings that look beyond the most egregious violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The latest ruling is based on the justices' belief that the Florida Supreme Court's actions in ordering a recount "was irrational, arbitrary and made no sense," Prof. Volokh said.  Even two of the court's moderate members, Justices Stephen Breyer and David Souter, concurred with their five conservative brethren that recounting rules in Florida raised Equal Protection problems. But they disagreed sharply with the remedy of ending the vote recount. The court's conservative bloc consists of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy.  Mark Levy, a Washington lawyer and Supreme Court practitioner with Howrey Simon Arnold & White, saw the decision as a relatively narrow one that won't become a significant precedent. He said the Supreme Court, which in most instances is solicitous of states' rights, won't be inclined to get involved in most election disputes. "This is a one-time ticket good for one ride only," Mr. Levy said.
