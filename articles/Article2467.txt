 Drug Giants Agree to Settle Pricing Suit   By By Thomas M. Burton and Elyse Tanouye, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1998  Four major pharmaceutical companies have tentatively agreed to pay about $350 million to settle class-action price-fixing litigation brought against the drug industry by thousands of independent U.S. pharmacies and drugstore chains.  Abbott and Rhone-Poulenc declined to comment, while a representative of Pharmacia & Upjohn generally confirmed that a deal had been reached. Hoechst officials couldn't be reached to comment. The terms of the agreement would need to be confirmed by U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras in Chicago, who is supervising the sprawling litigation.  The settlement would cover numerous lawsuits filed beginning in 1993 and consolidated into one action. The suits generally allege that a dual system of drug pricing had improperly arisen in the U.S. during the first half of the 1990s, with a discounted pricing system that pharmaceutical companies offered to big managed-care companies and health maintenance organizations, while a range of higher prices were offered to drugstores and big pharmacy chains.
