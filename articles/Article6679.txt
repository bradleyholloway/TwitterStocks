 Suspected Case Of SARS in U.S. Tied to Workplace   By By Rick Brooks and Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 2003  Of the 2,781 world-wide cases and 111 deaths from SARS reported by the World Health Organization, the CDC said there were 166 suspected cases in the U.S. There have been no deaths in the U.S. Canada now has 254 cases, including 206 in Ontario, and 10 deaths. Canadian officials said they are pleased that the rate of increase has slowed in recent days.  In Florida, the 47-year-old woman developed symptoms of SARS after four hours at work March 31, when she came into contact with a 60-year-old woman who came down with a suspected case of the virus after returning from a trip to mainland China. No one else at the office, with fewer than 20 workers, has shown any SARS symptoms, said Thomas Belcuore, public health department administrator for the Alachua County Health Department in Gainesville, Fla.
