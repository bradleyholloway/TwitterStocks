 Bonneville reduces power to California in wake of outage   By Holden, Benjamin A, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1996  The Bonneville Power Administration will cut by 25% the power it supplies to California in an attempt to avoid future power outages. The move comes in response to an outage on Aug 10, 1996 that blacked out four million customers in nine states and parts of Mexico. All three big California investor-owned utilities said they were able to easily make up for the cutback.
