 Gorbachev Under Siege in Moscow Shift --- Tensions Keep Escalating; Soviet Troops Storm Latvian Site, Killing 5   By By Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1991  But with tensions escalating further in the Baltic republics a week after tanks and paratroops attacked Lithuanian television, the political battle has largely shifted to Moscow, and this time it is President Mikhail Gorbachev who is under siege.  As many as 100,000 people marched onto a square by the Kremlin on Sunday to listen to a message from Boris Yeltsin, the popular president of Russia, warning that "dictatorship has become a reality." Many protesters waved banners depicting Mr. Gorbachev as a ruthless tyrant and calling for his resignation. A similar large rally was held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, where Soviet tanks crushed an anti-Soviet insurrection one year ago.  The huge demonstration in Moscow followed a few hectic days in which leading democrats rallied around Mr. Yeltsin in a decisive challenge to Mr. Gorbachev and his new hard-line allies in the Kremlin.
