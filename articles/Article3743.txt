 Tyco Lawyer Says Swartz Had Him Sign House Deed   By Debaise, Colleen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2003  Prosecutors have sought to show that Tyco's former top executives improperly used company money for such luxury items. Mr. [Swartz] and L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, went to trial Sept. 29 on charges they looted the company of $600 million.  During testimony, the Tyco lawyer, Byron Kalogerou, said he was asked by Mr. Swartz to put his name on the deed because the property's bylaws banned corporate ownership. Mr. Kalogerou, who was working for Tyco in Luxembourg at the time, said he agreed and signed a contract stating he wouldn't actually live in the home.
