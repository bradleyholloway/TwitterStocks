 After Gobbling Up Iams, P&G Finds People Who Have Bones to Pick --- Gains in Sales, Mass-Market Share Are Clouded by Charges That Quality Was Lowered   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2000  Durk I. Jager, who stepped aside as CEO last week, engineered P&G's $2.05 billion purchase of Iams, a line of gourmet dog and cat food, last September. It was the consumer-products company's largest acquisition ever. Mr. Jager figured P&G could get badly needed sales growth by ramping up Iams, a niche brand that hadn't been broadly advertised and was sold only in specialty stores. All P&G had to do was get Iams into grocery stores and mass chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., where it already sells Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Bounty paper towels, and apply a little Procter Marketing 101.  Iams, which had about $800 million in sales before P&G bought it, has the potential to be a key contributor to P&G's overall $38.13 billion in annual sales. Already, P&G says Iams is expected to post $1 billion in sales for the year ending June 30. That's impressive growth but it remains to be seen whether P&G can sustain it -- an important factor since some considered the price tag for Iams quite high.  The lightning speed has also singed the Iams brand, showing that speed has its downside. Sales of Iams in specialty stores have fallen 15% to 20%, P&G says. That indicates that some of P&G's gain in mass-market outlets is simply old customers shopping at a more convenient location. It's also because some specialty shops and veterinarians' offices, angered by the loss of exclusivity, have quit promoting the brand. On top of that, despite vehement denials from the company, rumors are circulating among vets, competitors, retailers and pet owners that P&G cheapened the quality of Iams products in order to ratchet up production by so much so fast.
