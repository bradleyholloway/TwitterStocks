 Argentina Confident Despite Ills In Brazil   By By Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1998  This year's rout in the local stock market aside, an eerie calm prevails in Argentina as its giant neighbor, Brazil, wrestles with a worsening threat of devaluation.  Developed by former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo in 1991, the convertibility plan essentially acknowledged the obvious. A vicious cycle of devaluation and hyperinflation had completely discredited Argentina's money. So Mr. Cavallo simply said Argentina has no other currency but dollars. In effect, pesos are merely dollar substitutes used for commercial and nationalistic purposes; Argentines can use dollars to pay for taxi rides, meals, candy bars or just about anything because pesos and dollars are completely interchangeable at a one-to-one rate. The central bank must back every peso in circulation today with a dollar of reserves.  Data as recent as Sept. 2 show that Argentina's overall level of bank deposits is stable, a sign that capital flight hasn't plagued Argentina. Skittishness over the Argentine peso is also negligible with total dollar deposits rising in the most recent period by less than $1 billion, though further increases may be seen in coming days. "The financial system has behaved better" with each test, Pablo Guidotti, Argentina's vice minister of economy, said Friday in an interview with Wall Street Journal editors. "We do not expect, even under tough circumstances...a problem of liquidity in the banking system."
