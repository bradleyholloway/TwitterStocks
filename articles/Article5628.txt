 EDS Chairman Compensation To Lower Profit   By By Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  The company said the cost of the compensation to Mr. (Lester M.) Alberthal, who decided to retire last week, will reduce its third-quarter profit by five cents a diluted share. Even before that cost, analysts were expecting EDS's profit to fall to around 36 cents a diluted share from 50 cents a year ago.  A spokeswoman said full details of Mr. Alberthal's compensation will be released with the company's quarterly results in October. According to the computer-services firm, Mr. Alberthal, who is 54 years old, retired to pursue personal interests but will stay until a successor is found.
