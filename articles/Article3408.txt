 Forex View: Dollar May Fall Further On Trade-Gap Jitters; International Capital Flows And Current-Account Data Likely Will Add to Woes   By Norman, Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2005  Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial Group in New York, said the dollar "should get a double dose of concern" amid the twin releases of data on the current account and January's Treasury capital flows. In a research note, he said there is a "very high chance" that net capital inflows will fall short of the $58 billion January trade gap. The Treasury's capital-flow report is watched closely to see whether foreigners are likely to continue funding the current-account gap. Mr. Laidi predicted the data would push the dollar down through support at 103.67 yen. He set the euro's short- term target at $1.3550.  He reckons the dollar's fall could be heavy in coming days. Investors built up considerable dollar long holdings amid the early- 2005 dollar rally, according to the bank's data. These positions now are being flushed out as the dollar's decline triggers automatic sell orders, which could turn its losses into a tailspin against the euro and the Swiss franc in particular. As a result, he said, "the catalysts are there" for the euro to reach its record high. Mr. [Brian Garvey] also said that with positions in the dollar against the yen neutral, there is potential for "moderate upside" for the yen this week.
