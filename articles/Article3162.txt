 Peace Talks Breathe New Life Into Gaza Gas Project; U.K. to Ask Israel's Sharon To Reconsider Development Of Big Palestinian Resource   By Chazan, Guy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2003  "We're worried the royalties could go toward financing terror," says Israeli Infrastructure Minister Yosef Paritzky, who advocates a deal but understands Mr. [Ariel Sharon]'s security concerns. "We have to find a mechanism that ensures . . . that money received over there won't be allocated to any terrorist organizations."  BG says it would invest $400 million in the initiative, which would pump gas from Gaza Marine and nearby fields the company has licenses for -- both in Palestinian and Israeli territorial waters -- to a processing facility that it would build at the Israeli port of Ashkelon. State-owned Israel Electric Corp. has expressed interest in buying an annual 52.5 billion cubic feet of the gas over the next 15 years. But BG is waiting for a letter of intent from the IEC, which says it's waiting for Mr. Sharon's go-ahead.  In an unstable region, Israelis are reluctant to become dependent on Palestinian energy imports. "I hope that the PA will be moderate and pro-peace," says Mr. Paritzky. "But God forbid if fundamentalist groups take power. Will they use the supply of gas as a weapon against us?" Whatever happens, he says, BG will have to guarantee regular supplies, "and if they don't, it'll be very difficult to have a deal."
