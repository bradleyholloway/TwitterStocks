 Enterprise: Store's Sales Can Rest on a Moment; At Wine Shop, So Much Depends on Capturing The Big Year-End Rush   By Bounds, Gwendolyn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2006  From December 15th through the turn of the year, his shop typically does 15% to 18% of its total sales volume for the year. On New Year's Eve alone, sparkling wine and champagne can account for as much as half of that day's sales, compared with 10% to 12% the rest of the year. To help handle the crush, his delivery trucks will work double shifts. This year, 59-year-old Mr. Weiser's own son, an attorney, plays temporary sales clerk for the final countdown, helping regular staffers ring up purchases as he takes orders from his dad. "He's paying me back for law school," Mr. [Bernie Weiser] quips.  On this particular day, one red-nosed woman approaches the merchant and tells him she's sick. "I have a bottle of 1997 Cristal champagne already chilled but don't want to drink it," she laments, sniffling. "Will the quality suffer if I take it out of the refrigerator and drink it later?" (He tells her she shouldn't have put it in the refrigerator to begin with -- "that's too cold; keep it at 55 degrees to drink and store" -- and encourages her to uncork and be merry.)  Others queries are more irksome, such as: "Will my boss like this?" or "Is this good?" Mr. Weiser says he's contemplating erecting a bulletin board in his store dictating: "Questions customers are allowed to ask; Questions customers are not allowed to ask; and Questions that are impossible to answer." He's only half-joking.
