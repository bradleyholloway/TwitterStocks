 Nasdaq Index Drops 1.5% Amid Technology Worries   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1997  "You had bad news from three highly visible stocks, some of which raised questions about what is going on at other companies," said Ciaran O'Kelly, technology-stock trader at Salomon Smith Barney. For instance, shares of chip-maker Altera Corp., a small stock that is a bellwether for bigger companies in some traders' eyes, plunged 21% after officials told an analyst it saw cutbacks in orders in November. Mr. O'Kelly, for one, fears that this may reflect weaker orders for products by customers such as computer-networking company Cisco Systems. Cisco's shares also slid, falling 3 15/16 to 86 1/2. Western Digital and Cabletron Systems saw their stocks plunge after warning of disappointing earnings, and, in Cabletron's case, of shrinking margins. Western, Cabletron and Altera all were hit by analysts' downgrades.
