 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Healthy Businesses   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1994  The Business Roundtable's overwhelming vote against supporting the Clinton health care proposal deserves some attention, for what it says about this issue and more generally about business's dealings with Washington.  Up to now, there's often been a demarcation line between big and small business on issues like this one. The National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business lobby, has come to be viewed as the main opponent of government expansions, while the Business Roundtable historically has been suspected of an instinct to cut a deal, absorb the costs and let their smaller competition figure out how to survive the added burdens.  The Clinton Administration seems to have been surprised to discover that the Roundtable's normally round heels are suddenly dug in. We know the Clintonites dislike the 1980s, but maybe they should have been paying closer attention to what was going on then in corporate America. Better yet, rather than giving off the impression that they're too smart to talk to businessmen (we're thinking of the eyes-only White House health care task force), they might have spent some time with the CEOs now running these companies. The key, though, would have been to talk to them about business, not the blue sky of public policy.
