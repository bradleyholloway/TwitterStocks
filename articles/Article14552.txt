 National Business In Tentative Accords On Recapitalization   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1988  National Business said the recapitalization plan is conditional on settlement of the lawsuit. It said plaintiffs have tentatively agreed to drop the suit in return for $500,000 (U.S.) and warrants to buy 2.8 million National Business shares at C$1.00 (84 U.S. cents) to C$1.25 each.  Under the recapitalization plan, which must also be approved by shareholders and regulators, five insurance companies agreed in principal to convert 20 million Canadian dollars (US$16.8 million) of their US$80 million of National Business notes into convertible subordinated debentures. The company said that after the settlement of the lawsuit these would be convertible into National Business common shares, at the same price as the warrants.
