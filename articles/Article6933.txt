 Book Excerpt: And Some Other Financing Ideas . . .   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2005  Students enrolled in such programs, who usually must have a C average or better, can leave school during the day to attend classes at local colleges. In Minnesota's Post Secondary Enrollment Options program, for instance, the school district pays for tuition and course materials, so it's essentially free college credits to the student, says Alice Seagren, Minnesota's education commissioner.  If students eventually attend college in the same system they attended post-secondary classes in, the credits earned during high school are applied automatically toward their college degree. Otherwise, other schools they apply to can determine if the credits will transfer and how much they're worth.  Each state's requirements vary and some don't pay the entire bill. Some high schools also have programs where students can take college- level courses at school to earn credits.
