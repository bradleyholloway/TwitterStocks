 Leading the News: Pentagon Seeks $2.3 Billion Payback --- Boeing, General Dynamics Receive Demand in Dispute On Canceled Fighter Jets   By By Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  The Pentagon warned that if the money wasn't paid by Sept. 30 the matter would be turned over to the department's collection agency, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and that payments would be withheld from the companies on other military contracts. The demand, which amounts to a payment of about $1.15 billion for each defense contractor, was made in a letter written to the companies by Navy Comptroller Dionel Aviles.  Military analysts said the move was unprecedented given that both General Dynamics and Boeing have longstanding ties to the Navy and are among its largest contractors. "Treating your top suppliers like they're delinquent credit-card holders is not the right way to sustain an industrial base," said Loren Thompson, head of the Lexington Institute, a Washington think tank.  Settlement talks between the parties began after the Court of Federal Claims in Washington ruled in August 2001 that the government had been within its rights to cancel the fighter-jet program. During recent months, the companies had offered discounts on fighter jets, ships and missiles over a 10-year period in a package they said was worth about $2.5 billion. Senior Navy officials had supported the settlement package, but top officials at the departments of Justice and Defense rejected the notion, pushing instead for a larger cash component, people familiar with that process said. Those talks were still continuing when Mr. Aviles's two-page letter was sent Friday.
