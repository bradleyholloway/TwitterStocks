 SmithKline Is a Leading Bidder for Block   By By Nikhil Deogun and Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2000  P&G's Crest has lost out in recent years to Colgate as P&G, which invented modern toothpaste, has missed trends such as whitening products. P&G's new chief executive officer, A.G. Lafley, has vowed to restore Crest, and as an example, points to its recent launch of Crest Whitening Strips -- thin, clear strips that stick to the teeth and whiten teeth.  [Block]'s Sensodyne toothpaste is facing increasing competition as Colgate-Palmolive Co., the market leader in toothpaste, is coming out with toothpaste for sensitive teeth. This is a lucrative niche because with the aging of the baby boomers, more people need toothpaste for sensitive teeth. But most consumers grow up using Colgate or Procter & Gamble Co.'s Crest toothpaste, and they are inclined to stick with those brands as they age. If they haven't done so in the past, it's because those brands didn't offer toothpaste for sensitive teeth, says William Steele, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.
