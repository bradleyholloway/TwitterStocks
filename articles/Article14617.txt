 General Nutrition Accepts an Offer By Thomas H. Lee   By By Gregory Stricharchuk, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1989  General Nutrition Inc. said its board approved an offer for the health-products retailer to be acquired for an indicated $361.1 million by Thomas H. Lee Co., a closely held Boston investment firm.  General Nutrition, which had been on the block since March, said a tender offer of $11.50 a share will commence about next Monday for 28,668,016 common shares, or 91.3% of the company's shares outstanding. The company has 31.4 million common shares outstanding.  Last week General Nutrition said it had received nonbinding acquisition proposals from parties that weren't identified. "It'd be interesting if somebody else steps up to the plate (to make a competing bid)," said Mr. Kanters. But he said he believed the stock "was fairly well valued at the present time."
