 Moving the Market: Morningstar Suspects Crocker of Short-Term Trades   By Tom Lauricella and Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2004  Morningstar's analysts called the company's handling of the matter "very disconcerting," saying "Evergreen funds' shareholders deserve to know which fund personnel were involved and how the matter is being dealt with. The information provided thus far falls well shy of that basic standard," they wrote in a report published Wednesday evening. "Evergreen's efforts to communicate these matters to its shareholders . . . has been nothing short of abysmal."  Mr. Crocker joined Wachovia's mutual-fund team in February 1997, when Wachovia, then called First Union Corp., was expanding its stable of funds. By 2000, Mr. Crocker was the portfolio manager of $1 billion in high-yield bonds and winning kudos for his savvy investment strategies. SmartMoney magazine (a joint publishing venture of Hearst Communications Inc. and Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal), in August of 2001 said Mr. Crocker's advice to investors was: "If a CFO won't give a straight answer . . . 'Don't accept it.' "
