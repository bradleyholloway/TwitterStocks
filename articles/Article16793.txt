 Love & Money: Promises We Make to Kids -- and Can't Keep   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  I know I'm not the only parent who has made this blunder. We all make promises that we have no intention of keeping. Sometimes we discover after the fact that our promise costs more than expected, and we unilaterally declare it invalid. But mainly we make promises because we assume we'll never have to fulfill them. "I'll give you a million dollars if you can make that 50-foot shot with your eyes closed." "You can stay out as late as you want every night if you get a perfect score on your SATs."  How, though, to tell a 10-year-old that it was all a mistake? I don't accept that "tough luck" or "so sorry" is appropriate, because just as I put my faith in my stepfather's word, my son put his faith in mine. And the last thing I want to do is destroy that bond or to send my son the message that his dad's promises mean little.  "I know that now, and I'm sorry I made a promise I couldn't keep. It was just something that slipped out when I thought we were having fun. I thought that if I couldn't find the iPod, then you probably weren't going to find it either, so I didn't think there was much harm in making a deal with you. Now, though, I've made Mom mad by making a promise, and I made you mad by not keeping a promise."
