 The Colombia Trade Stakes   By Rice, Condoleezza, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2008  It is not every day that our government, with one bold stroke, could strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. workers; support a democratic ally on the cusp of achieving lasting national success; weaken those who would sow instability and autocracy in our hemisphere; and send an unequivocal signal to the entire world that the United States is a confident, capable global leader that acts not only in its own interest, but in the interest of its friends. With our sustained bipartisan support, begun by President Clinton and Congress in the 1990s and expanded by President Bush and Congress since 2001, Colombia's democratic government and its people have reclaimed their country from the FARC -- a narco-terrorist group that, disturbing new information suggests, has been receiving assistance from beyond Colombia's borders.
