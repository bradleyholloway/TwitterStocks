 South Korea Eases Overseas-Investment Rules   By Jin-Young, Yook, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2007  Yesterday's announcement by the Ministry of Finance and Economy is the latest after years of trying to liberalize the domestic foreign- exchange market. Last year, the ministry said it would completely liberalize the market -- allowing individuals and businesses to freely invest in overseas assets -- by the end of 2009, two years ahead of its target.  The government also intends to encourage real-estate investments abroad. "This measure will likely help divert Koreans' interest in the local property market," said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung Futures.  Analysts said they expect the measures will slow the won's appreciation but still forecast that by year end, the South Korean currency will strengthen against its U.S. counterpart, which is expected to weaken globally. The dollar finished yesterday in the local market at 938.5 won, weaker than 940 won Friday.
