 The Internet Under Siege: Stalking the Hackers --- FBI Launches a Vast Manhunt, But the Trail Is Byzantine And the Suspects Legion   By By David P. Hamilton and David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2000  The Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday geared up to mount a world-wide hunt for the perpetrators of a wave of attacks against major Web sites, as the targeted companies assembled their own teams of sleuths to try to find the raiders.  At a news conference in Washington, an FBI official said four field offices had opened investigations into the hacker incidents. "We're running every lead down," said Ron Dick, chief of computer investigations at the National Infrastructure Protection Center, an FBI office that monitors cyberthreats and hacker investigations.  The FBI is working on reconstructing the attacks by examining the records of the target companies and their partners on the Web. Such a broad analysis of Internet traffic can help narrow the search to particular geographic regions or groups of related servers. The FBI is collecting logs from Internet service providers that can show where transmissions originated.
