 Jones Apparel Taps Boneparth For CEO Post   By By Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2002  Mr. [Peter Boneparth], president of the moderate-priced McNaughton Apparel division, will succeed Sidney Kimmel, 74. Mr. Kimmel founded Jones in 1970 and built it into a $4 billion company with department-store labels such as Jones New York and Ralph Lauren. More recently, he added Nine West footwear and McNaughton Apparel. While some on Wall Street were aware that Mr. Kimmel had been contemplating a succession strategy since last fall, most were surprised that his decision was accompanied by the resignation of Jackwyn Nemerov, a long-respected merchant who served as president and chief operating officer.
