 High Home Values Boost Net Worth Of U.S. Households   By Rafael Gerena-Morales and James R. Hagerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2006  U.S. households' total net worth rose 2.3% to $52.11 trillion as consumers took on slightly less debt in the period, the Federal Reserve reported in its quarterly "flow of funds" data. Net worth measures household assets minus liabilities.  The latest data marked the 13th-consecutive quarter of growth in household net worth. For 2005 as a whole, household net worth grew about 8%. But the wealth gains aren't evenly distributed, and lower- income people tend to have much higher debt loads, making them more vulnerable to a weaker housing market, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. "We have a bifurcated consumer," she said.
