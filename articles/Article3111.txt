 Review / TV: Starring at the White House   By By Dorothy Rabinowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2003  With scenes like this running through it, "The White House: In Tune With History" (Monday, 10-11 p.m. EST on PBS, check local listings) is exceptionally potent fare as holiday celebrations go, that leaden title notwithstanding. With one vignette after another it captures the flavor of a time in a song, or in a picture of one president or another on the dance floor or playing the piano -- Truman and Nixon did both. To show an interviewer how well tuned the White House piano was, Truman sat down with his customary dispatch to play a little Mozart. It remained for Richard Nixon, though, to deliver what may have been the high point of presidential musical performances, when he sat down to play "Happy Birthday" to Duke Ellington. The gesture, carried off by an unusually relaxed and happy looking Nixon, came in the midst of a remarkably festive and moving event: the occasion of Ellington's receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a night that saw every jazz great in the nation take the stage to play.
