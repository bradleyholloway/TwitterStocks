 American Cuts Select Business Fares --- Move to Increase Revenue By Boosting Air Travelers Is Followed by Northwest   By By Melanie Trottman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2002  Northwest, after learning of the discounts, retaliated Friday night by cutting its own business fares 5% to 10% on routes where it overlaps with American. But Northwest, based in St. Paul, Minn., made its reductions through the computer reservations system.  American, in response, loaded its discounted fares into systems Saturday, making them broadly available. The airline said yesterday that Northwest initiated the pricing moves.  The published, walk-up round-trip fare between New York and Omaha, Neb., is now $906 on Northwest, compared with $936 on American. Delta Air Lines' and Continental Airlines' fares are $1,443 and $2,244, respectively.
