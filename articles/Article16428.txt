 FDA Revisits Issue of Antidepressants for Youths; New Analysis May Pressure Agency to Set Limit on Use Because of Suicide Risk   By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2004  What makes the issue so controversial is how the FDA has dealt with an internal debate on the matter. Congressional investigators have been examining the agency's decision to block a staffer from revealing this past February his finding of a tie between antidepressants and suicidal tendencies in young people, which drew on many of the same trials. FDA officials said his conclusion was premature, and based on ambiguous data. The new FDA analysis relies on an in-depth review of the data by outside researchers.  The new analysis by an FDA medical reviewer tabulates the results of an outside re-examination, requested by the agency, of the clinical- trial data. The document, dated July 19, focuses on an array of antidepressant drugs including Pfizer Inc.'s Zoloft, Forest Laboratories Inc.'s Celexa, Wyeth's Effexor, GlaxoSmithKline PLC's Wellbutrin and Paxil, and Prozac, made by Eli Lilly & Co. and available generically.  The FDA has said it felt Dr. Mosholder's findings were premature and based on ambiguous data. Last February, at the advisory-committee meeting, the agency did reveal the underlying data examined by Dr. Mosholder, but not the staffer's conclusions. Two congressional committees are currently examining the agency's handling of the epidemiologist's report. Dr. Mosholder declined to comment.
