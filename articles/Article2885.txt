 Deals & Deal Makers: Bids & Offers   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 2001  Quinten Stevens, a former managing director of J.P. Morgan & Co. is now . . . managing director of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.  Six months after quitting J.P. Morgan, Mr. Stevens, 37 years old, has decided he is too young to retire. After talking with investment banks like Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and UBS Warburg, he allowed himself to be wooed back by the newly merged mega-bank. In fact, not a lot has changed. Mr. Stevens, who used to help run the U.S. equity capital-markets desk at J.P. Morgan, will now be tackling almost the same job, working with Carlos Hernandez. One difference: Mr. Stevens, an Australian, will be tackling more of J.P. Morgan's overseas work.  That has led to some unusual situations. Last year, one of Crescendo's portfolio companies was acquired by a big technology concern, leaving a senior employee jobless. Ms. [Margaret Roberts] quickly found him a job at another Crescendo-funded firm. Now the employee, whom Ms. Roberts declined to name, is out of work again thanks to a "downsizing" by his new company.
