 Dinkins's Team Says No to Stock Tax   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1990  Recent discussions of the federal budget deficit have raised the possibility of a securities transfer excise tax of between 15 and 50 basis points, or 0.15% and 0.5%. STET would tax all sales of marketable securities (including stocks, bonds and commercial paper) other than Treasuries. Reaction to this proposal has been overwhelmingly negative. Several studies demonstrate the adverse impact STET would have on the U.S. economy and, in particular, on New York. We agree with the emerging consensus that STET would seriously, and perhaps irreversibly, damage the competitive viability of the U.S. securities markets and its financial institutions. STET would also have the short-term effect of further depressing the U.S. stock market, which has already fallen by 10% since mid-July.
