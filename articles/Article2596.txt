 Here's the Problem: A software company wants funds to grow without sacrificing control and endangering its egalitarian culture   By By Michael Selz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1999  The company had expanded initially into network-monitoring tools that sold for $1,000 each. The long sales cycle of such products prompted Midnight Networks to introduce network-testing software at a price that could support the several months required sometimes to make a sale -- $15,000 to $20,000 a copy.  By 1996, Midnight Networks grew in a market niche with estimated potential sales of $75 million. In 1995, the company reported a 77% jump in net income to $879,000, on a doubling of revenue to $1.75 million. Equally important, it has maintained its open, collegial culture amid such growth. Virtually all 25 of its employees participate in making major decisions. Even minor ones are shared in weekly online status reports. Everyone knows everyone else's salary. Employees are trained to perform each other's jobs. Workers' approach to quality is rooted in Japanese-management techniques.  But the company has exhausted its ability to fund expansion from operating earnings. A robust market for new stock issues is tempting the company to go public to finance further growth. However, some far-sighted employees fear Midnight Networks' new shares may be driven by the Internet frenzy to unsustainable heights. When reason is restored and the company's stock price falls, Midnight Networks' reputation might suffer.
