 Iraq Is Pressed By Superpowers To Quit Kuwait --- Bush, Gorbachev Also Show Differences in Approach To Easing Mideast Crisis   By By Michel McQueen and Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1990  HELSINKI, Finland -- President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev warned Saddam Hussein that they would consider unspecified "additional" steps against Iraq if he didn't heed United Nations demands to withdraw his army from Kuwait.  In particular, the Soviet leader was far more reluctant than President Bush to leave the impression that force might be used against Iraq if diplomacy and economic pressure fail. He made it clear the U.S.S.R. wouldn't join the growing land and sea forces surrounding Iraq. And he stressed repeatedly that the crisis could and must be resolved politically, even though U.S. officials said a military strike at Iraq was still an option.  The additional steps threatened by the superpowers weren't specified, and Secretary [James] Baker said the two leaders didn't discuss specifics on the subject. Mr. Baker himself, however, said such steps could include additional sanctions on Iraq, sanctions against countries that break the embargo, a broadening of the current U.N. approval for the use of force to stop goods moving into and out of the country, or the invoking of the U.N. charter provision permitting countries to defend themselves. Another U.S. official said action to stop air shipments into Iraq might also be taken.
