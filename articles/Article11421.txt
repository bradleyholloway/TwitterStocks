 Business Brief -- Kellogg Co.: Company Raises Prices 3.7% On All but 2 of Its Cereals   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1990  Kellogg Co. raised prices on all but two of its breakfast cereals 3.7%, following a larger increase by rival General Mills Inc.  The Battle Creek, Mich., company exempted best sellers Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes from the price increase, largely because those brands' market shares have been hurt by private-label versions. Kellogg hasn't increased the price of corn flakes since May 1989.
