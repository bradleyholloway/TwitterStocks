Governor Cuomo yesterday formally requested Congressional hearings to develop Federal legislation that would make clear the roles of the Federal, state and local governments in nuclear power plant emergencies.  ''Federal law hasn't dealt with this problem,'' the Governor said. He raised a series of possible Federal actions ranging from outright ownership of the nuclear plants to federally financed and trained special radiological response teams. He also mentioned the possibility of Federal reimbursement for utility users when a nuclear plant's failure to open drives up electricity rates.  The Governor, in a news conference at the World Trade Center, released copies of letters he had sent to the chairman and ranking minority members of four Senate and House committees that deal with nuclear energy. But he declined to provide specific suggestions.  Mr. Cuomo said he and his aides had consulted with the Senate and House officials and expected a ''quick and positive response.'' Chairman Named for Panel  At the same time he dealt with two local nuclear plant problems that have dramatized the issues of safety and evacuation if necessary in areas surrounding such plants. He appointed Dr. John H. Marburger 3d, the president of the State University at Stony Brook, as chairman of a fact-finding panel on the Long Island Lighting Company's nuclear power plant at Shoreham, L.I.  The Suffolk County Executive, Peter F. Cohalan, has refused to approve an emergency evacuation plan for the Shoreham area, contending that it would be impossible to evacuate the eastern end of Long Island.  Mr. Cuomo also named six others to the panel. They are Dr. David Axelrod, the State Health Commissioner; Karen S. Burstein, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board; Marge Harrison, an official of the Long Island Public Power Project; Prof. Albert Kahn of Cornell University, a former State Public Service Commission chairman; Dr. Paul Alan Marks, the president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Prof. Hugh Wilson of Adelphi University.  Last week, William J. Ronan, former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and David J. Willmott, a newspaper publisher, were named to the study group as representatives of Nassau and Suffolk Counties.  William J. Dircks, executive director for nuclear operations of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, will represent that group. The Governor said another agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had not yet responded to his invitation to designate a representative. Study Group's Findings Due  Dr. Axelrod, who is chairman of the state's Disaster Preparedness Commission, stood beside the Governor as Mr. Cuomo also announced that a study group headed by Dr. Axelrod would report its recommendations to him Thursday for state action to avert a shutdown of the Consolidated Edison Company's Indian Point plant in Buchanan, N.Y.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has threatened to close the plant if an emergency evacuation plan is not developed by June 9. Mr. Cuomo said his request for some Federal role in evacuation planning was analogous to Federal intervention in the nuclear waste crises at the Love Canal and West Valley in western New York. ''The matter of safety is basically a Federal responsibility,'' he said.
