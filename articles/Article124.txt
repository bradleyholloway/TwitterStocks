SAN SALVADOR, April 30â€” A body believed to be that of an American Roman Catholic priest who disappeared from his hotel Sunday was found here today, Government officials said.  The face was completely unrecognizable, they said, but the shoes and clothes indicated that it could be the corpse of the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, who was working as an interpreter for CBS News.  Results of a fingerprint analysis were not immediately known.  The body, found in a ravine in the western part of San Salvador, had a gunshot wound. But it was not known whether the disfiguration was caused by blows or by the fall into the ravine.  Reports indicated that the victim had been dead for several days.Father Bourgeois was last seen Sunday morning when he left his hotel, saying he was going to a pharmacy. Woman and Sons Killed  A female employee of a Government agricultural bank and two sons were shot to death in their home today by unidentified gunmen, the Government said. The bank has been a frequent target of leftist guerrillas.  A large Government anti-insurgency campaign was reported in the eastern province of Morazan, where up to 1,000 soldiers were said to be scouring the mountains for guerrillas. Government sources declined to provide details.  A bomb destroyed a downtown San Salvador hardware store tonight, but no injuries were reported.
