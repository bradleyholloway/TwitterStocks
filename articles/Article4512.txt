 Emphasis on Bottom Line in Domestic Policy Could Be Costly in the Long Run, Some Warn   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1985  During the Carter administration, Stuart Eizenstat, the president's chief domestic-policy adviser, was a powerful, well-known figure. Not so John Svahn, who holds the job in the Reagan administration.  Mr. Svahn's relative anonymity is partly a result of his own efforts to keep a low profile. And it remains to be seen what effect yesterday's streamlining of the White House cabinet-council system and the rising prominence of presidential aide Alfred Kingon will have on domestic policy-making. But the impact of the ballooning federal budget deficit has made cost-cutting rather than program development the order of the day. That has given David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, the administration's key role on many domestic issues.  For example, Jack Meyer, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, opposes the proposal to extend the existing freeze on Medicare payments to doctors until October 1986. Such a freeze, which is part of the compromise budget plan for fiscal 1986 recently worked out between the White House and Republican senators, will make doctors less willing to participate in Medicare and could lead to substandard care, Mr. Meyer argues.
