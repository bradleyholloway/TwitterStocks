 Summer Olympics 2000: Way Down Under, They're Way Over the Moon --- A Sports-Mad Nation Sees Its Medal Dreams Go Golden; Now, Drink Up!   By By S. Karene Witcher, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  "There's a mythology of Australia being a sporting nation," says Jane O'Dwyer, general manager of Sports Medicine Australia, a nonprofit education group in Canberra. "The reality is they are sporting mad, but in a couch potato sort of way."  Australia is one of only two nations that has competed at every modern Olympics since the revival of the Games in 1896. The other is Greece. But it was the Montreal Games in 1976 that prompted Australia to get serious. Australia came home with just five medals, none gold, causing a national bout of hand wringing -- and prompting a government program to stoke the country's future Olympic chances.  Sport got a grip on Australians soon after the first convicts landed here in 1788 to found a British penal colony. It was a "way people could show disdain for authority," says Richard Waterhouse, a historian at the University of Sydney. Convicts were sent to Australia to be reformed and told to attend church services. Instead, he says, they indulged in sports. Tavern owners sponsored prize fights and cockfights. Horse racing sprang up, and cricket matches soon became hotbeds of betting and drinking.
