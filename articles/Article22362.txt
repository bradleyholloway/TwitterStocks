 Wary Investors Sought Stability in 4th Quarter   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1998  "Anything that anyone could describe as a refuge, or a company that generates unexciting but stable profits, saw a big inflow of cash during the fourth quarter," said Bob Smith, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "The stocks that did well are all what I call `derivative' investments: People don't own them because they're great stocks, they buy them because they've got cash and they don't want to own other things."  The industrial average recovered much of the ground forfeited in the sell-off early in the quarter, but it still ended the period down 0.47%, as the ramifications of the Asian economic upheaval remain murky and analysts quibble over the impact on U.S. companies. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 6.84% in the quarter, as the technology stocks that dominate the benchmark were dumped by money managers in the wake of warnings about disappointing earnings.  In general, many analysts say, the stocks that beat the market in 1998 are likely to resemble the winners of the fourth quarter, rather than the stocks that led stock indexes higher for most of 1997. At the same time, though, they see continued popularity for the so-called Nifty 50 companies of today, such as Procter & Gamble, Gillette and Coca-Cola. While these stocks suffered early from the fallout from Asia's woes, they have retrieved a large portion of their losses and now benefit from investors' quest for stability and liquidity.
