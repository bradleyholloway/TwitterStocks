"Most of the studies in the past have revolved around cholesterol," but other factors also must be involved because cholesterol levels are normal in many heart-attack victims, Prof. Berliner said.  Scientists have long suspected that one such factor might be oxidized phospholipids, a type of fat that is a major component of LDL or "bad cholesterol."
