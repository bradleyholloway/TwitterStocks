 Digital River Surges as Investors Rediscover a Taste for Technology   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2001  VerticalNet, a Horsham, Pa., business-to-business e-commerce company, rallied 97 cents, or 20%, to 5.91. VerticalNet and SierraCities.com have mutually agreed to end their merger plan, citing market conditions. VerticalNet agreed to buy SierraCities in a stock deal initially valued at $133 million, or $7 a share.  FirePond, a Waltham, Mass., provider of electronic business sales and marketing technology, plummeted 3.53, or 41%, to 5.06. The company said it expects to report a fiscal first-quarter operating loss of 19 to 24 cents a share, compared with analysts' projections of a 9-cent operating loss. The company attributed the shortfall to the "global slowdown in information technology spending, which is delaying the signing of new contracts." Robertson Stephens, SG Cowen and Dain Rauscher lowered ratings on FirePond.  NYSE-traded Unifi, a Greensboro, N.C., yarn producer, fell 69 cents, or 9.2%, to 6.75. The company said fiscal second-quarter results will be "significantly" below analysts' estimates and it may even post a loss. Analysts had been predicting a profit of 14 cents a share. The company said some customers adjusted their orders, anticipating higher inventory levels because of sluggish holiday sales at the retail level. Credit Suisse First Boston lowered its rating on Unifi to hold from buy.
