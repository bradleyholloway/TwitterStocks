 Oil Companies Seen Reporting Lower Profits   By By Loren Fox, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1998  The major U.S. oil companies are expected to report fourth-quarter profits that are, on average, 10% lower than the year-earlier period because of plunging prices for oil and natural gas.  It was bad enough for the world oil market when, at the end of November, Saudi Arabia said it would increase production. Add to that an unusually mild U.S. winter and the likelihood that economic turmoil in Southeast Asia will trim oil demand growth, and the result was sliding prices.  It wasn't much better for natural-gas prices. Instead of rising, as usual, in November and December, prices fell, as the phenomenon known as El Nino brought mild weather to the Northeast and Midwest. U.S. natural-gas prices averaged $2.76 per thousand cubic feet in the latest fourth quarter, down 6% from the previous year, according to Salomon.
