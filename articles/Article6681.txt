 Best on the Street (A Special Report): 2003 Analysts Review --- Supermarkets & Drugstores   By By Patricia Callahan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  Mr. [Neil Currie] felt that Safeway Inc., the nation's No. 4 chain, and Albertson's Inc., the No. 3 chain, were vulnerable. Both chains cut costs last year, but Mr. Currie didn't think they focused enough on expanding sales. During his yearlong "sell" recommendation on Safeway, the Pleasanton, Calif., grocer's stock sank 44%. He had "sell" recommendations on Albertson's twice last year. The Boise, Idaho, chain's stock dropped 12% in the first period and 30% in the second.  The third-best stock picker, Lisa Cartwright, also at Smith Barney, scored with "sell" recommendations on Albertson's and Safeway for part of the year as the stocks declined. She upgraded Safeway to a "buy" in November, in time to earn an 8.3% gain by year end. "By November, they had really started to come around and say, `Hey, we need to address our pricing, we need to address our image,'" says Ms. Cartwright, who downgraded Safeway to a "hold" last month after the company warned its first-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' expectations.
