 On Sports: The Art and Science of Bowling   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1986  "Mine came in 1969," says the man who has knocked down more pins in Professional Bowlers Association tournaments than anyone else. "I was 36 years old -- about the age where most athletes call it quits -- and bowling lousy. I was thinking in terms of looking for a real job."  Then he started talking bowling with Hank Lahr, a friend who was an engineer. "He told me I didn't know my profession," says Salvino in the tones of this, his native city. "I told him 'Whaddaya mean? I've been a pro since I was 17!' He said I was doing things on instinct alone, like a typical jock, instead of understanding them systematically, like a scientist. He said that if I didn't wise up quick, I'd be through.  "Lahr gave me a few pointers on engineering, and told me to go home and read some books. I never got past high school, but I read and understood 'em! I was amazed! Pretty soon, I understood about things like vector analysis and translational motion. It straightened out my bowling and gave me a whole new way to look at the world. I haven't been the same since."
