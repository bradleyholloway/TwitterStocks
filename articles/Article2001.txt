 SEC clears rule requiring political gifts disclosure   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1995  The SEC has approved a rule crafted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board requiring municipal securities dealers to disclose payments made to political parties. The change is directed against the same sort of "pay-to-play" pressures that led the agency to bar muni dealers from giving political gifts to officials with whom they do business.
