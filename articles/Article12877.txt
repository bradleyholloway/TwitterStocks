 Under Gateway's Tree, Another Shake-Up   By By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2003  Meanwhile, the plan to rebuild PC sales by cutting prices merely added to Gateway's losses. Where a year ago Mr. [TED WAITT] expected to lift sales volumes to turn a profit, he has now conceded that the goal of selling one million PCs a quarter is unlikely to be met.  According to a presentation Mr. Waitt sent to executives late in December, Gateway will reorganize this month, naming new executives and reshuffling its sales efforts. It will also recreate a separate business-PC marketing and sales organization.  Mr. [Joseph C. Formichelli]'s most pressing challenge centers on getting Gateway's PC sales rising again. While building an expensive retail-store network, its U.S. market share fell to 6.1%, down from 9.3% three years ago. "It's hard to see how he can pull this one out," says UBS Warburg's Mr. [Don M. Young]. "The core PC business isn't efficient."
