 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Lourdes Lee Valeriano, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1993  Bookstore chains are exploring the U.S. market for Spanish-language titles. Since 1990, Waldenbooks Inc., Stamford, Conn., has set up Spanish sections in 130, or about 10%, of its stores. Some outlets carry up to 250 titles. The books make up just under 1% of sales, "enough to be profitable," a spokesman says. Barnes & Noble, New York, in 1992 began testing Libro Espanol sections in 60 B. Dalton stores.  "As you see more bestsellers in Spanish, the section will do well," says a spokeswoman. But Spanish-language titles, often printed abroad, are pricey at $18-$22 for a paperback. Michael Denneny of St. Martin's Press, New York, sees "a real opening" for U.S. publishers. Next year, St. Martin's will publish English and Spanish versions of "Wings of the Morning" by Orestes Lorenzo, a pilot who daringly smuggled his family out of Cuba.  Theft has grown as more and pricier bikes hit the road, so new firms are jumping into the security business -- and old hands are honing their offerings. Products to protect bikes "are just starting to catch up" with thieves, says Joseph Mele of the National Crime Prevention Institute, Louisville, Ky. The American Center for Bicycle Registration, Phoenix, Ariz., set up shop this year, vying with nine-year-old National Bike Registry Inc. of Sacramento, Calif.
