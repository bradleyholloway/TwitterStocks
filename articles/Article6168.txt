 Radio Concerns Hit High Notes In 4th Quarter --- Analysts See Strong Results As Clustering Turns Up Advertising Revenues   By By Brian Steinberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1999  Mr. [Richard] Weening said he is comfortable that the Milwaukee broadcaster, which went public in June, can meet or exceed expectations by some analysts for fourth-quarter cash flow of a penny a share. Because amortization and depreciation after big purchases can distort earnings, Wall Street gauges a radio company's financial health more by cash flow than by earnings. Cash flow is usually calculated by adding earnings before depreciation, amortization, and deferred taxes.  Chancellor has "been very successful at converting their ratings growth into higher revenues," Mr. [William] Meyers said. The First Call consensus estimate is for Chancellor to post cash flow of 59 cents a diluted share, up from 36.24 cents a share on a post-split basis a year ago. Analysts expect the acquisitive Irving, Texas, radio giant to post a loss of 19 cents a share, narrowing from 27 cents a share a year ago.  Clear Channel and Jacor continue to perform well ahead of their merger, which is expected close in September. Clear Channel is expected to post 46 cents a share in cash flow, according to First Call, up from 37.5 cents a share on a split-adjusted basis. Analysts see the San Antonio, Texas, broadcaster posting net income of nine cents a diluted share, down from 11 cents a share a year earlier.
