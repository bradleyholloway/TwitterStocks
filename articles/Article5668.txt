 Human Rights Depend on American Power   By By Adrian Karatnycky, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1998  Fifty years ago today the member states of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Shaped by a remarkable group of men and women headed by Eleanor Roosevelt, the document was intended as an optimistic global charter of freedom.  In the immediate aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, the desire to enact the declaration was as much a matter of pragmatism as it was one of idealism. At the time, the U.N. consisted primarily of countries friendly to the U.S., and to a remarkable degree the declaration reflects American values. It gives far greater emphasis to individual civic and political rights than to collective social and economic issues. Its core belief, said Mrs. Roosevelt, is that "the state is for the individual."  The pivotal role played by the U.S. in giving flesh to the declaration is not acknowledged in many corners of the world today. Some in the international human-rights community complain about U.S. resistance to the establishment of new global structures such as the International Criminal Court. Others focus on what they claim are massive domestic U.S. violations of human rights. But the positive role of the U.S. in a half century's expansion of freedom cannot be denied.
