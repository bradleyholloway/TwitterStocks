 Time Asks FCC to Reject Paramount Bid For a Voting Trust for Its Takeover Offer   By By David B. Hilder and Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1989  Time Inc. asked the Federal Communications Commission to reject Paramount Communications Inc.'s application for a voting trust that would help Paramount complete its $10.7 billion hostile tender offer for Time.  Time's board hasn't yet responded to Paramount's offer, but Time's filing with the FCC sent another strong signal that Time intends to spurn the Paramount bid and try to complete its proposed merger with Warner Communications Inc., although perhaps in a revised form. Time directors are expected to meet as early as today to decide on a response.  Paramount had asked the FCC to approve a voting trust to be administered by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to hold Time shares if Paramount buys shares under its tender offer before the FCC licenses are granted. Cable experts, however, have said it is unlikely that the trust will go into effect because the FCC usually acts on such applications faster than local governments, and Paramount has conditioned its offer on receiving all significant local franchise approvals.
