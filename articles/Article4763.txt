 Delay of Trial In Insider Case Sought by U.S.   By By Daniel Hertzberg and William Power, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1987  Federal prosecutors asked for a two-month delay in the insider-trading trial of three prominent Wall Street executives, and indicated they will seek an expanded indictment against the three that involves trading in the securities of nine companies.  The proposed delay of the trial, which is scheduled to start next week, was immediately seized on by defense lawyers as an indication that the government was having trouble proving its case against the three executives, whose arrests in February stunned Wall Street. The lawyers indicated they would oppose any delay in the start of the trial. The government wants a postponement until July 20.  The three executives awaiting trial are Robert M. Freeman, a partner and head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co.; Richard B. Wigton, who was head of arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co. at the time of his arrest; and Timothy L. Tabor, a former arbitrager at Kidder, a General Electric Co. unit. The three men were indicted by a federal grand jury in April on various charges of fraud and conspiracy to violate securities laws. They have denied the charges.
