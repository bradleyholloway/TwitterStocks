 Benchmark Bond Rises Sharply After Treasury Unveils Plans to Further Reduce Sales of Debt   By By Marianne Sullivan and Brian Blacktone, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2000  The 30-year Treasury bond ended sharply higher after the Treasury Department unveiled plans to further trim debt sales and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates less than some investors had feared.  The Treasury announced it will auction $12 billion of 4 3/4 -year 5 7/8% notes (reopening) (Cusip: 9128275S7), $10 billion of 10-year notes (Cusip: 9128275Z1) and $10 billion of 30- 1/4 -year bonds (Cusip: 912810FM5).  In addition, the Treasury said it now will sell new 30-year bonds only once a year. Essentially, the Treasury will be scaling back 30-year bond sales to around $16 billion to $18 billion this year, from $20 billion last year and $30 billion in 1998, said Marc Wanshel, financial economist at J.P. Morgan Securities. "Investors have to be thinking about a shortage of long-term paper in general," he added.
