 New Theory Could Roil Stem-Cell Debate   By By Laurie McGinley and Antonio Regalado, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2001  Ms. [Dianne Irving], in the paper, says that the scientific literature suggests that stem cells, once separated from an embryo, naturally tend to "heal themselves from any injuries, and they then revert to being new living whole embryos." Thus, she argues, the government is barred from funding stem-cell experiments because of an existing funding ban on research harmful to embryos. The Clinton administration last year concluded that because stem cells aren't embryos, funding for stem-cell research could go forward, as long as scientists didn't use federal funds to derive the stem cells themselves.
