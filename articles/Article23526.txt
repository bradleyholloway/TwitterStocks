 Auditing the Auditors After Sarbanes-Oxley   By Solomon, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2007  The 21-member committee, which includes a mix of business, regulatory and academic representatives, is expected to make recommendations by summer 2008. The timing of those recommendations could pose a challenge for Mr. [Henry Paulson], however, since they will come just months before the Bush administration leaves offices and as the 2008 elections begin to occupy the attention of Congress. Treasury officials played down those concerns, saying the recommendations aren't intended for the "short term" and can be implemented once Mr. Bush -- and Mr. Paulson -- leaves office.
