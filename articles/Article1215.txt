 Budget Director Calls for Fed To Ease Credit --- Unusual Public Comment Indicates Plan to Shift Blame for Any Recession   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1989  Budget Director Richard Darman warned that the Federal Reserve's credit policies may be pushing the economy into recession and suggested the Fed needs to bring interest rates down further.  In an interview yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Mr. Darman said he fears the Fed "may have been a little bit too tight" and said, "If we do have a recession, I think it will be because they erred on the side of caution."  Asked whether he was suggesting the central bank should bring down interest rates more than it already has, Mr. Darman replied: "That would be a fair conclusion."
