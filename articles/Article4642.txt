 U.S. Currency Is Likely to Move Lower As Speculation on Intervention Recedes   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1986  With expectations receding of central-bank intervention to support the dollar, many traders and analysts expect the U.S. currency to move lower this week, particularly against the Japanese yen.  The dollar fell against most major currencies last week but dropped most sharply against the yen, setting new lows against the Japanese currency during four consecutive days.  The U.S. currency, however, was buoyed at various points last week by Bank of Japan intervention and by an unconfirmed report, which was later denied, that the central banks of Japan and West Germany had agreed on a joint effort to blunt the dollar's fall. By Friday, traders said they were convinced that the Japanese central bank stands alone in its fight against the dollar's downhill charge and thus will be unable to stop it.
