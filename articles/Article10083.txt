 Style & Substance: Proenza Schouler Designs A New Financial Model   By O'Connell, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  In May, New York designer Narciso Rodriguez sold a 50% stake in his name to apparel giant Liz Claiborne Inc. for $12 million. Liz Claiborne created a new company to develop the brand, with Mr. Rodriguez as creative director. Designer Peter Som, whose label is eight years old, is close to a deal with NRDC Equity Partners, the retail developer and owner of department-store chain Lord & Taylor. Mr. Som wouldn't sell his name outright. Instead, NRDC would take a 65% stake in a new company that would license the designer's name. Its investment is expected to be less than $10 million, according to people with knowledge of the deal. "People are accepting now that designers don't want to sell their name entirely," says Gail Zauder, managing partner at Elixir Advisors, an investment bank specializing in luxury brands.  Proenza Schouler designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, both 29 years old, say the Valentino investment will allow them to start selling handbags next year, while expanding their shoe collection, adding fragrances and opening some boutiques. "We jump on the power bandwagon now," Mr. Hernandez said in a recent interview at the designers' studio in Manhattan's Chinatown.  Valentino's Mr. [Sassi], who met the duo at a Paris textile fair in February, says he respects their desire to keep control of their company. "We saw these two guys, so fresh, so enthusiastic, so open- minded," he says. "They weren't at all prima donnas."
