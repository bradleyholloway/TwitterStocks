 SHOP TALK: What's Next? Love Canal Soap?   By By Cynthia Crossen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 1986  Late last year, P&G acquired Richardson-Vicks Inc., which makes, among other things, a shampoo called Mill Creek. To people in other cities, Mill Creek has the sound of pastoral purity. But Cincinnati actually has a Mill Creek, and it's anything but pure. "It's an industrial sewer," says J. Bruce Suits, administrative assistant for the city's Environmental Advisory Council. At least two dozen companies, including P&G, have plants along the creek, and Mr. Suits says pollutants occasionally seep into it accidentally.  Cincinnati's Mill Creek is so foul, in fact, that the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission recently recommended that water skiers avoid the nearby Ohio River below the point where Mill Creek empties into it.  A P&G spokeswoman says the company believes it can sell plenty of Mill Creek shampoo elsewhere, and anyway P&G has five other shampoo brands that Cincinnati residents might want to buy. As for Mill Creek shampoo, the spokeswoman concedes, "I'm not sure I would want to wash my hair in something with that name."
