 Tenet Has Wider Loss, Discloses New Supoena   By Rundle, Rhonda L, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2004  Tenet also announced that Chief Financial Officer Stephen Farber will resign rather than move to Dallas when the headquarters relocates there from Santa Barbara, Calif., early next year. And Tenet disclosed that it received a subpoena last week from the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Orleans requesting documents relating to a continuing investigation into its physician relationships and financial arrangements at three hospitals in the region.  For the year-earlier quarter, Tenet recorded a net loss of $195 million, or 42 cents a share. Revenue in the latest quarter fell 3.3% to $2.57 billion from $2.66 billion. Tenet attributed the decline to discounted prices it has implemented for uninsured patients, as well as a 3% decline in admissions and continuing pricing pressures.  The biggest disappointment in the latest quarter was the decline in patient volume, which affected three-quarters of the 69 hospitals that Tenet has said it plans to keep after it completes a divestiture program. Still, Tenet played down the decline, saying it amounted to about 5,000 fewer patients, or a difference of fewer than one patient a day at the core hospitals.
