In Bethesda Naval Hospital outside Washington yesterday, Edmund S. Muskie, the former Secretary of State and United States Senator from Maine, was reported making a good recovery from an eight-hour back operation.  Specialists at the hospital removed an enlarged disc from the 67-year-old Democrat's back Saturday.  He had a similar operation in 1977.  Mr. Muskie's son, Stephen O. Muskie, said his father's back problem went back nearly 30 years, before he became Governor of Maine. He was finishing off two extra bedrooms in his home in Waterville when a railing gave way, and Mr. Muskie, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall, fell down two flights of stairs.  His back was broken and he was unconscious for two days, said Stephen Muskie, and at the time doctors feared for his life. He was hospitalized for two months. He is expected to remain in the hospital another nine or 10 days, his son said.
