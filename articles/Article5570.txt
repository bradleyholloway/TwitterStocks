 The Colossus   By By Frederick Brown, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1998  After completing a life of Balzac five years ago, Graham Robb bravely undertook to do the same for Victor Hugo. Few centuries have begotten two literary figures of such girth, and the British biographer needed an even more ambitious reach to encompass his second subject than his first, which he has now done in "Victor Hugo: A Biography" (Norton, 682 pages, $39.95). While Balzac elaborated the modern novel in his voluminous series "La Comedie Humaine," Hugo influenced every genre, producing fiction, theater and, above all, verse that embodied the ethos of Romanticism for youthful generations. As Henry James might have put it, he abounded aggressively in his own sense.  His own sense did not confine him to some ivory tower. A passionate royalist at age 25, he wrote the official ode for Charles X's coronation in 1827, but no sooner had this last Bourbon king awarded him the Legion of Honor than he began to find liberal ideas more compatible with his iconoclastic aesthetics. When in February 1830 the Comedie-Francaise performed "Hernani," a play whose hero swears vengeance against Don Carlo (i.e., King Charles), it provoked a brouhaha that heralded the July Revolution. Eighteen years later, following another revolution, Hugo was elected to the republican legislature and served until Louis-Napoleon's coup in 1851. From his refuge on the Channel island of Guernsey (where he wrote "Les Miserables," among much else), the poet laureate hurled derision at the Bonapartist usurper. In exile his stature only increased, and after Napoleon III fell in 1870 the Hugo who returned to Paris was hailed as a patron saint of human freedom.
