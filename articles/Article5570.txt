 Telecommunications (A Special Report): A Wireless World --- The Developing Leap: Many Emerging Nations Are Moving Directly Into the New Age, Bypassing the Wired Stage   By By Cynthia Owens, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 1994  Telephone service was a different story. The couple waited for a year, hoping to get one of Thailand's precious phone lines. But they finally gave up and bought a cellular phone, which they started using immediately. "There is no choice," says Mrs. Wandee, a 30-year-old buyer for American Standard Co. "It's just too long to keep waiting."  What's happening in Thailand provides an outline of changes unfolding elsewhere, though the details may vary. Thailand has a moderate number of conventional phone lines, for instance, but some of its less-developed neighbors are making the jump to cellular communications more directly, bypassing traditional lines almost entirely en route to the wireless age.  The Thai government figured that cellular phones, already popular in more advanced Asian capitals like Hong Kong and Singapore, could ease Thailand's shortage of conventional lines. Cellular companies would only have to install transmission stations in key areas, rather than lay new phone lines and route them through already inadequate and aging switching stations. That makes cellular systems cheaper just about everywhere in Thailand, though the cost savings are biggest in places with little or no conventional telephone infrastructure.
