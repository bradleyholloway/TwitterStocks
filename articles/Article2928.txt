 Airbus Faces Adjustment In Output as Demand Falls --- New York Crash Is a Blow, But More Crucial Is Need For a Downturn Strategy   By By Daniel Michaels, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2001  European Aeronautic Defense & Space Co., which owns 80% of Airbus, said its nine-month revenue through Sept. 30 rose 12% from a year earlier, to 20.7 billion euros ($18.5 billion). Including revenue from Airbus's United Kingdom operations, which EADS recently integrated as part of a deal with fellow Airbus shareholder BAE Systems PLC, EADS's nine-month revenue rose 30% from a year earlier.  Mr. [Rainer Hertrich] said Airbus is prepared to weather the downturn thanks to a strong cash position, little debt and adaptable production management. After the recession a decade ago, Airbus developed flexible arrangements with its labor unions allowing it to raise or lower production by 15% without renegotiating employment contracts. Mr. Hertrich said Airbus can remain profitable with output as low as around 290 planes. Below that, "we have to think about head-count reductions," he said in an interview.
