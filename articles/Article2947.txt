 Frequent-Flier Programs Hunt in Rivals' Airspace   By By Jane Costello The Wall Street Journal Online, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  In 2002, Ms. [Combs] will be enjoying all those privileges on Alaska Airlines, an airline she has flown only twice. Fortunately for Ms. Combs, the Alaska Air Group Inc. carrier is offering elite membership in its own frequent-flier program to United's best customers. Alaska Airlines has offered to match the elite status of any United passengers willing to fax in a copy of their mileage statement to the airline before the end of January.  While United customers may welcome the chance to get comped, some Alaska Airlines fliers aren't quite as pleased. Paula Fischer, a marketing-research analyst from Olympia, Wash., is an Alaska Airlines "Gold MVP" passenger who isn't happy about the thought of having to compete for upgrades and seat assignments with former United passengers. "I am a loyal flier who voluntarily chose to fly Alaska," she says. "And now the first-class section could be full of people who've never flown them before."  While Alaska's move appears to mark the first time an airline has made a blanket offer to the public, it isn't the only time that the public has been able to get in on the action. During the flight-delay plagued summer of 2000, Continental Airlines set up tables at several U.S. airports to solicit elite members of rival airlines, offering to match status in the airline's OnePass frequent-flier program.
