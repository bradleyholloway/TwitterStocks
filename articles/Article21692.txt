 Untaxed Pensions   By Nicklas, Robert H, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1992  Robert H. Nicklas responds to the Apr 17, 1992 article "Retiree's Woe: Tax Man Haunts Your Place in the Sun," noting that while New York reaches outside the state to tax former residents on their pensions and IRAs, it does not tax retired state, municipal and teacher pensions at all.
