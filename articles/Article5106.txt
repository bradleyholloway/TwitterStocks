 Prosecution's Case Against Poindexter Bolstered by North   By By Paul M. Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1990  Oliver North, reticent and uncharacteristically forgetful, nevertheless bolstered the prosecution's case in the Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter by testifying that he acted under Mr. Poindexter's supervision in providing covert military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.  Instead, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel said that Mr. Poindexter, then the national security adviser, gave him ambiguous instructions about what to say during an August 1986 congressional inquiry into Reagan administration involvement in Nicaragua. Mr. North said that before one session with members of Congress, he told Mr. Poindexter of his concern that the lawmakers would ask about topics he had been ordered to keep secret, such as administration fund-raising for the Contras. Mr. Poindexter told Mr. North, " `You take care of it' or `You can handle it,' or words to that effect," Mr. North testified.
