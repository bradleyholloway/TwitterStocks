 Oil Prices Surge As OPEC Ploy Gets Results --- Traders React to Cartel Plan For Talks on Production With Outsider Nations   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1988  OPEC yesterday demonstrated the strength of its newest weapon in its war against weak petroleum markets: to set the date for another meeting.  Oil prices surged in the wake of a weekend decision by five oil ministers to meet April 23 with several non-OPEC exporters to consider a joint effort aimed at curbing the world oil glut. Although the latest effort may come to nothing, it was another occasion on which the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries caused prices to jump merely by scheduling a meeting.  The bid for an alliance of OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters was initiated by eight producing countries outside the cartel. Just how committed either group may be to sharing production cuts to prop up the price of oil remains in doubt. There were conflicting reports, for example, on whether the 13 nations of OPEC will even consider reducing their output of nearly 18 million barrels a day at an April 25 conference, following the meeting of the five ministers with the non-OPEC exporters.
