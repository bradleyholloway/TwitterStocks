 The Economy: Jobless Rate Rose to 6.4% in June; Measure's Nine-Year High Shows Job-Market Woes, Signals Delayed Recovery   By Barta, Patrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2003  "It's fair to say the average consumer of financial information is most familiar with the unemployment rate," he said. The latest "jump is not going to help consumer confidence in any way, shape or form."  Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston, said he thought the payroll report was particularly worrying given that the Federal Reserve has already pushed interest rates so low. "They can keep pumping out money and avert deflation, but there isn't much room left to provide a bounce in interest-sensitive consumer activities like buying new homes and new cars," he said. Though he is still hopeful the economy will rebound in the second half of the year, "the more time passes without a positive sign, the more one gets nervous about it."
