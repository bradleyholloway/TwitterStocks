 Innovation Fuels Drive for Voter Turnout --- High-Tech Tactics, Aggressive Recruiting Mark 11th-Hour Push to Get Out the Vote   By By Greg Hitt and Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2002  For Democrats and their allies, especially labor unions, the ability to turn out voters is important to mitigating the party's fund-raising disadvantage. The AFL-CIO says the turnout effort being mounted in Las Vegas on behalf of Democratic House candidate Dario Herrera is of the most technologically advanced ever undertaken. The Las Vegas race is one of about a dozen where control of the House will be decided.  The AFL-CIO's aim is to build on recent gains. In 1992, labor households made up 19% of the electorate, according to AFL-CIO surveys. In 1996, the percentage was 22%, and in 2000 it was 26%, thanks to about three-quarters of registered union members making it to the polls, said AFL-CIO spokeswoman Denise Mitchell.  So as the president barnstormed the country, local officials leveraged his appearances to enlist Election Day volunteers. In Maine, the campaign of Republican Kevin Raye, a House hopeful locked in a tossup contest, was allotted 1,000 tickets for the [Bush] rally in a drafty hangar at Bangor International Airport. As the campaign parceled out the tickets, officials hit up each recipient for help. The result: 100 extra volunteers to make phone calls, hand out fliers and knock on doors. "There's a method to all this madness," says Kathie Summers, the Raye campaign manager.
