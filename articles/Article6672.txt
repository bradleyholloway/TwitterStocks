 The New Kitchen -- Your Car --- Makers Push To-Go Appliances To Heat, Eat on the Road; A Fridge for the Front Seat   By By Sarah Robertson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 2003  While the new gizmos may be a bright spot for the struggling $4.6 billion small-kitchen-appliance industry, which saw sales fall 6% in the second half of last year, everyone from sociologists to car detailers say they're a bad idea. These days "you're more likely to find french fries in the car than a penny," says Harry Balzer, vice president of NPD Group, which tracks consumer eating habits. Also unhappy: safety experts. "Everybody should focus entirely on driving," says Jane Stutts of the University of North Carolina's Highway Safety Research Center. "All it takes is one time when you drop the taco." (Indeed, a new study ranks mobile eating just behind cellphone use as a cause of distracted-driving accidents.)  parents, especially, say the new gadgets can make life easier. Jane Voltz likes to make home-cooked waffles for her children's breakfast (she has three boys), but between taking her older child to school, running errands and getting to swim practice, they often don't have time to sit and eat. So the Virginia stay-at-home mother recently picked up a $20 cooker from Hamilton Beach that turns out waffle sticks for the road. Now she just throws a batch into a bag and lets everyone have their morning meal in her minivan. "It's just like eating at home," she says -- though she admits it's undermining her lessons on table manners. "They just eat them with their fingers," says Mrs. Voltz.
