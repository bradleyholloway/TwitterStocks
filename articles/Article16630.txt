 Autodidact: In a Rare Bright Spot for GM, Its Korean Unit Is on a Tear; Daewoo Makes Cars Quickly And Has Low Labor Costs; The Antithesis of Detroit; Managers Scrounge Furniture   By Chon, Gina, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2006  GM, which owns 50.9% of GM Daewoo, has staked a big bet on the company. By the end of 2007, the U.S. giant will have invested about $3 billion in its Korean subsidiary and is hiring there while laying off workers in the U.S. GM is also trying to combine the expertise of both sides -- GM works better with computers and GM Daewoo is better with hardware and prototypes -- to develop vehicles even faster than GM Daewoo. GM Daewoo, a remnant of the now defunct Daewoo Group, a once-massive conglomerate, is the third largest Korean car maker behind Hyundai Motor Corp.'s Hyundai and Kia brands.  GM executives expect Asian auto sales to boom during the next decade, propelling growth they hope will keep GM ahead of archrival Toyota Motor Corp., currently the world's No. 2. Mr. [Nick Reilly] says GM Daewoo could effectively become GM's Asian arm. That would allow GM to think and behave like an Asian company, selling products designed for the local market rather than simply peddling U.S. models.  The Korean company isn't big enough to solve GM's woes and it could run into problems of its own. Like other Korean companies, it's suffering from the rising value of the Korean currency, the won. GM Daewoo has only a 10% market share in Korea, compared with the 30% it commanded during the 1990s. Moreover, GM Daewoo is exposed to its parent's uncertain future because it relies on GM's distribution network, especially for exports, which make up more than 80% of the Korean company's business.
