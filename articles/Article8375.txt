 The end of banking as we know it: Widening reach: Merrill Lynch, pushing into many new lines, expands bank services   By Siconolfi, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1993  With over $500 billion in client assets and 10 consecutive quarters of strong earnings, Merrill Lynch & Co. has penetrated almost all financial services sectors, proving that a firm can succeed via diversity and a wide product menu. Merrill uses its banking and nonbrokerage businesses as links to core brokerage operations. For example, its business lending unit serves as a vehicle whereby the firm can work to gain the asset management business of the client company and its executives. Merrill has endured unsuccessful ventures, continues to face stiff competition, and has suffered from internal conflicts. However, the brokerage firm has benefited from cost-cutting efforts, now covers 50% of fixed costs with recurring fees, and has developed a corporate culture that requires employees to sublimate their egos in favor of a company focus.
