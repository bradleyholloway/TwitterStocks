 IRS Chief Talks About Refunds And Rudeness   By By Rose Gutfeld, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs says taxpayers this year have continued the recent pattern of filing later and later, even if they are due refunds. He admits that his own return, which is being prepared professionally, probably won't be filed until tomorrow, the last day possible. An IRS spokeswoman says Mr. Gibbs generally owes a small amount or gets a small refund that he applies against next year's liability.  Still, despite the growing procrastination among taxpayers, Mr. Gibbs contends the IRS is experiencing one of the best filing seasons. Until this week's crunch the agency was issuing refunds in an average of four to five weeks. Through April 3, it had processed 47.45 million returns, up 3.2% from a year earlier, and had issued 37 million refunds totaling $29.8 billion, compared with 36.28 million totaling $28.7 billion at the same time last year. The agency had received 58.09 million returns, down 1.6% from a year earlier.  The IRS will start paying interest on late refunds May 30. Two years ago, computer foul-ups and staff reductions combined to produce unprecedented refund delays. Mr. Gibbs says just under 5% of all taxpayers generally request automatic four-month filing extensions, by filing Form 4868. If that rate increases, it would relieve the agency's processing crunch.
