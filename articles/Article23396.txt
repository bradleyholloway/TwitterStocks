 Starting Out: Law Prods Workers to Save   By Ransom, Diana, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  "They just take money out of my paycheck," says Ms. [Amy Kim]. "I honestly don't pay attention."  Those employees who don't wish to participate will typically have 90 days after the first day they contribute to back out and have any involuntary contributions returned penalty-free. "You have to opt out rather than opt in," which should get more younger workers in the plans, says Susan Hirshman, a wealth strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.  The new law also makes it less risky for employers to pick a reasonable, age-appropriate 401(k) investment for participants who don't make a choice themselves. In the past, many employers went with very conservative default choices, such as money-market funds and "stable value" portfolios, because they feared legal liability if the investment went down.
