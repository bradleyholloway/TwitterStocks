 Media: Japanese Film Sells in U.S., But as a Different Animal   By By Richard Turner, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1989  "The Adventures of Milo and Otis," a children's movie that is playing afternoons -- only on a paltry 239 screens, started as little more than a pet project at Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. A small but engaging Japanese movie about a cat and a dog, it was a film that studio executives took under their wings in their spare time, investing only a few million dollars. Careers didn't hang on it.  The movie germinated when well-known Japanese author Masanori Hata, who owns a huge ranch abounding with animals, made a series of nature films with Japan's biggest commercial TV network, Fujisankei's Fuji TV unit. The films were so successful that Fuji made "The Adventures of Chatran," a movie about a young cat who finds himself floating down a river in a box and spends nearly a year away from home, all the while pursued protectively by a pug dog.  Still, several studios sniffed at "Chatran" and several nibbled, including Columbia executive Robert Newmyer. He showed it to David Puttnam, then the newly installed head of Columbia, who gave it an immediate green light. Though other studios offered better terms, Columbia had the edge because the Japanese trusted Mr. Puttnam, who earlier had paired Fujisankei with "Chariots of Fire" composer Vangelis for "Antarctica."
