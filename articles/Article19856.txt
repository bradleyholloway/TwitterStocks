 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: House of the Week / Jamesian Style   By McMullen, Troy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2005  Due Diligence: This Colonial was built as a summer residence in 1881 for the writer Alice James, sister of Henry James and psychologist William James. Jacqueline Sohier, who along with her two brothers owns the home, says it's been in her family for three generations. Several of its 15 rooms are big enough to host large gatherings. Two sets of bay windows in the living room look directly onto the beach. Ownership includes rights to a deepwater dock.
