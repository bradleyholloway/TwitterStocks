 Panel Approves Some Charges For Texas Plant   By By Dianna Solis, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1988  A state agency representing consumers and small businesses has recommended that South Texas nuclear project owners be allowed to recover only about 58% of the plant's costs from ratepayers.  Citing enormous cost overruns and delays, the Office of Public Utility Counsel said Houston Lighting & Power Co. and Central Power & Light Co. should be denied recovering about 42% of the $10 billion the agency estimates the project has cost. The utilities, however, put the price tag at $5.3 billion. The Texas agency's recommendations came as part of a regulatory case involving a prudence review of the twin-unit nuclear project located about 90 miles southwest of Houston.  With nuclear plants costing multiples of their original estimates and sometimes producing unneeded power, state regulators are more frequently rejecting a once-undoubted maxim that utilities should earn a profit for all the money invested in building power plants for the public. The South Texas Project is now more than 500% overbudget from its 1973 estimate; Houston L&P attributes about three-fourths of the cost overruns to changes in nuclear safety requirements after the Three Mile Island debacle.
