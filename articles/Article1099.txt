 Love & Money: Readers on Engagement Rings and More   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  That's fine. But then there are situations such as the one that Kara Kelly Milner faced. Ms. Milner, of Bristol, R.I., proposed to her husband 11 years ago, giving him a nice watch as her version of the woman's diamond ring. During the engagement, the couple went to insure the watch as well as the engagement ring her husband-to-be had given to her. Their agent informed them, Ms. Milner says, "that until we were married, the ring belonged to David," her husband. "If either of us broke off the engagement, legally I had to return it to him.  He says he knew that if he sold the ring he'd take a loss, since the demand for used engagement rings isn't robust. "So," he says, "I demanded that my ex reimburse me for 50% of the loss. We haggled. She agreed."  "We named it 'Our Little Piece of Heaven,' because it is the one place where everyone goes and associates it with nothing but relaxation, fun, parties, family and friends," Ms. [Stephanie Godbout] says. "Our family goes there many times in the summer, on weekends and on vacation weeks. It's like we are in our own world."
