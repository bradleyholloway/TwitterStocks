 Thailand Emerges as Major Importer Of Cheap Labor From Nearby Countries   By By Nopporn Wong-Anan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1995  BANGKOK, Thailand -- Long known for exporting cheap labor to toil everywhere from Japan to Saudi Arabia, Thailand is emerging as a major importer of unskilled workers from neighboring countries.  As Thailand's affluence grows, its native work force has become both more expensive and less willing to take dirty or dangerous jobs. Workers from China, Burma and Cambodia are eagerly filling the gap. In doing so, they're helping keep Thailand's low-wage industries competitive.  Cheap immigrant labor is especially prevalent along Thailand's borders. In the southwest province of Ranong, along the Thai-Burmese border, between 30,000 and 50,000 Burmese laborers work among a native population of less than 150,000, says Manas Sukvanitvichai, secretary general of Ranong's chamber of commerce.
