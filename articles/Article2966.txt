 Deals & Deal Makers -- Carolina Group's Unusual IPO Warning: Bankruptcy Filing Is a Real Possibility   By By Raymond Hennessey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2002  The problem lies in the Engle decision, the tobacco class-action suit that resulted in about $145 billion of damages to be paid by the big tobacco companies. The decision is being appealed. Lorillard's share of that payout is $16.25 billion in punitive damages and $12.5 billion in compensatory damages, according to the registration statement for the Carolina IPO.  True, these kinds of judgments are reversed all the time. But even if the award isn't upheld, but is simply reduced, "the final judgment might ultimately exceed the assets of Lorillard and result in a liquidation or bankruptcy of Lorillard," Carolina said in its offering documents.
