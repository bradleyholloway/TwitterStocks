 Corporate Reforms Tamed Only Part Of 3-Headed Beast   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2003  Then, The Wall Street Journal revealed that MCI and Enron Corp., and possibly Qwest Communications International Inc. and HealthSouth Corp., are seeking refunds of taxes they supposedly paid on their exaggerated earnings. This, even though the Joint Tax Committee's Enron report showed conclusively that the same accountants who helped Enron flimflam shareholders also helped them flimflam the IRS.  As for tax refunds for Enron and MCI, those may be stopped by the IRS. Tax refunds for restated earnings can be justified, but the IRS will be under pressure to take a second look at some of the aggressive tax shelters these companies used. Moreover, any refund in excess of $2 million has to be reviewed by the Congressional Joint Tax Committee, which has spent much of the past year studying Enron's taxes.  The Finance Committee also is contemplating a measure to deal with companies like MCI and Enron that seek tax refunds as a result of the restatement of fraudulently reported income. The bill would authorize the government to go after the executives who participated in the fraud, and make them pay the refund cost.
