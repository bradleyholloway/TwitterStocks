 Blackstone Weighs Investment In Chinese Chemical Company   By Santini, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  Managers of private-equity funds in China say Blackstone may take a stake of between 20% and 40% in China National BlueStar Group. The fund managers put the value at about $400 million but don't indicate whether that points to the high or low end of the range.  That investment was widely seen as a bid by Beijing to gain a greater understanding of private equity, which has amassed huge sums of money and is aggressively hunting for opportunities in China. For Blackstone, the arrangement seemed to promise an edge on its rivals in pursuing deals in the country.
