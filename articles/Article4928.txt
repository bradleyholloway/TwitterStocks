 Macmillan Said to Seek KKR Bid; Maxwell Proposes to Raise Offer   By By Johnnie L. Roberts and Peter Norman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1988  Directors of embattled Macmillan Inc. met Saturday amid reports its management has enlisted Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. for a leveraged buy-out and after one unsolicited suitor, Robert Maxwell, proposed to raise his offer by $4, to $84 a share.  Separately, Robert M. Bass Group extended until Sept. 23 its $75-a-share, or $2 billion, offer for the 90.8% of Macmillan it doesn't already own. The offer was to have expired last Friday. Although the group's tender offer is lower than Mr. Maxwell's, the group is keeping it open while it evaluates its options.  Mr. Maxwell proposed the higher offer in a letter late Friday to Edward P. Evans, Macmillan's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Maxwell said the new offer would be conditional on the British firm's "receiving a clear understanding of which members of (Macmillan's) senior management will be staying and which will be leaving" if the Maxwell bid succeeds.
