 Poverty: The New Search for Solutions; Extra Credit: Poverty Program Gives Points to Do The Right Thing; Chicago Residents Get Rewards For Going to Work, School; 'A Piece of the Puzzle'; Saving Up for a PlayStation   By Eig, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2006  "It's a piece of the puzzle," says Crystal Palmer, a social worker with the nonprofit Near West Side Community Development Corporation, a partner in the Pathways to Rewards program. "The clients who are doing well [in Pathways] are the clients who are already motivated," says Vorricia Harvey, program director for the Near West Side CDC. "It's an incentive to say, you're doing well, keep it up."  This redevelopment, too, has been based on incentives: Those who paid rent consistently and complied with the terms of their leases have been invited to stay in the reshaped community, with its new playgrounds and flower beds. "I love the area now," says Sandra Shepard, 54, who pays $65 a month (30% of her monthly income, which comes from Social Security) for a two-bedroom apartment near the elevated train tracks. "It's different. It's spacious. We don't look so cluttered."  "We're saying, 'Look, every single person can make progress,' " says Toby Herr, executive director of Project Match, the nonprofit employment program that created the Pathways program. "We're asking you to tell us what you're good at and offer you a broad enough array of goals so you can keep succeeding. Then we'll keep upping the ante."
