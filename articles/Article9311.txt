 Sony, Universal License Music to Yahoo!   By By Nick Wingfield and Jennifer Ordonez, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2001  Yahoo, Santa Clara, Calif., said it will make the Duet subscription-music service, a joint venture between Universal and Sony announced last year, available to visitors to the Yahoo Music part of its site. Although critical details about Duet still need to be resolved, such as how much consumers will be charged for it and which software technologies will deliver the music to their computers, the service is supposed to be available this summer for anyone willing to pay a monthly fee.  Both Yahoo and Duet say the deal, terms of which weren't announced, is nonexclusive, meaning Duet will license its service to other Web sites as well as seek to add music from other record companies. Likewise, Yahoo executives said they are independently talking to other companies about expanding the music available on its site.  Internet companies such as Yahoo, meanwhile, are under intense pressure to reduce their reliance on advertising revenue. Ellen Siminoff, senior vice president of Yahoo small business and entertainment, said Yahoo would receive an undisclosed portion of the monthly subscription fees Yahoo users pay for Duet.
