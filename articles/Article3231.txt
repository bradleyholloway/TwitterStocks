 Founding Father of the Glass Armonica   By Miniter, Brendan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  [Benjamin Franklin] spent much of the American Revolution as a diplomat in France and often played his instrument for parlor audiences. Soon Europeans fell in love with it and began building their own. One story has Franklin curing Polish Princess Izabella Czartoryska of "melancholia" by playing the armonica for her. She liked it so much he gave her lessons. Marie Antoinette is said to have studied the instrument. Mozart and his father, Leopold, heard the armonica in Vienna in the 1770s. Wolfgang "has played upon it," Leopold wrote his wife. "How I should love to have one." And in 1791, the younger Mozart composed an Adagio for the armonica solo and the Adagio and Rondo for the armonica, flute, oboe, viola and cello.  Not that he isn't enamored with the armonica's history and inventor: "I just have this vision of, after a hard day of being a Founding Father, Franklin coming in and unwinding with the armonica, which he invented, sitting next to the Franklin stove, which he invented, using bifocals, which he invented." Mr. [William Wilde Zeitler] says he used to just play, but the audience would always stop him and demand, "You really have to tell us about this thing."
