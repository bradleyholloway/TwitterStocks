 Commodities Report: CME Alters Governance in Step That May Help Avert Criticism   By McKay, Peter A, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2003  The "Merc," a subsidiary of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc., said it is forming a new "market regulation oversight committee" on its board. The new committee will be made up of independent directors who will conduct an annual review of the CME's in-house regulation of trading in futures pegged to the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index, and pork bellies, foreign currencies and other assets.  Terrence A. Duffy, the CME's chairman, said his exchange is in a "gradual process" of improving its governance, and that the latest changes weren't prompted by turmoil at the Big Board or other industry trends.  Mr. Duffy and other Merc officials have often said in recent months that, given the complexity of futures markets, they must balance independence against the expertise of directors who are traders. "We're just trying to do what's best for our shareholders," Mr. Duffy said. "Our governance committee has looked at this for about a year now, we've made our statement, and we'll work toward fulfilling these goals. But there may be more changes later."
