SAN FRANCISCO, April 2â€” In a move that may give it access to a large part of the French electronics market, the Intel Corporation said today that it had agreed to form a joint venture with Matra-Harris Semiconducteurs, a French concern.  Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is a leader in the design and manufacture of NMOS, or N-Channel metal-oxide semiconductors, used in microcomputers and memory storage devices. Under terms of its agreement, it said it would provide its technology to Matra-Harris in establishing a French center for semiconductor design.  ''The French market is substantial, and Intel's obvious objective here is to penetrate that market,'' said James R. Berdell, a semiconductor industry analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. here.  An Intel spokesman, James Jarrett, said that the joint venture was for the design of semiconductors only and that no French manufacturing facility was being contemplated. He said Matra-Harris would hold a 51 percent interest in the new design center, and that Intel would hold a 49 percent interest.  Mr. Jarrett called Intel's cash commitment to the joint venture ''very small.'' He added, ''The investment we're making is basically in technology and not in cash.'' He declined to say how much Matra's investment would amount to. Government Clearance  The spokesmann remarked that a key consideration in Intel's decision to enter the venture was that it would give his company's products French Government clearance to be sold to the French telecommunications industry. The French Government, which operates a large part of that country's telephone industry, has a policy of buying equipment only from companies in which French shareholders have a majority interest.  ''What it means is that we can design semiconductors in France, manufacture them in California, and then sell them to the French telecommunications industry,'' Mr. Jarrett said. He added that the French telephone system would undergo a rapid modernization, and that there would be a large demand for state-of-the-art semiconductor products in that country.  In addition to the telecommunications industry, Intel said that the semiconductors, or fingernail-sized integrated circuits, that are designed in its joint venture would be marketed in the European automotive and data communications industries.  Matra-Harris, which operates an integrated circuit manufacturing plant in Meantes, France, is a joint-venture company in which a 49 percent interest is held by the Harris Corporation, another United States company engaged in manufacturing integrated circuits and information processing equipment. The majority share of the French company is held by Matra.  Intel said its joint venture would also give it access to tooling for the manufacture of CMOS, or complimentary metal oxide semiconductors, used in low power memory devices, usually batteryoperated.. Harris, which is based in Florida, is considered a leader in CMOS technology, a field that Intel has not in the past entered aggressively. Access to Harris Technology  One analyst, Thomas Kurlak, a vice president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., in New York, said that ''over the long run, this deal may also give Intel access to Harris's CMOS technology, and that may be a factor nearly as important as its move into France.''  Intel, which reported a net income of $96.7 million on sales of $854.5 million in 1980, showed a softening of its sales during the fourth quarter. Its net income for the fourth quarter of 1980 edged down to $22.8 million, from $23 million in the comparable 1979 period.  Like other semiconductor manufacturers, most of which experienced a similar decline in sales, Intel attributed the slowdown to high interest rates here and abroad and to a sharp reduction in prices on some of its products.
