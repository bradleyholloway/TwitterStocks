 Gillette Unveils Disposable Razor In Bid for Bigger Slice of Market   By By Charles Forelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2002  Disposables have been a relatively rough patch for Gillette. While the Boston concern's refillable-cartridge-system razors control more than three-quarters of their market, Gillette has a comparatively moderate 43% of the disposable arena, according to figures from Information Resources Inc., whose data don't include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. locations. Societe Bic SA and Pfizer Inc.'s Schick-Wilkinson Sword unit together hold nearly all the rest. The mass-market stores, supermarkets and drugstores IRI surveys sell about $400 million in disposables a year.
