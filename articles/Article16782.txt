 Consumers May Get Caught in Piracy War; Strategy to Thwart Movie Copying Could Frustrate Innocent Users   By Winstein, Keith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  High-definition DVDs were first rolled out last year.

By April, the industry was issuing its new key-revocation DVDs to thwart the hackers, in titles such as "The Nutty Professor" and "Matrix Reloaded."  Technology blogger Cory Doctorow, who opposes key-revocation restrictions, says that the self-destruct signal will frustrate honest consumers and push them toward bootlegs when they find that their legitimate DVDs won't play. "At the end of the day, this stuff is being engineered to fail, and that's not good engineering," Mr. Doctorow says. "Do you want to buy a product whose designers intend that sometimes it mysteriously stops working?"  "We don't at all deny that there's a cat-and-mouse game," says Mr. [Michael Ayers]. "We are fully expecting that we will have to deal with this again and again."
