 Stocks Meander in a Narrow Range, End Slightly Higher in Listless Trading   By By Sonja Steptoe, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1989  Investors showed so little interest in either buying or selling stocks on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market that the Nasdaq Composite Index meandered within a narrow range and finished only a bit higher.  Jeremiah Mullins, head OTC trader at Dean Witter Reynolds, said that even though the OTC market weakened by the end of the session, trading volume in declining stocks was light. Among the 1,017 declining OTC issues, volume totaled only 35.2 million shares. That compared with total volume of 44.7 million shares in the 887 issues that gained ground.  But he and other OTC traders continue to be troubled that individual investors haven't re-embraced stocks. As a result, he said, the OTC market hasn't participated in the market's recovery since 1987. "The public plays our market," Mr. Mullins said. "We're the first market they (deserted); and they haven't come back." He also believes the current controversy over program trading is keeping individuals from directly investing in stocks.
