 The Expat Life: Encountering Danger, Way Off the Beaten Path Online edition  By Paul, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2007  China's vast, often beautiful interior is far wilder. It feels totally unregulated and often extremely primitive, with vast stretches of dirt roads and outhouses that are just wooden slats atop small ravines. It's a side of the country that short-term visitors rarely see, but Rebecca's parents, sister and aunt now know well, thanks to a recent trip we took to Sichuan province.  I made it clear that I was angry but didn't press the issue because we had no other options and I didn't want to panic the kids. Mercifully, they remained extraordinarily well-behaved, thanks to my mother-in-law's heretofore-unknown storytelling prowess. Her wonderfully rich half-hour versions of several classic fairy tales kept the kids -- and even me -- calm and focused.  I'm still not sure where the whole experience leaves me. Trips to remote Guizhou and Yunnan are among my favorite China experiences, and both had their hairy moments. We also loved much of this trip, including the panda bears we finally visited. We're not ready to give up on venturing off the beaten path, but I'm not sure what steps I can take to assure our safety other than to be very careful about whom we choose to guide us, and asking a lot of questions before agreeing to any itinerary.
