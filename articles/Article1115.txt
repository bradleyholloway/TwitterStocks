 California Emissions Target Hands Task to Industry   By Ball, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2007  Central to California's plan is the creation of a market in which fuel producers can reduce their cost of compliance by buying and selling carbon "credits." Under the plan, transportation fuel sold in California will be subject to a ceiling on the amount of carbon it can emit per unit of energy it contains. The limit will take into account the carbon produced throughout the fuel's entire "life cycle": from the making of the fuel to its consumption in a car or truck.  Oil producers Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips expressed support for the broad intent of the new California rule. The industry increasingly has concluded it will get slapped with some sort of carbon cap, and, based on the broad outlines it has seen so far, it thinks California's approach is as flexible an offer as the industry's likely to get. "The good news is it's not picking winners and losers," says Joe Sparano, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, the oil industry's Sacramento-based trade group. The group itself hasn't taken a position.  General Motors Corp. hasn't taken an official position on the California low-carbon-fuel rule, said David Barthmuss, a GM spokesman. But, he noted, when Gov. [Arnold Schwarzenegger]'s office asked GM what the auto maker thought about the fuels rule, "we told them we think fuels like this are very important to the vehicles and technologies we're putting on the road right now."
