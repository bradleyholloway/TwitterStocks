 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Tastings: A Sun-Baked Treat for Winter Nights; Our Quest for Comfort Wine Leads Us to Cote-Rotie; The Virtues of Restraint   By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2006  It's a remarkable wine. It's primarily made from Syrah grapes, but sometimes winemakers add some aromatic Viognier, which contributes in part to Cote-Rotie's very fragrant nose. Cote-Rotie means "roasted slope" -- its grapes are grown on sun-baked hills -- and these dark wines do indeed have hints of roasted fruit, blackberries, earth and lemony acidity, sometimes along with pepper and smoke.  Guigal was impressive as always. And, as always, we liked a Cote- Rotie called Saint Cosme that is less widely available than some others (though we did buy it in stores in Texas, New Jersey and New York). In the long run, our favorite stood out, even with the first whiff. "Nose promises structure," we wrote. "Wow. It's big, but structured, with layers of taste. Raisins, herbs and earth. So very clean. Some dried blue flowers and tea. Real brightness. Quite polished. It's like it's wearing a tie." This elegant Cote-Rotie turned out to be Tardieu-Laurent 2001, and it cost $69.45 at a store in Texas.
