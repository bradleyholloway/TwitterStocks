 Hot Seats: Board Members Draw Fire, and Some Think Twice About Serving --- Fending Off Takeovers, Suits Is Stressful and Expensive; A Plum Becomes a Lemon --- Federal Marshal at the Door   By By Amanda Bennett, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1986  William May, the retired chairman of American Can Co., recalls a time early in his career when corporate-board meetings were pleasant, low-key affairs. "We'd combine meetings with lunch and a glass of sherry, or maybe something stronger," says Mr. May, who has sat on about a dozen boards over the past three decades. "The chairman would describe what had happened, give some numbers and a projection, and we'd all go home."  In recent years, Mr. May, like many other directors, has been swept up in some pretty complicated and distasteful situations. At American Can, he had to deal with corporate raider Carl Icahn, who acquired 4.9% of the company's stock in 1982. To prevent a takeover, American Can bought Mr. Icahn's holdings for $33.1 million, $7.5 million more than their market value. As a director of Manville Corp., Mr. May helped take the company into bankruptcy proceedings in the face of mounting asbestos-related health claims, and he had to defend himself against shareholder suits. "It took a lot of hours out of my life that I could have spent much more profitably and enjoyably," he says of his boardroom travail. Now, he says, "I'd think four or five times" before joining another board.  No one is saying that board seats are actually going begging. Nor does there yet seem to be any wholesale flight from the board room. Money and prestige still attach to directorships of big corporations, and some directors say that recent corporate crises have encouraged a let's-get-down-to-business attitude that they find praiseworthy. Many directors seem to face the difficulties of board membership with aplomb.
