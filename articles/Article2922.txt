 Amtran Posts Profit as Vanguard's Loss Narrows, Both Aided by Airline Bailout   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2001  Before Sept. 11, the carrier had expected to record several items related to the planned privatization of the company and the retirement of older planes. Afterward, the company incurred other items and recorded a pretax gain of $62.6 million in the form of the government grant. Before all items and taxes, the company said it had a loss of $15.2 million in the quarter. The privatization was abandoned after lenders withdrew their financing following the terrorist attacks. Vanguard, a low-fare carrier based in Kansas City, Mo., said it posted a loss of $3.6 million, or nine cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.7 million, or 27 cents. Revenue fell 7.7% to $32.8 million from $35.5 million. The latest quarter included a gain of $2.3 million from the federal government.
