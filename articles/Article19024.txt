 ShowBiz Has Come Out of Hole, But There's Still Time for a Nibble   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1998  Is it too late to get a piece of the ShowBiz pie? Hardly, say some fans. Given the company's turnaround strategy and the state of the industry, they say, there's room for the shares to grow even higher. ShowBiz "is substantially undervalued relative to its growth rate, and its prospects going forward," says Dennis Telzrow, an analyst at Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas.  Indeed, ShowBiz trades at just 22 times its 1997 per-share earnings, which at $1.34 were 91% higher than a year earlier. And, going forward, Mr. Telzrow believes earnings will continue growing at nearly 25% annually. For 1998, Mr. Telzrow expects the company to post per-share earnings of $1.65 a share, which would be a 24% increase, while he says $2 a share looks like a conservative estimate for 1999. He rates ShowBiz a "buy" with a price target of $42.  ShowBiz also won customers from Discovery Zone outlets, many of them opened in the early 1990s in the same strip malls where ShowBiz was located, by giving kids more fun for their money. While Discovery Zone charged customers to enter its playgrounds, ShowBiz let children at its restaurants crawl around free in newly installed SkyTubes -- brightly colored plastic tubes and tunnels that weave through the restaurant hanging from the ceiling.
