 Journal Exchange -- The Informed Reader: Insights and Items of Interest From Other Sources   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2007  To find out, Ken Silverstein of Harper's posed as the representative of the fictitious "Maldon Group," a firm that had a financial stake in improving the image of Turkmenistan. Foreign governments often turn to lobbying firms to advance their interests in the U.S. capital. Lobbyists can be a "crucial conduit," Mr. Silverstein writes, for regimes whose human-rights records or corrupt practices post public- relations problems. Scant disclosure rules make it hard to find out what lobbyists do on behalf of foreign governments.  APCO recommended holding forums for journalists, academics and politicians, hosted by a third party, where a Turkmen politician could give a speech. To avoid the feel of a paid advertisement, the lobby firm suggested possible names for the forum such as "Energy Security" or "Caspian Basin Pipelines."  Harper's editor Roger Hodge says the magazine didn't seek comment from the lobbying firms prior to publication or inform them about Mr. Silverstein's true identity. Mr. Hodge says one of the firms, APCO, contacted the magazine to express disappointment with the article.
