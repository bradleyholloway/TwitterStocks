 MCA May Develop Proposed Project Dropped by Disney   By By Kathleen A. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1988  MCA Inc. said it is considering taking over the development of an entertainment and shopping complex in the heart of Burbank, Calif.  Last week, Walt Disney Co. said it abandoned plans for the development of the complex because the project couldn't be justified financially. The Burbank complex was to be called the Disney-MGM Studio Backlot and was expected to cost $150 million to $300 million.  MCA has its own studio tour and entertainment complex in nearby Universal City. Both Disney and MCA are building rival studio tour attractions in central Florida, and MCA had sued the Burbank city agency responsible for the project in an effort to block Disney's earlier plans for the development.
