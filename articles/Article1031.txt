 Despite All the Hype, Getting Your Software On the Web Has Limits   By Gomes, Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2006  The poster child for SAAS is Salesforce.com, the San Francisco company that went public in June 2004 and now has a stock market valuation of nearly $4 billion on a lofty P/E ratio of 160. The company markets its approach with "No Software" buttons and emphasizes ease of use: Open a browser, and right away you can start tracking your sales staff and customers, the particular SAAS application that Salesforce.com offers.  LOOKED AT ONE WAY, it's evidence of a thriving "ecosystem" of products and services. But it also suggests that as SAAS companies grow to serve more users, they increasingly take on some of the complexity of the software approaches they are trying to replace. And for Salesforce.com specifically, a series of embarrassing outages on its servers that left some customers unable to work, including one last Thursday, haven't helped.  "At first, they were trying to differentiate themselves from others and said you didn't need an IT department," says Christian Aaselund, of Acetta, a Seattle-based consultancy. "But now that the platform is becoming more robust, you are starting to need those things again."
