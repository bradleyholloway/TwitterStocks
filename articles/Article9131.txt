 House Approves Insurance-Access Bill --- White House Talks of Veto, Criticizing the Method For Paying for the Plan   By By Shailagh Murray and Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1999  The House passed a $48.6 billion bill hailed by Republicans as a way to help the uninsured gain access to health insurance, but attacked by Democrats, including President Clinton, as an effort to kill comprehensive HMO reform.  Yesterday's action on the insurance-access bill heightened the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of today's vote on several HMO-reform proposals, including a sweeping bipartisan measure, sponsored by Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Charlie Norwood (R., Ga.) and backed by the White House. The bill would vastly expand consumers' ability to sue their health plans, and has been bitterly opposed by the managed-care and employer communities.  Republican leaders intend to pair the insurance-access bill with whichever HMO bill passes today when they send the legislation to conference with the Senate. But several Democrats strongly oppose much of the insurance-access bill, such as the expansion of medical-savings accounts, as well as the fact that the Republicans didn't provide a way to pay for it. "It's a $50 billion bill pulled out of the air," said Rep. Jim McDermott (D., Wash.).
