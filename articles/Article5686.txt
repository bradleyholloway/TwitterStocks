 Finance Stocks Give Up Advances; Yahoo!, CNET Fall in Carnage   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  BankAmerica got up more than two points, but closed 1/4 point lower at 59 3/4. Chase Manhattan closed 1 1/8 lower at 72. Citigroup fell 1 7/8 to 50 5/8. J.P. Morgan did end higher, up 1 1/4 at 100 1/2, but that marked a decline of nearly two points from its best levels of the session.  Internet-brokerage operations caught the worst of both worlds, with weakness in technology and banking. Ameritrade Holdings (Nasdaq) declined 14 15/16 to 65 1/16 and E*Trade Group (Nasdaq) lost 5 9/16 to 40 3/16.  Lycos fell 33 to 94 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after the company, which operates Internet sites, agreed to a takeover by USA Networks. The disappointment apparently stemmed from what investors saw as a relatively modest acquisition premium in the price of the takeover, which suggested subsequent deals for Internet concerns won't be done at dizzying prices.
