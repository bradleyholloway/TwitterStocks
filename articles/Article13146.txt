 Interpublic Officials Cite Gains In Company's Tone of Business; Top Executives Are Upbeat, But Are Short on Specifics Of Holding Firm's Rebound   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  "We are working as diligently as possible to become current with our filings as quickly as possible, but we cannot make any assurances on the timing at this point," Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call yesterday. "Given the complexity of the task at hand, the shortcomings we have disclosed in the control environment and the fact that we're in the initial stages of the process, it's difficult to identify a date for completing this process."  Indeed, one agency executive under the Interpublic umbrella experienced some fallout when Interpublic first disclosed its accounting issues several years ago. The executive's agency had won a new account, but the would-be client had reservations about the holding company, and eventually decided to send the business to a rival, this executive said. Interpublic's more recent troubles haven't had an effect at this particular Interpublic agency, this executive said.  Interpublic has other concerns. One of its biggest clients, General Motors, has put its large media-buying account into review. Interpublic has also lost valuable media business from Unilever and Nestle in the recent past. Such a backdrop could make other Interpublic media clients "sort of question why they are still here," said Alexia Quadrani, who follows the advertising industry for Bear Stearns. "That puts other relationships at risk." Mr. Roth said Interpublic is looking to improve its media operations and "beef up our talent."
