 Medicaid Programs Are Told to Pay For Viagra but Monitoring Continues   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  Federal health officials are notifying states that their Medicaid programs must pay for Viagra, but they may eventually drop the requirement if a new monitoring system shows the drug "is subject to clinical abuse or inappropriate use."  The new federal policy is outlined in a letter from Nancy-Ann DeParle, the administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, to Govs. Lawton Chiles of Florida and Michael Leavitt of Utah. Ms. DeParle's letter, which is to go to the governors today, is a response to a May letter from the governors in which they argued that the states should decide whether Medicaid covered the high-priced impotence drug.  Ms. DeParle told the governors that, with few exceptions, federal law requires that Medicaid, the state-federal health program for the poor and disabled, cover federally approved drugs prescribed for medically approved uses. But, she said, the law allows federal officials to exempt certain drugs after determining, based on evidence from the states, that the medications are being abused or improperly used.
