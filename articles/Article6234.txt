 FDA May Sue Rx Depot to Halt Sales of Canadian Drugs in U.S.   By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2003  In a letter sent to Rx Depot Inc., of Tulsa, Okla., the Justice Department said it was prepared to file a civil suit based on a request by the Food and Drug Administration. The letter says the company illegally imports U.S.-made and foreign, unapproved drugs into the U.S. from Canada.  Rx Depot President Carl Moore said he plans to fight the suit. "We're absolutely not shutting down," he said. He argues that his company's actions don't break the law, because individual consumers are faxing their own orders to Canadian pharmacies. "We're not doing anything illegal and we're going to prove it in a court of law."  Mr. Moore got a warning from the FDA last March. He says Rx Depot now includes 85 storefronts in 26 states, where U.S. consumers fax their prescriptions to four affiliated Canadian pharmacies. The pharmacies send them to Canadian doctors, who then send the drugs directly to the U.S. customers.
