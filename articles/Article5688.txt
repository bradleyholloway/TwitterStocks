 Flights on Nearly 75% of Major Routes Take Longer Than Those of Decade Ago   By By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  Flights on nearly three-quarters of major routes are taking longer than they did 10 years ago, spending more time in the air and on the tarmac, a Transportation Department report says.  The probe also examined how carriers report departure times and compile flight times between major airports. The investigators found that airlines, under pressure to boost on-time performance, are sending off many more flights before their scheduled departure times; in one case, a flight was more than 50 minutes ahead of schedule.  The report also faulted current government procedures for reporting departure times, which allow different carriers to use different measures. Investigators watched 794 planes departing, measuring the departure times against those reported. Also, two airlines, not named in the report, were exaggerating some departure times slightly; in one case, by as much as 10 minutes early, the report says.
