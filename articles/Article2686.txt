 World-wide: Bosnian and Croatian Serbs set up   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1995  Bosnian and Croatian Serbs have set up a joint defense council in a step toward greater military cooperation. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the move committed the two groups to come to each other's aid if attacked. Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic told a Kremlin envoy he can't accept a peace plan if UN sanctions stay in place.
