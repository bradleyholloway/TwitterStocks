A Colombian journalist held at a maximum-security jail after trying to enter the United States last month is a Cuban agent and member of a terrorist organization, a State Department official said in an interview broadcast last night.  The journalist, Patricia Lara, 35 years old, a reporter for the leading Colombian newspaper, El Tiempo, and a graduate of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, was detained Oct. 12 in New York.  She had come here for an awards presentation at Columbia.  Interviews with Ms. Lara and Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, were shown on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes.''  ''She is a member of the M-19 terrorist organization in Colombia.'' Mr. Abrams said. ''She is an active liaison between that terrorist organization, which is in the business of murdering people, and the Cuban secret police.''  Mr. Abrams said the United States had years of intelligence information on Ms. Lara.  Ms. Lara said she disavowed violence in politics and had never been a member of the Communist Party, M-19, or any other organization that advocates violence or the overthrow of government. She has written a book about M-19, a movement devoted to overthrowing the Colombian Government.  Asked about accusations that she is a Cuban agent, Ms. Lara said: ''I have many Cuban friends, as I have many American friends, many Mexican friends, many Panamanian friends, many French friends. But it doesn't mean that I work for them.''  She was held at the Metropolitan Correction Center and returned to Colombia five days later without being allowed to attend the awards ceremony.
