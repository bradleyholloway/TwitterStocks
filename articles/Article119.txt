-------------------------------------------------------------------- FRANCES FRANK MARCUS is a writer who lives in Louisiana. By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS  THE MIXTURE - Named by its French founders for a red stick, or post, that marked the boundary between the lands of two Indian tribes, Baton Rouge is a city of many parts. It is the Louisiana state capital; it is a port city strategically situated on the Mississippi River and in the Great Louisiana Oil Patch; it is a center for chemicals; it is the home of Louisiana State University and Southern University. It has a population of more than 250,000 and a skyline of banking and government towers. But underneath all this lives a small town with Southern embellishments: green gardens in the spring, the sweetly blooming magnolia and white-columned houses. The city is a comfortable headquarters for touring the plantation country and sampling Louisiana cooking.  WEATHER - Like New Orleans, Baton Rouge has a subtropical climate with mild winters and warm summers. The Gulf of Mexico is a tempering influence. The ideal time to visit is spring, which offers daytime temperatures in the 70's and evening temperatures in the 50's and 60's. By late June the warm weather begins in earnest with the average high 92 and the average low 73, a pattern that continues through July. January is the coldest month, with an average high of 62, the low averaging about 40. Because of its greater distance from the Gulf of Mexico, Baton Rouge is slightly less humid than New Orleans.  GETTING AROUND - Baton Rouge moves by private automobile. Public transportation is sparse. The carless visitor would do well to forget public buses and rent a car or rely on taxis. Yellow Cab (504-926-6400) charges $1.55 for the first half mile and $1 a mile thereafter, and provides 24-hour service. The major hotels provide free airport transportation. Ryan Airport is about 15 minutes from downtown. The cab fare from the airport to dowtown is about $9.50 for one or two people, $4 each for three or more. Airport Limousine Service (504-356-4343) charges $5 a person. Many of the city's landmarks are downtown and within walking distance of the Gothicstyle Old State Capitol, which stands on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi. The place to begin a tour is at the building's information center. The Old Capitol is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday to Saturday and from 1 to 5 P.M. on Sunday.  The easiest way to see the city is to book a seat in a Louisiana Lagniappe Tours air-conditioned van. The company (504-387-2464) offers a two-hour city tour, 10 A.M. to noon, at $8 for adults and $5 for children. There is also a four-hour plantation country tour, 1:30 to 5:30 P.M. The price is $20 for adults and $15 for children.  RIVERSIDE - In recent years there has been extensive riverside development. Part of it is the Louisiana Arts and Science Center, which has an exhibit showing the river's many changes as well as paintings, sculpture, a restored train and an Acadian house. It is in the old Illinois Central train station and is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday and 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday. Free.  Beside the Arts and Science Center is the Mississippi River observation deck, which connects with a walkway over the River Road leading to the Riverside Centroplex, the new convention center.  A short walk away, the Arts and Science Center planetarium has shows at 2:30 P.M. Tuesday to Friday, 3:30 P.M. Saturday and 2:30 and 3:30 P.M. Sunday in June, July and August, and the rest of the year at 3:30 P.M. Saturday, 2:30 and 3:30 P.M. Sunday. Adults' admission price is $1, and 50 cents for those under 18.  Also nearby is the Old Governor's Mansion, which has been restored to the period of the 1930's when it was built for Gov. Huey Long. It has the furnishings and memorabilia of former governors. Hours are the same as the Arts and Science Center. Free.  STATE CAPITOL - The 34-story Art Deco State Capitol looms over the Baton Rouge skyline, a reminder of the glory days of its creator, Governor Long, who was assassinated in the Capitol in 1935. Elevators rise to the Observation Tower on the 27th floor. The Capitol and observation deck are open from 8 A.M. to 4:15 P.M. daily. A statue of Long stands over his grave in a 27-acre garden in front of the Capitol.  The Old Arsenal Museum, just east of the Capitol, is a restored 19th-century arsenal with exhibits of Louisiana history. It is open from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Wednesday to Monday. Free.  PLANTATIONS - Plantations may be seen in and around the city. Among them is the official residence of Gov. David C. Treen and his family, built in 1963 in the grand style of an archetypal Louisiana country manor. The house is open to tours from 9 to 11 A.M. and from 2 to 4 P.M. Monday to Friday by appointment (504-342-5855). Free.  Magnolia Mound Plantation House at 2161 Nicholson Drive, believed to have been built in 1791, is one of the oldest wooden houses in the state. Tours are conducted from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday and from 1 to 4 P.M. Sunday. Adults pay $2, students 75 cents, children under 12, 50 cents. 1 2 3 NEXT PAGE >
