 Stem-Cell Compromise   By John T. Gill and Pete Sessions, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  The Senate recently passed two bills on this issue. One would open many viable but unused embryos for research and federal funding, but will draw a Bush veto. The other would allow funding for research on stem cells from "naturally dead" embryos, but scientists question if this will supply the needed stem cells. As Congress debates this issue, one has to ask, "Could there be a middle ground that would give the scientists the stem cells they need and at the same time not violate the sanctity of life?"  In most IVF labs, the embryos will be allowed to grow in culture for five days. By day two there will be two to four cells, five to eight cells by day three, day four 12-16 cells or "morula stage," and by day five 32-100 cells or "blastocyst stage." Ultimately, only 20%-40% of these embryos will grow to this blastocyst stage. The best will be chosen for implantation and others frozen for potential implantation at a later date. Some embryos, however, are not suitable for implantation or freezing. They may offer the middle ground.  In like fashion, the "organs" of these defective, nonviable embryos could be donated. Whether one asserts that life begins at the union of egg and sperm or not, the belief is not violated by this proposal. This once viable, living, one-celled zygote embryo has, through the course of natural events, become nonviable just like the organ donor. Could then the "parents" of these nonviable embryos, which can neither be implanted nor frozen and thus never become a living human being, elect to donate the "organs," or cells, of these embryos? If you believe in organ donation as an ethical practice, you would have to say "yes."
