 SmartMoney: You Call That a Warranty?   By Mauldin, William, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2006  With Dell laptops selling for as little as $600, Dell has shortened its warranty to 90 days on some computers and shifted troubleshooting to phone reps around the globe. Often consumers must repair Dell computers themselves using parts that Dell mails out. Even laptop customers who shell out a little extra for the company's optional "at home" service plan still have to do the work themselves on parts Dell deems "easy to install." A Dell spokesman says customers seem to like the self-repair process: "If it's intimidating for you, we can have someone walk you through it on the phone."
