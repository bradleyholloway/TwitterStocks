 Entertainment -- The Weekend Adviser: Networks Hope January Is TV's Coolest Month; NFL Playoff Matchups, New Fiction From India; Posthumous Nina Simone   By Schechner, Sam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2006  This year, several established series -- such as "24" and "Scrubs" -- have had or are planning splashy January premieres. Channels up and down the dial are betting big on new shows, too. AMC, a station known for airing old movies, is launching its first original drama series, "Hustle," this week, while CBS has been promoting its new hourlong dramatic comedy "Love Monkey" for weeks. Based on a 2004 novel, "Love Monkey" stars a record company scout (Tom Cavanagh) searching for romance in New York City.  The new sitcom "Crumbs," which debuts on ABC tonight, stars former child star Fred Savage as a failed Hollywood screenwriter who returns home to spring his mother out of a psychiatric institution and to help his estranged brother run a restaurant. "Crumbs" has been getting some good reviews for its off-beat humor. ("Crumbs" premieres tonight, 9:30 p.m. EST, ABC; "Hustle" premieres Saturday, 10 p.m. EST, AMC; "24" premieres Sunday, 8 p.m. EST, Fox)  Now add incendiary. A new compilation coming out Tuesday draws together some of Ms. [Nina Simone]'s most political tracks from the civil- rights era. "Forever Young, Gifted & Black: Songs of Freedom and Spirit" includes both a studio and a live version of "To Be Young, Gifted and Black," which became something of a black-pride anthem, and "Mississippi Goddam," which she wrote in response to the murders and church bombings.
