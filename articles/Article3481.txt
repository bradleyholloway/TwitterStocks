 America West Says Its Cash Position Is Shrinking Fast   By By Melanie Trottman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2001  Mr. [W. Douglas Parker] said the airline is working with vendors to await payment until the government makes a decision on help, and has deferred all capital spending. The airline has only about $200 million of book debt, he said, because it leases the vast majority of its airplanes. Hefty lease payments are due in July and January, he said.  Morgan Stanley airline analyst Kevin Murphy said he believes America West is one of the carriers most imperiled by the devastating downturn in travel following last week's terrorist hijackings. UBS Warburg analyst Sam Buttrick downgraded America West to "hold" from "strong buy," citing risks that were "just too high."
