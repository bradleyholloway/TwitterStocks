 These Two Laptops Are Small and Sleek, But Come With Flaws   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2007  The Dell XPS M1330, while still relatively small, is larger than the Toshiba. It weighs a hair under four pounds, has a larger footprint and is thicker. It falls into a hot new laptop category that features 13.3-inch widescreen displays -- a size considered a good compromise between the small displays on the lightest laptops and the larger ones on the heavier models. The M1330 has some very un-Dell-like aspects to it, such as a choice of three lid colors and a slot-loading DVD drive that doesn't require a pop-out tray.  The Toshiba starts at $1,999 for a unit with a 120 gigabyte hard disk, a gigabyte of memory, and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless networking. The Dell starts at $1,299 for a model with a 120 gigabyte hard disk, a gigabyte of memory, built-in Wi-Fi (but not Bluetooth) and standard display. An LED display costs $150 more; Bluetooth is an extra $20.  Like the Toshiba, the Dell speedily handled Microsoft Office, Firefox, iTunes and other software. Its Wi-Fi worked very well. My test model used Vista, and had the extra memory and souped-up graphics Vista needs to work well. The M1330 isn't available with Windows XP. To Dell's credit, it can be ordered with no craplets on it, for no extra money. But because it uses Vista, it starts up painfully slowly. A reboot took more than four minutes.
