 Medicine's 'Magic Bullets' Add A New Dimension to Imaging   By By Wendy L. Wall, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1987  Now, a handful of companies are finding ways around these problems, and the first wave of monoclonal imaging products soon may reach the U.S. market. One company is already selling such a product in Europe, and at least two are in the final phase of U.S. clinical trials. A drug reviewer at the Food and Drug Administration says chances are good that at least one monoclonal antibody imaging product will be available in the U.S. within two years.  ONE LIKELY CANDIDATE is Myoscint, a monoclonal antibody developed by Centocor of Malvern, Pa., to gauge the severity of a heart attack. Myoscint zeroes in on cardiac myosin, a substance in heart muscle that is released when cells rupture during a heart attack. The isotope-tagged antibody gives doctors a detailed map of dead heart tissue less than 24 hours after it is injected into a patient's bloodstream.  Some cardiac cells are unique. Developing imaging products for cancer cells, which generally vary only slightly from other human tissues, is more difficult, but some companies are making progress there, too. NeoRx Corp. of Seattle is in the final stages of clinical testing on an antibody that detects melanoma, a virulent skin cancer that spreads rapidly throughout the body. NeoRx says its antibody binds to more than 90% of all melanomas, while creating little background noise: the kidneys, where melanoma seldom spreads, are the only other tissues that absorb the antibody.
