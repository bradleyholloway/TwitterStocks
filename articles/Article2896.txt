 Time Off: A Week of Diversions   By By Stuart Ferguson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2001  Chesterwood was the Berkshires summer home of sculptor [Daniel Chester French] (1850-1931), best known for the presidential portrait in the Lincoln Memorial. A converted 19th-century barn now holds "Daniel Chester French: Sculpting an American Vision," the recently opened, long-term exhibition on his role in the "American Renaissance." It recounts the sculptor's life, his creative process and the social context of his work in the years following the Civil War. Also on the grounds is "Contemporary Sculpture at Chesterwood 2001," a juried show of 43 outdoor works by 34 artists. Visitors will find Stanley Marcus's whimsical welded/cast aluminum and bronze "Baldheaded American Banking Eagle" and Susan Rodgers's "Tallgrass," an arrangement of 24-foot-high aluminum tubing, steel pipes and rods that shift in the wind.
