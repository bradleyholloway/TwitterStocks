PETER, PAUL & MARY'S 20th anniversary reunion at the Savoy on Wednesdayâ€” the opening concert of a four-night stand - offered no musical surprises. Their smooth, polite folk-pop style didn't significantly evolve after the mid-60's.  And at Wednesday's concert, the arrangements for three voices, two acoustic guitars and a bass of such hits as ''Leaving on a Jet Plane,'' ''Day Is Done,'' and ''Puff the Magic Dragon'' were the same ones they have always used.  One was struck by the way three such modestly endowed talents could combine into an entity that was far more than the sum of its parts. Of the three, only Paul Stookey has real projection as a pop singer. Peter Yarrow's folk crooning is very limited in range, and all too often Mary Travers's hard, coarse alto sounds like Neil Sedaka gone flat. Yet when the three combine their very limited resources, music of considerable charm, albeit of a blandly homey sort, can result. Stephen Holden
