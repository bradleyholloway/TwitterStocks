 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review --- Lifetime Annuity Payments Shrink --- Some Holders Worry Income May Never Return to Levels Seen at Stock-Market Peak   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2003  The type of variable annuity purchased by Mr. [Frank LoVerde] is called an "immediate," or "payout," annuity. A buyer of one of these contracts pays a lump sum of money and receives in exchange a series of periodic annuity payments that begin right away and continue for the lifetime of the individual or the individual and spouse. (Investors can also choose to annuitize the money they have been accumulating for retirement in a deferred annuity contract.)  The allocation of one's immediate-annuity portfolio is only one factor determining the degree to which payments rise or fall over time. Another key determinant is an easily misunderstood aspect of immediate variable-annuity contracts -- the assumed annual investment return. At Fidelity, for instance, immediate-annuity buyers select a so-called benchmark rate of 3.5%, 5% or 7%.  While it might seem otherwise, the choice of the assumed rate generally doesn't increase or decrease the total payments to an annuity buyer, says Robert Nestor, a principal and head of annuity and insurance services at Vanguard Group. (Vanguard is planning to introduce an immediate variable annuity later this year.) If a person lives to life expectancy, the present value of the annuity income should be the same whatever the assumed rate the investor selected, Mr. Nestor explains.
