 Congress Approves $60 Billion Farm Bill --- But Democrats Show They Have Votes to Sustain Clinton Veto Over Aid   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1998  Congress approved a $60 billion agriculture spending bill, but not before Senate Democrats demonstrated they have the votes to sustain a promised veto by President Clinton over the level of aid for cash-strapped farmers this fall.  In a show of solidarity with Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D., S.D.), 38 Democrats opposed passage, four more than needed to sustain a veto. Five Republicans also voted "no." The final margin of approval, 55-43, was the closest in many years for the popular annual agriculture budget bill and testifies to the severity of the U.S. farm crisis caused by low commodity prices and bad weather.  Attached to the measure is $4.2 billion in emergency aid, but Democrats want at least $3 billion more, as well as provisions to force major packers like ConAgra Inc. and IBP Inc. to better disclose prices paid on cattle. Mr. Daschle, running for re-election in South Dakota, personifies the fight. He won from Mr. Clinton the promise to veto the bill and has begun to build alliances with Western Republicans whose own ranchers are demanding mandatory reporting of cattle prices paid by the heavily consolidated industry.
