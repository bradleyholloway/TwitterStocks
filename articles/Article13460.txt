 Beazer's Woes Continue to Mount; Home Builder Predicts Charges of $230 Million, Unveils More Cost Cutting   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  Beazer previously disclosed that its former chief accounting officer may have inflated reserves and other accrued liabilities in earlier periods. It also previously disclosed that it received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office in the Western District of North Carolina, seeking the production of documents focusing on the company's mortgage-origination services. The Securities and Exchange Commission has started a formal investigation of Beazer to determine whether any person or entity related to the company violated federal securities laws. The company has said it is cooperating with the inquiries.  Last month, Beazer said it will restate financial statements for a three-year period after an internal probe found its mortgage- origination unit violated federal lending rules. The company has said the cumulative effect of its restatements likely will be an increase in profit, though it can't say exactly how much. It said the restatement won't cause an adjustment to the company's current cash position.
