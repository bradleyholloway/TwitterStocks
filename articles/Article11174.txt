 Williams & Connolly Ends Work for Two Tied to Drexel Inquiry   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1988  Following the filing of civil securities-fraud charges against Mr. Milken, Florida financier Victor Posner and others, Williams & Connolly partner Vincent Fuller indicated that the firm was looking at which clients it should continue to represent. Because of the potential for conflict of interest, it is unusual for one law firm to represent multiple defendants in a case, especially one as volatile as Drexel's.  This volatility was evident when, as previously reported, James Dahl, a key aide to Mr. Milken and a former Williams & Connolly client, decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Mr. Dahl, who wasn't named in the civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, was sent a letter in September from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office notifying him that he might be indicted in the Drexel case. Mr. Dahl recently switched his defense to New York's Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler.
