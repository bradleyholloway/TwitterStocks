 Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis: Before You Drive That Hot ETF...; They're spiffy and alluring, but an owner's manual is essential for novices   By Laise, Eleanor, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2007  Amvescap PLC's PowerShares Capital Management unit, one fast-growing ETF provider, charges 0.60% for most of its industry-focused ETFs, including PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio, PowerShares Dynamic Energy Sector Portfolio and PowerShares Water Resources Portfolio. XShares Group LLC's HealthShares lineup of health-care and biotechnology ETFs costs 0.75%. At the higher end, charging 0.95%, are some leveraged ETFs and those that make bearish bets against stocks, including ProShare Advisors LLC's Ultra S&P 500 ProShares and Short S&P500 ProShares.  The ProShare ETFs, many of which aim to deliver double an index's performance on a daily basis, are more expensive because they "require a specialized level of knowledge and skills to run," says Michael Sapir, chairman and chief executive of ProShare Advisors. He adds that the ETFs are cheaper than comparable mutual funds. Jeff Feldman, chairman of XShares Group, says the HealthShares ETFs, which are composed largely of smaller companies, are "more difficult to put together," and the funds' relatively small size means that their asset-based expenses will be higher.  Among U.S. stock ETFs, for example, the fund with the biggest spread in the six months ended April 30 was First Trust Portfolios LP's First Trust DB Strategic Value Index, according to XTF Global Asset Management, which tracks, rates and builds portfolios of ETFs. That fund, which tracks the obscure Deutsche Bank CROCI US+ Index, a benchmark composed of large-cap U.S. stocks, had an average spread of 0.64% of its share price, or roughly 16 cents, based on the fund's recent $25 share price. That means that, on top of the fund's 0.65% expense ratio and the brokerage commission paid to buy and sell, an investor trading the fund at typical market prices over that period may have sacrificed an additional 0.64% of his or her investment to trading costs.
