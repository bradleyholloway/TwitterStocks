 Hillary and Us   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2003  The [Ken Starr] report concludes that Mr. Foster "was involved in work related to a number of important and difficult issues," including controversial appointments and "litigation related to the Health Care Task Force; the dismissal of White House Travel Office employees and the ensuing fallout from that incident; the Clintons' tax returns (which involved an issue regarding treatment of the Clintons' 1992 sale of their interest in Whitewater); the Clintons' blind trust; liaison with the White House Usher's office over issues related to the White House Residence; and issues related to the Freedom of Information Act." Other living historians might recall that most of those controversies involved Mrs. [Hillary Rodham Clinton].  We'd just as soon move past the Clinton years, but if its partisans are going to rewrite history, someone has to keep track of the billing records. Now Senator Clinton has Presidential ambitions, and her memoir is being portrayed as an attempt to clear away the 1990s for her White House run. If she really wants to be trusted in the future, she could start by being more honest about the past.
