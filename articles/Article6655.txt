 Divine Inspiration: Seminary Article In Alabama Sparks Tax-Code Revolt --- A Methodist Lawyer's Thesis Cites `Christian Duty' To Back Fairer System --- Evangelicals Rally to Cause   By By Shailagh Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2003  Her paper, published last month in the Alabama Law Review, has been cited by influential Alabamans in business and the state house, including the recently elected Republican governor, Bob Riley. It has also brought some of the most powerful of Alabama's 8,000 churches into the fray, with pastors culling from the article to preach about the Christian duty to demand a tax code that falls more evenly on rich and poor. Recently, the paper has been condensed into a brochure titled, "The Least of These," a reference to Jesus' teaching about helping the disadvantaged, and 10,000 copies are now being distributed to churches statewide by Samford University, where Ms. [Susan Pace Hamill] attended divinity school.  As a traditional Methodist, Ms. Hamill at first felt like an outsider among Alabama's large evangelical Christian population. She decided to immerse herself in the study of evangelical Christianity during a sabbatical at Samford University's Beeson Divinity School in Birmingham. While there, she read a local newspaper explaining how Alabama taxes families of four with very low incomes. "I assumed the $4,600 figure was a misprint," she told a recent Kiwanis Club breakfast meeting in Tuscaloosa.  "What can I do to help?" he asked her. "Write an op-ed," Ms. Hamill replied. Mr. [Bob Montgomery]'s account of his conversion, headlined "What Would Jesus Do About Alabama's Tax System?" was published in late January in several Alabama newspapers.
