 Leading the News: Scrushy Remains Silent During SEC Grilling --- Ousted HealthSouth Chief Seeks Access to His Assets To Pay for Legal Costs   By By Carrick Mollenkamp and Ann Carrns, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  During a daylong court hearing to determine if Mr. [Richard M. Scrushy] can regain access to his bank accounts and a large collection of real estate, luxury boats, aircraft and other financial assets, Mr. Scrushy was grilled for more than an hour by attorneys for the Securities and Exchange Commission, mostly regarding the status of his assets and his knowledge of alleged fraud at the company. The SEC accused Mr. Scrushy of accounting fraud and insider trading last month, and HealthSouth subsequently fired Mr. Scrushy and asked him to resign from its board. There was no ruling on the freeze yesterday.  Mr. [Donald V. Watkins]'s most vitriolic defense of Mr. Scrushy came in a nine-page court filing earlier this week seeking to lift the government's freeze on Mr. Scrushy's assets, which the attorney said is an effort to deny Mr. Scrushy access to the money he needs to defend himself.  Meanwhile, he said, Mr. Scrushy continues to work at his office, adjacent to his home in Birmingham. "Mr. Scrushy has not abandoned plans to get HealthSouth back," he says. "Richard Scrushy loves HealthSouth."
