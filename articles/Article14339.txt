 Contras Helped Fund Military Activities With Panamanian Firms' Bank Accounts   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1987  The financial network is detailed in records provided to federal investigators by Adolfo Calero, head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, known as the FDN, who appeared yesterday before a grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair.  Within the FDN, Mr. Calero appears to have personally directed the bulk of the finances for the dominant military organization for the anti-Sandinista resistance. He has denied any knowledge of funds being diverted from U.S. arms sales to Iran. But among Contra leaders, he was closest to former National Security Council aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, who oversaw the Iranian arms sales.  The source familiar with the records said that six bank accounts are identified, including three held by a Panamanian corporation, Alpha Services S.A., that was set up by an associate of Mr. Calero. Two other Panamanian corporations, Chester Corp. and Data Guard International, also held accounts used by the FDN, and a sixth account was in the name of Esther Morales, who wasn't identified further.
