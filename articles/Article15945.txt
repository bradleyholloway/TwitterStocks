 Corruption Stunts Growth in Ex-Soviet States --- Fresh Probe Reflects Big Drag on Reforms, Foreign Investment   By By Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2000  A U.S. government bribery probe involving Kazakstan officials and a consultant to major international oil firms underscores the biggest problem facing the former Soviet states of the Caucasus and Central Asia: Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, corruption has swamped the region, slowing growth, delaying reforms and discouraging foreign investment.  Large companies such as Unilever have shuttered offices in the Caucasus and Central Asia; instead, Unilever is selling products into the region from nearby countries. British Airways PLC and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines stopped flights to the Azerbaijani capital Baku in March, officially because it was unprofitable; privately, airline executives blamed bribery. Two weeks later, Azerbaijani President Haydar Aliyev publicly condemned Baku airport managers for corruption and inflated charges.  "Transaction costs are 25% to 30% of a deal [in Central Asia]. Getting this changed will take a very long time," says Hodson Thornber, a Moscow-based consultant for Arthur Andersen. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development reports that the average cost of bribery is 5.7% of company revenue in the former Soviet Union, and ranges as much as 8% in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The relative burden is heaviest on small entrants to the market. "The more a firm pays in bribes, the more time it spends dealing with . . . government," the EBRD said.
