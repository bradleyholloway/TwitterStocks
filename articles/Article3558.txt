 U.S. May Stop, Refund Excise Tax On Phone Service   By Robert Guy Matthews and Amol Sharma, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2006  The Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department wouldn't confirm the direction of the discussions. "Treasury, IRS and Justice Department are working together and considering the matter and you could expect some sort of decision to come in the future," said Treasury spokesman Sean Kevilighan. Treasury, Justice and the IRS wouldn't confirm that they are discussing refunds.  Courts have ruled seven times in recent years that the government is misapplying the 3% tax and ordered refunds to companies that have sued over the charges. The courts have generally accepted the argument that the tax is outdated and should no longer apply on long-distance calls, given how technologies and calling plans have changed. More suits are pending, and rather than continue with costly litigation, the Treasury has decided to concede defeat, say government officials.  Treasury Secretary John Snow indicated in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing in February that he would likely have to concede total defeat if the IRS continued to lose appeals cases.
