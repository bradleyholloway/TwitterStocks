 Get Off the Veranda and See the Plantation   The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2006  One organization, the Friends of McLeod, has forged an alliance embracing a mosaic of racial and cultural groups determined to save McLeod Plantation, a Sea Island plantation standing only five minutes from historic Charleston. [Willie McLeod] is the last plantation in metropolitan Charleston. For more than 300 years, it has been a focus of African-American history. Slaves cleared the land and built the buildings, the famous 54th and 55th (black) Massachusetts regiments were headquartered there during the Civil War, and at war's end a regional Freedmen's Bureau was located at McLeod. The row of slave cabins along the oak allees were home to African-Americans until the 1970s, and the overgrown cemeteries are the last resting place of long generations of slaves and free men.
