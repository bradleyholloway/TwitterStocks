 Lazard Freres Raises $1.55 Billion Pool Devoted to Major Corporate Investments   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1988  Lazard Freres & Co. has completed raising $1.55 billion for what would be Wall Street's fourth-largest pool of money devoted to major corporate investments, officials at the investment banking firm said.  Unlike other big funds principally aimed at leveraged buy-outs, the new Lazard fund, named Corporate Partners Limited Partnership, will buy only friendly, minority equity positions in companies. The fund will take 10% to 40% stakes in companies that are actual or potential takeover targets, a tactic commonly known as a "white squire" defense.  Lazard thus becomes the latest entrant in Wall Street's already crowded field of takeover-related funds. The proliferation of such funds has created a pool of more than $20 billion that has helped drive up takeover prices. The size of Lazard's fund is topped only by those managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Forstmann Little & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co.
