 In Lay Trial, Prosecutors Seek To Use Enron Scandal of 1987   By Emshwiller, John R, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  Mr. [Kenneth Lay] and his two co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges. In public statements, Mr. Lay has said that in 2001 he was unaware of the extent of some of Enron's problems and did his best to provide accurate information to employees and the public. Michael Ramsey, Mr. Lay's criminal attorney, said his client's recollection of the 1987 events is "vastly different from the government's rendition." Mr. Ramsey also accused prosecutors of getting "desperate" as the trial approaches.
