 Rethinking Asthma Treatment; Mild Cases May Not Benefit From Daily Use of Inhalers; Awaiting Updated Guidelines   By Zimmerman, Rachel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  Until then, drug-industry analysts expect doctors -- especially risk-adverse primary-care physicians -- to largely stick with the current guidelines. The study's authors and other physicians also note that these findings don't apply to patients with moderate to severe asthma, who should still continue daily preventive treatment. "This is an evolution of our understanding of this illness," said John Oppenheimer, an asthma specialist and clinical associate professor of medicine at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark who wasn't involved in the study. "But we have to temper it by saying clearly that this only applies to patients with mild asthma."  Stephen Mally, 41 years old, of Boston, is typical of mild, persistent asthmatics. He says he goes for weeks without any symptoms. Then, at certain times of the year, or when he visits a house full of cats, his asthma flares and he takes albuterol, a nonsteroid medication that provides quick relief. He has never seen an allergist and when he goes to his primary-care doctor once a year, he says, "I probably underplay my symptoms." Why? "I'd like not to have to go on a daily medication," said Mr. Mally, who is a hospital fund-raiser.  Pulmicort Turbuhaler's U.S. sales in 2004 were $151 million, the company said, and about $576 million when combined with sales of another formulation of the medicine. That's about 31% of the overall inhaled steroid market. Its biggest competitor, U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline PLC's Flovent, captured about 50% of the market with 2004 sales of $460 million, according to analyst reports.
