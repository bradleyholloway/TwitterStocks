 Hilton, LodgeNet Set Venture for Interactive TV   By By Christina Binkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2000  LodgeNet, a 20-year-old company based in Sioux Falls, S.D., sells movies, Nintendo video games and Internet access to about 4,900 hotels in the U.S., Canada and some international markets. The venture with Hilton is significant for LodgeNet. The Hilton properties alone, which include the Hilton, Doubletree, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and several other brands, could add 1,800 hotels to LodgeNet.  As a separate company, the 50-50 venture also will seek to sell its services to hotels not affiliated with Hilton, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif. But that would require an unusual level of cooperation in the highly competitive hotel industry. Some Hilton officials concede it is unlikely that Hilton's rivals, such as Marriott International Inc. or Starwood, would open their computer systems to a Hilton venture. Independent hotels or smaller chains are more likely candidates.
