 Leisure & Arts -- Masterpiece: Max Ophuls's Movie of Matchless Elegance --- 'The Earrings of Madame de...' enchants and causes heartbreak in equal measure   By Mermelstein, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2010  The drama centers on a loveless but not unhappy marriage whose delicate balance is upset when a foreign nobleman unexpectedly falls in love with the flirtatious Madame de . . . and she reciprocates his affections. In other hands, the rituals and concerns of these characters would surely appear frivolous, but with the help of Matras's virtually acrobatic camera and a poignant, waltzing score by Oscar Straus and George van Parys, Ophuls seduces viewers into inhabiting this rarefied world.
