 When the Canvas Is Your Fingernail   By By Tessa DeCarlo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2002  "Competition means illness and trauma -- I have terrible nerves," confessed Jai Harvey-Lin, from Melbourne, Australia. "But it's a way to monitor your work against your peers. And I guess I enjoy the adrenaline." She and the other 66 contestants had 2 1/2 hours to create a full 10-finger set of nail art using an array of tools and techniques that included airbrushing, hand-painting, stenciling and collage. Ignoring the din of the 2002 Hair and Nail Conference going on around them, the artists worked on their patient, elaborately costumed models with a silent intensity worlds away from the chatty fellowship of a beauty parlor.  Butterflies, flowers and other traditionally feminine subjects were also popular, but not with everyone. Pam Dew of Calgary, Canada, depicted American Indian totem animals -- the mountain lion, bison and owl -- trimmed with real fur and feathers. Jessica Hoel of Bothell, Wash., dressed her model as Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz" and painted her nails to illustrate the whole story. Sheryl Macauley of Bakersfield, Calif., chose "Moby Dick" as a theme.  This enterprise is more than art for art's sake. In the U.S., nails have grown into a $6.3 billion industry, says Vicki Peters of NailPro Magazine. Over 225,000 salons now offer manicure services, she says, including 50,500 that are devoted exclusively to nail care. Manicurists are now licensed "nail technicians" -- there are now 311,000 in the U.S. -- versed in the arcane chemistry of acrylics, gels and glues.
