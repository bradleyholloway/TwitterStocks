 Sea Containers' Recapitalization Plan Is Altered   By By Glenn Ruffenach, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 1990  Sea Containers Ltd. unveiled a second recapitalization plan under which the shipping concern and its subsidiaries seek to buy back as many as seven million shares, or about 51%, of the company's common stock for $70 each in cash.  The plan announced yesterday answered some questions that Hamilton, Bermuda-based Sea Containers had left hanging in January. Last month, the company said it would accept an offer from Temple Holdings Ltd. to buy most of the assets involved in Sea Containers' original recapitalization plan for $967 million. Temple, owned by Stena AB in Sweden and Tiphook PLC in London, had sought to acquire all of Sea Containers for $70 a share.  The new plan provides for an all-cash offer, but the $70 figure is dependent on how many shares are actually tendered. If more than seven million are tendered, shareholders would receive some cash and retain some shares. Analysts said the number could exceed seven million because under the new plan, Sea Containers' management left open the possibility that it might tender some shares. In the original plan, which also involved the buy-back of about half the company's 13.8 million shares, that group planned to retain its holdings.
