 Dollar Falls on Yen Comment   By Molinski, Dan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  Mr. [Henry Paulson], in response to a question in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, said: "I understand some people might not like where [the yen] is trading, but it's my job to fight for open competitive markets, and I believe the yen is trading in an open competitive market based on underlying economic fundamentals."  Mr. Paulson has said that yen weakness simply reflects the fragile state of the Japanese economy and low interest rates there. His comments pushed the dollar down toward its intraday low of 119.96 yen, and knocked the euro down significantly, as well. The euro rebounded some late in the session, but the dollar remained near 120 yen.
