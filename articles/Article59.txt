To the Editor:  In my younger years I had dreams of becoming a millionaire by playing the stock market. After all, I only had to double my money every year for seven straight years.  What could be easier?  hen I realized that if I con-tinued to double my money every year for 30 more years I would have all the money in the world! But that thought was a bit depressing; being somewhat philosophical, I wondered, What would I do with all the money in the world?  I figure if oil continues to increase in price at the rate of my last four oil deliveries, in a little over a decade the oil companies will have all the money in the world. I pledge here and now to the oil companies that I shall not bemoan the ever-increasing price of oil - if they will answer satisfactorily one question:  What will the oil companies do with all the money in the world?
