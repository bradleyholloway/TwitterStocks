 TrizecHahn Reports 22% Drop in Earnings, Amid Special Costs   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2000  "There has been some lack of clarity as to where we planned to go," said Peter Munk, TrizecHahn's chairman and controlling shareholder. "Let me be clear: We are going to develop nothing else other than these two core activities."  TrizecHahn said it will defer plans to buy back shares until it has determined how much capital it needs to invest in the carrier-hotel business. The company is building carrier-hotels in partnership with the U.K.'s Global Switch International Ltd., a concern in which TrizecHahn holds a one-third stake.
