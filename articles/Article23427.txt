 Getting Going: Which Funds To Tap First in Retirement   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  As a rule, you should tap your taxable account in your initial retirement years and only later eat into your retirement accounts. Indeed, that strategy could extend your nest egg's life by an additional two or three years, calculates William Reichenstein, an investments professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Prof. Reichenstein analyzed different withdrawal strategies for a paper published by New York's TIAA-CREF Institute.  "If you retire at age 62 and if you're living off money in a taxable account, you might have minimal taxable income," Prof. Reichenstein notes. "Don't blow that opportunity. You want to increase your taxable income. You may want to withdraw funds from a traditional IRA or convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA."  Alternatively, you might take enough out of your regular IRA each year to get to the top of, say, the 15% income-tax bracket, and then take further income from your Roth and taxable account. "That will minimize the average tax rate over your retirement," Prof. Reichenstein says.
