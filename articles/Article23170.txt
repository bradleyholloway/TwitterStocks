 Investment Dartboard: Minnesota Man Wins One Contest, and Another Begins [1]  By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2004  Orbitz posted a takeover-inspired leap last week but finished second, with the first prize going to Aric Nissen, a marketing director from Prior Lake, Minn., who picked a local firm, SurModics. His belief that its coatings for drug-coated stents were a "huge product" paid off as the stock rose 19%, winning him a Sunday Journal tote bag and lifetime bragging rights. "SurModics has proven it can succeed; stents are only the beginning," says Mr. Nissen, who reads Sunday Journal in the Minneapolis Star Tribune.  Martha Stewart may be going to jail, but her company isn't. That's the theory of Michelle Mategko, a former lobbyist who now stays home to care for her autistic child in Duluth, Minn. "She's obviously a fantastic businessperson," says Ms. Mategko, a Minneapolis Star Tribune reader. "And she's picked great people around her, so the company will do well whether she's involved or not."  It's been a tough year for Nashua, N.H., "e-learning" software firm SkillSoft. "They have been seesawing," admits Denver Post reader Gwen Hanley. But she's encouraged by the company's overseas growth prospects and believes it can stage a recovery. Ms. Hanley was recently laid off after 16 years as a hospital administrative worker in Denver.
