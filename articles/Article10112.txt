 Big Three to Curtail Production of Pickups in January   By Josee Valcourt, Terry Kosdrosky and Mike Spector, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2007  "Generally, the full-size truck segment is going to continue to struggle now and as we enter 2008," said George Pipas, Ford's top sales analyst. "The situation needs to be addressed."  Bob Thibodeau, who heads a Ford dealership near Warren, Mich., said he was surprised production cutbacks at GM and Ford were "as small as they were."  "I'm seriously concerned that we have an issue that is a lot bigger than a lot of people are thinking," Mr. Thibodeau said. "We've gone a few days without selling anything. I'm concerned."
