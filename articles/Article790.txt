 Mustafa Quits Citicorp for PaineWebber In Latest Defection From Investment Unit   By By Phillip L. Zweig, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1986  Kamal Mustafa, a top mergers and acquisitions specialist at Citicorp, quit to join PaineWebber Inc. It was the latest evidence of disaffection at the company's investment banking unit.  Mr. Mustafa, 37 years old, a managing director of Citibank's U.S. mergers unit, confirmed that he left yesterday to assume a similar position at PaineWebber. Although it is understood that his compensation at the Wall Street investment banking firm will be considerably higher than at Citibank, Mr. Mustafa said that "compensation wasn't as important as opportunities." He declined to comment further.  Banking sources also said that Martin A. Fox, 33, a Citicorp vice president in the mergers department, will also be leaving for PaineWebber, where he will work for Mr. Mustafa as a first vice president. Mr. Fox declined to comment.
