 The 'Six Sigma' Factor for Home Depot; Departure of CEO Nardelli Brings Into Focus a Management Technique He Championed   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  "Quality programs are not designed to be measured by a company's stock price," says Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University's business school and a Six Sigma advocate. Improvements generated by Six Sigma, he adds, "may or may not be reflected in the stock price."  Charles Holland, QualPro's founder and CEO, disagrees. "There surely is enough smoke in the study to let you know there are problems with Six Sigma," he says. "Over a period of five years or more, share price is an excellent indicator of whether you're getting better as a company."  The retail sector, in particular, "is a very human thing, with lots of people going through your store, wanting to talk to somebody about buying a chainsaw," says Jeff Matthews, general partner at Ram Partners, a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn. "That's a lot different than running a light-bulb plant efficiently." Ram holds an "insignificant" stake in Home Depot, Mr. Matthews says.
