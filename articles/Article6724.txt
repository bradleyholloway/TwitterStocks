 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- House of the Week: Up, Down, Up   By Reed, Danielle, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2003  Due Diligence: Philanthropists Harding and Jan Willinger bought this 1958 Marion Sims Wyeth-designed home for $4.3 million in 1998. They installed hurricane-proof glass, restored the interior paneling, redid the bathrooms and added an outdoor loggia and grilling area. Now they're looking for another project in the area. They first listed this home at $10.2 million, then reduced the price to $8.6 million, then raised it back up to $8.9 million.
