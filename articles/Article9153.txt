 Study Finds New Weaknesses in Social Security   By By John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1999  Social Security is in even worse shape than the current numbers suggest, according to a blue-ribbon advisory panel.  One of the reasons, a report prepared for the Social Security Advisory Board found, is that people are living longer than current actuarial assumptions suggest, meaning retirement benefits must be paid out over a longer period of time.  The report is intended to help guide federal policy makers in setting annual assumptions for the pension program. Stanford G. Ross, a Washington lawyer and the advisory board's chairman, says he hopes the report will reinvigorate congressional debate about an overhaul of Social Security, currently projected to become insolvent in 2034.
