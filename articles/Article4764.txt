 U.K. Government Proposes Bolstering Takeover Rules   By By David Shirreff, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1987  The measures, some of which require legislation, would give Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers greater power to gather confidential information and would, for the first time, let the panel suggest penalties. The self-regulatory body is staffed by the financial industry and financed by bidders in takeover fights.  The takeover panel also would be able to recommend freezing voting rights of those shareholders who refuse to reveal their identity during a takeover bid. It also could propose barring outside advisers acting for companies they suspect may violate the takeover panel's rules.
