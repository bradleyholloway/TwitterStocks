 Bond Funds Again Become Not So Easy   By Aaron Lucchetti and Ian McDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2005  To determine the interest-rate risk of a particular fund, investors should look first at the fund's name. "Short" funds tend to be less vulnerable to rising rates but have lower yields. "Long" funds are riskier but pay more. Intermediate funds are in between.  Corporate, mortgage and junk-bond funds all carry different risks, not all of which are tied to interest rates. International funds and bond funds that hold Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, are popular among investors worried about rising rates. So-called "strategic" or "total return" funds attempt to boost returns by shifting among various bond sectors.  "We're concerned about the twin deficits" in the U.S. budget and trade account, says Christopher Molumphy, chief fixed-income officer at Franklin Templeton, a mutual-fund firm that has built international bonds to 10% to 35% of portfolios that usually focus on U.S. bonds. Funds that focus on international bonds and TIPS would likely do well in such an environment, as they benefit from a falling dollar and rising U.S. inflation, respectively.
