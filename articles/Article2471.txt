 Verdict Against Cigarette Maker For $1 Million Thrown Into Doubt   By By Ann Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  A landmark $1 million verdict against Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. was thrown into question yesterday when a Florida appeals court ruled that the suit should have been tried in the county where the dead smoker's family lived.  But Brown & Williamson was more cautious, saying only that it believes the decision, along with another recent appellate-court victory in a similar case, gave the trial court in Jacksonville little choice but to grant it a new trial in Palm Beach County. The judge in Jacksonville is still considering the company's motion for a new trial based on other factors, such as whether he improperly admitted privileged documents into evidence that may have prejudiced the jury.  Brown & Williamson, the Louisville, Ky., unit of London-based B.A.T Industries PLC, had requested the change of venue because it said witnesses would be inconvenienced by coming to Jacksonville for the trial. Co-workers and others who were prepared to testify about deceased retail clerk Roland E. Maddox's awareness of the health risks of smoking lived in Palm Beach County or out of state. His doctors practiced in South Florida, his widow and daughter lived in Palm Beach County, and Mr. Maddox himself had never lived in Jacksonville.
