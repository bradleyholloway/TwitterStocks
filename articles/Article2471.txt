 Executive Pay (A Special Report) --- Who Made the Biggest Bucks   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1993  Many chief executives exercised a slew of stock options last year to avoid the threat of higher federal taxes -- sending their pay soaring. According to the William M. Mercer Inc. compensation survey, 1992's highest-paid CEOs -- taking into account salary, bonus, long-term incentive payouts and the value of their restricted-stock grants -- included:  -- Thomas F. Frist, Jr., HCA-Hospital Corp. of America, with total compensation of $127 million. Much of that was due to a $125.9 million gain from exercising stock options.
