 A Shortfall in Outlets; Our Homes Are Filled With Gadgets Fighting for Too Few Wall Sockets   By Fry, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2006  In the kitchen the villain isn't appliances so much as it is chargers, which seem to have multiplied while we were distracted. Once upon a time, we just had a pair of cellphones that would plug in behind the flour jar. Today there's a rat's nest of transformers and cables and adapter tips, one that's migrated across the kitchen to surround the mixer, which long ago lost the right to stay plugged in.  I know what he means, but man, I wish. When I'm eyeing an outlet that's already overwhelmed and/or hopelessly far from where I need power, the technology certainly registers -- and it sure doesn't feel magical. In fact, I feel like the magician's harried assistant, struggling backstage to cram several annoyed rabbits into one very small hat. For a while we've been scheming to expand our apartment, and where my wife imagines a big master bedroom and a nice bathroom, my fantasies run toward cables behind walls where they belong and belts of outlets anywhere they might conceivably be useful.  In looking for our apartment's offenders, my eye fell immediately on those chargers: They're plugged in at all times, whether or not they're charging gadgets. This isn't a new cause celebre -- this fall Nokia agreed to include alerts on its cellphones that will inform their owners that the phone is fully charged and the charger should be unplugged. (If you don't think this is a terrible idea now, please check back in with me the first time you stumble downstairs at 1 a.m. to unplug a naggy charger.)
