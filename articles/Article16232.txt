 The Economy: International Body To Suggest Tighter Merger Accounting   By By Silvia Ascarelli and Cassell Bryan-Low, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2002  The group responsible for setting international accounting standards is unveiling proposals for merger accounting that in some ways are tougher than the existing U.S. approach. The move is part of a broader joint effort to meld U.S. and international-accounting standards.  The proposed international standard is likely to draw concern from U.S. companies. But the U.S. rule setter, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, has signaled it will consider such proposals as part of its plan to harmonize U.S. accounting standards with international ones.  In many instances, U.S. companies record restructuring charges at the outset of an acquisition for anticipated future costs, such as to cover factory closings -- in some instances totaling billions of dollars. Then, in news releases, they designate the amounts as "one time," "nonrecurring" or "unusual," indicating investors should disregard them; in regulatory filings, the charges are shown as ordinary expenses under prevailing U.S. standards. (U.S. rule makers already don't allow such sweeping, upfront restructuring charges outside of acquisitions.)
