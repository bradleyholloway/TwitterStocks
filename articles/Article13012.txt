 Debate Begins On Biodefenses At Postal Service   By Gary Fields and Rick Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2004  Ira Cohen, spokesman for Rep. Danny Davis (D., Ill.), said his boss favored more funding in the 2005 budget to upgrade biodefense in the postal system. "If you're going to give the Postal Service the added responsibilities of homeland-security issues, why should that be financed" out of Postal Service revenues, he said. Rep. Davis is a member of the Government Reform Committee, which has been considering a Postal Service revamp.  Sensitive to any suggestion that the agency is dragging its feet, the Postal Service insists its terrorism-fighting efforts aren't falling behind. "We are right on schedule," said Thomas Day, vice president of engineering at the Postal Service. He also said the agency will try to find more money for biohazard-detection equipment even if Congress doesn't provide funds. "We are still committed to doing it, and it would have to come from our operating funds," he said.
