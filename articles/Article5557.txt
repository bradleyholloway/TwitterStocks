 Letters to the Editor: Speculation Is Behind Cheap Gold   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1998  The resulting decline in price has been exacerbated by some investors' expectations that this indicates a watershed in the opinions of central bankers about the role of gold in the conduct of their monetary affairs.
