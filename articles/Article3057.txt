 GE 3rd-Period Net Rose 25%; Immelt Backs 2002 Outlook   By By Rachel Emma Silverman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  GE's third-quarter earnings reflected gains from the sale of an Internet commerce unit and strength in GE's NBC television network, power-systems and commercial and consumer-finance businesses. Their influence offset big losses in GE's reinsurance and equity units.  GE said several one-time events helped its earnings in the third quarter. GE recorded a one-time gain of $317 million after tax from the sale of its Global Exchange Services business to Francisco Partners, a technology buyout fund. GE also benefited from a low effective tax rate of around 7% in its financial-services businesses, in part because of a tax settlement.  Those gains offset losses in other areas of GE's wide portfolio of businesses. Its Employers Reinsurance Corp. business, which helps other insurance firms spread their risks, recorded a $156 million after-tax loss, hurt by the recent flooding in Europe and increased estimates of prior-year losses. GE also said it was adjusting its GE Equity portfolio, which had a $167 million after-tax third-quarter loss, by exiting from investments in sectors such as telecommunications and software.
