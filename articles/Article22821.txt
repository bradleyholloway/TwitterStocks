 Treasury's Shift Sticks Traders With Big Losses   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 2001  The reason: The Treasury's move wrecked some of the most popular, and successful, trades of this year, transactions that some big bond players only recently began piling into. The Treasury's announcement also ruined some of the most popular hedges used by Wall Street firms and big investors to protect their positions in some corporate and other bonds.  While there is a winner for every losing trade resulting from the decision on the 30-year bond, of course, some say there was such a shock to the market during the past two days that it potentially has undermined the credibility of the Treasury Department -- particularly Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, already mistrusted on Wall Street, and his chief market aide Peter Fisher, who has been well respected in financial circles -- and could hurt its ability to work with investors to manage the nation's debt.  While nursing losses, many traders say the Treasury Department's handling of its historic decision to end sales of 30-year bonds has added risk to the Treasury market, perhaps forcing yields higher on some securities. And there have been scattered indications of difficulties trading Treasurys in the past two days. All that could hurt the Treasury Department's continuing efforts to sell debt at the lowest rates.
