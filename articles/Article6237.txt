 Will the Music Industry Sue Your Kid?; As Lawsuits Target Individuals, Music Swappers Weigh Options; Evaluating the Amnesty Offer   By Bialik, Carl, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2003  The RIAA has targeted people who make available a large number of songs -- typically more than 1,000 -- that are copyrighted by its member companies. The risk is lower if you are sharing only a couple of files, and zero if you're the kind of music swapper who only downloads, not uploads. (Downloading is basically taking a file from someone else's computer; uploading is making a file available to someone else for download.) Lawyers say that in most states, parents generally aren't liable for their kids' actions, as long as parents didn't knowingly allow them to break the law.  Critics of the offer warn that the RIAA doesn't represent all copyright holders, so songwriters and independent musicians could use the affidavits to bring other lawsuits against you. A lawsuit filed against the RIAA yesterday in state court in San Rafael, Calif., attacks the amnesty program for that reason. In response, the RIAA says people don't need to reveal which songs they swapped nor their Internet names to obtain amnesty.  A: Not much, at least in the short term. For one thing, it is much harder to track the biggest downloaders. That is because while you can easily see an entire directory of all uploaded files, people typically download one song at a time. Also, the main concern is getting people to stop uploading; the thinking is, this will deplete the file-sharing services' libraries and thus make them less attractive and drive people to legal, authorized services like Apple's.
