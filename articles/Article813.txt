 Major Airlines Plan Fare Hike Later in Month   By By John Koten, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1986  Although the price hikes haven't been announced, several large carriers confirm that they are filing across-the-board increases in their discount fares that will take effect on tickets written on Oct. 26. The increases, which average more than 5%, also affect regular coach fares that weren't included in an earlier round of price increases in some major markets last month.  "This is a system-wide increase," says an official in the pricing department at one large airline. Carriers that have so far agreed to adopt the planned increase include United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Trans World Airlines, according to industry executives.  Airline officials say that one-way fares for trips under 1,000 miles would increase $10, while fares on longer trips would rise $20. The increases amount to more than 10% on many discount fares. All round-trip "excursion" fares will increase by $20.
