 Brazil's Bank Chief Faces New Storm   By By Jonathan Karp and Matt Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2002  To be sure, Brazil has made economic strides under President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who isn't permitted to seek a third term. But the changes are far from complete, and some legacies, such as heavy public debt, keep Brazil vulnerable. Mr. [Arminio Fraga] says that he "wouldn't rule out working for any government that was inclined to respect contracts, to stick with the rule of law . . . [that] understood and made it clear that fiscal responsibility is important, that low inflation is a precondition for development."  As Brazil's bond-yield spreads widened to beyond Venezuela's, indicating greater risk, many investors balked at buying Brazilian government debt with maturities beyond January 2003, when the new government takes office. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yield, were driven down further for technical reasons. For instance, in his quest to bring greater transparency to Brazil's financial markets, Mr. Fraga moved forward to May 31 the deadline for new accounting rules for Brazilian mutual funds. The changes caused paper losses and added to the oversupply of domestic debt. The reaction: More unsold Brazilian treasury bills this week and a plunging real as demand for dollars, in a quest for stability, rose.
