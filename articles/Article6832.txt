 Dollar Is Steady Amid Wait for Economic Cues   By Vames, Steven, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2004  The dollar was little changed versus most major rivals, though the yen advanced modestly against the U.S. currency after Saudi Arabia pledged to increase oil production in hopes of easing prices.  Though the Saudi pledge to put additional capacity online initially caused a only knee-jerk pullback in oil prices and crude contracts resumed their rally, the yen retained some of its gains on hopes that Saudi Arabia can make good on its promise.  In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2217 from $1.2237 late on Tuesday. Against the yen, the dollar was at 110.90 yen, down from 111.33 yen. The dollar was steady against the Swiss franc, at 1.2621 francs from 1.2617. The pound was fetching $1.8291, somewhat higher than Tuesday afternoon's $1.8265.
