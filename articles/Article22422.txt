 Malaysia Again Sets Stimulus Program   By By Darren McDermott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  The five-billion-ringgit ($1.21 billion) program announced Wednesday by Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim aims to get cash to companies and consumers without triggering a fresh speculative attack on Malaysia's beleaguered currency.  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is strongly pressuring the finance minister, Datuk Seri Anwar, to lower interest rates. Last week, Dr. Mahathir installed trusted adviser Tun Daim Zainuddin as economic czar, apparently undercutting Datuk Seri Anwar, whom he blames for driving Malaysia into recession with an austerity program modeled on International Monetary Fund policies.  Monday, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin declared in Kuala Lumpur that high rates are required to solve Asia's woes, Datuk Seri Anwar said Malaysian rates are "prohibitively high." Nevertheless, Datuk Seri Anwar appears wary that lowering rates would intensify capital flight and attacks on the ringgit.
