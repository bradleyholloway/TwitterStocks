 Boeing Will Redesign 737 System   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2000  The initiative, including millions of additional dollars it is expected to cost carriers to perform the work, is one of the most expensive retrofit efforts in modern aviation history. The move comes 18 months after the National Transportation Safety Board determined that rudder malfunctions were the cause of two much-publicized Boeing 737 crashes between 1991 and 1994. At the end of the public hearing in March 1999, the safety board called on the FAA and Boeing to develop fixes ensuring that failure of a single valve couldn't cause a catastrophic accident.
