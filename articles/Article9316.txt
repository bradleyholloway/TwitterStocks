 Some Analysts Believe Timing Is Right in Europe To Return to Telecom, Media and Tech Shares   By By Alfred Kueppers, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2001  European stocks were generally higher Friday on new hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would lower rates again following worse-than-expected U.S. employment figures. Asian markets were mostly weaker, though Tokyo was closed again for a holiday. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 2.07 points, or 1.05%, to 199.28. Excluding the U.S., the index gained 0.8 point, or 0.55% to 146.17.  Schroder Salomon Smith Barney's strategy team points to three factors that it believes show the market is on its way up. First, retail investors sold their holdings in February and March, traditionally a sign that the market has hit bottom. Second, institutions, the investment bank says, are buying again -- switching out of bonds and cash and into stocks. Finally, U.S. inventory levels are falling, an important factor in their decision to raise projections for 2002 U.S. GDP growth to 3.8%.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index closed up 1.8%, or 104.5 points, at 5870.30. Vodafone shares rose 4% to 196.75 pence, bouncing back after recent losses related to news of its GBP 3.5 billion share placement. British Telecom closed up 1.6% at 600 pence as investors welcomed news that an industry watchdog has ended its investigation into BT's new tariff packages for off-peak Internet access. Bank of Scotland and Halifax Group confirmed their merger, valued at GBP 28 billion. Halifax was up 2.9% at 823.5 pence, while Bank of Scotland gained 4.3% to 846 pence.
