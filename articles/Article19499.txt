 Global Crossing Bid Is Readied By Buyout Firm   By By Dennis K. Berman and Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2002  Gores, led by Israeli native Alec Gores, is expected to file its proposal this week with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, where Global Crossing filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 28. Mr. Gores is best known for quickly turning around Learning Co. after acquiring it from Mattel Inc. in 2000.  AT&T is in talks with the banks and creditors about possibly making a bid for some or all of the network, these people said. If AT&T bought the entire network, AT&T would likely sell much of it to other parties, since some of the Global Crossing network duplicates AT&T's. A deal with AT&T would be a humbling end to Global Crossing, which built its system to compete directly with AT&T. But it isn't definite: A person close to the talks said the chance of AT&T buying any lines is "in the low 30% range."  An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the company is planning to bid for Global's assets. But she added that AT&T "has made it clear that we will always look at distressed assets and see whether they are beneficial to the company and our customers." AT&T, which recently disbanded its international joint venture with British Telecommunications PLC, has been looking for ways to complete its overseas network.
