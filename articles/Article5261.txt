 Time Warner Stock Offering Expected To Be Replaced by a Fixed-Price Plan   By By Randall Smith and Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1991  Time Warner Inc. is expected to abandon a controversial $3.5 billion stock offering plan and come back with a new plan to sell stock at a fixed price instead of a range of prices.  At the time the plan was concocted, that entire price range represented a tempting discount to Time Warner's market price, which closed at $120.50 a share on May 31, a few days before the plan was announced. However, as the complex and confusing details emerged, the stock plummeted below $95 a share by June 7, leaving holders smarting at being coerced into buying stock at possibly above-market prices.  The reaction to the rights offering has already knocked 22%, or $1.5 billion, off the market value of Time Warner's 57 million shares outstanding. And some analysts predict the stock may remain in the doldrums if investors don't regain confidence in the company's ability to dig itself out of debt incurred in the 1989 acquisition of Warner Communications Inc. by Time Inc. In addition to $11 billion of bank debt, the company has another $5 billion of preferred stock with hefty annual dividend requirements.
