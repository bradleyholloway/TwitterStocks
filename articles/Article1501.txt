 Commonwealth Bank of Australia Wins Investors' Notice on First Trading Day   By By S. Karena Witcher, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 1991  SYDNEY, Australia -- Investors snapped up stock in Commonwealth Bank of Australia during its first day of trading, giving a boost to the government's nascent privatization program.  The stock began trading on Sydney's stock exchange at midmorning on Thursday and quickly climbed. During the session, 10.6 million shares, or about 4.5% of the stock issued to the public, changed hands. The stock closed at 6.46 Australian dollars (US$5.10), a premium of 20% above the initial public offering price of A$5.40.  Trading in the bank helped produce the busiest day at the exchange since the October 1987 global crash, exchange officials said. The 10.6 million shares represented about 11% of the total volume of 97 million shares. Overall prices closed little changed, with the All Ordinaries Index rising 0.5%, but Commonwealth Bank isn't included in the index yet. The exchange's chairman, Laurie Cox, hailed the listing as "giving the market quite a psychological lift, and that's very important."
