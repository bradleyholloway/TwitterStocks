 A New Twist in the Raging Hormone Debate --- Controversial HRT Drugs May Ward Off Alzheimer's, But Still Pose Cancer Risk   By By Scott Hensley, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2002  Although the latest information isn't conclusive about HRT's ability to protect against Alzheimer's, the results may add a slight counterweight to the balance of scientific evidence against the risks of the medicines. Even a flawed weapon against Alzheimer's gives cause for hope. "One thing to recognize is that the overall five-year survival rate for breast cancer is excellent, and we don't have anything that works for Alzheimer's," says Michele Curtis, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. She's not ready to recommend HRT for Alzheimer's prevention in the public at large. But she's encouraged that the data support previous reports on a potential benefit.  They then followed them for three years to find new cases of Alzheimer's, and found that women who had a history of hormone replacement therapy experienced about half the risk of Alzheimer's, compared with those who hadn't taken the medicine. Only 26 of 1,066 women who had used HRT came down with Alzheimer's; by contrast, 58 of 800 women who had never taken the drugs got the disease.  Several previous studies have shown that once Alzheimer's has already surfaced, taking hormones does no good. Other research had previously hinted that hormone replacements helped women guard against the mental deterioration that is the hallmark of Alzheimer's. The new findings "achieve a reconciliation of the apparently conflicting scientific literature," says John C.S. Breitner, a geriatric psychiatrist at V.A. Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle and the senior author of the recent paper. It appears that hormone therapy lowers the risk for Alzheimer's, but does so only a decade after treatment is started, Dr. Breitner explains.
