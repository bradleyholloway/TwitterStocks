 Executives At Rational Buy Shares After Fall   By By Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1997  Some shareholders have filed suit in San Francisco federal court for the northern district of California over the way Rational handled the announcement of its earnings shortfall last month, complaining that some Wall Street analysts got early word of the development. And some analysts remain skeptical about the purchase of 400,000 shares by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paul D. Levy, Senior Vice President John R. Lovitt and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Robert T. Bond. The analysts noted that the executives had small stakes in the company to begin with.  The fundamental issues that Mr. Moore refers to include an acquisition binge that has seen Rational acquire or merge with a half-dozen companies in the past 10 months. Rational's stock has tumbled particularly since its purchase of Pure Atria Corp. in June. In addition, the company must cope with fierce competition from the entry of such software giants as Oracle Corp. into its corner of the software development market.  Mr. Levy bought 200,250 Rational shares between Oct. 20 and Oct. 28 at prices between $7.70 and $9.82. On Nov. 3, he bought an additional 100,000 shares at $9.25 to $9.38. According to CDA/Investnet, a database that follows insider purchases and sales, the transactions were valued at $2.7 million. Mr. Lovitt bought 60,000 shares between Oct. 28 and Oct. 31 at $7.75 to $9.13. And Mr. Bond bought 25,000 shares at $10 on Nov. 4. The purchases bring the holdings of the three executives to 425,250 for Mr. Levy, 103,617 for Mr. Lovitt and 49,990 for Mr. Bond, according to Federal Filings Business News.
