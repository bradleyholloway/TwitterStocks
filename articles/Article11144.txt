 Tense Tots: Some Schools Press So Hard Kids Become Stressed and Fearful --- Flashcards, Computers, Tests All Day Long Take a Toll On Fast-Track Students --- Burning Out by the Age of 10   By By Gary Putka, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1988  Shane's battlefield is the second grade in the Sawmill School in Tewksbury, N.J. Like many schools pushed by upwardly mobile parents, Sawmill has toughened up. Parents say there are more tests and homework. For the first time this year, Shane had different teachers for each subject, a practice once begun in junior high. Last month, his little brother took that first big entrance exam -- for kindergarten.  Yuppie youngsters on the fast track to Harvard already know the drill -- flashcards and swimming lessons in diapers, Suzuki music and Gymboree later. But now, teaching lots to tots has moved into the mainstream. Check out your neighborhood school. Reading, arithmetic and computers are fast replacing playtime in kindergarten. The four-to-six set spends more hours at desks, faces more rigorous tests and sits behind more computer screens than ever. It's even possible now to flunk kindergarten in places such as Minneapolis and Georgia.  Many parents are beginning to wonder: Do we expect too much of the very young? Many pediatricians and psychologists say stress-related problems in children are increasing. Children's hospitals report more injuries associated with repetitive training exercises. In white-collar suburbs, teachers and parents speak of elementary school "burnouts" -- children who bloom early but wilt by age 10 or 11.
