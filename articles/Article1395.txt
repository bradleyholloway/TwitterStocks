 Letters to the Editor: Guilty Homeowners Come Out of Hiding   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1990  I was struck with guilt on learning that Mary and I, like other homeowners, "profited from the S&L mess," according to your Nov. 5 page-one article "Tracing the Billions: Just What Happened to All That Money Savings & Loans Lost?"  Still, we don't want to be profiteers at our nation's expense in these difficult times. Could your writers please tell me to whom I should send our fair share of the $25 billion-to-$30 billion piece of the "S&L mess"? I'd really like to settle this right away.
