 Japan Urges Coordinated Intervention; Dollar Falls Slightly as Sell-Off Continues   By By Alex Keto, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 11, 1988  Limited intervention by the Bank of Japan in Tokyo trading, when the central bank bought dollars around the 123.85-yen level, and a higher level of rhetoric by the Japan government served to stabilize the dollar-yen exchange rate, which extended to other exchange rates.  The statements appear to be the first public appeal by a central bank for concerted, coordinated action by the Group of Seven industrialized nations to halt the dollar's decline since the dollar began its descent in the beginning of October. (The G-7 is made up of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.)  A later report during New York trading indicating that the Bank of Japan would try to recruit European central banks in its efforts to curb the dollar's slide was interpreted as putting pressure specifically on the Bundesbank to help support the dollar. The Bundesbank has been noticeably absent from supporting the dollar during its recent decline.
