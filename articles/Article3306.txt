 Social Type: Town & Country's Update Redefines a Genre   By Agins, Teri, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2004  In redefining its coverage, Town & Country's goal was to be "more tuned-in, more fashion-conscious, cultural and community-spirited -- and not driven by old money," says Ms. Fiori, 60 years old. The daughter of a florist, she grew up in racially mixed Union, N.J., becoming a high-school teacher after graduation from Jersey City State College. She spent 22 years at American Express Co.'s magazine unit, last serving as editorial director for all of its titles, including Travel + Leisure.  Since Ms. Fiori took over, newsstand sales have climbed 37%, to 62,000 in 2003, according to Capell's Circulation Report. Overall circulation, however, has dropped somewhat: 465,000 in 2003, down from 493,000 in 1994. Advertising pages, meanwhile, have more than doubled, to 1,429 in 2003, says the Audit Bureau of Circulation. Publisher Jim Taylor says ad revenues have grown by "tens of millions" of dollars from a decade ago; and that the magazine is now profitable. He declined to elaborate. Privately held Hearst affirmed its faith in the brand last year with the launch of Town & Country Travel, a quarterly magazine.  The makeover has made Town & Country a go-to publication for prominent minorities. During an age when many magazines still ignore African-American culture except for athletes or movie stars, Town & Country "is more inclusive in a way that is not patronizing," says Raymond McGuire, a black New York investment banker. He extols the magazine for depicting minorities "as mainstream consumers as opposed to a 'special demographic.' " Says Tonya Lewis Lee, wife of director Spike Lee, who agreed to have her Manhattan home photographed for a coming issue: "They treat people of color in a way that seems effortless."
