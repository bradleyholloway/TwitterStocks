 He Has a Little List -- and a Long Indictment   By By Gary Rosen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2002  In Judge [Richard A. Posner]'s view, today's highbrow pundits and commentators are a pretty sorry lot. Creatures of the modern university -- with tenure, light teaching loads and generous leave -- they have responded all too readily to the media's ever-growing demand for "expert" opinion. The wide-ranging freelance intellectual of a few generations ago has given way to the Ph.D. know-it-all, an arrogant specialist who, gratifying his ego and padding his wallet, gladly pronounces on matters "about which he is an idiot." The result: opinion-makers who are "careless with facts and rash in predictions," lack "realism" and "worldliness," delight in "universals and abstraction" and, in their eagerness to stand out, take "extreme positions."  What he does instead is gather all manner of data about public intellectuals, most of it irrelevant to his charges against them. Especially unhelpful is his (already much-talked-about) "top 100" list. Basing his pecking order on nothing more discriminating than the number of times an individual's name turns up on Lexis/Nexis, Judge Posner blithely arrays the likes of Sidney Blumenthal, Bill Moyers and Ann Coulter on a continuum with Henry Kissinger, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Garry Wills and, of course, himself.  Why did such destructive causes appeal to so many smart people? Because, as Judge Posner observes, public intellectuals tend to approach political and social change with "impatience and unrealism," underestimating "the world's recalcitrance to efforts at improving it." They tend, in short, to be leftists, and in overwhelming numbers. He knows this but makes little of it, as if the characteristic vices of public intellectuals were unrelated to their place on the ideological spectrum.
