 Gadgets -- The Mossberg Solution: A Primer on Your New Digital-Music Player; Answers to Key Questions, From File Compatibility To Playing Tunes in the Car   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2004  A: Digital music players, like the iPod, the Dell DJ, or any other brand, play songs in the form of computer files, which also can be played in music jukebox programs on Windows and Macintosh computers. There are several types of these music files, but the most popular type is called an "MP3" file. MP3 files have names that end in the letters "mp3," as in "songname.mp3." Other types include WMA, a Microsoft-developed format, and AAC, an industry standard that is only now becoming popular.  There are two common ways to acquire songs in the form of these files so that you can play them on a computer and load them onto your player. The first method is to convert some or all of the songs on your existing CDs into music files. This process, popularly known as "ripping," is done by launching any popular music jukebox software and then inserting a music CD. The software can then be instructed to convert the tracks on the CD into music files, which are placed in a folder on your computer's hard disk. If you're just starting out, and ripping a lot of CDs, this can be time consuming. But, in most cases, you can keep feeding in CDs while you do other things on the computer.  The most common type of encrypted format is a special protected version of the WMA standard developed by Microsoft. Many players, including the Dell DJ and the Napster/Samsung player, can handle these protected WMA files, though there can be incompatibilities between files purchased from different stores. Unfortunately, the best- designed, and best-selling digital player, Apple's iPod, can't play back these files.
