 Japan's Expected Tightening Is Focus of Key Banks' Actions   By Norman, Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2006  Late in New York Friday, the euro was at $1.2037, off from $1.2041 late Thursday. The dollar was at 116.39 yen, up from 115.82 yen, while the euro was at 140.09 yen, up from 139.46 yen. The dollar was at 1.2977 Swiss francs from 1.2979 francs, and the British pound was fetching $1.7544, compared with $1.7546.  Carsten Fritsch, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the euro heads into this week well supported. One sign of this is that the common currency managed to hold onto most of its post-ECB gains in Friday's session despite strong U.S. data.  Monica Fan, global head of currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London, said the market has "already fully discounted the end of policy easing." The risk, she said, "is that dollar/yen and euro/yen actually rallies if there are comments from the BOJ which say that inflation will remain low at the start of the new fiscal year" on April 1.
