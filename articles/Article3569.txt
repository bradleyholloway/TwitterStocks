 U.S. May Delay Payroll Taxes On Some Options   By By John D. McKinnon and Jennifer Corbett Dooren, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  Based on recent conversations with Treasury Department officials, some business groups say they believe the IRS will soon announce it is going to extend the present moratorium for an additional two years, until Jan. 1, 2005. The payroll tax so far has never been imposed on incentive stock options and employee stock-purchase plans, although it is imposed on other types of stock options.  "Treasury officials have been pretty clear in recent comments that some relief will be forthcoming," said James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the American Benefits Council, a group that represents large employers that offer stock options to their employees. Mr. Delaplane said he expects an announcement "within days or weeks" of a two-year extension of the moratorium.
