 Love & Money: Why Mom Is Getting an iPod Today   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  So, I called his bluff. "Do you think this is something Mommy really wants," I asked, "or just a way for you to get the iPod that Mom and I won't buy for you?"  "It's something I think Mom needs," he told me. "And I'm going to put all the songs on it that I like, which she'll probably like too, and then she can share it with me."  "But I made a mistake," he says. "It isn't that my older daughter will never use it. It's more that had I given it more thought, I would have realized that my younger daughter didn't really care about it, either. She saw it in the store, and at the spur of the moment wanted to buy it. Had I suggested we keep shopping, she would have forgotten about those plastic fish in a second. So on Christmas, three weeks later, she didn't really care that she had bought it."
