 Primary Colors   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2006  Meanwhile, the national GOP was on the losing side Tuesday in Arizona, where a primary for an open House seat went to anti- immigration hard-liner Randy Graf. Immigration was the dominant issue in the Tucson district that borders Mexico. Yet Mr. Graf managed a plurality of just 43%, the same amount he received in a primary two years ago in a loss to Jim Kolbe, the 11-term pro-immigration incumbent retiring this year. GOP restrictionists are cheering Mr. Graf's victory, but he is now expected to lose the seat in November. Restrictionists also took a blow as their Arizona candidate for governor, Don Goldwater -- who campaigned at the border, yelling "Mr. [Bush], build this wall now!" -- lost handily to a conservative who favors comprehensive immigration reform.
