 SEC Widens Xerox Civil Probe To Ex-Executives and to KPMG   By By James Bandler and Mark Maremont, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2002  The SEC is believed to see the Xerox case as a test of its ability to conduct an investigation in situations where it gets very little cooperation from a company. While many corporations quickly bow to the securities watchdog, Xerox chose to fight. At one point it appealed a technical judgment by the enforcement staff to the agency's accounting arm. It lost the appeal. Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone said the company "cooperated fully with the SEC" while "exercising our legal rights with the SEC to protect the best interests of the company."  Two months later, Xerox again was thrown into turmoil when KPMG balked at signing the company's 2000 annual report, insisting on a broader internal investigation involving a different law firm. KPMG officials say Xerox executives were furious and argued that the delay could throw Xerox into a bankruptcy proceeding. Mr. [George Ledwith], the KPMG spokesman, says his firm took its stance after learning new information as a result of the SEC probe. That information, he said, "raised questions" about whether top Xerox management prepared financial statements "to achieve certain earnings rather than trying to get it right."  A second internal probe conducted by Xerox's audit committee resulted in last June's financial restatements. Xerox also began to disclose far more information about its accounting practices. At that point, KPMG said it was satified that Xerox's accounting now was sound. It continues to believe that. But the SEC continued its probe, arguing that Xerox still hadn't gone far enough.
