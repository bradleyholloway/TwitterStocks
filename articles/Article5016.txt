 K mart Uses Double Coupons For a Day To Draw Shoppers in Bid to Boost Sales   By By Francine Schwadel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1989  The nation's second-largest retailer, hurt in recent months by sales that have fallen short of its expectations, normally redeems manufacturers' coupons at face value at its 2,200 discount stores. But on Saturday, for one day only, Troy, Mich.-based K mart doubled the refund for shoppers redeeming coupons with a face value of as much as 50 cents. K mart absorbed the cost of the extra discount.  The timing of the double-coupon event suggests that it is a response to sagging sales and profits. Through May, the fourth month of its fiscal year, K mart's sales were only 3.5% ahead of last year's, meaning they barely kept pace with inflation. K mart's profit for the first quarter, which ended in April, fell 22%. The company blames cold spring weather for the poor showing, but analysts also cite a new marketing strategy at Sears, Roebuck & Co., the nation's largest retailer.
