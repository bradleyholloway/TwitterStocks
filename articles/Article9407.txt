 Worker Productivity Is Up Despite Economic Slump   By By Jon E. Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2002  If productivity is rising as robustly as the Labor Department's latest report suggests, it means businesses are squeezing more and more output out of fewer workers. In the short run, that helps explain why the unemployment rate has shot up by a sizeable 1.7 percentage points since late 2000, even though the overall decline in economic output has been relatively mild. "That runup in unemployment has been much more rapid than would have occurred without that strong productivity growth," says Dale Jorgenson, an economics professor at Harvard University. He says more increases in unemployment might be in store.  Yet some economists warn against reading too much into yesterday's number. Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist who has been less sanguine about the productivity picture, says the real U.S. economic slowdown started in the third quarter of 2000, when many companies first began to realize that they wouldn't hit their aggressive growth projections. Since then productivity has grown at a 1.7% rate, markedly slower than the 2.3% rate that has prevailed since the recession officially began in March.
