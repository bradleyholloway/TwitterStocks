 When Empires Are Falling, Daring Is Prudence   By By Albert Wohlstetter, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1989  Yes, we in the U.S. want our leaders to respond prudently to the visibly rapid disintegration of the communist empires. And yes, we ought to support "perestroika," to the best of our limited abilities, if perestroika means the movements of people forcibly included in these empires toward free political choice and free markets. Surely we need to keep talking with our allies about what we can do to help these momentous changes that affect us all. And, of course, we want those changes to be non-violent. Nobody, so far as I can tell, advocates chaos.  Last April, when Mr. Gorbachev and the Politburo decided to send internal security troops to Tbilisi in Soviet Georgia to suppress a demonstration -- later described by the Soviets themselves as exclusively peaceful in nature and intent -- for the restoration of Georgian sovereignty, it ended in poison gas and massacre. The bloodshed in Tbilisi isn't likely to stop the movements for Georgian independence -- and in fact, it might speed them up. Leaders in the East as well as in the West have problems of prudence.  Communist regimes isolate their peoples to inspire hopelessness and fear. The new information technologies can overcome that isolation. That's the importance of the word processors, copiers, compute-rto-computer communications, fax machines and printers supplied by the New York-based Center for Democracy in the Soviet Union to independent publishers in the Soviet Union including the Express Chronicle, the first independent Soviet news agency. The agency now links 100 correspondents throughout the huge expanse of the country with each other and with the rest of the world.
