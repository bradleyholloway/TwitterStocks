 Amazon and Wal-Mart Have Discussed An Alliance, but No Deal Is Likely Soon   By By Nick Wingfield and Ann Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2001  While there are various forms that an alliance between the companies could take, a Wal-Mart acquisition of or investment in Amazon appears very unlikely. In a companywide meeting on Jan. 15, Jeanne Jackson, chief executive officer of Walmart.com, Wal-Mart's Internet subsidiary, addressed speculation that Wal-Mart was interested in purchasing Amazon, according to a former employee. Despite a steep decline in Amazon's market valuation, Ms. Jackson told employees that Wal-Mart was not interested in acquiring Amazon, preferring instead to pick up pieces of the company if the gloomiest predictions about Amazon's future come to pass.  The relationship between Wal-Mart and Amazon has historically been a rocky one. Wal-Mart in 1999 filed a lawsuit against Amazon -- at the time touted as "the Wal-Mart of the Web" by dot-com enthusiasts -- and other defendants for recruiting Wal-Mart employees in an alleged bid to copy Wal-Mart's vaunted information systems.  Amazon and the other defendants settled the suit with Wal-Mart later that year by agreeing to reassign former Wal-Mart employees to tasks different from their assignments at Wal-Mart. No damages were paid by any party.
