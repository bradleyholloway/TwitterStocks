 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  A PAGE ONE ARTICLE yesterday about the appointment of a new chief executive for the Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. tire company incorrectly stated that John Lampe is the first American appointed by Bridgestone Corp. to head the U.S. unit of the Japanese company. Bridgestone appointed George W. Aucott chairman, CEO, and president in January 1990. He held the positions until March 1991.
