 Big Board Takes Action Against 11 People   By By Dean Starkman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1999  FLORIDA: Robert B. Lees of Delray Beach, a former broker, was barred for two years without admitting or denying a finding that, during January 1992 to August 1996, he made unsuitable transactions in 10 customers' accounts; made material misstatements to supervisors concerning the activity in the accounts; and caused books-and-records violations by entering inaccurate information on new account documents and inaccurately marking order tickets.  GEORGIA: After a contested hearing, C. Lance Lovett of Adel, a former broker, was permanently barred after being found guilty of misappropriating funds of a customer of his employer and commingling the customer's funds with his personal funds. An NYSE panel found that Mr. Lovett deposited a customer's check for $15,000 into his personal bank account and used the funds, without customer authorization, for his own purposes.  NEW YORK: Albert Michael Benincasa of Sea Cliff, a former broker, was barred for six months without admitting or denying findings that, during 1990 to 1995, he exercised discretionary power in the accounts of two customers without first obtaining written authorization and made transactions in the accounts that were excessive in frequency and unsuitable in view of the customers' investment objectives, securities experience and financial resources. A hearing panel also found that Mr. Benincasa caused a violation of books-and-records requirements by making inaccurate entries on updated new account forms for the customers.
