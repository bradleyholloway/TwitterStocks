 Books -- Bookmarks: Where Man O'War Meets Secretariat   By Turner, Richard, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2006  "Champions" tries to find a happy medium between the two camps. The book has handsome photographs of regal Thoroughbreds, jockeys in resplendent silks and champion race horses, from Man o' War and Seabiscuit to Secretariat and Funny Cide. There are also decade-by- decade accounts of these equine athletes by writers from the venerable Daily Racing Form, the book's publisher.  At the racetrack or in betting parlors around the country, handicappers clutching their Racing Forms squint at these charts, crammed with information about a particular horse and his previous races. One can glean what jockey was aboard him, who his sire was, what odds he went off on, how fast he ran the third and fourth furlongs, how wet the track was that day -- and on and on. The parade of data on each line is broken only at the end, with a pithy appraisal of his race, such as "Rallied, drew clear," or "Vied inside, gamely."  It's this information, when set alongside that of other horses in a race, that sends a wagerer into hours of pleasant study as he tries to predict how a race will shape up. ("Champions" explains how to decipher the past-performance information). Baseball fans may wallow in box scores, but horseplayers pore over their charts with rabbinical intensity. Plus, there's money to be won.
