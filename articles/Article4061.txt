 In France, a Drive-Up Grocery Takes Off --- Modifying an Old Model, Online Food Retailer Chronodrive Drops the Delivery but Keeps the Web Ordering   By Passariello, Christina, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2010  Delivery times, usually limited to working hours, were inconvenient, and costs were high -- home-delivery fees are about 12 euros, or $17 -- not feasible in a country where it is more common for people to pick up groceries several times a week, rather than loading up once a week as is typical in the U.S. Consumers in countries such as France "are so concerned about getting value, they'll do anything to save money," says Isabel Cavill, a senior retail analyst at consultancy Planet Retail in London. The pair founded Chronodrive in 2002, bringing in privately owned French supermarket chain Groupe Auchan as majority investor in order to get the bargaining power of a major grocery chain and keep prices competitive.
