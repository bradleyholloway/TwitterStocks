 The Naked Corporation   By Don Tapscott and David Ticoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2003  Consider some recent headlines. Richard Grasso quits the New York Stock Exchange after revelations about his $139.5 million pay package. Enron charges six banks with helping design secret deals "to manipulate and misstate Enron's financial condition." McDonald's and other fast food companies face lawsuits, consumer abandonment, and brand degradation for failing to clearly explain health risks, like obesity, in their advertising campaigns.  Transparency -- and its opposite, opacity -- is central to all these cases. NYSE directors should have made Mr. Grasso's pay packet public much earlier; and if they had done so, it no doubt would have been quite different. Enron's banks and managers would not have made their deals if they had realized that the new dynamics of capitalist markets would inevitably bring their actions to light. And though McDonald's has so far won in court, consumers now expect it to tell the truth about the effects of junk food.  Messrs. Tapscott and Ticoll are co-authors of "The Naked Corporation: How the Age of Transparency Will Revolutionize Business," out this month from Free Press. --- Submissions should be sent to managers.journal@wsj.com --- Journal Link: To view an archive of past Manager's Journal columns, please go to CareerJournal.com.
