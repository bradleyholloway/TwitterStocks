 AT&T Plans Local Service In New York   By By Stephanie N. Mehta, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1999  AT&T Corp., moving quickly to enter the local-telephone market, plans to offer residential service in New York by leasing Bell Atlantic Corp.'s phone network.  The long-distance giant has been pushing for years to find its way into local phone markets across the U.S., one big reason it decided to buy cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. But TCI has no cable-TV lines in New York state. And negotiations with Time Warner Inc. that would provide access to that company's 12 million cable customers are proceeding more slowly than AT&T had hoped.  By going through Bell Atlantic, AT&T is hoping to side-step a slew of cable-telephone technical issues. But it will be expensive, a big reason AT&T to date has avoided using Baby Bell lines to offer competing local services. Aiming to get the Bells to make their leasing prices more palatable, AT&T has filed complaints in a number of regulatory proceedings.
