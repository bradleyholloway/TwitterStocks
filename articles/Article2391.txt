 Intel and Motorola Lose Ground As Stocks Gain Again on Earnings   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1998  Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 2 7/16 to 18 7/16, losing most of the ground gained Tuesday, as investors received the details of the earnings report the company released after the market's close Tuesday.  Motorola, though, edged down 9/16 to 56 15/16. The stock had slipped to a 52-week low this week at 53 3/4, as investors awaited the earnings report it released Monday with some foreboding. Similarly, Intel (Nasdaq) gave back some ground, falling 1 1/2 to 75 7/16, even though its own better-than-expected earnings report, issued late Tuesday, seemed to quell some investors' anxieties about how devastating Asia's economic problems would prove to be for U.S. multinationals.  DeKalb Genetics' Class B shares dropped 3 15/16 to 28 1/8, and fell to a 52-week low intraday. The DeKalb, Ill., producer of hogs and engineered seeds, posted fiscal first-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street's forecasts. Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Dain Rauscher cut their ratings on the stock.
