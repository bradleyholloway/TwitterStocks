 Bush Is Warned Not to Veto Bill That Overturns FCC's TV Rule   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2003  The issue -- and threatened veto fight -- soon will be joined in a massive spending bill being written by the Appropriations leadership and scheduled for floor action in the next two weeks. Mr. [Ted Stevens] said he doesn't expect the bill will overrule all of the FCC decision, which also makes it easier for media companies to own newspapers and TV stations in the same market. But the Alaska Republican predicted the 35% cap will be restored and, given the stakes now, ought to be accepted by the administration.  "It's an omnibus bill. Obviously, I don't think that's a veto-able item," Mr. Stevens said. "You wouldn't veto the whole blasted thing for that."  "I believe Americans should be able to travel to Cuba," Joni Scott said. "I just went to pass out Bibles."
