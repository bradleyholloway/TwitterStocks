 Burger Declares War on Leaks; Now Will He Reprimand Himself?   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1986  The chief justice's question-and-answer session in Cleveland took place on Feb. 17. Three appeals asking the Supreme Court to uphold the constitutionality of the Gramm-Rudman law weren't even filed at the Supreme Court until Feb. 18 and weren't scheduled to be discussed by the justices until their closed-door conference on Feb. 21. Official announcement that the nine justices had agreed to an expedited schedule and to hear arguments on April 23 wasn't made until Feb. 24. Mr. Burger's Feb. 17 appearance was reported in the Cleveland Plain Dealer and the National Law Journal.
