 Kohl Softens Stance in Nuclear Dispute Improving Chances for a NATO Accord   By By Thomas F. O'Boyle, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1989  West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl took a step back from a dispute he triggered two weeks ago over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's negotiating strategy for short-range nuclear arms.  "We are willing to compromise and I see good chances for that," Mr. Kohl said at a press conference in Rome following his meeting there yesterday with Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita. A senior adviser to Mr. Kohl added: "Everyone wants a compromise. Nobody is interested in a heavy debate during the summit."  The debate within NATO over short-range arms negotiations was triggered when the Bonn government called for East-West talks to begin "soon." The U.S. and Britain have opposed negotiations. They fear such talks might lead to the elimination of land-based nuclear weapons in Europe and hence leave NATO exposed to the Warsaw Pact's overwhelming superiority in conventional arms.
