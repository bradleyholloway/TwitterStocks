 Review / Books: What's in a Name?   By By Frederika Randall, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2000  Peter Robb's "M: The Man Who Became Caravaggio" gives the artist usually known as Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio a name no one else has ever called him, as least so far as we know. Why "M"? Because the Caravaggio label came later, after the painter's death, and anyway he probably wasn't even born in the Lombard town of Caravaggio, where his family originated, but in nearby Milan, the author tells us. Of course that fatal initial means more. As much as a name, "M" is the author's flamboyant en garde, his way of warning us his sword is drawn and he's ready to pounce on conventional wisdom.
