PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz., Oct. 25â€” Margaret (Bibi) Levitz, the ex-wife of Leon Levitz, founder of a chain of furniture stores, was found dead today in the ruins of her home, which had been set on fire, the police said.  The body of Mrs. Levitz, who was 42 years old, was found in a bathroom under the collapsed roof and ceiling, said Debbie Valdivia, a dispatcher for the town's police department.  Mrs. Levitz, who was divorced last year, had been reported missing after the fire early Friday at her home, where she lived alone. Investigators said the fire was the work of an arsonist.  Miss Valdivia said she did not know why the body had remained undiscovered until 1 P.M. today. Mr. Levitz, a founder of the 72-store Levitz Furniture Corporation, lives in the Phoenix area. He had pressed for an investigation into his former wife's disappearance.
