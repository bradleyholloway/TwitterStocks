 Letters to the Editor: The Daunting Expense of Transplants   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2002  The Journal ran a story about one such patient, Susan Diaz ("Pass the Hat for a Transplant," June 4, 1999). As that story explained, Susan had been told she would have to raise a deposit of $385,000 before she could be placed on the organ donor waiting list for an intestinal transplant. Her family and friends formed a volunteer committee through National Foundation for Transplants to raise that daunting amount. Eventually the required deposit was lowered to $240,000. Her NFT volunteers succeeded in raising the deposit through tireless efforts stretching over 18 months. Fortunately, Susan was transplanted Jan. 9, 2001, and today she is doing well.
