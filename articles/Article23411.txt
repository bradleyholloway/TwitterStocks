 Travel Watch   By Holmes, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  Men looking for a little grooming during their vacation should check out the new ManScaping package at Le Merigot in Santa Monica, Calif. The luxury hotel, a Marriott property, has a 6,5000-square-foot spa and health club that is riding the wave of the ManScaping trend, a reference to tidying up a man's body. The package costs $610 and includes overnight accommodations, and waxing of the back, chest, shoulders and ears. For reservations, call Marriott at 1-888-539-7899 or online at www.LeMerigotHotel.com.  The price cut comes after 11 Hilton properties throughout the country, including Doubletree and Embassy Suites in California, Arizona and Florida, were accused of bundling per-night charges for resort services and amenities charged in addition to the per-night room rate. The litigation was brought by clients who stayed at a hotel before Jan. 1, 2004, paid a resort fee and either didn't know about it or claim they were misinformed about the charge.
