 Real Time: The Era of Bottom-Up Brands; Google's Dominance Is Changing the Rules By Which Brands Win Consumer Loyalty Online edition  By Fry, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2007  The idea is obviously crazy now, but don't give Time Warner a break based on hindsight -- it was crazy then, too.
