 Stryker to Buy Pfizer Unit for $1.9 Billion --- Planned Deal Would Make Medical-Products Firm Leader in the Industry   By By Steven Lipin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  Stryker Corp., a Kalamazoo, Mich., maker of orthopedic products and medical instruments, has agreed to acquire Pfizer Inc.'s Howmedica unit for $1.9 billion, the latest in a string of deals in the medical-products sector.  People familiar with the matter said little-known Stryker won an auction for Howmedica, which is in a similar business of manufacturing orthopedic instruments. An announcement is expected as early as today.  Stryker has revenue of about $980 million, and the acquisition of the Howmedica division, with estimated sales of more than $800 million, would catapult Stryker to the No. 1 or No. 2 position in the medical-products industry. With the purchase, Stryker is expected to have 15% of the roughly $10 billion global orthopedic market, and more than 20% of the reconstructive-device market.
