 Muni Bonds Can Cost More to Trade Than Stocks   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2004  The study, presented yesterday by SEC Chief Economist Lawrence Harris at a conference in Ottawa, Canada, showed that individual investors trading tax-advantaged municipal bonds pay an "effective spread" of 2% of the securities' price.  "Municipal bonds are expensive" for individual investors to trade, according to the study, written by Mr. Harris and Michael Piwowar. Mr. Harris is on leave from his job as a finance professor at the University of Southern California, and Mr. Piwowar is on a temporary leave from Iowa State University.  If new rules are approved when the MSRB meets this week, public pricing information for most municipal bonds starting next year will be posted within 15 minutes of a trade. "We expect that ongoing regulatory initiatives to increase transparency in the municipal-bond market" will lead to improvements that will help individual investors, the study says.
