 Toronto Strikes Gold as Center of Mining Finance   By By Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1997  New York may be a nerve center of world finance, but when it comes to mining finance, this Canadian city is increasingly the place to be.  Although a financial scandal involving Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was expected to cast a pall over Toronto's reputation, the city is attracting a growing number of companies from the U.S. and even from other continents. The companies are seeking a pool of institutions that know the mining field well and are comfortable with its inherently risky projects. "We went across the border to use the underwriting expertise of the Canadians," says Donald Robson, chief financial officer of Getchell Gold Corp., an Englewood, Colo., company developing a big Nevada gold mine. Getchell hired four Canadian investment banks to underwrite a $150 million equity issue last spring, after using a mix of Canadian, U.S. and European underwriters in a previous deal.  Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. says it plans to move its international mining-finance operations to Toronto from New York by the end of this year. And Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, a unit of German banking giant Deutsche Bank, recently chose Toronto as its international headquarters for mining finance. "It makes a lot of sense to have the senior part of the group where the greatest volume of mining companies, mining finance, new issues etc. is located," says Tye Burt, head of the new Toronto operation.
