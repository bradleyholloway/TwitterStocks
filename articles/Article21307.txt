 Eastern Pilots Seek Meeting With Pritzker --- Union's Bid to Find Buyer Follows Revised Accord On Trump Shuttle Deal   By By Jonathan Dahl and Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1989  The pilots say they hope to meet with the Chicago financier this week, in yet another attempt by an Eastern union to find a new buyer and remove the carrier's ownership from Frank Lorenzo, whom the unions despise. But the unions' past attempts haven't worked. And there is no sign over the weekend that Mr. Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., is seriously negotiating with Mr. Pritzker.  Meanwhile, one uncertainty for Eastern was removed -- at least for now. On Friday, developer Donald Trump said he agreed to buy Eastern's shuttle for the same $365 million he originaly agreed upon; he will receive, though, 21 planes instead of 17. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump tried to shave his original price offer by a third, saying the month-long strike by Eastern's unions had diminished the shuttle's value.  For now, that approval seems likely; even Eastern unions, after previously opposing the sale, apparently support Mr. Trump. And sources close to Mr. Trump have said that the shuttle agreement provides for a substantial payoff to the developer if Eastern backs off. But if a higher bid emerged for the shuttle or the entire airline, Eastern's creditors might insist that the airline scrap its deal with Mr. Trump.
