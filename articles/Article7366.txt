 The Population Bomb Ticks Inside Africa   By By J. Joseph Speidel, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1985  Is it just bad luck? Have cyclical vagaries of weather created an emergency that is unlikely to recur? Unfortunately, this is not the case. Certainly bad weather has been a significant factor in 1983 and 1984. But it would have been tolerable had Africa not by then experienced 25 years of declining per-capita agricultural production. It is intolerable because rapid population growth outstripped the increase in agricultural output and depleted the food reserves of many countries.  What of agricultural productivity? Despite government agricultural monopolies that have depressed prices, production has increased a respectable average of 2% a year since 1967 -- but this is a full percentage point below the rate of population growth, so food production per capita has steadily declined. Furthermore, to maintain even this inadequate increase has required clearing forests and overcropping fragile arid and semi-arid lands. The result has been rapid soil erosion and dramatic expansion of deserts, degrading the agricultural resource base. A few countries can bring additional land under cultivation, but in East Africa most increases in food production must be wrung from currently available land.
