 Letters to the Editor: A Poor Deal for the Impoverished   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1986  Studies by economists from Harvard, MIT, Wharton and Southern Methodist have concluded, in separate analyses, that this legislation would put tremendous upward pressure on rent levels because it repeals or reduces many of the tax incentives for rental housing. To the extent the value of tax incentives is lost, builders will construct less rental housing or look for higher rents to make up the lost tax benefits. The studies project that rent increases of 22% ($77 a month) would be needed. Without such increases to make up for the lost tax benefits, there would not be an adequate return to make the production of housing units feasible. This would not be the case for more expensive ownership or vacation housing that retained their tax benefits.
