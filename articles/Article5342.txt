 Senate Panel Votes to End Lid on Damages   By Karr, Albert R, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1992  The Senate Labor Committee approved an Equal Remedies Act, legislation that would remove limits on damages that women, disabled people and religious minorities may seek for workplace discrimination. The measure faces a tough fight since the Bush administration wants the caps left in place, while women and civil-rights groups want them removed.
