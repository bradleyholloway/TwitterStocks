 A Lot Of Restaurants Now Serve Rudeness With the Rigatoni --- Bad Manners Go Unchecked At Places Taking Success And Clientele for Granted   By By Kathleen A. Hughes and Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1986  When Sarah Pillsbury called for dinner reservations one evening at Le Chardonnay, a Los Angeles restaurant, the maitre d' admonished her, "Well, I happen to have a cancellation, but in the future please do not think you can call at 6:45 for an 8 o'clock reservation."  Move over, Paris. Fashionable restaurants in Los Angeles and New York are rivaling the French in their rudeness to guests. Food experts blame it on the explosion of expensive new places to eat and on the number of upwardly mobile young men and women who migrate from one hot new restaurant to the next, company credit cards in hand.  Not soon enough. "You're late. You lose your place. You are now treated as though you walked in off the street," said the restaurant's maitre d', according to Mr. Stadiem. Mr. Stadiem says he explained that he had indeed arrived on time and dropped the fact that his companion, a French journalist, was interested in writing about the restaurant. "We don't care about the French magazines," was the rejoinder, according to Mr. Stadiem.
