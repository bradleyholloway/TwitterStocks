 Mutual Funds / Managed Investing: Zweig Guarantee Helps Set Fund Apart   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1988  Newsletter guru Martin E. Zweig is making waves with an unusual program that guarantees investors a minimum annual payout of 10% of his stock fund's net asset value.  His $345 million Zweig Fund gained 14% last year, surpassing all other diversified closed-end stock funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. This year, the fund gained 9.1% through May 31, slightly behind the 10.5% gain in similar funds during the same period, according to Lipper.  Under the program, investors are guaranteed a cash distribution of at least 10% of the fund's net asset value; if net investment income and net short-term realized capital gains are less than that, the difference is paid out of net realized long-term capital gains. And should the fund fail to earn 10% through net investment income and short-term and long-term realized gains, it will distribute the remainder as a tax-free return of capital.
