 Out of Control: How Unpreparedness Turned the Alaska Spill Into Ecological Debacle --- Account of First 4 Days Shows Mishaps and Lost Chances As the Oil Drifted Away --- A Frantic Coast Guard Call   By By Ken Wells and Charles McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1989  VALDEZ, Alaska -- It is the afternoon of March 27, four days after the Exxon Valdez spewed 10 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. After several false starts, Exxon is at last spraying the huge slick with chemical dispersants. A C-130 plane, chartered by Exxon for the task, is roaring across the sound and is supposed to stop spraying more than a mile from the stricken tanker. But to the horror of the Coast Guard crew aboard the vessel, the plane inexplicably keeps on coming, unleashing some of its load from an ear-splitting altitude of 50 feet, directly on the men.  Nothing much has gone right for Exxon from the very moment the Exxon Valdez went aground early in the morning of March 24, causing the largest oil spill ever in North America and an environmental disaster covering 1,300 square miles. Nor for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the eight-company consortium that operates the Valdez oil terminal and that was supposed to mount the initial defense against the spill.  The delays have sparked heated criticism of Exxon and Alyeska, compounded by a finding last Thursday that the tanker's captain was intoxicated under Coast Guard rules nine hours after the accident. Exxon also admitted that it knew the captain had gone through an alcohol detoxification program, but still put him in command of its largest tanker. Federal and state criminal investigations are under way, and four lawsuits have been filed, and are expected to seek punitive damages. The Coast Guard is also trying to explain its own shortcomings during the affair.
