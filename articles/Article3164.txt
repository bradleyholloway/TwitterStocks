 Questions Bedeviled Bush On Prewar Claims About Iraqi Arms.   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2003  CIA chief Tenet took blame for not quashing a specious report of alleged Iraqi efforts to buy African uranium, and the president stood by him, but the episode has opened a chorus of criticism that grounds for war were inflated and the price minimized. An interim council took power in Iraq, including Pentagon favorite Chalabi. Rumsfeld warned troops face a dangerous summer as the U.S. opened a new offensive against insurgents and turned over policing in Fallujah to an Iraqi force.  Israel's Sharon flew to Britain and will be in Washington this month as Palestinians demanded Arafat be allowed to travel. A mob threatened a pollster who found Palestinians would take money over a "right of return."  Al Qaeda has trained as many as 120,000 terrorists and some are in the U.S., Sen. Graham, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on TV. He cited Congress's Sept. 11 inquiry.
