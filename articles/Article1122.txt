 Sri Chinmoy Seeks To Claim a Title: Stunt Man Supreme --- The Guru Thrills Devotees By Lifting Heavy Objects, Playing 25 Instruments   By By James T. Areddy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 13, 1989  Last summer, at a shopping center in California, the 57-year-old guru lifted two San Francisco 49ers. His press kit claims even greater accomplishments. Mr. Chinmoy, it says, also has hoisted, if only for a fraction of an inch, airplanes, helicopters, sailboats, cars, trucks, an elephant, and a grand total of 700 people, individually and in small groups.  Less enlightened souls may ponder the relevance of pumping iron to, say, world peace. Mr. Chinmoy declined to be interviewed for this article, but he offers an explanation through his lawyer, Rudra Tamm. Mr. Tamm maintains that weight lifting is "the perfect analogy to the spiritual life."  Mr. Chinmoy's exploits wow his flock, which, by the estimate of his spokesman Agraha Levine, numbers 1,500. "Sri Chinmoy lifted me up like I was nothing," says Khalil ElAmin, a body builder from Olympia, Wash., who says he holds the titles of Mr. America, Mr. North America, Mr. Northwest Natural, Mr. Western Oregon, Mr. Washington and Mr. Olympia Natural. Mr. El-Amin adds: "If he can lift me and others, then I can reach my goal to be Mr. Olympia."
