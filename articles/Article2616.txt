 Taste -- Review & Outlook: God and Man in Kansas   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 13, 1999  Whatever. It is not our purpose today to throw in with either the Kansas Board of Education, which voted this week to drop biological evolution from its curriculum guidelines, or with the biologists now screaming that the creationism movement is driving out serious science.  We do, however, very much want to discuss driving important things out of public life. Specifically we have in mind the Supreme Court decisions way back in the early 1960s that led over the years not merely to banning prayer from the schools but to wiping God and religion out of textbooks, graduation ceremonies and anywhere else the ACLU and its ilk could find Him hiding inside a public school.  "About 35 years ago, you folks banned our religion from the public schools. So we've just voted to drop your religion from the public schools. Now maybe you'd like to sit down and negotiate a deal."
