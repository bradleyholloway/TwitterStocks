 Politics '88 (A Special Report) --- Loose Lips: A Look at the History Of Sinking Campaigns   By By James M. Perry, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1987  And Sen. Biden, the Democratic Demosthenes, unhorsed for borrowing class-conscious lines from a celebrated speech by Neil Kinnock, long-winded leader of Great Britain's socialist party. It turned out, too, that Mr. Biden really wasn't the student at college and law school he had said he was. "I exaggerate when I get angry," said the senator, in a line that would have sent H.L. Mencken running for his trusty Corona typewriter.  The Messrs. Hart and Biden weren't the first victims of campaign gaffes, nor will they be the last. Blunders and bloopers have a long and -- to tell the truth -- honorable tradition. To err, after all, is human. Politicians, especially since the advent of the ubiquitous TV eye, tend to err in very public ways.  "I don't believe," said President Ford in his second debate with Jimmy Carter, "that the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I don't consider that the Romanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union." President Ford clearly was a man who had never celebrated Captive Nations Week.
