 Prepayment Clauses Come With Pitfalls   By By Ruth Simon, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  "You can have a prepayment penalty with a lower rate or no prepayment penalty and a higher rate," explains Herbert Sandler, chairman and chief executive officer of World Savings Bank and its parent, Golden West Financial Corp., of Oakland, Calif. About 70% of World Savings customers choose a loan with a prepayment penalty, Mr. Sandler says. Other major lenders that have prepayment penalties on some loans include Bank of America Corp., Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., First Nationwide Mortgage Corp. and Washington Mutual Inc.  As mortgage rates dipped to 30-year lows earlier this year, homeowners rued their decision to agree to prepayment penalties in the past year or two. Robert Schmermund, managing director of corporate communications for America's Community Bankers, a trade group in Washington, D.C., about 10 months ago replaced his 8.5% mortgage with a 30-year fixed-rate loan that carries a 7.5% rate and a prepayment penalty. "I was willing to sign up for the prepayment penalty because I got the best deal I could get," says Mr. Schmermund, who borrowed more than $300,000. "If I had a crystal ball, I probably wouldn't have done what I did," he adds. Indeed, the penalty discouraged Mr. Schmermund from refinancing a month ago when the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped to 6.6%. The average has since climbed back to about 7.1%.  Many states restrict the use of prepayment penalties by state-chartered lenders, but that hasn't proved a big impediment to lenders. For one thing, many federally chartered lenders are free to impose prepayment penalties, provided they are adequately disclosed. And even state-chartered lenders can get around these rules because of an obscure law that allows them to subject "alternative" home financing such as adjustable-rate mortgages to rules issued by federal regulators, which don't restrict them.
