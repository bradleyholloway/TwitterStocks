 De Beers Says Diamonds Shine Again, But Dealers Dispute Recovery Report   By By Neil Behrmann, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1986  De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls about 80% of the world's diamond sales, says a recovery is under way in the market for rough, uncut diamonds. But dealers say any upturn in the industry's deep five-year slump is uneven at best.  A spate of dealer bankruptcies last year in Antwerp, New York and Japan, along with high gem inventories, the disinflationary effect of falling oil prices and other factors weigh against any broad recovery, some dealers and analysts say. A Belgian tax-fraud inquiry involving some diamond dealers in Antwerp has further clouded the outlook there.  De Beers cites a 48% second-half gain from year-earlier levels in its sales of rough, uncut diamonds as evidence of a recovery. A surge last September, October and November drove six-month sales to a five-year high of $986 million from $668 million a year earlier, De Beers says.
