JERUSALEM, Aug. 16â€” While the names Begin, Sharon, Habib and Arafat have been constantly on the lips and minds of Israelis during the war in Lebanon, attention has now begun to focus on a new name: Aharon Ahiaz.  Mr. Ahiaz, an air force pilot who was shot down over southern Lebanon on June 6, the first day of the invasion, is the only Israeli prisoner being held in west Beirut by the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israeli officials say his unconditional release is the last major demand that must be met before Israel agrees to the Palestinian evacuation.  Israel also demands the return of the bodies of nine soldiers killed in Lebanon, but the freedom of Mr. Ahiaz is of prime concern. His captivity has provoked sporadic controversy because of attempts by two prominent Israelis to visit him.  Israeli officials say the talks on a Palestinian withdrawal do not involve the release of two pilots shot down during the war and being held by the Syrians. That, the officials say, would be an Israeli demand in future talks on the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from Lebanon. Israeli military officials say that they are holding 7,400 Palestinian guerrillas captured during the war, but that the disposition of these prisoners will not be determined until after the evacuation of west Beirut. Israeli Pilot Sent Two Letters  Little is publicly known about the captured pilot. The military spokesman here would say only that Mr. Ahiaz was born in 1946, has a wife and two children and flew a Skyhawk fighter-bomber. The spokesman declined to disclose the pilot's rank or say whether he was a regular or reserve officer.  But his wife, Yael, and his father-in-law, Aharon Sakharov, discussed the pilot's situation briefly today by telephone from their homes in Herzliya.  ''I don't think anything right now,'' said Mrs. Ahiaz, with apparent nervousness in her voice. ''Let him first come home.'' Her father, Mr. Sakharov, who is in the banking and insurance business, said Mrs. Ahiaz was ''managing just like any other mother in Israel while her husband is in the army.'' He said the older child, Ari, 3 years old, ''understands more or less'' about his father's captivity. The other child, Itai, is one year old.  Mr. Sakharov said the family had received two letters from the prisoner through the Red Cross, but he declined to disclose the contents. He also said he doubted that the Red Cross had been able to deliver one of the packages the family had sent the pilot two weeks ago, although a package sent about a month ago did apparently reach him. Photographed and Interviewed  Since he was captured, the pilot has been seen twice in photographs that were distributed by United Press International. In an interview with U.P.I. on June 28, he said that he was being well cared for and that the Palestinians had saved his life, which had been threatened by farmers when he landed by parachute after his plane was hit. The pilot, who was accompanied to the interview by two guards, was quoted as having said that he hoped the Israelis would not invade west Beirut.  The only Israeli to visit the prisoner was Uri Avneri, a leftist former member of Parliament. After a visit July 3, he said Mr. Ahiaz was in relatively good spirits and had not been seriously injured when he was shot down.  An attempted visit by Abie Nathan, the self-styled peace advocate, aroused controversy in Israel. Mr. Nathan said he met with P.L.O. officials in west Beirut on July 7 and asked for the release of Mr. Ahiaz. The Palestinians refused, he reported, but said that Mrs. Ahiaz and her children would be permitted a visit. Mrs. Ahiaz declined the offer. The Minister of Tourism, Avraham Sharir, has urged Attorney General Yitzhak Zamir to take measures to prevent Israelis from visiting P.L.O. officials in time of war.
