 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1989  REAGAN'S FINAL BUDGET has presented Bush with some difficult decisions. The president-elect's pledge not to raise taxes or cut Social Security leaves him little choice but to back most of Reagan's proposals, which include steep cuts in domestic programs. But the budget has raised hackles in Congress, and many there are waiting to see if Bush softens the plan or reneges on the tax issue.  The dollar's rally slowed following a flurry of central bank intervention. Bond prices eased, but stocks rose. Rates on new short-term Treasury bills hit a nearly four-year high.  Two big cable TV operations were sold separately by Cooke Cablevision and New York Times Co. for a total of almost $2 billion. The sales indicate the recent flood of such properties on the market hasn't hurt demand.
