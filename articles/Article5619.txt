 Middle Class Immigrants   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  What's the most common surname for new home buyers in Los Angeles County? It's not "Smith." When a California firm called Axiom DataQuick Information Systems reviewed home titles to uncover the most common last names of buyers in 1997, it found that "Garcia" topped the list. Number two was "Lee" -- an Asian name. Numbers three through 10 included "(Gregory) Rodriguez," "Lopez," "Gonzalez," "Martinez," "Hernandez," "Kim," and "Perez." "Smith" was there, too -- at number nine. And when DataQuick ran the numbers for the entire state, it came up with Latin and Asian names again, albeit in a different order. Altogether the immigrant presence provided quite a contrast to 1989, when DataQuick's statewide list of the top 10 contained only one Latin name.  The growing prosperity of California's immigrants is important when you consider where the country was earlier this decade: mired in a frenzy of anti-immigrant sentiment, led mostly by Republican politicians and intellectuals. Five years ago, restrictionist lawmakers were telling us that immigrants were an underclass who would either stay on welfare forever or, worse, give up the dole to steal American jobs. Nobody was louder on this topic than politicians in California (save, perhaps, the occasional Senator from Wyoming). Some zealots even went so far as to push legislation that would have cut immigrants off from emergency earthquake aid.
