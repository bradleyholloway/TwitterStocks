 China and Africa Strengthen Ties With $1.9 Billion in Deals   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2006  China is unapologetic about its need for African resources to supply its booming economy, but its leaders also point to the construction projects, technical training and low-price goods it is bringing to Africa. "In this new era, China and Africa share increasing common interests and have a growing mutual need," Chinese President Hu Jintao said in a speech.  Mr. Hu, signaling that China isn't acting purely out of self interest, promised to provide Africa with $5 billion in preferential funding in the next three years. China also will double its aid to Africa and cancel some debt owed to China by the poorest African nations, he said, though Mr. Hu didn't put a value on either commitment.  "Economic cooperation should be at the core of the renewed Sino- Africa strategic partnership," said Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Messrs. Hu and Meles, with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, read a declaration calling for strengthening China-Africa ties on a basis of "political equality and mutual trust."
