 Pertamina Battles Claim on Its U.S. Assets   By By Sadanand Dhume, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2002  Karaha Bodas Co., a Cayman Islands-registered concern controlled by American investors, has filed garnishment and discovery requests in Texas, New York and Delaware against U.S.-based banks believed to hold Pertamina funds and U.S. energy companies that do business with Pertamina.  For Pertamina, a loss in the Karaha case could lay the state oil company open to similar claims from other suspended geothermal power projects. For foreign oil companies operating in Indonesia, which have production contracts with Pertamina, the prospect of being punished financially if Pertamina loses a legal confrontation will add another layer of uncertainty to an already cloudy investment climate here.  Pertamina is going to court in the U.S. and Indonesia to try to overturn the award. The company has appealed in a New Orleans court against a Houston-based judge's ruling upholding the arbitration award. Separately, a senior Pertamina official said the company will also ask a Jakarta court to intervene to "settle" its dispute with Karaha.
