 Auto Firms' Sales Slowed at End of '84, But Yearly Figures Were Best Since '79   By By Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1985  Sales for domestic makers fell 2% in the final 10 days of the month, compared with a year earlier, following a 3% decline during mid-December. Only a relatively strong performance early in the month kept domestic-car sales for all of December 4.2% ahead of December 1983.  On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, December looked much better. Domestic sales amounted to an 8.3 million annual rate, based on a Commerce Department formula. That was a significant improvement from a 7.1 million rate in November and a 6.9 million rate in October. It also topped the year-earlier December rate of eight million.  General Motors Corp. was the main drag on the market during December, with sales up only 1.3%, compared with gains of 12% at Ford Motor Co. and 12.2% at Chrysler Corp. GM, which represents more than half of all domestic cars sold in the U.S., has consistently shown lower sales growth than its two major competitors since United Auto Workers strikes last fall cut GM car output. In fact, December was the first month since the strikes that GM showed a year-to-year increase in monthly sales.
