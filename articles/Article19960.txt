 Raw-Sugar Futures Fall Off High As Brazil Ethanol Rumors Swirl   By Buchanan, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2006  Rumors that officials in top producer Brazil were considering cutting the cane-based ethanol mix in gasoline sold nationally to 20% from 25% were one of several factors spurring the selloff, said Michael McDougall, senior vice president with Fimat USA in New York. A reduction in Brazil's ethanol share would lower immediate demand for cane.  "Funds liquidated about 4,000 lots of futures this morning, and were probably influenced by a pickup in producer selling when the market neared 15 cents last week," Mr. McDougall said. "The trade, or commercials, after being aggressive buyers in futures since September, was surprised by the sudden price drop."
