 Small Businesses Say Superfund Overhaul Falls Short --- Proposed Law Wouldn't Eliminate The Burden of Retroactive Liability   By By Jeanne Saddler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1994  Entrepreneurs have long chafed over the heavy legal expenses and credit risks created by the 1980 Superfund law. Small-business owners and trade groups want to eliminate their open-ended liability for wastes sites used before 1980 and to speed resolution of their cleanup responsibilities.  The administration's revision of the Superfund law, which Mr. Clinton is expected to unveil later this month, wouldn't go that far, however. The proposal would tax insurance companies to create a $500 million-a-year fund, which could be used for settling legal disputes between businesses and their insurers.  The federal settlement fund could absorb as much as 80% of a company's liability for cleaning up hazardous wastes dumped before 1980. Therefore, businesses would still retain certain cleanup responsibilities. The new fund wouldn't be available to companies that still choose to sue their insurance companies for a cleanup's entire cost. In addition, the fund probably wouldn't cover businesses that lacked environmental insurance before 1980.
