 Price of 30-Year Bond Recovers to End Higher, After Easing on Economy Data, Technical Factors   By By Guy Dixon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 20, 1998  Late yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 3/32 point, or $0.938 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 103 3/32. Its yield stood at 5.893%, down from 5.900% late yesterday, as bond yields move the opposite way as prices.  Wage inflation was still very much in the mind of market watchers after the Federal Reserve's mention of higher wages in its Beige Book report Wednesday, Ms. Schaja added. The Beige Book is a periodic assessment of economic conditions in various Fed districts.  Yesterday, the Commerce Department's report on trade in January said U.S. exports fell to some key markets in Asia. The U.S. trade deficit with a group of countries that includes Hong Kong and South Korea jumped to $2.19 billion from $841 million in December. However, the deficit with Japan narrowed to $4.36 billion in January from December's $5.11 billion.
