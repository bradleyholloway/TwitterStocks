 Despite Weak Yuan, Other Asia Currencies May Rally, Help U.S.   By Karmin, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2003  That would be welcomed by many U.S. multinationals. Avon Products Inc., for example, received 13% of its 2002 net sales from Asia. Since the beauty-product company's transactions are conducted in local currencies, any strengthening of Asia's currencies means higher earnings when translated to dollars, says Dennis Ling, Avon's treasurer. "And our view is that Asian currencies will strengthen," he adds.  While weak currencies are desirable in periods of deflation, Mr. [Marcel Kasumovich] suggests that some prices in Asia look poised to rise, providing a more favorable backdrop for a strengthening currency. Consumer prices are relatively stable throughput the region, but he notes there are pockets of price pressures. China's raw-material prices, for one, rose 8.7% in the first half of the year. What's more, Merrill Lynch forecasts that Asia's inflation will exceed that of the U.S. in 2004, which would be the first time that has happened since 1998.  Merrill also predicts that, China's current reluctance aside, the yuan will start to appreciate against the dollar sometime during the second half of next year. But Mr. Kasumovich argues that Asia's other currencies will begin to appreciate well before China adjusts its currency regime. "Any sign of greater official commitment to such an eventuality," he writes in a recent report, "is sufficient to cause Asia's floating currencies to react."
