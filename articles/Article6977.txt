 Honda Raises Its Racing Stakes With a Full F1-Team Ownership   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2005  "We began negotiations in the summer to increase our share from 45% to full acquisition," said Hiroshi Oshima, Honda's operating officer for corporate communications and motor sports.  Honda said it would rename the new team in agreement with future sponsors. "The name will be Honda something-or-other but we will have to talk with the sponsors before making that decision," Mr. Oshima said.  Since 2000, when Honda signed an engine supply and joint chassis- development contract with BAR, the car maker has been stepping up its efforts to strengthen its F1 motor-sports activities. The BAR Formula One team was bought by a joint venture between engine partners Honda and BAT in January.
