 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2005; Surging World Markets Entice U.S. Investors   By Karmin, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2006  "Corporate profits have grown more rapidly in Europe and Japan than in the U.S., even though their economies have grown less rapidly," says Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "The main reason is that those companies are cutting costs in ways that, even a few years ago, global investors didn't think possible."  "European companies were doing what U.S. companies did in the 1990s," says David Rosenberg, a managing director for Citigroup Private Bank. "They were applying technology and cost cutting to make themselves more efficient."
