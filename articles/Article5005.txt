 U.S. Prosecutors Accuse Consultant In Bribery Scheme   By By Edward T. Pound, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1989  Both Messrs. Jacobson, 45, and Klos, 45, have agreed to plead guilty to the criminal complaints, according to people familiar with the agreements. Mr. Klos, also of East Petersburg, was a close associate of United Chem-Con's president, James Christian, and also could be a significant witness in the McDade inquiry. Lawyers for Messrs. Jacobson and Klos declined to comment.  Prosecutors said Mr. Jacobson conspired with Mr. Christian to pay $120,000 in bribes to a Navy official, Richard Ramirez, in 1982 and 1983, for his help in steering Navy contracts for 40-foot steel cargo containers and related equipment to United Chem-Con. The company received $54 million in Navy contracts. Mr. Ramirez pleaded guilty last September in New York federal court to accepting the payments and, like Messrs. Jacobson and Klos, is cooperating in the continuing Philadelphia probe.
