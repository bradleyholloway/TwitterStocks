 Tax Break May Be Hiding in Your Home   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2004  In general, property-tax bills are calculated by multiplying the assessed value of a home by the local tax rate. In some places, homes are assessed at a percentage of market value, in others at market value. So homeowners should make sure their houses are assessed at the same ratio as their neighbors'. They also should make sure the value at which their home is assessed is in line with that of similar homes in the area.  Some states and cities grant abatements to homeowners who make property improvements. In those cases, homeowners wouldn't have to pay taxes on the increased assessed value resulting from the improvements for a number of years. The applicable taxes would in effect be frozen at the pre-improvement assessed value of the home. The abatement period can be up to 10 years in some cases.  Circuit-breaker programs, named after the electrical devices that shut off power to prevent circuits from overloading, generally come in the form of tax credits (or exemptions) that vary with income. Most of these programs are limited to low- and moderate-income homeowners and target homeowners at least 55 years old, or the disabled. Many circuit breaker programs set thresholds that property taxes can't exceed. In general, when property taxes exceed the threshold, the homeowner gets a rebate of some or all the property tax owed.
