 Cendant Ex-Chief Is Rewarded In Other Ways Besides $1 Salary   By Whitehouse, Kaja, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2006  The spinoffs of Realogy and Wyndham Worldwide brought Mr. [Henry R. Silverman] a change-of-control payment of $62.7 million, including $28.3 million for unearned salary and bonuses. The remaining $34.4 million funded Mr. Silverman's purchase of a life-insurance policy from the company.  A Cendant spokeswoman said Mr. Silverman, who founded a predecessor company in 1990, earned the payout and the retirement perks because he "created billions of dollars of wealth for shareholders," and is responsible for creating $17.5 billion in market capitalization for the four companies that until several weeks ago were Cendant.
