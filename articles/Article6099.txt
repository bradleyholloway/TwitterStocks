 On Sports / World Cup 1998: The Kickoff: In Typically French Fashion, the Cup Begins   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1998  ST. DENIS, France -- The soccer World Cup began this week on a high level of abstraction. There wasn't a soccer ball to be seen in Tuesday night's parade at the Place de la Concorde in Paris that heralded the monthlong competition. The centerpieces of that fete were four 60-foot-high inflated plastic figures -- one purple, one orange, one light blue and one greenish-yellow -- that "walked" on motorized feet and symbolized "the anthropological and cultural origins of man," according to the show's press guide. As those giants trudged, fancifully costumed creatures gamboled in their midst, making the scene a cross between the Cirque du Soleil and "Gulliver's Travels."  There were five huge soccer balls in the ceremony that preceded the opening game Wednesday in the new Stade de France in this Paris suburb, but they sprouted from huge fabric flowers and were surrounded not by people eager to kick them, but by figures of insects, turf-headed green guys and pollen-casting stiltwalkers. Later, the "balls" cast off their skins and emitted pollen (balloons, really) themselves.  Things finally got down to cases in the game that followed. It involved defending-champion Brazil, which defeated Scotland, 2-1, and soccer is never an abstraction there. This was made clear in 1962, after Brazil had won the second of what would be four Cup titles. "We have neither rice nor bread, but we have Pele, Garrincha and Amarildo, and we have the Cup. That is what matters," said Joao Goulart, the country's president at the time.
