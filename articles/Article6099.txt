 HHS's Thompson Faces Angry Crowd At AIDS Meeting   By By Mark Schoofs and Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  Yelling "Shame, shame," the protesters carried signs accusing the U.S. of the "murder and neglect" of people with AIDS. They believe the U.S. is giving too little money to the global AIDS fight, now estimated to require about $10 billion annually.  Mr. [Tommy Thompson] continued his speech, though it was inaudible because of the jeers and whistles. Afterward, he defended the U.S., saying no prior administration or foreign country had done as much on the issue. "The U.S. can't do it alone," he said, noting that current U.S. spending for AIDS overseas is about $1 billion, including research.  The $2.5 billion figure is the target that many advocates have urged for the U.S. Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, speaking here, said the U.S. actually should be spending $3.5 billion in 2003 on the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, including $2.5 billion to the United Nation's Global Fund alone. "Massive confusion by the world's most important donor" is how Mr. Sachs described U.S. efforts to fight AIDS, and he also criticized U.N. agencies.
