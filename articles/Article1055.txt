 Liggett Ordered to Pay $400,000 In Damages for Smoker's Death --- Jury's Ruling on Liability Is First Against Industry; Conspiracy Isn't Found --- This artile was prepared by Alix M. Freedman in New York And Timothy K. Smith and John Helyar in Atlanta   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1988  A federal jury found that Liggett Group Inc. wrongly implied that cigarettes were safe in its advertising before 1966 and awarded $400,000 in damages to the widower of a smoker who died of lung cancer.  The six-person jury in Newark, N.J., also held that Durham, N.C.-based Liggett was aware of the dangers of smoking and should have warned Rose Cipollone and other customers before 1966, when Congress started requiring tobacco companies to put warnings on cigarette packages. Mrs. Cipollone, a life-long smoker, died in 1984.  However, in one of the most crucial parts of the closely watched case, the jury found that Liggett and the other defendants -- the Philip Morris Inc. unit of Philip Morris Cos. and the Lorillard Inc. unit of Loews Corp., both based in New York -- didn't conspire to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking before 1966.
