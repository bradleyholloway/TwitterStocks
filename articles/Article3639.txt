 Scrushy Loses Retrial Motion; Challenge to Jury Mix Remains   By Brooks, Rick, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2006  The political-corruption conviction isn't related to the $2.7 billion accounting fraud at HealthSouth, a Birmingham, Ala., surgery and rehabilitation-services provider. Mr. [Richard M. Scrushy], ousted from HealthSouth in 2003 and acquitted last year of criminal fraud charges, has insisted he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Last month, Mr. Scrushy and the company settled claims tied to bonuses he received during the fraud and legal bills, with HealthSouth recording a $35 million "recovery" from him and a $10 million reduction in a legal-fees reserve, according to securities filings. Mr. Scrushy maintains HealthSouth violated his contract when it fired him, while the company has sued him for allegedly breaching his fiduciary obligations.
