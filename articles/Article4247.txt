 Ohio Firm Is Entangled in Confusion Over U.S. Policy on High-Tech Exports   By By Michael Wels Hirschorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1987  COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Shortly before 5 p.m. on June 1, 1985, eight U.S. customs agents pulled up to the front door of Columbus Instruments International Corp. here and presented its president, Jan Czekajewski, with a search warrant.  Two days earlier, agents at New York's Kennedy Airport had confiscated 69 boxes of medical equipment and computers, valued at $228,812. Columbus Instruments was sending the equipment, used in medical research, to a Moscow conference on biomedical technology. Agents thought they had caught the company trying to disguise computers, which they claimed were banned for export to the Soviet Union, as medical equipment and sell them behind the Iron Curtain. The most powerful of the computers in question is a clone of the IBM PC XT, which International Business Machines Corp. already sells directly to the Soviet Union.  None of this is much consolation to Mr. Czekajewski, 52, who remains the target of a grand jury investigation, although no charges have been filed. The assistant U.S. attorney handling the case wouldn't confirm or deny that such an investigation was taking place. But a Commerce Department official said the government's case hinges on a pending joint government-industrial review of export-control policy.
