 Wild Card: Russia Plays Iraq Crisis To Its Own Advantage; U.S. Can Only Wonder --- Is Foreign Minister a Friend Of Peace or of Baghdad? Certainly, He's a Survivor --- `Saddam Is Not a Madman'   By By Carla Anne Robbins and Steve Liesman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1998  But what Moscow really wants stirs anxiety both inside the Clinton administration and out. The most benign interpretation has Russia using its historical ties to persuade Iraq to open up to United Nations arms inspectors before there is a military attack. But some fear that Mr. Primakov is mainly trying to get an old Soviet friend and future Russian market off the hook. As an Arabist, Soviet diplomat and former spymaster, Mr. Primakov has spent 30 years cultivating Saddam Hussein.  Through it all, Mr. Primakov has remained convinced that he, and perhaps he alone, can cut a deal with the Iraqi dictator. "Saddam is not a madman. . . . It's quite possible to convince him that one thing is acceptable and one thing is not acceptable," he told a former Russian state television director, Sergei Blagovolin, in 1991. Mr. Blagovolin concludes: "Saddam Hussein is a part of (Mr. Primakov's) life, his personal history."  American doubts about Russian intentions go far beyond Iraq. Since Mr. Primakov, 68 years old, replaced the younger, pro-Western Andrei Kozyrev two years ago, relations have chilled noticeably. Russia now actively cultivates American nemeses such as Iran and Iraq. Some U.S. officials say Mr. Primakov has not only been pleading Iraq's case to the U.N., but also has been coaching the Iraqi government in its standoff with U.N. inspectors and its bid to get sanctions lifted. Mr. Primakov regularly questions U.S. leadership in Europe, the Persian Gulf and Asia, saying his goal is a "multipolar world" not dominated by the U.S. or any other single power.
