 Traders From Asia Flock to Wisconsin, Seeking Their Roots --- They Scramble to Buy Ginseng Grown Here, and Why Not? Ours Can Bolster Their Yin   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1992  What's up? It's the ginseng rush, an annual rite here in Marathon County, which -- by quirk of climate and commerce -- is the world's third largest exporter of ginseng. Yes, ginseng, the wonder root revered by the Chinese for centuries, said to cure every malady: from anemia to insomnia, from a flagging libido to a failing memory. It is Geritol for China's gerontocracy. Soviet cosmonauts, when in orbit, used to take it. For thousands of Americans, it is Mother Nature's antidote to jet lag and job stress.  To U.S. medical experts, ginseng is just an overrated carrot. To ginseng growers and traders, it's 24-karat gold. With millions of Asians craving it, Wisconsin ginseng ranks as one of America's most lucrative legal crops, bringing $38 to $52 a pound this fall. Established growers reap as much as $100,000 an acre.  American ginseng is prized by Chinese devotees of the concept of yin and yang forces. Yin is the cool, mild force, while yang is the hot, strong one. If your yin is out of sync with your yang, you supposedly need a nip of 'shang, as the root is called here. The American variety purportedly has a calming effect on the body, and Asian ginseng, a stimulating effect.
