 Selling Birth Control to India's Poor --- Medicine Men Market an Array Of Contraceptives   By By Miriam Jordan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1999  Mirzafari, India -- From his outpost behind a wobbly desk under a tree, medicine man Sushil Bharati dispenses everything from cough remedies to advice on bad karma. Like thousands of other medicine men throughout the country, he is at the very heart of village life.  Now he is also part of an elaborate new medicine-man marketing network. Known as "Butterfly," its goal is to revolutionize the way the world's second-largest country curbs its soaring population. In return for advocating a formalized birth-control program, Mr. Bharati receives free radio ads and other benefits, like customer referrals. He also profits from selling condoms, prominently displayed in a jar on his little table, and birth-control pills.  Plastered on the wall of Mr. Bharati's makeshift clinic are posters with the bright Butterfly logo -- the same one that is displayed on billboards and village walls across the giant state of Bihar. There are butterflies, too, on Mr. Bharati's stationery, referral notes and prescription pad.
