 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  While the government urged LG Card's creditor banks to participate in last week's $3.2 billion rescue plan, the banks cut a better deal than many outsiders expected. Figuring that the plan clarifies and begins to deal with the banks' exposure to LG Card, stock-market investors drove up the banks' share prices this week. Since Friday, before the plan was announced, Kookmin Bank's share prices is up 1.16%. Shinhan Financial Group is up 3.25%, Woori Finance Holdings up 6.23%, and Hana Bank up 3.04%.  Dealing with LG Card is one big step in resolving this issue. While creditor banks agreed to convert much of LG Card's debt into equity, and to provide some additional cash, they did win a major concession in tough negotiations with the government. All of them, except state- run Korea Development Bank, have been assured they won't have to give further financial assistance to LG Card.  The incident is the latest flap in a growing diplomatic spat between Brazil and the U.S. Brazil began requiring Americans to be photographed and fingerprinted upon entering Brazil in response to a U.S. antiterrorism measure that requires the same from citizens of all countries who need visas to enter the U.S. The Brazilian requirement became the government's official policy Monday, citing the diplomatic concept of "reciprocity."
