 Societe Generale Asset Management Stake to Be Sold   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1999  Mutual-fund manager Jean-Marie Eveillard has always counseled patience in investing. He is a patient deal-maker, as well.  The high-profile stock picker announced that Societe Generale SA, the French bank, would sell its 80.1% stake in Mr. Eveillard's Societe Generale Asset Management to Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Inc., a New York investment firm. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Mr. Eveillard said he will retain his minority stake in the company and continue to run the SoGen Funds for five years.  The announced deal is expected to close late this year or early next year. That would be about a year after a previous pact to sell the firm fell through. In early 1999, Liberty Financial Cos. backed away from plans to buy Mr. Eveillard's firm for up to $216 million.
