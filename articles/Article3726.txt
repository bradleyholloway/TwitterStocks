 Personal Health (A Special Report); Online Offerings   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2003  Here's a brief look at some of the highlights -- and criticisms -- of several candidates' positions on prescription-drug coverage under Medicare.  HIGHLIGHTS: Mr. [Bush] has staked a greatdeal on a bill to change Medicare by offering 40 million senior and disabled Americans a benefit to help pay for prescription drugs, which currently aren't covered. The $400 billion bill passed the House and Senate in June, and details are now being hammered out in conference committee. Under both versions of the bill, a drug benefit would be available both to beneficiaries in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program and to those who have joined one of several preferred-provider organizations offered through private insurers.  CRITICISMS: Some Democrats fear Mr. Bush's approach represents a push toward the privatization of Medicare. Some Republicans claim the drug benefit would create a huge non-need-based entitlement that the government can ill afford. Still others are calling for a change in the Medicare premium structure that would require higher-income seniors to bear more of the costs. The upshot: As the bill languishes and criticism mounts, passage is in question.
