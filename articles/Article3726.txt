 The Buzz -- MarketWatch Weekend Investor: After an Analyst's 'Sell' Call, Nautilus Flexes Its Muscles   By Greenberg, Herb, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2007  Their lack of response, he says, appears directly related to the increasingly critical nature of his reports, which culminated in June 2006 with his downgrade to a sell "on heightened concerns" over a variety of issues. This was one month after Mr. [Eric Wold] wrote that he was "unconvinced" the company, which had a series of missteps and disappointments, "has turned the corner."  Ron Arp, Nautilus's senior vice president of corporate communications, says the analyst "is entitled to his opinion." Mr. Arp also says it is "not true" that the company won't talk to Mr. Wold. "We've assigned a person at an investor-relations firm to arrange or respond to any appointments or calls and to assure that multiple people can be on the line and there would be no questions about our accessibility." He adds that Mr. Wold "turned down an opportunity to spend some time with management in the first quarter to compare our points of view."  "That is hilarious," Mr. Wold responds. "I would jump at the chance to meet or speak with them, but they will never give me the chance." He says he did get that invitation, after he had briefly upgraded the stock to "neutral." After an earnings conference call the next month, he again chopped his rating to a sell. After that, he says, he asked the company's external investor-relations representative if the offer still stood. "He said they pulled the offer," Mr. Wold says. Nautilus's stock was about $18 at the time. As of 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, the stock was at $12, up 17 cents, reflecting continued flabby performance.
