 The Accused: Terror Probe Eyes Pakistani Links Of British Suspects; Alleged Muslim Plotters Didn't Appear Radical; Middle-Class Homeowners; An 'Angry Young' Generation   By Chip Cummins and Carrick Mollenkamp in London, Alistair MacDonald in High Wycombe, England and Zahid Hussain in Islamabad, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  Don Stewart-Whyte, 21, another High Wycombe resident, was born in Britain and converted to Islam as recently as six months ago. One neighbor recalls him complaining about getting bullied at school. "I was surprised when Don became a convert," says this neighbor. "He'd had trouble with the Asian community before. He'd been beaten up by them." Mr. Stewart-Whyte recently grew a goatee and sometimes wore a Muslim headdress, neighbors say. He began greeting people using the Muslim greeting, "Assalamu Alaikum," or "Peace be with you."  One neighbor says Mr. Stewart-Whyte's mother is a physical-education teacher at Pipers Corner in High Wycombe and is currently on holiday in Scotland. Prior to converting, Mr. Stewart-Whyte was "a bit rebellious," says this neighbor, who says she is a friend of his mother's. She and others say he is very personable. Mr. Stewart-Whyte had told people that converting was a positive thing and that he'd been happy since he did. "His mother liked the change," this neighbor says.  Shaukat Warraich, a local teacher and Muslim community leader in High Wycombe, says the town's mosque, where Mr. Stewart-Whyte went when he decided to convert, has a reputation for moderation. "The imam there is known as a moderate man. He has never expressed extreme views," he says. "This is a very small, sleepy English town."
