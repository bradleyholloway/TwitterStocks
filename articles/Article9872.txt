 Tom DeLay's Woes Won't End in Texas   By Gurwitz, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2005  After throwing out the conspiracy charges, Judge [Pat Priest] laid out the challenges for Mr. [Ronnie Earle]'s money-laundering case. He must prove that Mr. DeLay obtained funds from corporate contributors with the express intent of converting them to donations to individual candidates. Alternatively, he must show that Mr. DeLay illegally converted lawfully obtained Trmpac funds by sending them to the Rnsec "with an agreement that funds of the same amount would then be made available by that committee to individual candidates for Texas political office, and [he must] prove that funds in the same amount were in fact contributed to individual candidates." Read through Mr. Earle's wafer- thin, four-page indictment and you won't find a shred of evidence to support either scenario. Unless Mr. Earle has some evidentiary rabbit he can pull out of his hat, there's little reason to believe he'll get a conviction.  Mr. DeLay's ties to Mr. [Jack Abramoff] are numerous. Some expenses associated with a political junket and golfing trip to the United Kingdom in 2000 showed up on Mr. Abramoff's credit card. Mr. DeLay made frequent use of Mr. Abramoff's skybox at the MCI Center. Christine DeLay, the congressman's wife, worked for a lobbying firm that received referrals from Mr. Abramoff. These only scratch the surface of a relationship between Mr. Abramoff, Mr. DeLay, and Mr. DeLay's office that stretches back a decade and involves some of the lobbyist's most noxious efforts.
