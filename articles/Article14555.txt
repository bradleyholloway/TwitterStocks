 Efforts to Force Zenith Sale Ended By Investor Group   By By Alex Kotlowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1988  GLENVIEW, Ill. -- Zenith Electronics Corp. said Brookhurst Partners L.P., a New York investor group, has ended its efforts to force the sale of the company.  Brookhurst, which has a 6.1% stake in the electronics company, retreated from its effort to seek shareholder approval to oust seven Zenith directors and to sell the company. While a Brookhurst spokesman wouldn't say why the investor group backed down from its challenge of Zenith's independence, the investor group's sudden withdrawal suggests it didn't have enough support from shareholders in its consent solicitation.  In a prepared statement, Herbert B. Abelow, a general partner in Brookhurst, said: "Zenith is headed in the right direction and we endorse the company's pursuit of these programs."
