 Grand Jury Accuses Four More Individuals In Orange County Case   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1995  As expected, supervisors Roger Stanton and William Steiner were hit with civil misconduct allegations stemming from the $1.7-billion loss suffered by the county's now-defunct investment pool and the county's filing for federal bankruptcy protection a year ago.

Both men have consistently denied any wrongdoing.
