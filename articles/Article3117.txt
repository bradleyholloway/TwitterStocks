 Senator, Amid Satellite Debate, Seeks Stronger U.S. Industry for Launches   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1998  With the Clinton administration and Congress at odds over how best to guard U.S. technology in satellites launched overseas, a senior Republican senator plans to examine ways to strengthen the domestic launch industry.  Sen. John McCain of Arizona plans to hold hearings and will look at legislation to try to make U.S. launches more competitive with nations such as China, an aide said. He plans to examine a variety of measures to achieve that goal, including regulatory reform.  Meanwhile, a U.S. official said the administration is leaning toward not challenging a congressional plan to move the monitoring of commercial-satellite exports back to the State Department from the Commerce Department. The official said although the administration opposes the move, it probably wouldn't veto the Defense Department authorization bill that contains the measure. "We have to balance what's in the bill and make a judgment call, and everything else in the bill looks pretty good," the official said on Friday. Administration officials expect to see details of the lawmakers' agreement today.
