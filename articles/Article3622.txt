 Spanish-Radio Firms Blast Arbitron   By By Eduardo Porter, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  Arbitron last week said it would start "weighting" by language preference the audience samples it uses to measure ratings in primary markets, adjusting them to ensure the mix of English and Spanish speakers accurately represents the linguistic makeup of the population. But Arbitron didn't specify a time for the change, saying it would disclose the timing and other details early next year.  Spanish-language broadcasters contend their ratings are depressed because Arbitron's Hispanic samples, which aren't adjusted for language preference, include too many English speakers. They claim Spanish speakers, many of whom are immigrants unaccustomed to marketing polls, are less likely to take part in Arbitron's surveys. As a result, Mr. [Joaquin Blaya] said, the audience share of Spanish-language radio is undercounted by at least 20% on average, costing broadcasters $500 million to $600 million in lost ad revenue during the past five years.
