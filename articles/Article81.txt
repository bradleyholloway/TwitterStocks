WASHINGTON, March 18â€” President Reagan was set back today in his effort to block an April 1 increase in milk price supports when a House subcommittee scrapped an Administration amendment and substituted one supported by the dairy lobby.  As a means of cutting about $147 million from the 1981 budget, the Administration wants to skip one of the adjustments of the dairy price support level that are made twice a year.  Instead of approving the Administration's simple amendment eliminating the April 1 price adjustment, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Agriculture voted unanimously to substitute one that would retain the twice-a-year adjustment, which the dairy lobby has been fighting for. It would also change the support formula, setting up a flexible scale of 75 to 80 percent of parity depending on how large the milk surplus was at the time of adjustment. Parity is an index that measures the price farmers receive for their products against their operating and other costs.  Unlike the treatment of other commodities, the dairy section of the current farm law requires the Agriculture Secretary to support milk prices at 80 percent of parity and adjust this ratio on April 1 and October 1 to reflect an increase or decrease in milk production costs. Under the arrangement, the Government buys milk and milk products at rates that will enable the processor to pay the farmer no less than the support price.  If the April 1 adjustment is made, the Agriculture Department expects the support level to rise about seven and a half cents a gallon. In the past, the increases have always been passed directly on to consumers.  The Agriculture Department would also have to pay an additional $147 million to buy up and store, at the higher support level, the surplus milk products that are being accumulated each month.  Dairy lobbyists have conceded that some changes would have to be made in the price support program. Milk production is now at an alltime high and it will cost the taxpayers at least $1.9 billion this year to buy and store surplus butter, cheese and powdered milk.  The full House Agriculture Committee is to take up the subcommittee's amendment tomorrow afternoon if it concludes budget hearings in time. It was not known tonight whether the full committee would endorse the amendment of its Livestock, Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee. But the dairy industry, which has invested heavily in the campaigns of many members of Congress, has friends on the full committee.  According to Federal Election Commission records, in the past two Congressional elections three dairy committees have contributed more than $350,000 to the 24 Democrats on the committee and to 10 of the 19 Republicans. Representative Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa who is chairman of the subcommittee, received $22,000 from the dairy groups. Chairman Supports Amendment  Representative Kika de la Garza, the Texas Democrat who heads the full committee, said this afternoon that he was inclined to support the subcommittee's amendment but he could not predict what the rest of the committee would do.  The dairy interests have indicated to Agriculture Secretary John R. Block that they would not try to block a flexible price support formula based on the size of the surplus when a new farm bill is written later this year. But they wanted to continue the twice-a-year adjustments. They also wanted a provision that the formula would not decrease supports below the current level. Both of those requests are included in the subcommittee amendment.
