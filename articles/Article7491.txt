 Allied-Signal Reports Deficit Of $600 Million --- Loss in 4th Period Included $725 Million in Charges On Job Cuts, Other Steps   By By Barry Meier, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1986  MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- Amid speculation of pending management changes, Allied-Signal Inc. posted a loss of $600 million for the fourth quarter, including $725 million in one-time charges.  The write-offs were slightly larger than projected by Edward L. Hennessy Jr., Allied-Signal's chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview last week. He had estimated the charges at $600 million to $700 million, including write-downs on several businesses spun off to Henley or put up for sale by Allied-Signal.  Allied-Signal was created by the September merger of Allied Corp., based here, and Signal Cos., La Jolla, Calif. Soon afterward Allied-Signal said it would spin off about 32 former Allied and Signal units into Henley, to be headed by Michael D. Dingman, former president of Signal.
