 Travelers to Increase Asbestos Fund   By By Christopher Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2003  Whatever number it announces, Travelers and its shareholders won't absorb the full impact. When it went public early last year, Travelers, Hartford, Conn., was given a guarantee by former parent company Citigroup Inc. that the financial-services company would pay as much as $800 million of any additional asbestos reserves required by Travelers -- $555 million of which hasn't yet been used.  A Travelers spokesman declined to comment on the results of the insurer's reserve-adequacy study. In the third quarter, the company reported net income of $332.3 million. At the end of the third quarter, Travelers had $950 million in asbestos reserves.
