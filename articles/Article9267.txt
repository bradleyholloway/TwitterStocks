 Celera Gives Draft Of Human Genome To Journal Science   By By Scott Hensley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2000  In keeping with scientific precedent, Celera and Science will make the archival genetic sequence data available free to academic researchers, but Celera will restrict them from redistributing the data. Nevertheless, some scientists are concerned that the particulars of the arrangement will complicate further research.  Under terms of the agreement between Science and Celera, academic researchers can download substantial portions of the data to their own computers from Celera's Web site, publish scientific papers based on their work with the data and even seek patents for discoveries made from the data. Celera also will provide copies of the databases to Science to keep in escrow to assure that no changes have been made to the databases.  For their part, Celera and Science say the unique and necessary arrangement makes the data widely available while safeguarding the commercial rights of Celera.
