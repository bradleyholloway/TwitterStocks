 Cendant's First-Quarter Earnings Top Forecasts   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1998  Cendant Corp., which last month disclosed accounting problems at its core membership business, posted slightly better-than-expected first-quarter earnings of $230 million, or 26 cents a diluted share.  The marketing and franchising concern said the results were fueled by cost cutting and increased revenue at its real-estate and travel operations. Cendant said the earnings may be subject to slight revisions because of the continuing investigation of accounting problems. The membership business represents about 18% of Cendant's operations.  The company didn't give results for last year. Because of the accounting irregularities, it previously said its year-ago results aren't reliable. It expects to reduce last year's reported results by $100 million to $115 million, or 11% to 13%. According to its financial filings, Cendant had 1997 first-quarter net income of $166 million, or 19 cents a diluted share. Year-ago results include earnings from both CUC International Inc. and HFS Inc., which merged in December to form Cendant.
