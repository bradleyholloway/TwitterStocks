 GM Net Beats Expectations For 1st Period   By By Gregory L. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2000  General Motors Corp. reported income from continuing operations in the first quarter of $1.78 billion, down 2% from $1.82 billion a year earlier, as declining prices and rising investment in new products cut into profit in its core North American operations.  But GM's earnings from continuing operations of $2.80 a diluted share were a first-quarter record, beating the analysts' consensus of $2.66 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, and up 4.5% from the $2.68 reported for the first quarter of last year, when there were more shares outstanding.  Net-income figures were the same as the continuing-income figures for the most-recent quarter, down from year-earlier net of $2.06 billion, or $3.04 a share. The year-earlier numbers included results from GM's Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. parts unit, which was spun off last year.
