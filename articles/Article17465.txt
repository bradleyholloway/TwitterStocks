 ITT and Sperry End Talks on Merger As Companies Fail to Agree on Terms   By By Janet Guyon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1985  ITT Corp. and Sperry Corp. said preliminary merger talks between them ended because they couldn't agree on terms.  News of the talks indicates that Sperry could be a takeover candidate and that ITT, currently engaged in an aggressive divestiture program, is in the market for a big acquisition. ITT's motive probably includes making itself less attractive as a takeover target, analysts and industry consultants said.  Neither ITT nor Sperry would comment on plans. Speculation that ITT might acquire Sperry prompted the announcement Friday that talks had ended. Both companies said the negotiations began early last week and grew out of talks to establish joint marketing and technology-transfer agreements. To compete in the rapidly changing information-processing business, ITT needs a computer partner and Sperry needs a telecommunications partner.
