 Lloyd's of London Says '93 Results End Five Years of Losses   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1994  Lloyd's of London Chairman David Rowland said that, after five years of losses, 1993 was a "very profitable" year for underwriting and 1994 also looks positive.  Lloyd's, an insurance market, reports full results with about a three-year lag, so actual 1993 figures won't be published until 1996.
