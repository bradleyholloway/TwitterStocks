Airports around the country, including San Francisco and Atlanta, are receiving new X-ray machines that use a system called "threat image projection," which projects phantom images of dangerous objects onto otherwise innocent luggage.

The convoy is small: three engines, a sleeper car, a utility car, plus the five vintage cars, which offer meeting rooms, dining facilities, high-speed Internet access and suites for two.

Price per person: about $3,330 with the favorable Canadian exchange rate.
