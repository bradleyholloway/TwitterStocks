 Delphi Discloses New Irregularities In Its Accounting   By Neal E. Boudette and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2005  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Delphi said its audit committee had found previously undisclosed off-balance-sheet debt related to its European operations. The undisclosed debt was incurred between 1999, when Delphi was spun off from General Motors Corp., and 2004, and ranged from $187 million to $374 million per quarter. Not disclosing the debt inflated Delphi's net liquidity, but had no impact on the company's bottom line.  In its SEC filing, Delphi said its treasury staff was aware of the off-balance sheet debt but didn't report it to Mr. Battenberg, the board of directors or credit-rating agencies. The debt stemmed from what is known in accounting circles as a "factoring facility," which allowed Delphi to borrow money against payments that were due but hadn't yet come in. The company used this as a source of short-term financing.  Delphi also said in its filing that it has reviewed newly disclosed accounting problems with the lead arrangers involved in its current efforts to reach a new bank-loan agreement. "After consideration of the matter, the banks expressed their continued full support of Delphi," the company said. The refinancing is oversubscribed with a total facility size of $2.8 billion, within the expected range, and should close by June 15, Delphi said.
