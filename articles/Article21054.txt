 BankAmerica To Sell Schwab For $230 Million --- Unit Founder, Group to Pay Cash, Notes; Bank to Get Stake in Firm's Growth   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1987  BankAmerica Corp. said it agreed to sell its Charles Schwab & Co. unit to a group led by founder and chairman Charles R. Schwab for $230 million in cash and notes as well as a share in the discount brokerage firm's future growth.  The purchase price, although partly conditional, falls short of analysts' expectations. BankAmerica will receive $175 million in cash, $55 million in 9% junior debentures and, subject to certain constraints, 15% of the firm's future equity capital growth. The buyers are also issuing $50 million in 10% senior debentures to BankAmerica to cover a previous $50 million advance.  BankAmerica acquired Schwab for $57 million in stock in 1983 in a move that helped to establish new powers for banks. The brokerage was one of BankAmerica's most profitable operations, although the marriage between the two companies often was troubled. Mr. Schwab had steep personal losses as BankAmerica's stock price began collapsing shortly after the sale from the weight of huge loan losses. A BankAmerica director until resigning last year, he was a major critic of management plans to revive earnings through a massive corporate shrinkage.
