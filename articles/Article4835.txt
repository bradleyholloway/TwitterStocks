 Pennzoil Co., Texaco Holders Agree on Plan   By By Allanna Sullivan and Caleb Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1987  Pennzoil Co. and a committee representing Texaco Inc. shareholders are expected to file a settlement plan with the bankruptcy court, possibly as early as next week to settle the mammoth legal dispute for about $3 billion, say sources familiar with the bankruptcy.  Texaco is to be notified of this settlement plan, but doesn't necessarily have to agree to it for the court to approve it. In a ruling earlier this week, Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg said that Texaco had until Jan. 11 to file its own plan of reorganization, which would include a framework for settlement. But he also said that the equity committee and general creditors committee also could propose a settlement during the same period if they could strike an accord with Pennzoil.
