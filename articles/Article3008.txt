 A Gift for Mr. Putin   The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2002  Mr. [Bush] really didn't want another treaty; he had said all along he could do a Russian deal with a handshake. U.S. national security didn't require it; the military chiefs long ago signed off on unilateral U.S. reductions in nuclear warheads, from about 6,000 to fewer than 2,200, that Mr. Bush had proposed during the 2000 campaign. And domestic American politics didn't demand it; while Delaware Senator Joe Biden might erupt in ecstasy at the prospect, U.S.-Russian treaties don't stir American voters these days, if they ever did.  So especially after Mr. [Vladimir Putin] gave Mr. Bush the green light to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Mr. Bush felt the need to oblige him by codifying U.S. nuclear reductions. "The larger relationship is really what is important here," a senior Administration official told us yesterday. "It was clearly important to Putin to say that this is something that would outlive the two men and be legally binding."  The real reason the U.S. and Russia don't need this treaty is because of their improving relationship. Arms-control is dangerous between adversaries, and it is unnecessary between friends. Mr. Putin has drawn closer to the U.S. for his own self-interested strategic reasons. He needs foreign investment, and to get that he needs to become part of the stable, peaceful Western world. Arms-control is irrelevant to that historic mission.
