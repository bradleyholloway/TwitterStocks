 Russian Revival: As things look up in Moscow, one crucial ingredient remains missing: foreign direct investment   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  The stock-market boom also has been fueled by changed perceptions of Russia, which under President Vladimir Putin is now a partner in the West's war against terror. Its efforts to mend fences with old Cold War adversaries have been richly rewarded by a bigger role in the NATO alliance, membership in the G8 industrial nations and recognition by both the U.S. and the European Union as a market economy. The upshot: Russia is being seen by foreigners as a less risky place to invest.  The fact that changing sentiment toward Russia has so far failed to generate big inflows of foreign capital shows the uphill struggle Russia still faces in trying to convince the world it's really changed. Under Mr. Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, the country was renowned for its lawlessness, political chaos and thuggish business practices. Mr. Yeltsin's Russia was best known for the way a group of tycoons, the so-called oligarchs, used their connections to snap up state-owned assets at giveaway prices. Foreigners' mistrust of Russia peaked in 1998, when many emerging-markets hedge funds were wiped out in the country's financial crash.  Other, more far-reaching changes that could mark a definitive break with Russia's communist past and deliver the economic growth Mr. Putin wants are proving slow to get off the ground. A bold plan to reduce government interference in business has encountered tough resistance from the very bureaucracy it was supposed to curb. A socially painful plan to end state subsidies of energy and housing costs has been put on hold and is unlikely to go ahead before next year's parliamentary elections. A long-promised root-and-branch overhaul of the civil service, a revamping of the banking sector, and the restructuring of Russia's gas and electricity monopolies are all moving too slowly for some.
