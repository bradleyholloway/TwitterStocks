 Opera: Saving `Ariadne'   By By Heidi Waleson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1998  Chicago -- Act II of Richard Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos" is usually an endless hour and a half of static oversinging, relieved briefly by the piquant Zerbinetta and her clowns. Lyric Opera of Chicago broke the mold with its new production, thanks to the stagecraft of director John Cox and designer Robert Perdziola, Deborah Voigt's singing as Ariadne, and Robert Spano's conducting. The production's creators took the composer's perverse notion of opera seria performed within a commedia del arte seriously and made it work with Baroque-style theatrical design, while Ms. Voigt and Mr. Spano gave us Strauss at his most glorious.  Then in Act II, all the backstage machinery and squabbles meshed into something that went far beyond mere entertainment. Mr. Perdziola flipped the set to give us the audience's point of view: 18th-century style flats that encircled the playing area to create Ariadne's cave, a hanging cloud with Echo (Elena Kolganova) in it, footlights, even a stage manager at a desk and a view of the characters as they entered and left. For Bacchus's first offstage serenade, he cleverly flipped it back, which put the tenor (John Horton Murray) at the front of Lyric Opera's stage, singing from music pages as he and his ship awaited their entrance. This worked musically as well as theatrically, as the tenor could sing naturally rather than bellowing to be heard from a distance. Mr. Perdziola then let us experience the magic of the finale by turning the stage once again, and having Ms. Voigt and Mr. Murray sing their final duet as the encircling flats disappeared and dozens of chandeliers were gently lowered to create the stars of the night sky. Duane Schuler created the breathtaking lighting.
