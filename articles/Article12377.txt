 Retailers Report That Sales Rose Modestly in October --- Same-Store Increase of 3.6% Reinforces Predictions Of a Weaker Christmas   By By Rebecca Quick, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1998  In the first full month of fall, strong sales from specialty apparel retailers were offset by weaker results from many department stores. In the end, same-store sales, or those at stores open at least a year, rose a tepid 3.6% in October, according to the Goldman Sachs index of 60 retailers, weighted by sales. The firm had expected a gain of 3% to 5%.  And one surprise in yesterday's retail numbers: a better-than-expected performance from some luxury retailers, including Neiman Marcus Group Inc., which had a 2.4% increase in same-store sales from a year earlier. High-end retailers had performed poorly in September, leading to fears that consumers would steer clear of the more expensive stores this holiday season.  A collective 7.3% increase in same-store sales at specialty apparel retailers such as AnnTaylor Stores Corp. and Gap Inc. led the Goldman Sachs index. Same-store sales at discount retailers, including WalMart Stores Inc., Kmart Corp. and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target chain, also were strong, rising 6.1% as a group from the year-earlier period.
