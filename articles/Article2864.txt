 Music: Recording, and Reordering, Bach   By By Barrymore Laurence Scherer, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2001  By now, we all know you don't play a Bach Passion or Mass the way you would play a Mass by Verdi or Bruckner. Nevertheless, the rigorous, sprouts-and-yogurt approach to [Johann Sebastian Bach]'s choral music can leave you hungry for a softer, more human touch. For this, you can look to the Belgian conductor Philippe Herreweghe, a Bach exponent who strikes a fine balance between scholarly insight and genuinely expressive warmth that recalls the work of Wilhem Furtwangler and Wolfgang Sawallisch, not to mention America's grandest laureate of choral literature, the late Robert Shaw. Mr. Herreweghe's recent recording (on Harmonia Mundi) is a handsome Bach set comprising the Mass in B minor, BWV 232; the Magnificat, BWV 243; and the cantata "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott," BWV 80. He performs these with various members of the Collegium Vocale and La Chapelle Royale -- both organizations founded by him, and the results are profoundly satisfying.
