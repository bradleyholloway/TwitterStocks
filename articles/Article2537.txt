Nextlink, Bellevue, Wash., said it will pay $695 million in cash and stock to buy WNP Communications Inc., a Reston, Va., company that was the largest bidder in a federal auction last year of LMDS frequencies. The deal, which gives Nextlink 39 wireless licenses, includes $542.1 million paid to WNP and $152.9 million in license payments owed to the Federal Communications Commission.
