 Tech Magazines Struggle for Ad-Revenue Growth   By By Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  Hilary Schneider, chief executive of Red Herring parent Red Herring Communications, says the layoffs weren't driven by the broader advertising slowdown. Ms. Schneider says the company is still "very comfortable" with last year's decision to expand. In December, advertising pages rose 71%, according to Publishers Information Bureau figures released yesterday, and ad revenue more than tripled, due to the magazine's increases in publishing frequency and ad rates. The magazine's biweekly circulation is 325,000.  Red Herring isn't the only magazine looking over its shoulder. Wired, a 500,000-circulation monthly published by Conde Nast Publications Inc., says ad pages will likely be off 10% in both January and February. Standard Media International, publisher of the 200,000-circulation weekly Industry Standard, this week cut 7% of its work force and last year scuttled a spinoff title called Grok after just a few issues. Likewise, Imagine Media Inc., publisher of Business 2.0, closed a business-lifestyle magazine called Fuse after only one issue. Business 2.0's biweekly circulation is 300,000; it plans to boost its guarantee to 350,000 with the next issue.
