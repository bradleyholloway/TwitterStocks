 Amusement Parks In U.S. See Prices Decline on Average   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1999  ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The average price for a family of four to visit a U.S. amusement park decreased by $1.58 this year to $141.32, according to an annual survey by the trade publication Amusement Business.  Amusement Business, Nashville, Tenn., which compiles information from the same 25 parks each year, considers the cost of admission for two adults and two children, parking, food and two child-size souvenir T-shirts. The decline is the first since the publication began keeping tabs five years ago.  "When you look at the whole scope of things, (the cost) didn't decrease as much as it just stopped its magnificent gains," said Tim O'Brien, Amusement Business's southeast editor, who compiled the survey. "They are stabilizing a bit."
