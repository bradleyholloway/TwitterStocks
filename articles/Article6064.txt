 New Programs Make A Big Production Of Your Family History   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1998  LIKE MILLIONS of people, I've been collecting information on and off over the years on all of the branches of my family, trying to construct family trees, obtain documents and photos, and interview elderly family members. I still remember as one of my greatest thrills the moment I found at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., a copy of the handwritten ship's manifest recording the arrival on these shores of my paternal grandfather from what is today Ukraine.  I began using crude genealogy software to chronicle my own family on an ancient Apple II many years ago, but the programs available today do far more than their predecessors. They can create and print an amazing variety of charts and trees, permit you to scan in old photos, and even create books or albums on your family's history.  RECENTLY, I have been testing the latest versions of two genealogy programs: the market leader, Broderbund's Family Tree Maker Deluxe Edition III, version 4.4, which costs about $82; and a rising upstart, Palladium Interactive's Ultimate Family Tree Deluxe, which costs about $60. I tested the top-of-the-line Windows version of each, though both come in more basic versions and in Mac iterations as well. I also tried out the elaborate accompanying Web sites both companies have built to complement the programs.
