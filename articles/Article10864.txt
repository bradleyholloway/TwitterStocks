 Popular Restaurants Whip Up Cuisine for the Grocery Store   By By Ronald Alsop, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1986  Carson's Ribs in Chicago, for instance, has formed a joint venture with United Brands Co.'s John Morrell subsidiary to market ribs and pork loin under the Carson's name in Kroger stores. Dean Carson expects national success because many visitors to Chicago remember his restaurant fondly and have even paid to have ribs delivered to their hometowns by express mail service.  In New York, Mamma Leone's, an 80-year-old restaurant that caters to tourists, has licensed its name to American Home Products Corp. for prepared pasta dishes. TV commercials, filmed in the restaurant's wine cellar, tout the "fresh, homemade taste that made Mamma famous." The primary motivation for Restaurant Associates, which owns Mamma Leone's, is collecting royalties. "We're not sure whether the exposure will help the restaurant's business," says John Harding, marketing director. "But we'll be on millions of jars and national TV, something we could never afford ourselves." For American Home Products, it's important to start with a famous name to compete against Chesebrough-Pond's new Ragu pasta meals in jars.  OTHER RESTAURANTS that in recent years have parlayed their names into the grocery business include Eli's the Place for Steak in Chicago with cheesecake, Old Original Bookbinder's in Philadelphia with canned soup and the Benihana chain with frozen Oriental entrees. Los Angeles chef and restaurateur Wolfgang Puck plans to market frozen gourmet pizzas and desserts later this year in packages that will carry his name. Says Mr. Puck: "We thought this would be better and also more interesting than opening another restaurant."
