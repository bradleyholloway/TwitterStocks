 Desert Partners Proposes to Lift Offer for USG   By By Paul F. Duke Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1988  The Midland, Texas-based partnership's latest proposal gives two options, both of which require a "negotiated" merger agreement. One option offers more cash per share -- but for fewer shares. The other seeks the entire 90% stake in USG that Desert Partners doesn't already own, but heavily increases the debt portion of the bid.  The latest Desert Partners proposal came only two days after USG unveiled a recapitalization plan that the company said was superior to the partnership's hostile tender offer. Under the recapitalization plan, USG shareholders would receive cash and debt valued at $42 for each share, along with one share in the recapitalized company. Wall Street analysts value the plan at $47 to $49 a share.
