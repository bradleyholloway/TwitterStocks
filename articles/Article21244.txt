 U.S. Productivity Fell at 1.4% Rate In 2nd Quarter; Building Outlays Rise   By By Shoba Purushothaman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 1988  Non-farm productivity declined at a revised 1.4% annual rate in the second quarter, slightly less than the 1.7% pace of decline reported a month ago, the Labor Department said.  Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.2% in July, boosted by spending on government projects and on office and apartment construction. The July increase, however, was offset by a substantial June revision. The new estimate was that spending declined 1.5% in June, while the department initially said it had increased 0.1%.  The small upward revision in the department's estimate of second-quarter productivity resulted from an increase in its calculation of output, the department said. Non-farm output rose at a revised 5.2% annual rate compared with an initial estimate of 4.7%. Hours worked were revised slightly to show a rise at a 6.6% annual rate compared with the 6.5% pace reported earlier.
