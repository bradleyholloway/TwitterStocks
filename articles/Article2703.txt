 E*Trade to Buy ATM Network Amid a Push Into Online Banking   By By Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2000  The Menlo Park, Calif., online financial-services firm, seeking to overcome one of the biggest hurdles to widespread acceptance of Internet banking, said it will acquire 8,500 automated teller machines, immediately propelling it into the ranks of the largest ATM providers nationwide.  E*Trade has agreed to buy, in an all-stock deal, Card Capture Services Inc., the largest independent network of ATMs in the U.S. Its 8,500 machines are located in 48 states and in three countries. By comparison, Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank unit has about 1,900 ATMs, Wells Fargo & Co. has about 6,300, and Bank of America Corp. has more than 14,000. The acquisition, terms of which weren't disclosed, is expected to close in the second quarter and will be immediately accretive to E*Trade's earnings, officials said.  E*Trade, best-known for its online stock-trading service, is buying the network just months after launching a big push into online banking through its acquisition of online bank Telebank.
