 Volatility Jump Often Associated With Earnings Hasn't Developed   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2003  Index volatility fell 4.9% from Dec. 31 to Jan. 9, while average stock volatility (weighted by market capitalization) slipped 3.2%. Since Jan. 9, the measures have edged up, with index volatility rising 1.6% and average stock volatility up 0.74%. While this type of muted volatility movement is more typically associated with Old Economy companies around earnings season, the current earnings lineup is thick with technology bellwethers.  Traders said volatility isn't depressed by historical standards, and geopolitical risks and economic ambiguity appear to act as a floor, preventing it from slipping much further. But as investor optimism has grown, volatility has subsided markedly from its recent peaks in July and October. The various volatility indexes are at their lowest levels in about seven months.
