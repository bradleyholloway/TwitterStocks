 Patients Sue Medicare Agency Over Lack of an Appeals Process   By By Jill Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2002  The plaintiffs said they filed an appeal of the March decision, but that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare, had shelved it. They claim the situation violates a law passed by Congress in December 2000 that directed CMS to create an appeals process for blanket-coverage decisions. The system was supposed to be up and running by Oct. 1, 2001.  CMS said it hasn't seen the suit but "we are always disappointed when certain paid special-interest groups decide to sue us rather than work with us to create benefits and processes that best serve the interests of Medicare beneficiaries and the Medicare program," a CMS spokesman said.
