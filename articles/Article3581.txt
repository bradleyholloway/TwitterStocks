 For Oil, Does $80 a Barrel Loom?; As Mideast Conflict Flares, Price Forecasts Are Revised; Long-Shot Bets Reach $175   By Farivar, Masood, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  The biggest odds appear to be placed on the price of oil hitting $80 a barrel. T. Boone Pickens, the legendary Texas oil man who made billions betting on oil prices, has made that prediction, although he doesn't see it happening before the early part of next year. Analysts at Barclays Capital said a test of $80 a barrel was "imminent," noting the risk that the conflict in the Middle East could develop "into regional conflagration with the potential for Syria to also become involved."  "Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon," said Michael Cambria, vice president at brokerage Dimon Oil. "The market has a mind of its own. We're up on two countries (Israel and Lebanon) that don't produce oil. It shows how jittery the market is."  "While a strike by Israeli forces into Lebanon seems to be far away from the oil patch, when Israel's lawmakers lay the blame for Hezbollah's activity at Iran's doorstep . . . oil subsequently has to be the focus," said John Kilduff, senior vice president of risk management at Fimat USA. "The security premium in prices is being pumped up again."
