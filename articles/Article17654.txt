 Service Control Ends $68.2 Million Offer To Acquire Servisco   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1986  HILLSIDE, N.J. -- Servisco Inc. said a proposed $68.2 million takeover by Service Control Corp. has fallen apart because, the suitor asserts, Servisco is the target of a "federal investigation."  Servisco rents work clothes and provides building services. Servisco officials said they were told earlier this week that Service Control couldn't get financing for the merger through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. because the investment banking house had received information pointing to a federal probe of Servisco.
