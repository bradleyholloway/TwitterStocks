 RJR to Issue Preferred Shares For $2 Billion --- Move Seen as a Precursor To Merger or Separating Tobacco and Food Lines   By By Eben Shapiro, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1994  RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said it plans to raise $2 billion in a preferred-stock offering, in a move widely seen as the precursor to a separation of RJR's food and tobacco businesses, or a merger with another consumer-products giant.  RJR said that it is actively reviewing various "significant corporate transactions" including mergers, divestitures and spinoffs. "It is likely that the company's tobacco and food businesses would be separated should certain of the foregoing transactions be consummated," the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  RJR also said that it could use the $2 billion it raises in the stock offering to make an acquisition. In recent months RJR has been said to be discussing mergers with British tobacco giant Rothmans International PLC or Hanson PLC. RJR was also said to be interested in acquiring Borden Inc. Yesterday, Borden declined comment, and Rothmans and Hanson officials couldn't be reached.
