 Commodities Report: Crude Goes Over $32 a Barrel As OPEC Meeting Is Digested   By Farivar, Masood, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2003  Traders and analysts said the rally was partly a technical move, based on preplaced "buy stop" orders. But news that a major refinery in Venezuela -- a major source of gasoline for the U.S. -- was planning to shutter a gasoline-making unit for repairs may have added to the bullish sentiment, traders said. The rally "looks like a technical judgment that, for the moment, the greater, more easily accessible trading volume was to be had on the upside," said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at research firm IFR Pegasus in New York.  The widely expected decision sparked little reaction Thursday, but some analysts Friday said the move's bullish implications may be beginning to dawn on the market. "It may have taken people 24 hours to realize, but OPEC keeping production the same is bullish," said Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at trading advisory firm Cameron Hanover in New Canaan, Conn.
