 Capital Cities/ABC Plans to Offer Buyout to Employees of Network --- Non-Union Staff Eligible; Company Expects Flat Ad Income to Continue   By By Elizabeth Jensen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1992  Capital Cities/ABC Inc., facing flat earnings this year and bracing for a difficult advertising climate next year, is preparing to offer a voluntary buyout to all non-union employees at the ABC Television Network Group.  The broad-based move, which apparently would cover more than half of the roughly 5,000 people at ABC, is unprecedented in the six years since the merger that formed Capital Cities/ABC. It signals that the company's top executives have decided that recent years of largely flat advertising revenue at ABC indicate a continuing trend rather than a cyclical downturn, said one executive familiar with the situation.  Although many details aren't firm, the staff-reduction plan appears to be aimed at the fattest part of the ABC payroll and at some of its most highly paid, long-time employees. The buyouts are expected to include additional incentives for employees who are over age 55, and they won't apply to the separate, already lean television and radio station group. Nor will the buyout plan cover some 2,000 unionized technical and engineering employees in the network group.
