 Restaurants: Fast-Food Spinoff Enters Pepsi-Free Era   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1997  The spinoff completed today by PepsiCo Inc. of its Pizza Hut and KFC and Taco Bell chains creates a publicly traded giant with 30,000 restaurants, more than any other company. But total sales of the spinoff, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. are two-thirds those of hamburger behemoth McDonald's Corp. The chains' profit margins haven't matched those of Pepsi's beverage and snack-food businesses.  More broadly, Tricon insists that escaping PepsiCo is a solution in itself. Tricon officials complain privately that PepsiCo used the restaurants as training grounds for Pepsi managers and marketing gimmicks and that PepsiCo's marketing-based culture favored new-product splashes that juiced up sales only temporarily. They note that sales of Pizza Hut's Stuffed Crust Pizza grew cold once the company stopped promoting it.  Tricon, whose stock symbol is YUM, has nothing to focus on but its restaurants. Its stock certificate features a manager from each of its three chains (it calls them concepts), a reminder that soft drink executives are no longer in charge, and Tricon officials profess to have big plans for each chain's menu. The Edge is part of an effort to make permanent additions at Pizza Hut. At KFC -- the former Kentucky Fried Chicken -- a new chicken sandwich is expected, in an attempt to boost lunchtime sales. Such a sandwich, although long popular at KFC's units in the United Kingdom, has been ignored in the U.S.
