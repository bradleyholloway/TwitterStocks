 After FBI Raid, A Tenet Doctor Defends Practice   By By Rhonda Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2002  REDDING MEDICAL Center's chief of cardiology, Chae Hyun Moon, was born in 1947. A Marketplace article yesterday incorrectly said Dr. Moon arrived in the U.S. in 1947.  Dr. Moon says he was disenchanted with the practice of medicine in the Orange County region of Southern California and was looking for a place to relocate "without all the politics." Redding was a small, growing town that needed doctors, so Dr. Moon and his fiancee, soon to be his wife, decided to make their home there. "It has been a wonderful life until now," says Dr. Moon.  Dr. Moon attributes his manner to his Korean background. In East Asia, doctors are rarely questioned by their patients and the concept of "informed consent," where patients get a thorough explanation of why a certain treatment is being recommended, has never gained traction. In explaining his approach, Dr. Moon cites an old Korean proverb, "Empty cars make more noise," adding that he wants to be judged on what he does and not what he says.
