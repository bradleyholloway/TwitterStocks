 HillaryCare Returns   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  The company doesn't disclose its health care spending. But last year officials told Maryland's legislature that Wal-Mart typically spends between 7% and 8% of its payroll on health care. In the fiscal year ending this month, the company expects to have spent $4.7 billion on all benefits (including health, dental, retirement and more) while turning a profit of about $10 billion. One perverse aspect of the Maryland bill is that Wal-Mart won't be able to count any savings from negotiating lower prices with doctors and hospitals toward the 8% threshold. So the bill works against the oft-invoked liberal goal of reducing the nation's overall health-care costs.  Wal-Mart hasn't said how it will respond to the new Maryland law, but we'd suggest at a minimum that it cancel its plans for a new regional distribution center in the state that would create about 800 jobs. Maryland's politicians need to understand that policies punishing business have bad economic consequences. Let a more enlightened state benefit from Wal-Mart's prosperity.
