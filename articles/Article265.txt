 He's `Air' Today and `Air' Tomorrow   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  May 22, 1998  He, of course, is Michael Jordan, and the question that surrounds him is whether the current National Basketball Association playoffs will be his last hurrah. Over the course of the season, the Chicago Bulls star has said it will, and it won't. Now he's saying he'll decide when it's over.  It's a big question because Mr. Jordan is the best basketball player ever, and, possibly, the best athlete as well. This proposition can be backed in such quantifiable ways as the trophy cases he and his teams have filled, the latest addition being his fifth NBA Most Valuable Player award. More importantly, it can be supported by the evidence of our senses. Every time he takes the floor he does something, or several things, that take our breath away.  He says that's the way he wants to be remembered, so he's thinking of quitting, at age 35. He says he loves his coach, Phil Jackson, and doesn't want to play for another. He says he loves his hard-court sidekick, Scottie Pippen, and doesn't relish playing without him. The Bulls have said this is Mr. Jackson's last year in Chicago, and Mr. Pippen, disgruntled over his salary, has said the same about himself, many times.
