 Bank Is Used To Sell Rights For Polluting   By By Laura Johannes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1995  In the first major transaction of its kind in Texas, Anchor Glass Container Corp. sold 125 tons a year of pollution credits to Rollins Environmental Services Inc.  Under terms of the transaction, Anchor Glass agreed to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide -- a key component of smog -- at its east Houston glass plant, while Rollins can increase the same type of emissions at its hazardous-waste incinerator in nearby Deer Park.  The bank was set up 18 months ago amid much fanfare with the goal of allowing Texas industry to meet federal Clean Air Act rules without stifling economic growth. The lack of pollution-credit trading has frustrated economic-development officials. And while they hail the Anchor-Rollins sale, they say transaction rules should be eased to stimulate the market.
