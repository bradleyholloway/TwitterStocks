 Lundbeck Seeks Partners After Insomnia Setback   By Rising, Malin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2007  Finding in-licensing deals -- where a company buys the rights to develop and market a specific drug -- is difficult, partly because Lundbeck lacks a presence in the U.S., a major market for drug companies.  The patent on [Lundbeck]'s blockbuster antidepressant Cipralex -- sold as Lexapro in the U.S. -- expires in 2012 in the U.S. and in 2014 in Europe. Gaboxadol was expected to fill the sales gap after the patent expires, as well as lead the way for the company to enter the U.S. market. Lexapro is sold in the U.S. by a partner company, Forest Laboratories Inc., of New York. Without gaboxadol, Lundbeck postponed the launch of a U.S. sales force.  In Lundbeck's remaining pipeline, the only possible candidate to replace lost revenue once Lexapro's patent expires is the antidepressant Lu AA21004. However, the drug is in Phase II, or midstage, trials and needs to prove it is superior to earlier- generation products.
