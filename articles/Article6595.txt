 Editor's Note: Sunday Journal at Seven:A Letter to Our Readers   By Crook, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  Our new News Editor Karen Damato (she's the one who does the heavy lifting every week) has juggled and tweaked our weekly article mix, expanding the breadth of our news stories to look for investing and money-management opportunities beyond the week's immediate market news.  This week's first-page look at the prospects for "consumer discretionary" stocks in a slowing economy, by frequent contributor Gregory Zuckerman, is a classic example of the sophisticated and useful market commentary Sunday Journal aims to deliver week after week. But our lead articles in recent months have also delivered on- the-news advice on topics ranging from the economics of buying a hybrid car to the impact on workers when traditional pensions are replaced by "cash balance" plans.  We've made a few other improvements as well. Encore, our column on all issues retirement related, is now a monthly offering by Tom Lauricella, who's joined us from the esteemed Money & Investing section of the daily Wall Street Journal.
