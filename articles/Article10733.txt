 IBM Unveils New Data-Storage Devices, Pressuring Already-Hurting Competitors   By By Dennis Kneale, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1985  The moves could contribute further to the troubles of competitors, particularly Storage Technology Corp., which have struggled to match IBM's disk technology. In 1984, IBM shipped an estimated 35,000 of the 3380 disk devices, more than three times the combined total of all other disk-drive vendors, estimates Disk/Trend Report, a trade publication.  But at least one optimistic competitor, Burroughs Corp.'s Memorex unit, said that IBM's pricing wasn't as aggressive as originally feared, and that the announcement ends a year of wait-and-see shopping by customers who had been expecting IBM's double-capacity product.  Storage Technology had said that it expected IBM's double-capacity disk drive to be introduced in late 1984 and had claimed that it would be able to produce a similar product shortly after IBM's became available. Since the Chapter 11 filing, however, new management has taken over, and the company currently says it is "evaluating our various courses of action." The company said it considers IBM's new product "an important development that materially improves disk storage for IBM users."
