 Buying at Integrated Alarm Gets Flak   By Cooke, Tony, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2005  The reason? Contrarian Capital has been pushing for the company to be sold, and the hedge fund says that Integrated Alarm's insiders wouldn't be buying stock if they expected a deal anytime soon.  An Integrated Alarm spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment, and an official at Contrarian Capital said the firm wouldn't discuss the matter.  Michael Malloy, a professor at California-based University of the Pacific Law School who has served as an SEC enforcement special counsel, didn't dispute Contrarian Capital's legal logic. "I've never heard that argument before, but on its own terms it's certainly a viable argument," he said.
