 Who Gives Atlanta Top Olympic Marks? Well, Georgians Do   By By Kevin G. Salwen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1996  In a poll of 558 Georgians completed Sunday, residents of the state offered little but praise for the just-finished Olympics. Despite the bombing in Centennial Olympic Park, the commercialism and the traffic hassles, 83% of those polled scored the event an "8" or higher on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being a total success and 1 being a total failure).  Indeed, Georgians were pleased with Marta, the city's rail system (it got a 7.8 rating on the same one-to-10 scale), according to the poll by Georgia State University's Applied Research Center and Atlanta public-relations firm Omni Resource Group Inc. And they want Atlanta to bid for other big-time sporting events, including Super Bowls and the collegiate basketball championships.
