 Genentech's Net More Than Doubles --- Cancer Drugs Boosted Gain In the Fourth Quarter As Revenue Rose 30%   By By David P. Hamilton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  The two drugs racked up combined sales of $454 million in the quarter. Rituxan just became Genentech's first billion-dollar drug, having pulled in 2002 sales of $1.16 billion. Genentech splits profits from the drug with Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp., which originally developed Rituxan.  That adjusted earnings-per-share figure is Genentech's preferred measure of its own performance, in line with a 1999 company pledge to deliver average EPS growth of 25% through 2005. Over the past several years, however, the company's EPS growth has steadily slowed, from 30% in 2000 to 25% in 2001 to 21% last year. This year, Genentech expects EPS growth of only 20%, Chief Financial Officer Louis Lavigne said in an interview.
