 Mannerism With a Vengeance -- the Art of Hendrick Goltzius   By Gurewitsch, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2003  For some visitors, the exhibition "Hendrick Goltzius, Dutch Master (1558-1617): Drawings, Prints, and Paintings," at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through Sept. 7, may lend substance to such a prejudice. For others, it will prove a thrilling discovery. But expect no lukewarm reactions. In Goltzius (sound the 'g' like the "ch" in the Scottish "loch), style so thoroughly trumps content that at times style is all one can see. Here is Mannerism with a vengeance. Bizarre, one might say. Grotesque. Like other artists from both sides of the Alps to whom the Mannerist label has been attached, Goltzius saw his way forward from the perfection of Michelangelo and Raphael in self- conscious exaggeration and distortion.  By the time Goltzius realized a life-long dream of visiting Rome, he was in his early 30s, so famous that he felt a need to travel incognito, an intention carried out by wrapping his telltale right hand. Italy was in the throes of famine, and Romans were dying in the streets, even as Goltzius stood by, drawing antiquities. A happier souvenir of the journey is his rear view of the celebrated tourist attraction known as the "Farnese Hercules" being ogled by a pair of perhaps Dutch cavaliers. (A monumentally scaled masterpiece from antiquity, it had been discovered some 40 years before.) A decade later, Goltzius quit printmaking and took up a new career as a painter in oils, producing some 50 known works on panel, copper and canvas, among them the ravishing "Danae," couched on satin pillows, not only showered in gold but with a pirate's chest of coins at her feet.
