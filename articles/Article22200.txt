 Boeing delays launch of new 747 and unveils $6.3 billion in orders   By Cole, Jeff; Goldsmith, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1996  Boeing Co announced orders for 68 airliners valued at $6.3 billion, but delayed the launch of its long-awaited new 747 jumbo jets for as long as three months. Boeing had been expected to announce the two new versions of the 747 at a big air show in Farnborough England, but it backed away from a formal production launch, partly because more orders are needed to satisfy Boeing's board.
