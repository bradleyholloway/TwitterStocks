 Investment Dartboard: Last Call to Join New Stock-Picking Game   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2004  Today is the final day for entries in The Wall Street Journal Sunday's 15th stock-picking contest.  It doesn't matter how well the dartboard portfolio does. We always have a human winner in these contests. A new contest starts at the end of every quarter and the contests run for six months each.  People who have joined in our prior contests also aren't eligible to compete this time.
