 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): R(Human) = R(Rodent)   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  It's no wonder that Meryl Streep and the National Resources Defense Council have been scaring people with the organization's report on children, cancer and pesticides in food. It's based on rats.  It is derived in large part from equations of the sort reprinted nearby, which attempt to extrapolate cancer risk in humans, R(human), from cancer risk in rodents, R(rodent) (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ April 10, 1988). This equation appears in the NRDC's report as part of Appendix Three, "Methodology for estimating preschooler cancer risk from carcinogenic pesticides in food."
