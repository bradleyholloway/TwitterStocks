 Successful Money Manager Finds Activism In Investing Can Come With a Stiff Price Tag   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1988  Mr. Sosnoff, 56 years old, heads a $5 billion money management firm, Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital. For years, he seemed relatively content to buy big, passive stakes for himself and clients in well-managed concerns like New York Times, Loews and J.P. Morgan. Until recently, Atalanta/Sosnoff was among the top 20 institutional stock-pickers tracked by CDA Investment Technologies.  But last spring -- in a move that was unprecedented for a pension fund manager -- Mr. Sosnoff became a shareholder activist. He launched a costly, ill-fated bid to buy Caesars World for his personal account. In a book published last March, "Silent Investor, Silent Loser," he upheld activism and castigated corporate executives for ignoring advice from big, long-term holders.  Atalanta/Sosnoff went public in 1986 at 14 1/2; it closed yesterday at 8 1/8. Mr. Sosnoff now has an 80% stake; he recently paid $18 million for Mr. Osherow's 20% stake. Mr. Osherow says he left the firm "on good terms" and wishes it well.
