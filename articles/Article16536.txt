 Change on the Supreme Court: Bush Unlikely to Give Lawmakers Much Say in His Pick for Justice   By John D. McKinnon and Christopher Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2005  Neither the Bush White House's operating style nor historical precedent suggests that those conversations will have much effect. "[Bush] will pick whomever he wants," said David Yalof, a University of Connecticut professor and author of a book about the Supreme Court nomination process. Mr. Bush might go through the motions with influential Senate moderates, Mr. Yalof added, but "if it could even be described as input, it's not going to be influence."  "Traditionally that's just not been done that much," said John Maltese, a University of Georgia professor who wrote a book about the confirmation process. While the Constitution calls for the president to nominate and appoint justices with the "advice and consent" of the Senate, the "advice" part of the clause "has atrophied," he said.  "If I were the president's lawyer I would say [the Gang of 14 agreement] can't possibly change the game," said Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor and former constitutional legal counsel in the Justice Department during the administrations of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush. "I actually think the effect is to embolden the president, to make the choice he would most strongly favor."
