 Insurance-Trial Goal: Keep It Simple; Complex GenRe/AIG Case Promises to Be Challenge for Prosecutors   By Richardson, Karen; Lattman, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2008  Today's case is the culmination of a nearly three-year probe into what prosecutors say was a sham deal in which GenRe, for a fee of $5 million, improperly helped AIG boost its loss reserves in 2000 and 2001 by $500 million or so, misleading analysts and investors about the amount of losses AIG could absorb and supporting its stock price. (Mr. Scrushy was later convicted of bribery and other charges in a separate trial.) Another wild card: the potential role, if any, of billionaire Warren Buffett, chairman of General Re's parent, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The defendants have argued in court papers that the widely respected Mr. Buffett was involved in the deal.
