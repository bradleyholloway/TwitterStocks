 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Moscow Spring   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1991  The world is fascinated with the chess-like power struggle between Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev. But in the end, the fate of the Soviet Union will rest on broader forces than merely the political craftiness of one of these men. Mr. Gorbachev has said over and over again that he will go to his grave a Communist. The Communist power base, as always, is muscle -- the army and the KGB.  The separatist referendums in the Baltics, Ukraine and Georgia forced Mr. Gorbachev to counter with his own all-Union referendum. The momentum of the past weeks demonstrates that the March referendum helped the democrats a great deal and the Communists not at all.  Consider even what happened to the Russian Communists. The Russian Congress of People's Deputies marched into the just-concluded session in a truculent anti-Yeltsin mood. The body turned down a Yeltsin initiative for direct presidential elections. But in two weeks of stormy debate, Mr. Yeltsin transformed the congress. In the end, it granted him extra powers, and overwhelmingly supported the direct elections it had earlier repudiated. The Communists, who are about half the delegates, are now split. About 170 Communists, sensing the decisive shift in momentum, have broken with their reactionary leadership and swung toward Mr. Yeltsin, forming a curious group called Communists for Democracy.
