 Will the Yen's Export Effect Help Japan? --- Yes, Currency Is Weak, But Other Factors Affect Economy More   By By Peter Landers and Phred Dvorak, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2001  Japanese officials are quietly welcoming the recent weakening of the yen, hoping it will benefit exporters that have propped up the economy in the past two years. But questions are mounting as to whether a weak yen can do much to counteract the fierce downward pressures on Japanese growth, among them the slowing U.S. economy and a continuing slide in Japanese share prices.  Yet for the Japanese economy as a whole, the currency is just one factor among many -- and not the most important one, say economists. The sudden weakening of the U.S. economy could hit hard the very same companies who benefit from a weak yen, such as auto and electronics makers. Japanese car makers will export 4.26 million cars in the year ending March 31, 2002, compared with 4.49 million in the current fiscal year, as demand falls off in the U.S. and Europe, according to estimates by Nomura Securities Co. Demand for personal computers is also weak, hurting Japanese exporters of parts such as semiconductors and displays.
