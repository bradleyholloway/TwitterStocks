 Blue-Chip Stocks Vault Back Over 7800 Mark   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1997  Stock prices continued to climb as investors exuberantly cast away worries about earnings and interest rates, even though the bond market's effort to break through to new 22-month highs stalled.  "Portfolio managers face the pressure of having more cash on hand they need to invest," said Michael Driscoll, listed stock trader at Hambrecht & Quist. "They also have the fear of falling behind and underperforming, so there's still a bias toward buying even though there's some skepticism on the long-term picture."  But in the short-term, the stock market appears to be set for further gains, traders agree. Yesterday, all major indexes posted sizable gains: the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 25.34 points, or 1.6%, to 1626.56, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 5.01 to 435.70. The breadth of that advance also encouraged bulls, as 2,058 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose, while only 923 declined.
