 Budget Talks Now Are Close To Agreement --- Accord Between Congress, Bush on Cutting Deficit Could Come Late Today   By By David Wessel and Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1990  After four months of unproductive talks, White House and congressional budget negotiators finally narrowed their differences and say they could reach a deficit-reduction compromise by late today or tomorrow morning.  Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and $200 billion from projected levels, based on proposals offered by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with both sides now proposing to make the elderly pay a bigger share of the cost of the rapidly growing Medicare program. Savings on interest costs would account for the balance of the $500 billion package. Even if negotiators agree to cut the deficit $50 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. and the package is enacted, the federal deficit will still approach $200 billion, the White House budget office estimates. As a result, any pact will have to waive the $64 billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.  In their new plan, Democrats call for people with incomes above $500,000 year to pay a "temporary surtax" of 20%, double the surtax they proposed initially, a summary of their proposal showed. But they dropped their demand for an increase to 35%, from the present 28%, in the marginal income-tax rate levied on the highest-income Americans. The temporary surtax, however, effectively would raise the top tax rate to 33.6% for people who make more than $500,000 a year. The Democrats also abandoned a proposal to increase the alternative minimum tax -- paid by upper-income individuals who would otherwise avoid taxes -- to 26% from the present 21%.
