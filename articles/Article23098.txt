 Carbs Aren't Fat City for Coors; Brewer Is Losing Diet-Conscious Drinkers to Michelob Ultra   By Lawton, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2004  As diet-conscious carb counters transform the beer business, casualties may include shareholders of Adolph Coors Co. The company's stock has been rising, in part because of stronger-than-expected earnings, but the Coors Light brand is getting hit by low-carbohydrate phenomenon Michelob Ultra. And much of Coors's earnings pop appears to be coming from currencies and tax cuts rather than sustainable organic growth. Some analysts have speculated that Coors is a takeover target.  Meanwhile, America's second-largest brewer, Miller Brewing Co., a unit of London's SABMiller PLC, repositioned Miller Lite as the low- carb beer of choice in a summer ad campaign. The commercials featured a sudsy beer background and told drinkers that Miller Lite has fewer carbohydrates than rival Coors Light. Viewers apparently liked what they heard. Miller Lite posted 0.6% volume growth in 2003, according to Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry publication, and analysts believe the beer is back on the road to growth.  In a U.S. market that actually shrank 0.9% by volume in 2003, the growing popularity of Miller Lite may have hurt Coors Light, whose volume slipped 2% last year. Parent company Adolph Coors suffered a 1.4% volume decline in its U.S. business, the third consecutive year Coors failed to grow in the U.S., according to Beer Marketer's Insights.
