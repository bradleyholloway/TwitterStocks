Thousands of teen-agers in Manhattan used St. Patrick's Day as an occasion to drink openly in the streets and to push and shove each others and passers-by. In Central Park, some of them climbed a 50-foot-tall flagpole and swung from a high weather vane.  The admonition last Sunday by Terence Cardinal Cooke, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, against what he said had become a trend in recent years to ''outrageous public behavior'' on St. Patrick's Day apparently went unheeded.  ''It seems to be as bad as ever,'' the Rev. Edwin F. O'Brien, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said late yesterday. ''I don't see how you can control it.''  Patron Saint of Archdiocese  New York City's Board of Education said there were no indications of unusual absences at public schools yesterday. Roman Catholic schools were closed for the day in the Archdiocese of New York - which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and several upstate counties -because, as Father O'Brien explained, ''St. Patrick is the patron saint of the archdiocese.''  In other areas, the pattern was mixed, with some Catholic schools open and others closed. Many of the youths came in from the suburbs, and commuter trains and buses were crowded with young people in the morning.  Early in the afternoon, some of the youths began showing up at hospital emergency rooms, many carried in because they were unable to stand.  Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire said through a spokesman that there were sufficient police officers to control the situation at the parade and that no serious problems had arisen.  But in many cases, the police apparently chose not to act against lawbreakers or were outnumbered by them. Green-Dyed Streaks  All along the Fifth Avenue parade route, youths were drinking beer and hard liquor despite a city law prohibiting the drinking of alcoholic beverages on the street. At 57th Street, a group of teenage girls, some with streaks of green dye in their hair, were drinking from a bottle of whisky. Two police officers standing less than a dozen feet from them smiled.  At 58th Street, an officer warned teen-agers to get rid of the beer they were carrying or they would get a summons. They looked at him incredulously and kept on drinking. He did not pursue them.  Many of the teen-agers carried six-packs openly, and some even lugged whole cases of beer. The police tried to keep the youths from taking beer and liquor into Central Park, but were largely unsuccessful. Hundreds of youths gathered on the rocks and hills around the Wollman Memorial Skating rink, cheering as they crashed empty bottles against the rocks. 'Go, Go, Go'  One boy started climbing a 50-foot-tall flagpole at the rink. A police sergeant stood by, struggling to call for reinforcements on his walkie-talkie over the crowd's shouts of ''Go, go, go,'' urging the climber on. The climb turned into a contest. When one youth finally reached the gold ball on top of the flagpole, the crowd yelled wildly.  Another group of youths clambered on the steep copper roof of the rink's comfort station, impaling beer cans on the spikes at the peak. Some mounted the weather vane and swung dizzily around on it far above the concrete pavement as the crowd cheered.  Nearby, a team from the city's Emergency Medical Service managed to revive a boy of about 15 who was flat on a bench. They tried to take him away to a hospital, but a girl of about 16, staggering with a half-empty bottle of whisky, intervened. ''Don't you take Mike away,'' she admonished. ''He's only drunk. We'll take him home.''  At the Roosevelt Hospital emergency room, the first youth, a 16-year-old, showed up at 2 P.M., carried in by two friends because he could not walk. The friends reluctantly said he had taken ''uppers'' - stimulating drugs - followed by Scotch whisky.  Saundra Shohen, administrator of Roosevelt's emergency department, was on duty for 15 hours last St. Patrick's Day. Yesterday afternoon, she braced for the same as a stream of cases began to flow in.  ''People think New Year's Eve is the busiest time for us,'' Miss Shohen said. ''Not so. St. Patrick's Day is by far the busiest day of the year.''  ''It's getting scary,'' she said as the emergency room began to fill. ''It used to be only the older teen-agers. Now it's the younger teen-agers and even younger kids.''  Illustrations: Photos of teen-agers
