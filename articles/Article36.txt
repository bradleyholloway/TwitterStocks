Steve Boros, a former major league infielder, will be named manager of the Oakland A's today, replacing Billy Martin, who was dismissed four weeks ago after three years with the team.  A source close to the A's said yesterday that Boros, who has been a coach with the Montreal Expos for the last two seasons, was selected over Jim Leyland, a Chicago White Sox coach, and Ray Miller, Baltimore's pitching coach.  Boros's appointment leaves only the Yankees without an announced manager for 1983. Martin is a strong candidate to replace Clyde King, who completed last season as manager and has not been told if he will continue.  At a news conference yesterday, the A's announced the signing of Tom Burgmeier, a free-agent relief pitcher who is 39 years old and has been in the major leagues for 15 years. According to a source familiar with the signing, Burgmeier, a left-hander, was signed for two years at about $400,000 a year. He was 7-0 with two saves for Boston last season.  Boros, 46 years old, was primarily a third baseman during his career with Detroit, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati, finishing with a .245 batting average. In the last 13 years, he has managed in the minor leagues for six seasons and coached in the majors for seven, five with Kansas City and the last two with Montreal.
