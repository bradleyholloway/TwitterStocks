Coming East to find his fortune is Charles L. Gould, long-time San Francisco ad man, who has been named the new president of Deutsch, Shea & Evans.  The case is a beautiful example of cross-pollination. The 42-year-old executive spent most of his advertising agency career at Honig, Cooper & Harrington, which was acquired by Foote, Cone & Belding in 1975. Then last May, F.C.& B. bought Deutsch, Shea & Evans, pulled a vice president out of the West Coast and made him president of the New York recruiting specialty agency, which has plans of moving West.  Arnold R. Deutsch will remain chairman and chief executive, while Van M. Evans, 55, slips up to chairman of the executive committee from president.  Illustrations: Photo of Charles L. Gould
