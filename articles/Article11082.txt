 Thrifts' Net Inflow Of Cash Was Lower During November   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1988  The net flow of cash into thrift institutions following the stock market crash continued in November, but at less than half of October's record amount, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said.  Deposits in thrifts exceeded withdrawals by $2.7 billion in November, the Bank Board said. This is a drop from October's net inflow of $6.1 billion, but contrasts sharply with thrifts' net outflow of $3 billion in November 1986.
