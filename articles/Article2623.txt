 Indonesia Bank Probe Uncovers Indications of Fraud --- Investigators Say Top Politicians Got Millions of Dollars   By By Jay Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  Indonesia's financial markets were roiled last month by banking regulators' reports that 546 billion rupiah ($66.6 million) was siphoned out of the recently nationalized Bank Bali to a company linked to President B.J. Habibie's ruling Golkar party. The company, PT Era Giat Prima, is headed by Golkar's vice treasurer, who contends the funds were earned through a legal "debt collection" service. Golkar Chairman Akbar Tanjung, meanwhile, said none of the money was transferred into the party's coffers.  In particular, the report highlights how rules governing Indonesia's loan-guarantee program had been breached by government officials in the Bank Bali case. Under the program, the government is obligated to repay all loans owed by shuttered Indonesian banks to third parties, in this case Bank Bali. But the report highlights that senior members of the Indonesian government assisted in channeling the funds to the Golkar-linked party.
