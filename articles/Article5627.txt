 Regional Airlines' Immunity From Asian Ills Is Helping Lift Their Shares Sharply This Year   By By Karen Hube, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  Unlike the majors, whose international business is being dragged down by flagging demand in Asia, regionals operate almost entirely domestically. Some analysts predict continued strong growth, particularly for certain "feeder" airlines, a kind of regional that generally doesn't compete with majors. Instead, feeder airlines have agreements with major airlines to feed traffic into their hubs via lowertrafficked routes.  The trend driving feeder airlines' growth is their rapid acquisition of 50- to 70-seat jets to enhance their fleets of 30seat turbo-propeller aircraft, analysts say. These jets travel as fast as major airlines' 120-seat jets, and as far as 1,900 miles against about 350 miles for older turboprops.  While airlines in general have been benefiting from heavy traffic, high fares and low fuel prices, these small jets give feeder airlines something majors don't have: a lot of room to boost capacity, or number of seats, by adding jets to existing routes or opening new routes too long for propeller aircraft.
