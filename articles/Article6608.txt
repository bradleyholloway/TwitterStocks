 Small-Stock Focus: Leap Wireless, Airgate Fall in Subdued Trading   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2002  For the day, the Russell 2000 Index of small cap stocks fell 0.79, or 0.2%, to 393.37 and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 lost 0.50, or 0.3%, to 202.44. The Nasdaq Composite Index of both large and small shares dropped 4.64, or 0.4%, to 1315.45. Volume on the Nasdaq was 1.05 billion shares, its second-lightest day of the year.  Wireless-communications stocks were the day's best performers on a percentage basis, but it wasn't a clean sweep. Triton PCS Holdings Class A shares rose 4.7%, or 14 cents, to 3.10 on the New York Stock Exchange and Western Wireless added 4.5%, or 13 cents, to 3.15. But Leap Wireless International fell 5.6%, or two cents, to 34 cents and AirGate PCS became a penny stock, sliding 8.7%, or nine cents, to 94 cents, a far cry from April 2000, when shares were trading at 114.50.  Vestcom International gained 23%, or 1.07, to 5.67 after Cornerstone Equity Investors LLC received a commitment for a $50 million credit facility to finance its acquisition of the West Caldwell, N.J., business-communications provider. Vestcom said Cornerstone now has sufficient funds for the acquisition, at a price of $6.25 a share in cash, plus assumed debt in a deal valued at about $75 million.
