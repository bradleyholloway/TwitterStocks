 Eritrea emerges as America's newest ally   By Pearl, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1997  Eritrea is becoming a hot spot in the new Cold War. The capital, Asmara, is the headquarters for groups who in Jan 1997 launched a bid to overthrow the Islamic fundamentalist government of neighboring Sudan. Eritrean soldiers are training Sudanese-opposition recruits, and Eritrea alleges a Sudanese role in the slaying of five foreign tourists in Eritrea. Although the US denies claims it is backing the Eritrean-based rebels, it is providing military equipment to Eritrea.
