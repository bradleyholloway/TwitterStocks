 Cisco, Apple and Dell Advance, Riding Gains of Tech Shares   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2003  Instead, Mr. [Steve Kolano] said, all eyes were on Cisco, which rose 51 cents, or 3.3%, to $15.90 on Nasdaq ahead of reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell. The network-equipment provider delivered by posting 15 cents a share before items, when analysts were expecting 14 cents.  Apple Computer rose 1.41, or 8.8%, to 17.50 on the Nasdaq as investors continued applauding word that the company's online iTunes Music Store sold more than one million songs in its first week in operation, exceeding expectations.  Gillette fell 1.01, or 3.2%, to 30.97 after first-period earnings came in a penny ahead of the Street's expectations, but the company's chairman expressed concern about competitive actions causing continued deflation in the battery category. Analysts were mixed, with UBS Warburg adding Gillette to its Global 50 highlighted stocks list while Prudential Securities cut shares to "hold" from "buy."
