 Turkey's Erdogan Makes Case for EU Membership   By Hugh Pope and Alan Friedman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  Mr. [Tayyip Erdogan], 50 years old, brushed aside recent criticism of Turkey's eligibility to join the EU, saying positive signals from the leadership of nearly all its states made him confident Turkey would get a "yes." Mr. Erdogan said that would send a strong signal to the broader Islamic world. "Then they will see that the clash of civilizations is not a reality but harmony of civilizations is a possibility," he said. "This is an opportunity the EU shouldn't miss."  Mr. Erdogan's comments showed he will be ratcheting up pressure on the EU to embrace Turkey's membership as an antidote to increasing tension between the West and Muslims. For the U.S., his sharp criticism of Israel's Palestinian strategy and U.S. actions in Iraq may signal challenges ahead in dealing with one of America's most important Middle East supporters.  Supporters of Turkey's EU hopes say its membership would help stabilize the Middle East by extending the union's external borders -- and European ideals on human rights, religious tolerance and economics -- to Syria, Iraq and Iran. They also say Turkey's huge, predominantly young population is needed to offset the EU's aging population and could help revitalize the union's sluggish economy.
