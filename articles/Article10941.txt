 Letters to the Editor: Remarks Remarked   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1986  In his Oct. 24 letter, Joseph R. Coyne, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board, denied that Chairman Volcker ever told a group of state legislators, "Look, your constituents are unhappy, mine aren't." Well, we were there, and we heard it.  We were among 200 legislators from 13 Midwestern Farm Belt states who traveled to Washington in February 1985 to enlighten federal policy makers about the agricultural crisis. About 20 of us met with Mr. Volcker on Feb. 26, in the board room of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Volcker's comment struck us then as uncharacteristically offensive and has remained indelibly imprinted in our minds.
