 National Semiconductor Posts Big Loss For 1st Quarter, but Topped Estimates   By By Dean Takahashi, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1998  SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- National Semiconductor Corp. reported a large fiscal first-quarter loss, but the battered chip maker topped analysts' expectations and indicated that its financial troubles may have bottomed.  National reported a loss of $104.8 million, or 63 cents a diluted share, for the fiscal first quarter, ended Aug. 30, compared with profit of $62.6 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Based on the company's preannouncement guidance of Aug. 19, analysts had expected a loss of 65 cents a share.  Revenue for the quarter fell 28% to $469.6 million, from $656.7 million a year earlier. Brian Halla, National's chief executive officer, said in a conference call with analysts that bookings in the fiscal first quarter may have "touched bottom" and that some markets, such as chips for personal computers and computer-networking, were showing signs of an upturn. He added that inventories among customers were reduced.
