 Flush With Success, Bathroom Attendants Stage a Comeback; For Some Patrons, 'Hosts' Bring Awkward Moments; A Tip: Avoid Eye Contact   By McLaughlin, Katy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2004  Adam Jed, general manager of Matrix Fillmore, a nightclub in San Francisco, installed an attendant as part of his "broken window" theory. "If you let the bathroom get shoddy, people will continue to treat your place like that," he says. The extra set of eyes, he says, "prevents illegal activities," such as taking drugs. At Have a Nice Day Cafe, a '70s and '80s retro nightclub in Milwaukee, the bathroom attendant stands vigil against the least little thing, such as stealing toilet paper, a manager says.  Chazz Ward, the Kentucky entrepreneur, was working the door at a Jillian's near Cincinnati five years ago when he got the idea to provide the company with bathroom-attendant services. Today, his company, Black Tie Services, staffs bathrooms at 16 restaurants, clubs and entertainment centers in northern Kentucky, Cincinnati and Indiana. His newest effort: franchising the business. He says he is in negotiations with four potential franchisees around the country to buy into the formula he has created. Part of it is the curriculum for Black Tie University, a three-hour training program in which employees learn "a host mentality" as well as to always call patrons "sir" or "ma'am."  "There's not enough respect going on in people's regular lives," says Mr. Ward. Then suddenly, they go into the bathroom and a lounge host pulls out the hand towels, the mints, the top of the line colognes. "It's like if someone were never told they were loved, and they go into a relationship and they are told they're loved," he says.
