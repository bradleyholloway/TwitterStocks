 Owens-Illinois Inc. May Bypass FTC On Brockway Bid   By By Amanda Bennett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1988  Owens-Illinois Inc. indicated that it will try to complete its $750 million acquisition of Brockway Inc. even though it expects the Federal Trade Commission to sue to block the takeover.  "What we're saying is that we've talked with the FTC about remedies (for their concerns) and if the proposed remedy isn't satisfactory, let's let the court decide," said an Owens-Illinois spokesman.  Owens-Illinois said that, as agreed earlier, it is giving the FTC two days' notice before attempting to buy any Brockway shares under an often-extended $60-a-share tender offer that expires Thursday. The suitor said it "anticipates that the commission will seek an injunction to enjoin the consummation of the offer."
