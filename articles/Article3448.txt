 Cafta Is the American Way   By Paulson, Henry M, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2005  As Congress considers the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and as we move into a critical stage of global trade talks, the U.S. will be presented with a fundamental question: Will it continue to lead and help pave the way through open markets to create new jobs and growth? The answer is not all together clear. Cafta, which would create the second-largest U.S. export market in Latin America, is struggling to gain enough support. Concerns about labor-rights protections and sugar imports threaten to kill an agreement that actually opens up Central America's markets to U.S. goods, which are subject to high tariffs. America's markets already are predominantly open to goods from these countries.  Cafta would give U.S. producers, particularly in textiles and agriculture, an equal footing to sell their goods. Central America and the Dominican Republic represent the second largest market for U.S. textiles and yarn. Cafta would preserve and increase this market by granting duty-free status if regional producers use U.S. fabrics. This would support U.S. jobs and help Central America compete with Asia, where U.S. materials account for less than 1% of clothes made. Failure to pass Cafta would not only hurt U.S. efforts to sell more of its goods to Central America and the Dominican Republic; it would represent a setback to U.S. trade policy and a rejection of a fundamental reason for U.S. growth.
