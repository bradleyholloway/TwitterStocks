 Another Party Switch   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  Premise No. 1 of the Democratic playbook was that voters were tiring of the Bush Administration and an "extreme" agenda that was out of touch with the country. Indeed, House special elections traditionally give voters a ready way to convey discontent to the party in charge of the White House. Columnist Rich Galen notes there had been 19 special elections in the past quarter century in which a seat switched parties. In only three did the party in the White House win a seat held by the opposition party. The GOP win in Virginia, filling a seat vacated by the death of Democrat Norm Sisisky, is the fourth such victory. The Bush Administration so far has a better record of success in special elections than Ronald Reagan did during his first year.
