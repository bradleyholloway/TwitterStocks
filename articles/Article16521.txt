 North Koreans Test U.S. on Asylum; Despite Pledges on Rights, Rulings Call for Expulsion Of Many Seeking Protection   By Hiebert, Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2005  About 100 North Koreans have arrived clandestinely in the U.S. since President [Bush] signed the North Korea Human Rights Act last October. But none of them will be allowed to stay if they are caught or apply for asylum, according to U.S. officials and in light of recent court rulings on North Korean asylum seekers in the U.S. That is because the human-rights bill offers U.S. asylum only if the North Koreans haven't gone to South Korea first. Many of the North Koreans now in the U.S. fled to neighboring China and were allowed to travel to and resettle in South Korea before heading to the U.S.  Washington is reluctant to grant asylum to these North Koreans for fear of setting off a larger flood of refugees and angering China, whose cooperation the U.S. needs in the stalled six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear-weapons program. The U.S. is also wary of offending its South Korean ally, which might feel rebuked if the U.S. admits refugees who were already resettled in that democratic nation. North Korea views the human-rights legislation as an effort to subvert its regime.  Many of these North Korean refugees were attracted by inaccurate news reports in South Korea suggesting that people from North Korea would be welcome in the U.S. "There are false rumors that they will receive a [resettlement] stipend in the U.S. like they get in South Korea," Mr. You says. For years, South Korea gave North Koreans resettlement funds when they entered the country. But earlier this year, Seoul sharply cut the resettlement stipends as the number of new arrivals rose. The government also recently tightened screening of would-be immigrants from the North.
