ANKARA, Turkey, April 11â€” Former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who was taken from his home Saturday and detained overnight, will face a military court Monday over his contacts with the foreign press, martial law officials said today.  They said the court would decide whether to charge Mr. Ecevit, who is 56 years old, with violating Turkey's penal code by giving false information to foreigners that could endanger national security.  Conviction on such a charge means a minimum of five years of ''rigorous'' imprisonment, according to the code, which mentions no maximum penalty.  Mr. Ecevit has already spent two months in jail for speaking to the foreign press and is scheduled to stand trial on April 29 on a separate charge of writing an article published in the West German magazine Der Spiegel last month.
