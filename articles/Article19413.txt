 Improving Data Pose Challenge for Fed: How to Deal With Good News Amid Bad   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2001  For the Fed, that probably means a continuation, but a deceleration of its campaign to keep the expansion alive with lower rates. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan still sees ample "downside risk" to both consumer and business spending. That suggests when officials meet later this month, the most likely outcome is a quarter-point reduction in short-term rates.  The debate inside the Fed reflects a similar, profound shift in the broad economic mood since January. Even as profits sink and job losses mount, stock prices have soared and consumer confidence has improved. For that mood shift, James Glassman, an economist at J.P. Morgan, credits "the best timed set of macroeconomic policies we've ever had," with aggressive Fed easing, followed by surprisingly fast passage of a tax cut.  While Mr. Greenspan has taken pains to play down the risks of inflation, other Fed officials are increasingly talking about such risks. Fed governor Laurence Meyer has raised worries that when the economy strengthens again there will be very little slack in labor markets and this little margin for error.
