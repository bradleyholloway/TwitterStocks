 High Style on the High Seas --- It's First Class All the Way As Fashion Houses Join Forces With Yacht Makers   By By Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2000  Some of the world's finest sailboats sliced through the crystalline waters here off Sardinia's Costa Smeralda under late-summer sunshine earlier this month. It was Swan Cup 2000, with nearly 100 participants, but one boat was the center of attention -- the Solleone, a sleek new 82-footer from Swan, the boat maker bought two years ago by Leonardo Ferragamo of the eponymous fashion group.  Mr. Ferragamo, a passionate sailor, bought his first Swan in 1988. But it was just three years ago that he got a close-up look at the decline of the historic marque. Called the Rolls-Royce of sailing, [Swan] had suffered from years of uninterested ownership by the Finnish paper conglomerate that had inherited Swan's parent company, Nautor, as part of an unrelated deal.  There are those in yachting circles who say -- privately -- that Mr. Ferragamo lacks the experience in the boating sector to properly reposition Swan, while the whole luxury-boats sector is vulnerable to any waning in the current bull market. Mr. Ferragamo responds that his restructuring has already brought the group back into the black and will tide Swan over in bad times, supported by the strength of the brand and a world-wide following. "It's fundamental that we lower the breakeven level for the group," he says. "This is a company that has a strong reputation and is a historic name in the sailing world."
