 Bond Prices Tumble as Profit-Taking Brakes a Powerful Monthlong Rally   By By Edward P. Foldessy and Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1986  The mood contrasted sharply with the euphoria that swept the markets earlier in the week amid speculation that West Germany would soon reduce its interest rates. Such a move would pave the way for a cut in the discount rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve System, some analysts reasoned. The discount rate, the fee charged by the Fed on loans to banks and savings institutions, has been 7 1/2% since last May.  But some money managers are growing wary of long-term bonds. Richard J. Hoffman, president and chief executive officer of AIG Global Investors Inc., said he doubts that yields on long-term bonds will decline much further. Speaking at a breakfast meeting sponsored by Amivest Capital Management Corp., a pension fund manager, Mr. Hoffman said AIG Global, a subsidiary of American International Group, "is beginning to shorten maturities" in its bond portfolio.  A few analysts say the Fed already is easing its credit hold. "The Fed may be in the process of easing ever so slightly," said Mr. Sullivan of Dean Witter. He contends that the central bank is willing to tolerate easier credit conditions because of the sluggish growth of one broad measure of the money supply, known as M2. He estimated that the M2 measure expanded at only a 3.5% annual rate last month following a meager 1% growth pace in January. The Fed is seeking 6% to 9% growth this year in M2.
