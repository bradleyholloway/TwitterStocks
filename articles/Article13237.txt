 In Humans vs. Indexes, the Duel Continues; Active Managers Did Well in '05, But Advocates of Passive Funds   By Tom Lauricella and Diya Gullapalli, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2006  "If you think active managers did better, take a closer look," says Russel Kinnel, director of mutual-fund research at Morningstar, the investment-research provider. It's a "much more nuanced story." For starters, in most years, portfolio managers investing in small-company stocks will beat their target index.  TIAA-CREF LOSS: For the second time in less than three years, TIAA- CREF, the giant pension and insurance company, has been ditched as manager of a state-run college-savings program. Missouri officials announced yesterday that the state selected a group of three other companies, including Vanguard Group and American Century Investments, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., to run its $700 million program when TIAA-CREF's contract expires in May.  TIAA-CREF had bid to continue running the $827 million plan but wasn't chosen. "We would have liked our very competitive bid to continue managing the [plan] to have been selected," TIAA-CREF said in a statement. Missouri said it chose the new plan managers because they offered a wider range of products, and in the case of Vanguard, offered funds at lower cost than TIAA-CREF has been providing.
