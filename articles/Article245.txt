SAN YSIDRO, Calif., Aug. 29â€” The United States Customs Service has done without its expensive crime-detection computer system at the nation's five busiest border crossings for at least a month.  The San Diego Union reported that the suspension was ordered to see whether the system was a good investment; it costs the Government $8 million a year.  The use of the computer was stopped in primary inspection lanes at San Ysidro and El Paso points of entry from Mexico, and Detroit, Buffalo and Blaine, Wash., points of entry from Canada, a customs official said Wednesday.
