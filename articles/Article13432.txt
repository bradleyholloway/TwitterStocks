 Beating the Street: Ex-Star Analyst Sentenced To Prison for IPO Caper; He Took Big Liberties With Peter Lynch Idea Involving Mutual Banks   By Lattman, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2007  Pleading guilty along with Mr. [Bert Fingerhut] was Robert Danetz, a retired New York City schoolteacher. Mr. Danetz, known as [Bobby Danetz], traveled the country opening accounts funded by Mr. Fingerhut. He has agreed to forfeit about $1.2 million, his cut of Mr. Fingerhut's profits. "Mr. Danetz deeply regrets his involvement in this episode, for which he blames no one but himself," said his lawyer, Aitan Goelman.  Despite their friendship, their bank scheme had a formal side. Mr. Danetz signed an "Investment Trust Agreement" acknowledging that Mr. Fingerhut controlled the various bank accounts and stock allocations, according to the SEC. Mr. Danetz agreed that the accounts in his and his family members' names were held in trust "solely for the benefit of Bert Fingerhut." The agreement also required Mr. Danetz not to disclose their pact. It did not provide for a set percentage of the take to go to Mr. Danetz; that was left up to Mr. Fingerhut, according to people familiar with the case.  The deal was so hot it caught the eye of regulators. The SEC sent questionnaires asking some depositors if they had paid for the shares themselves. One questionnaire went to Mr. Danetz's daughter, according to the SEC's complaint. The SEC asked the woman, who the agency said earned about $25,000 a year as a speech therapist, how she came up with $700,000 for her purchase. At Mr. Fingerhut's direction, said the SEC, Mr. Danetz filled out the form for his daughter and told the SEC he had lent her the money. Federal authorities didn't take any action against Ms. Danetz.
