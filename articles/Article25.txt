NORTH CALDWELL, N.J., Jan. 21â€” Two New Jersey composers said today that they were proud that one of their hit songs, ''Tie a Yellow Ribbon,'' had become a popular anthem and a symbol of hope during the 15-month hostage crisis.  ''We're deeply gratified by what's happened and very proud that that's our song, and we want to jump out and let the world know it,'' said L. Russel Brown of North Caldwell, who wrote the song with Irwin Levine of Livingston, N.J.  Mr. Levine said he was filled with emotion last night when he saw that the two female hostages were wearing yellow ribbons in their hair when they stepped off the airplane.  ''For someone who writes for a living, I was at a loss for words. It was one of the greatest moments of my life,'' he said. Although the two Newark natives have collaborated on over 40 hit songs, ''Tie a Yellow Ribbon,'' which was written in 1973, is their most popular and most performed composition, and one for which they have received the least recognition.  Mr. Brown said that the song was regarded as a flop and a potential embarrassment until Tony Orlando, the singer, recorded it and performed it on television. Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby have also performed the song.
