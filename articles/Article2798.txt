 Election 2000: Some Die-Hard Democrats Are Still Trying To Sway GOP Electors to Vote for Gore   By By Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  From Austin, campaign aides say they are continuing to reach out to GOP electors, reminding them of their responsibilities. "We have had a concerted effort to communicate," says [George W. Bush] campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan. "It hasn't changed in any way because of the Supreme Court decision."  With a Florida win secured, Mr. Bush has 271 electors pledged to vote for him, one more than the minimum necessary to become president. But if three electors switch and vote for Mr. [Al Gore], he would be the winner. If just two electors switch, the election would be a tie and the presidential decision would have to be made by Congress.  This week, all GOP electors received instructions on how to vote for Mr. Bush. They also were asked to participate in a conference call this past Monday evening with Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate and transition chairman, and Bush campaign strategist Karl Rove. Similar calls are expected in the next week, though Mr. Sullivan stresses that "we don't want to pester them" with calls.
