In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Hammermill closed at $55.50 a share, up 50 cents, which analysts said indicates traders believe the bidding could go higher.  Hammermill also said it will seek court action to stop Mr. Bilzerian's group from proceeding with the tender offer and will seek to dismiss a suit that Mr. Bilzerian filed in federal court in eastern Pennsylvania, seeking to invalidate Hammermill's authorization cleared in May to issue a new class of preferred stock in an anti-takeover measure.
