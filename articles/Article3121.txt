 AOL Launches a New Tool to Keep Teens   By By Julia Angwin, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2003  To upgrade its image among technically savvy Web surfers, America Online is quietly rolling out a preview version of a new product called AOL Communicator. It won't be marketed until this summer but already is being offered to some subscribers. AOL Communicator looks a bit like a souped-up version of AOL Instant Messenger, the hugely popular free software used to hold running online text conversations.  The Communicator e-mail system is much more sophisticated than the e-mail program built into America Online's dial-up Internet service. The new system in many ways resembles Microsoft Corp.'s Outlook, the industry's largest e-mail software. It has filters to block junk e-mail and allows users to read mail sent to their non-AOL e-mail accounts. Unlike Instant Messenger, which is available to anyone with an Internet connection, AOL Communicator will be offered only to America Online subscribers.  "This is definitely is good enough for most technically savvy people," he says, even though he quibbles with the price. Right now, AOL Communicator is available only to subscribers who pay the full $23.90 a month for an America Online subscription. Mr. [Dan Kirshenbaum] says he wishes he could pay less just for his AOL e-mail address and Communicator, but will likely pay full freight if he has to.
