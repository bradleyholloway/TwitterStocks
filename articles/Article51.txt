WASHINGTON, Aug. 16â€” The aircraft carrier Coral Sea and four other United States warships arrived off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua today to start the second phase of United States exercises in the region.  An announcement said the battle group headed by the Coral Sea, which is carrying more than 70 warplanes, ''will conduct training and operations in international waters'' off the eastern coast of Central America.  Meanwhile, the battleship New Jersey and five other warships have left Pearl Harbor, and are steaming toward the Pacific coast of Central America, the Pentagon said.  MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Aug. 16 (Reuters) - Nicaragua today rejected an invitation from Honduras to send observers to joint United States-Honduran maneuvers because, it said, they were an obstacle to a peaceful solution in Central America.
