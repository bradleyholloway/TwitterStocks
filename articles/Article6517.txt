 Officers at Lands' End Sold in November   By By Cassell Bryan-Low, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  The leading seller was Chief Executive David Dyer, who sold 300,000 shares valued at $12.5 million, his largest sale to date. In addition, Executive Vice President Lee Eisenberg and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Jones sold 76,000 and 42,900 shares, respectively.  It was the company's largest monthly sale to date in terms of the number of insiders selling, according to Lon Gerber, director of research at insider-data tracker Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics who attributed the sales to profit taking.  In general, there hasn't been "overwhelming sales" by insiders at apparel retailers, but those companies where there has been noteworthy selling tend to have stocks trading near 52-week highs, Mr. Gerber said. He points to Ross Stores Inc. as another example. Ten insiders at the Newark, Calif., operator of a chain of discount stores sold more than 320,000 shares valued at about $9.7 million from late September through the end of October, at prices of $25.64 to $32.28, according to Thomson Financial. A Ross Stores representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
