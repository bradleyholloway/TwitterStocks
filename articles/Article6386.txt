 Reform Wreckers   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2004  The main obstacle here is a political bogeyman called "transition costs." We're not surprised to hear Democrats demanding a tax hike to "pay" for this reform, or that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (a major villain in the Medicare debacle) appears poised to join them. But color us disappointed to find South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham in their camp.  White House spokesman Scott McClellan was absolutely right yesterday when he said "the financial markets will look very favorably on that approach." Why? Because they know the government already owes the money anyway. The same politicians expressing horror at new "borrowing" don't seem to be urging any benefit cuts that would allow us to borrow less.  Which brings us back to Senator Graham's destructive idea -- and the folly of Republicans accepting the notion that people making $87,900 with a mortgage and kids are somehow "affluent" and worthy of sacrificing in order to win the plaudits of a Democrat or two. On the economic merits, the people who would get whacked by this 6.2- percentage-point increase in marginal tax rates are among America's most productive, many of them small business owners (who pay the full 12.4%) creating jobs. Such a tax hike would increase the cost of hiring and decrease the number of "good jobs" every politician says he wants to create.
