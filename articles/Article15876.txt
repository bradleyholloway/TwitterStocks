 Paul Allen Leads $32 Million Investment In an Independent-Movie Distributor   By By John Lippman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2000  In exchange for the funding, the investment group will receive warrants and convertible shares that could amount to a 37% stake in Lions Gate, a company best known as a distributor of independent movies such as "Gods and Monsters," "Affliction" and the recent "Dogma."  The infusion is a welcome relief for Lions Gate, Vancouver, British Columbia, which has struggled since going public more than two years ago. Frank Guistra, chairman of Lions Gate, said the investment will bolster the company's balance sheet and give it important strategic relationships with European partners. Mr. Guistra said Lions Gate could form deals that would give SBS and Tele-Munchen rights to air or distribute Lions Gate productions in their territories.
