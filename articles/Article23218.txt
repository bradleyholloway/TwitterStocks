 WSJ(3/3) UPDATE: Social Security Revamp May Hurt Spouses   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2005  What happens to those two women's benefits under the president's proposal to allow workers to direct a portion of their Social Security taxes to personal investment accounts? The administration says people who opt for personal accounts would see a corresponding reduction in their traditional Social Security benefits, leaving their total monthly payments dependent on how well their personal-account investments do. But it hasn't said whether traditional benefits paid to such surviving spouses and ex-spouses also would be reduced.  When the president's 2001 Social Security commission proposed a similar plan for personal accounts, its report didn't specify how the offsetting benefit reductions should be applied. But the Social Security Administration, in analyzing the commission proposals, assumed reductions would apply to retired workers and spouses, to surviving spouses of workers who died after retiring and to ex-spouses who received a portion of a worker's private account, says Stephen Goss, the agency's chief actuary.  That approach spreads the benefit reduction across the worker and the spouse -- but doesn't penalize the family if the worker dies at a younger age, while still working. (In that case, it appears the family might also inherit the worker's private account balance.)
