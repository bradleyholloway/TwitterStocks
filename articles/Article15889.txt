 Jill Barad Abruptly Quits the Top Job at Mattel   By By Lisa Bannon and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2000  Yesterday's meeting, held at the investment bank where two Mattel directors are executives, dragged on for nearly eight hours. The 48-year-old Ms. [Jill] Barad was present, although she left quietly through a side door. She was scheduled to fly back to Los Angeles last evening with several Mattel colleagues on a corporate jet.  Announcing Ms. Barad's resignation, which was effective yesterday, Mattel said it lost $18.4 million in the fourth quarter, or four cents per share on sales of $1.77 billion. That compares with net income of $88.7 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, in the prior year. Mattel's operating earnings for 1999 were $182.1 million, or 43 cents a share, before one-time charges.  Ms. Barad is widely acknowledged to be a brilliant marketer who worked her way up the ladder at Mattel over 20 years, building the Barbie doll into a $1.8 billion global powerhouse. But her time in the top office has been stormy almost from the start. Over the past six months, as Mattel's stock collapsed, wiping out nearly three-quarters of its market capitalization, investors have clamored for her replacement. At the center of Mattel's crisis is last year's $3.5 billion acquisition of software company Learning Co. But longer term, Mattel was already struggling with a changing market as toy retailers cut inventory.
