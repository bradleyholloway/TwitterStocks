 Choice of Kaifu To Lead Japan Seems Probable   By By Urban C. Lehner, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  Four of the Liberal Democratic Party's six major factions are supporting Toshiki Kaifu, a 58-year-old former education minister, and their support makes Mr. Kaifu a strong frontrunner. Although he is little known outside Japan and lacks top policy-making experience in economics or foreign affairs, Mr. Kaifu appeals to both sides of the sharply divided LDP: those who would do anything to clean up the party's scandal-plagued image, and those who desperately want the party to cling to its traditional ways.  Theoretically, the 405 LDP members of the Japanese parliament, or Diet, and 47 local delegates could still cast their secret ballots for one of the other two candidates who entered the race Saturday -- Shintaro Ishihara, 56, a novelist and former transportation minister, and Yoshiro Hayashi, 62, a former health and welfare minister. And Mr. Ishihara, in particular, is the favorite of a group of young, right-wing LDP Diet members, who like his hawkish nationalist views.
