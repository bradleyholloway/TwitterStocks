 Carter Faces Up to 4 Years In State Prison   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1990  Behind Mr. Carter's plea, which was expected, was "a systematic pattern of greed and fraud" involving the overcharging and false billing of corporate clients at Carter Organization, the firm Mr. Carter founded in 1974, said Ronald Goldstock, director of the state's Organized Crime Task Force, which assembled the case.  When necessary, Mr. Goldstock added, the Carter firm supplied false documentation to justify false invoices. As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Carter has agreed to put $1 million in an escrow account to reimburse wronged clients. Mr. Goldstock said such clients include Union Carbide Corp., Shell Oil Co., Caesars World Inc., and McAndrews & Forbes Group Inc., parent of Revlon Inc.
