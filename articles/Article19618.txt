 Putin Tests Limits of U.S. Partnership --- Russians Wary of Iraq War Say Washington Has Done Little to Earn Their Support   By By Alan Cullison, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  Most influential have been Russia's Soviet-era diplomats and military advisers, who continue to hold government posts. Evgeny Primakov, former head of the Soviet spy service and now a special envoy for the Kremlin, flew to Baghdad last week where he reportedly tried to persuade Mr. Hussein to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The trip mirrored a 1990 flight by Mr. Primakov to Baghdad, in which he met with Mr. Hussein and tried to stave off a U.S. attack on Iraq the following year. Neither diplomatic gambit was much appreciated by the U.S.: Last week a top [Bush] administration official called Mr. Primakov a "pain in the neck."  The Bush administration is betting that Moscow will, in the end, cave in over Iraq when it understands that war is inevitable. As a permanent Security Council member, Russia could veto the U.S.-backed resolution authorizing force if it comes to a vote. While Russia says it is prepared to do so if needed for "international stability," the U.S. says Moscow doesn't want to risk a break in ties over Iraq. Bush administration officials believe Russia won't cast a veto, especially not alone.  Last week, the U.S. designated three rebel groups in Chechnya as "terrorist organizations" linked to al Qaeda and imposed a freeze on their U.S. assets. While the U.S. said the move wasn't related to the standoff over Iraq, it is certain to please Mr. [Vladimir Putin], who rose to power on the back of promises to subdue the breakaway republic.
