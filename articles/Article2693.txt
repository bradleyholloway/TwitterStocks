 Meet Dave Dittrich, Holding Ground Zero In the D.O.S. Wars   By By Thomas E. Weber, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2000  "The intrusions were very quiet and very fast," Mr. [Dave] Dittrich says, recalling the days last August when he first noticed something amiss on the Internet. "It was obvious to me at that point we had a big problem here."  Meet the world's foremost expert on denial-of-service, or D.O.S., attacks. Mr. Dittrich doesn't work for the FBI or for any of the billion-dollar dot-coms that found themselves crippled by last week's hacker onslaught. He's a 38-year-old software engineer at the University of Washington whose job is to make sure the campus network runs smoothly.  Mr. Dittrich has prepared the state-of-the-art analyses of how these D.O.S. attacks work. He is the man who hunted, found, categorized and dissected these malicious programs, much as a doctor would identify and catalog a virus as the starting point for a cure. His work is on the Web for all to see at http://www.washington.edu/People/dad / (where you'll also find a photo of Mr. Dittrich on his back on a ski slope, feet waving in the air).
