 Credit Lines: International Bankers, Debtor Nations Squaring Off Again in the Debt Crisis   By By S. Karene Witcher, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1986  THE CRIES FROM disgruntled international bankers get louder: They aren't happy lending beleaguered debtor nations more money just to pay interest on old debt. Some of those bankers aired their views at a U.S. congressional conference on debt and trade held in New York last week. Similar remarks have been made before, but bankers say the place and timing was significant. U.S. lawmakers look set to make international debt an issue in the 100th Congress.  "It's silly," Yoh Kurosawa, deputy president of the private Industrial Bank of Japan, said of the practice of lending more to financially troubled debtor countries, such as Mexico. Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank called for alternatives; it is negotiating with Peru to be repaid in goods. And while a Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. official said his bank doesn't favor forgiving debt, Morgan is willing to consider various proposals. "We're pragmatists," he added.  But the strongest push for breaking new ground came from Franz Lutolf, general manager of Swiss Bank Corp. He proposed allowing debtor nations to defer interest payments and repay them later according to their ability to pay. Repayment would be based on, perhaps, commodity prices or a general economic growth target. He also suggested recycling to debtor countries interest payments they've made, provided they pursue certain economic policies.
