 Anschutz Settles IPO `Spinning' Case With Donation Pact   By By Randall Smith and Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2003  In the civil lawsuit, Mr. [Eliot Spitzer] charged that the executives were offered access to the IPOs by the former Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc. as part of an effort by the unit to win investment-banking business from their companies. He also charged that his $5 million in IPO profits unjustly enriched Mr. [Philip Anschutz], and that by failing to disclose those profits he violated the Martin Act, New York's state securities law. (The former Salomon Smith Barney banking unit has been folded into Citigroup's global corporate and investment bank.)  An Anschutz Co. statement said the company had "received IPOs because it is a large brokerage client that actively invests in a broad range of publicly traded stocks and bonds. We received a small amount of IPOs in relation to our overall portfolio and believe our conduct was proper in all respects. We never steered Qwest investment-banking business to Salomon Smith Barney nor to any other investment banker in exchange for IPOs. Mr. Anschutz did not personally receive nor review IPO opportunities, as they were handled by our portfolio managers."  Eric Dinallo, chief of Mr. Spitzer's investor-protection bureau, who supervised talks with lawyers for Mr. Anschutz, said his office still is examining the timing of IPO allocations and decisions by the other executives' companies to direct investment-banking assignments to Salomon. He added that those executives' defenses might be weakened by the fact that they were active corporate officers, unlike Mr. Anschutz.
