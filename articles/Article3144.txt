 Retailing: Buying for Home: Bright Spot in Uneven Season   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1998  At specialty stores, sales of home furnishings rose 9.1%, and home entertainment sales rose 3.7% in the second week of December over the same period last year, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Meanwhile, clothing sales were nearly flat, rising just 0.1%, says the council, which is sticking to its forecast for a 4% to 4.5% overall sales increase this season. "The home is fashionable now," says John Konarski, the council's senior vice president of research.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, says seasonal items, such as scented candles, are selling well at its discount stores, and furniture and home electronics are strongly at its Sam's Club stores. The Bentonville, Ark., company says sales are "within plan" for mid-single-digit increases at its discount stores and "above plan" at Sam's.  At Williams-Sonoma Inc., which operates Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma stores, sales are "right on plan" to beat last year, says Gary Friedman, Williams-Sonoma's president of retailing. A collection of plates and other tableware decorated with reindeer drawings is the "hottest item ever" at Pottery Barn, Mr. Friedman says. The plates, which cost $59 for a set of four, feature Vixen, for example, with long lashes and wearing just a red shawl. Dasher sports a blue dinner jacket, holding a martini.
