 Right Bank Jazz Revival   By By Nicholas Powell, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1987  Paris -- In postwar Paris when jazz, which the Nazis had banned, and dancing the jitterbug, which they also disapproved of, were all the rage, intellectuals like Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus spent many an evening in musty Left Bank cellar clubs drinking newly imported Coca-Cola and listening to bands. Duke Ellington and Sidney Bechet used to show up. So did Orson Welles, who commented many years later that he liked Camus but not Sartre, because Sartre didn't like his movies. Welles did, however, get on with fledgling singer Eartha Kitt, whom he helped launch from the dives of Paris to Broadway.  Then, in the 1950s, the jazz craze died out and with it the famous clubs of Saint-Germain-des-Pres: Le Mephisto, Le Tabou, Le Bar Vert and Le Lorientais.  But over the past year or so jazz has been making a big comeback in Paris and some French fans now claim the city has replaced New York as the jazz capital of the world. The clubs are now to be found mainly on the Right Bank of the Seine, in cafes and cellar bars in the trendy Les Halles district near the Pompidou Arts Center.
