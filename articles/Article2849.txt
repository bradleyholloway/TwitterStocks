 Siemens Cuts Profit Outlook For This Year --- Irking Investors, News Comes Just One Day After ADR Listing   By By Alfred Kueppers and Neal Boudette, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  Siemens said it still expects double-digit growth in new orders and sales for its own divisions, such as the turbine-making power-generation unit. However, it added, the rapidly falling prices of Infineon's primary earner, memory chips, will have a major effect on Siemens's performance. Infineon accounted for 26% of Siemens's net income in the first quarter of this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.  Company spokesman Eric Jackson said Siemens simply hadn't received the information from Infineon until after trading of its ADRs began Monday. Siemens Chief Executive Heinrich von Pierer had told reporters Monday "we are a very open company, certainly more transparent than our competitors."  Siemens isn't the first German company to issue a warning shortly after completing an offering in the U.S. However, it is certainly the quickest -- the announcement came at a breakfast meeting at 7 a.m. in New York. In late trading yesterday, Siemens's ADRs were down 31 cents at $109.69.
