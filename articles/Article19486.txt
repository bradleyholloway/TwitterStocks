 Deals & Deal Makers -- IPO Outlook: Tech IPOs Will Be Tested In Offering From PayPal   By By Raymond Hennessey, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2002  The next test for tech IPOs will come this week, with an offering from PayPal Inc. PayPal, based in Palo Alto, Calif., plans to sell 5.4 million shares at $12 to $14 a share through Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney.  PayPal is a sort of Internet bank, allowing frequent Web users, such as eBay participants, to handle cash transactions online. PayPal's sales growth is characteristic of tech companies when the IPO market was at its peak a few years ago. Pay-Pal's revenue of $40.4 million in the fourth quarter was more than four times the $8.8 million in revenue it reported for the comparable period of 2000.  This week, for instance, PayPal will be joined by a $115 million IPO from pipeline company Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, through Lehman Brothers.
