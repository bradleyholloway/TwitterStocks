 Gemstar Taps John P. Loughlin To Oversee Sagging TV Guide   By By Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2002  Gemstar executives say there is no reason TV Guide should continue deteriorating. Mr. [John P. Loughlin] said he would like to see the magazine become less a listing guide and more of an authoritative voice to help befuddled viewers navigate the increasing number of channels available. "It has to be more the arbiter of what's good and not so good on TV," Mr. Loughlin said. He said there will likely be changes "here and there" to the editorial team, but said it's too early to talk in detail about what he might do.
