 Lever Brothers Regroups in Wake Of Market-Share Losses in 1993   By By Kathleen Deveny and Gabriella Stern, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1994  Faced with flagging sales in most product categories, the U.S. household-products unit of Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group is in the midst of a sweeping restructuring program, designed to reduce overhead costs by more than 20%, improve marketing and speed up product innovation. Under the plan, Lever will cut its work force by 25% to 2,800, restructure its entire sales organization and shutter a detergent factory. The company will also group its many laundry and household products into two business units.  Critics say Lever's efforts are overdue. After making steady gains in 1992 against archrival Procter & Gamble Co., Lever last year lost market share in brand after brand. Sales of its liquid laundry detergents in supermarkets, drugstores and mass-merchandise outlets fell 15% in 1993, according to Information Resources Inc.'s InfoScan service. Sales of powder detergents, meanwhile, fell 11%. Even sales of Lever's bar soaps, a bright spot for the company, fell slightly.  Lever's restructuring won't be a panacea. Many of Lever's current problems are more related to marketing miscues than high costs. Lever Brothers lagged behind P&G by several months in rolling out a highly concentrated version of its liquid laundry detergent brands -- Wisk, All and Surf -- in the U.S. What's more, Lever confused consumers by making its detergents more concentrated than those already on the market. At the same time, P&G gained share by cutting the price of its concentrated liquid Tide.
