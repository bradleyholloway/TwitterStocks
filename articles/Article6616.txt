 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: Giving Thanks, With Cheesecake   By McMullen, Troy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2006  Eli's cake cost $28 and came presliced and frozen. (Thawing was simple: three hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.) Mr. [David Lugo] liked the rich, firm consistency and the moist texture. He thought the lemony taste could be too tangy, and some of our colleagues agreed. "Too tart," said one after a bite. The chef also wasn't crazy about the idea of a frozen cheesecake -- he worried that some hosts may serve the cake before it properly thawed -- but didn't think freezing affected the taste of Eli's cake, with a shortbread-cookie crust.  Everyone was happiest with the fresh cheesecake from Junior's. Tall and slightly bronzed, it was creamier and less crumbly than the others we tried. Junior's uses a thin, sponge-cake bottom that was a nice departure from the drier graham-cracker crusts. Mr. Lugo especially liked the dense, rich consistency. It's Best Overall, and at $27.95, Best Value as well. Sorry, calorie counters: The box didn't include any nutritional information -- but some things may be better left unknown.  STORE/PRICE/PHONE: Eileen's Special Cheesecake, Plain cheesecake, $60, 800-521-2253, eileenscheesecake.com QUALITY: Purists didn't like the lighter consistency of this 10-inch cake; Mr. Lugo gave its graham-cracker crust high marks. SHIPPING COST/TIME: Shipping is included in the price. Cake arrived on the appointed day, with a plastic server. RETURN POLICY: For replacement or refund if unhappy. But owner Eileen Avezzano says, "We've had very few unhappy customers." PHONE/WEB EXPERIENCE: No-frills Web site doesn't offer much product info, but it's easy to navigate. COMMENT: Ms. Avezzano says the fluffiness partly comes from separating the egg whites from the yolks. (It doesn't have any fewer calories than a denser cake, though.)
