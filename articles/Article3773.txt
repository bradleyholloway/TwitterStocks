 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: Different, Banned   By Khan, Amjad M, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2004  Several radical Muslim groups in Bangladesh have created an alliance to terrorize the Ahmadis and to prevent them from practicing their faith. Most recently, members of the alliance have attacked three Ahmadiyya mosques, murdering a prominent Ahmadi leader and injuring 50 others. "If they call themselves Muslims anymore," said Mahmudul Hasan Mamtazi, the head of a prominent anti-Ahmadiyya group, "we will eliminate them from the land."  Given this history in Pakistan, it is not surprising that the Bangladeshi ban has emboldened rather than appeased anti-Ahmadiyya groups. At a convention held on Jan. 16, eight days after the ban was issued, the anti-Ahmadiyya alliance delivered an ultimatum to the home ministry, demanding that it, too, officially declare the Ahmadis as non-Muslims. The alliance publicly vowed to demolish all Ahmadiyya mosques and to continue to terrorize Ahmadis if their demands are not met by March 17. One of the alliance's leaders has already called for an extension of the ban to Hindu and Christian publications.
