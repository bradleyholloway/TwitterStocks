 India Benefits From Focus on Tourism   By Neelakantan, Shailaja, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2004  The fact that the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, bypassed India also helps explain why that nation is doing better than other Asian destinations. Another factor is India's Ministry of Tourism, with its "Incredible India" campaign. "Before India was being promoted differently in different countries, if at all. There weren't two or three distinct images. This campaign changed that," says Lavanya Anirudh, an account director at Ogilvy & Mather (India), the advertising agency that created the campaign for the Department of Tourism. The "Incredible India" campaign started in December 2002 and focused on yoga, Ayurveda and other spirituality- related concepts.  "Yoga, we own it but have never flaunted it," Ms. Anirudh says. "Bali, etc., are flaunting yoga and meditation with their spas. But we have had it for centuries and centuries. And the real Ayurveda is in India. We decided to showcase all of that and we layered the entire campaign with spirituality." When she asks people what they think of the campaign, she says, "I just keep hearing that 'incredible' is absolutely the apt word to describe India. The country isn't perfect; everything isn't laid out for you on a platter. Yes, we have cows on the narrow streets, but this is mixed with some amazing stuff."  Almost everyone in the industry lauds the move. "Increased capacity will reduce costs, we hope," Mr. [Arjun Sharma] of the Heritage Village Club says. "Typically, a flight to India from Britain or the U.S. is 40% more expensive than a flight to Thailand, Indonesia and even Australia," he says, adding that carriers like Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines already have started operating additional flights. "It seems as though finally there is a political will backing tourism."
