 Politics & Economics: Russian Regulator Under Fire; Virgin Islands Says Evidence Points To Telecom Holdings   By Simpson, Glenn R, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  "It is believed that the movement of money among IPOC and its group of companies and the consultancy agreements," as well as the "overwhelming" indications that Mr. [Leonid Reiman] is the true owner of IPOC "are evidence that IPOC and its group of companies are corporate shams or facades designed to conceal the true facts about the source of the revenues in IPOC's groups and its true beneficial owner," he concluded.  The letter, part of a formal request for U.S. assistance filed Oct. 31 in U.S. District Court in Delaware, claimed there is "overwhelming evidence" Mr. Reiman secretly owns a large chunk of Russia's telecom industry through IPOC. Mr. [Terrence F. Williams] said the government in the British Virgin Islands plans to charge the minister's business partner, Danish lawyer Jeffrey Galmond, with perjury and perverting the course of justice for allegedly covering up Mr. Reiman's role.
