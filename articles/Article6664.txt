 Trump to Sell $485 Million in Notes --- Deal, Shelved in 2002 Due to High Interest Rates, Could Cost More Now   By By Tom Barkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2003  Proceeds will be used to redeem about $242 million of Trump Castle 11.75% mortgage notes due 2003, as well as 13 7/8% Castle pay-in-kind notes, 15 1/2% notes of the parent company maturing in 2005, and bank debt at Trump Marina casino and Trump's Indiana riverboat casino.  Some said the Trump deal probably wouldn't have been brought back if there weren't a high degree of confidence it could be completed this time. The offering had been rumored for months, and Mr. [Donald Trump] has likely already lined buyers up for most of the transaction, they said.  In addition, Mr. Trump has agreed to tougher call protection. The notes can't be called, or bought back, for four years. And the price that Mr. Trump has to pay for any called notes is higher than in most deals, investors said.
