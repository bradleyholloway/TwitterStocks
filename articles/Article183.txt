To the Editor:  In your June 13 editorial ''The Right to Ban Guns'' you state: ''The Supreme Court ruled long ago that the Second Amendment merely gives states the right to maintain a militia.''  I wonder which Supreme Court you're referring to. Surely it can't be the Supreme Court of the United States; that Court has never ruled that the Second Amendment guarantee is limited to state militias.  The only 20th-century case which addressed the issue directly was United States v. Miller (307 U.S. 174, 1939). It involved the right to possess and carry a sawed-off shotgun, prohibited by the National Firearms Act of 1936.  The Court held that, absent evidence supporting the contention, it could not take judicial notice that a sawed-off shotgun ''has today any reasonable relation to the preservation of a well-regulated militia; and therefore (we) cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees to the citizen the right to keep and bear such a weapon.''  The Court did not rule that the term ''militia'' in the Second Amendment is the equivalent of state reserves. It seemed to say, by implication, that citizens are members of the unorganized militia - a position gun owners have long maintained.  This is certainly the definition of militia the Founding Fathers had in mind when the Bill of Rights was adopted. In the Virginia debates on ratification of the Constitution, Patrick Henry used these words: ''Who are the militia? They consist of the whole people.'' The Militia Act of 1792 defined militia as ''every free, white, ablebodied male.'' A variant of that definition has been included in each version of the U.S. code to the present day.  I hope the Supreme Court will one day issue a definitive ruling on the meaning of the Second Amendment. In the meantime, please don't mislead your readers on the Court's past position. DONALD A.
