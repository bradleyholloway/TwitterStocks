 What Do You Risk Using a Credit Card To Shop on the Net?   By By Thomas E. Weber, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  It's an innovative system that allows consumers to sign up for a password, similar to the PIN codes used with ATM cards. When shoppers buy at a participating site, they will be prompted for the password. But the site won't ever see the secret code. Instead, it will be beamed to the credit-card bank, which will then give the retailer an all-clear on the transaction.  If it catches on, the approach could cut down on online fraud. But that mainly helps out online merchants. A typical online sale is considered a "card-not-present" transaction in the industry (as opposed to "card-present" sales at brick-and-mortar stores, where shoppers sign receipts). When a consumer challenges a card-not-present charge, the merchant is liable for the loss. The password is intended to stand in for a paper-receipt signature, and cut down merchants' liability.  Meanwhile, here are a few strategies you can follow to minimize credit-card problems online: Be sure you trust the merchant. That doesn't mean patronizing only well-known stores, but it does suggest checking out a store before you buy from it. Also, make sure that Web pages where you're asked to enter personal information use encryption (signified by a gold padlock icon in the lower right corner of an Internet Explorer window). Avoid using debit cards instead of credit cards. And most of all, challenge any irregularities.
