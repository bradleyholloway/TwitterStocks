 Letters to the Editor: IDA's Record   The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1987  The International Development Association (IDA) is at the forefront of efforts to alleviate poverty in the world's poorest nations, and to support projects that bring basic education, health care, shelter and economic opportunity to hundreds of millions of the needy and malnourished. In many of the poorest nations, notably in Africa, IDA is playing a key role in advising on and supporting policy reforms that stimulate trade, provide incentives to production, increase the efficiency of the public sector (often with privatization approaches) and boost competition.
