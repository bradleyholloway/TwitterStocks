 Sharp May Turn To Taiwan Makers For LCD Panels   By Ishibashi, Kanji, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2006  Sharp makes TV-use LCD panels and is the world's largest LCD-TV maker with its Aquos brand models. But it is running short of TV-use panels because of strong global sales of LCD TVs. In November, Sharp President Katsuhiko Machida said his company was in talks with several Taiwan LCD makers to obtain supplies of TV-use LCD panels.  "It is likely that we will get supplies from firms to which we provided [related] licenses," said Mr. [Toshishige Hamano], head of Sharp's overseas business. He didn't specify when Sharp is expected to start receiving LCD panels from Taiwan.
