 Barclays' French Unit Irks Competitors with High-Interest Checking Account   By Bray, Nicholas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1992  Britain's Barclays Bank PLC's decision to launch a high-interest checking account has caused an uproar from France's main commercial banks, whose earnings are already under pressure from shrinking margins and rising problems with bad debt.
