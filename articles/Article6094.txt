 Builders Unload Stock at High Rates   By By Tony Cooke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  Insiders at D.R. Horton Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc. sold two of the biggest chunks of stock in May, but Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Joseph Sroka said he isn't troubled by the sales.  D.R. Horton director James K. Schuler sold 1.5 million company shares from May 22 to May 30, getting $24.40 to $25.65 a share. Mr. Schuler wasn't available to discuss the sales. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, D.R. Horton shares were at $25.04, down 34 cents.  Mr. Sroka said Mr. Schuler acquired his shares when his business, Schuler Homes, was bought in February by D.R. Horton. "That's him taking some liquidity from the acquisition," Mr. Sroka said. Mr. Schuler reported indirectly holding 5.1 million shares after the sales.
