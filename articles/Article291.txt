 Pfizer Hosts Posh Seminar For Advocates   By By Carol Gentry, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1999  One of the nation's largest drug companies invited patient advocates from East Coast states to a conference at a four-star Vermont resort beginning today to discuss legislative issues and lobbying strategies.  Several people planning to attend say Pfizer is picking up their tabs for room and board. But participants will have to pay for other amenities at the Equinox, which include an 18-hole championship golf course, a full-service spa, falconry lessons and a Land Rover Driving School with its own 80-acre course.  But he says Pfizer sponsors three or four such meetings a year around the country, at which legislative issues and lobbying strategies are discussed. "We want to have good relationships with these groups," he says, "because over the years, it's become clear to us that their goals of access to medical reimbursement parallel ours."
