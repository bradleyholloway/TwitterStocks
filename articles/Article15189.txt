 `The Scream' Case Is the Very Picture Of Police Frustration --- Oslo Thieves Left Many Clues, But Detectives Draw Blank In Search for Stolen Art   By By Judith Valente, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1994  "This might be something," Detective Superintendent Gunnar Halset says, racing down a hallway to an interrogation room. The man convicted of stealing an Edvard Munch painting in 1988 has come to the station wanting to talk.  It has been more than a month since thieves stole Munch's "The Scream" -- Norway's most famous painting -- from the National Gallery in a 52-second caper, embarrassing Norwegian officials on the eve of the Winter Olympics. Unfortunately the earful Pal Enger has for Mr. Halset turns out to be a complaint, not a confession. He declares the 200,000 kroner ($27,160) reward being offered for the painting's return inadequate. "It should be a million," Mr. Enger says.  The search for "The Scream" has taken more twists and turns than a Van Gogh brush stroke. And this dead-end -- the latest in a string of false leads and humiliations -- is emblematic of the problems that Norway and other countries encounter in trying to recover famous works of art. So far, police have crisscrossed Oslo, scoured dozens of stolen-car records, interviewed 50 current and former museum employees, placed more than 100 phone calls around the world, and even contemplated employing a psychic. Though four detectives are investigating the theft, police aren't much closer to solving it than they were when they began.
