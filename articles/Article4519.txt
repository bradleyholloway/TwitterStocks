 Asian Report: Wage Boost of 5% Likely in Japan; Taiwan Is Promoting Its China Beer   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1985  In the country's annual "spring labor offensive," or "shunto," major railway workers' unions accepted a 5.7% pay raise, or an average of about $50 a month. This accord follows similar ones reached in such influential sectors as automobiles and electrical machinery.  Analysts say the increase won't boost domestic demand much, and thus isn't likely to ease Japan's trade frictions with the U.S. and other countries. The analysts say a considerable part of the pay raise will be eaten up by higher taxes and anticipated increases in transportation fares.  "Our goal is to beat Tsingtao," says J. Hunter Todd, chairman of Casablanca Co. of Houston, the sole importer of Taiwan's beer, which is called China Beer. The company already has begun an aggressive marketing campaign. "We want people to know (China Beer) isn't a commie beer," Mr. Todd says. Understandably enough, he also believes that Taiwan's beer is better than China's.
