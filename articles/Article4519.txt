 Two Scholars Blast KKR Buy-Out Study That Reached Pro-Takeover Conclusions   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1989  A study by a visiting Brookings Institution economist and another academic blasts a ballyhooed study of leveraged buy-outs by LBO giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., criticizing its methodology and challenging its pro-takeover conclusions.  The new study, by William Long, a former Federal Trade Commission economist who is now a guest scholar at Brookings, a Washington think tank, and by David Ravenscraft, an economist at the University of North Carolina's business school, says that Kohlberg Kravis's positive conclusions about LBOs are at best "premature," and perhaps the result of faulty research.  The Long-Ravenscraft study observes that other studies of LBOs reached very different conclusions, finding that LBOs reduce employment and decrease R&D and capital spending. Had Kohlberg Kravis used better methodology, the two scholars say, its findings might have been reversed.
