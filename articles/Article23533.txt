 At Discovery Holding, One >Five; A Cable Mogul Buys And That Outshines A Flurry of Sales   By Brulliard, Nicolas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2007  "Here, obviously, [John C. Malone] is in control, and he is a good guy to have in control given his track record," Mr. [Jonathan Moreland] said. "If anything, I would latch on to the continued high ownership of the B shares by John Malone as a positive that offsets the negative of the insiders' selling of the A shares."  Mr. Moreland said the insiders can't be blamed for selling shares as the stock is reaching new heights. "Insider selling after a stock has performed well is one of the most common activities I see on a daily basis," Mr. Moreland said. "In the vast majority of cases, it is not a sign that investors themselves should sell."  Based on Mr. Malone's experience, past transactions and greater voting power, Mr. Moreland said he is the one investors should focus on. "The fact that he is willing to hold these B shares even though he himself sold some A shares tells me he is certainly not running for the exits himself and he has some plans for this stock," Mr. Moreland said.
