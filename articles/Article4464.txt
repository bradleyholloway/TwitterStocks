 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): RICO's Nuclear Meltdown   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 9, 1988  The anti-nuke crowd has discovered a new trick to stop the Shoreham nuclear-power plant from opening. Governor Mario Cuomo failed last week in his scheme to buy out and close down the plant, but the state quickly found another bludgeon: RICO, now unquestionably the most abused statute on the books.  A federal jury on Wednesday decided that the Long Island Lighting Co. and a former president had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Their "fraud" was giving false testimony in 1978 and 1984 that Shoreham would probably open soon, which meant the utility could get a rate increase. In other words, Lilco's offense was underestimating the power of the anti-nuke lobby. Shoreham didn't open in 1978 or 1984, and now probably can't make 1988.  If Lilco was wrong about how soon Shoreham could open, Governor Cuomo was equally wrong about how soon he could close down the plant. We don't know whether his pledge to kill Shoreham by now also amounts to a RICO violation, but there is evidence that Long Islanders don't want to pay higher rates to close Shoreham.
