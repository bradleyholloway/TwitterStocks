 Politics & Economics: Mukasey Reopens Internal Probe   By Perez, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  The stalled inquiry fueled charges of White House political interference during Mr. [Alberto Gonzales]'s tenure. When lawmakers pressed Mr. Gonzales to explain why the security clearances were denied, Richard Hertling, the department's legislative affairs director, said in a letter that Mr. Gonzales had favored granting them but that President [Bush] "made the decision not to grant the requested security clearances."  Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D., N.Y.), who pushed for the internal Justice inquiry, hailed the reopening of the investigation as a sign that Mr. [Michael Mukasey]'s tenure will be a departure from Mr. Gonzales's. "It seems like an extraordinary beginning," he said. "We may have an attorney general who understands his obligations and responsibilities are to the people of the United States and not the president."
