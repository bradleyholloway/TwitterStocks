 Personal Business: Franchising Can't Guarantee Success   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  Franchise fans often boast that buying a franchise increases the odds that you'll be a successful entrepreneur. But Timothy Bates, an economics professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, found that's not necessarily the case. He found that 38% of young firms that open a franchise fail within five years, compared with 32% of young firms that go it alone.  "The franchiser makes money whether you do or not," Mr. [Mario Herman] says. Make sure you know what you'll pay for royalties, advertising and other fees. If you're realistic about likely costs from the start, you may avoid a cash-flow crisis later.  To learn more, start with the Federal Trade Commission's "A Consumer Guide to Buying a Franchise," available at ftc.gov, as well as at the Small Business Administration's Web site, sba.gov. AllBusiness.com and The Wall Street Journal's free StartupJournal.com also have how-to sections devoted to franchising.
