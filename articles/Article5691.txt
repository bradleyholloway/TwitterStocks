 Lycos Insiders Sold Off Shares Back in January   By By Susan Pulliam, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  Ready for some salt in the wound? Lycos executives were piling out of the stock in mid-January, just as the company's shares were soaring on hopes of a takeover at a big premium to its share price. Between Jan. 8 and Jan. 19, Lycos's two top executives, President and Chief Executive Robert Davis and Chief Financial Officer Edward Philip, filed with securities regulators their intention to sell a total of nearly $12 million of Lycos stock.  Lycos executives didn't return several requests for comment on the executives' sales. Mr. Davis, in an interview late yesterday, said "the initial discussions with USA would have been at least one week subsequent to" his filing to sell shares. He said the sales were consistent with his pattern of sales at Lycos, adding his holdings are still "quite substantial."  On Jan. 11, shares of Lycos peaked at 145 3/8, boosted partly by comments from Mr. Davis to investors about its market share, which he said was closing in on that of Yahoo!, the dominant player in the Internet-portal segment. In fact, in the days that followed, big institutions were loading up on Lycos, convinced that it represented a better value, especially if it was a takeover candidate.
