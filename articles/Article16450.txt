 Visa Campaigns to Replace Cash In Daily Life of Farflung Regions   By Robert Guy Matthews, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2004  The $25 million outlay is about average for a new campaign in the region but is a big deal for Visa, which intends to expand the campaign after its initial push. "The vast majority of people don't have a relationship with banks or the banking system," says Keith Lams, head of external communications for this region of Visa International. "We want to evolve our message." Visa spent $133.5 million on U.S. advertising in the first six months of this year and $359.2 million throughout 2003, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR.  After a decade without a car account, Omnicom Group's DDB New York has landed Subaru of America's ad account. The agency, once synonymous with car advertising because of its well-known Volkswagen work such as "Think Small," was fired from Volkswagen's domestic business in 1994. DDB has sought an automobile account, and the prestige that comes with that category, ever since. While other DDB offices have continued to handle Volkswagen chores in other parts of the world since 1959, the New York outpost has long hoped landing another car account could help restore the shop's once-stellar reputation, which has diminished over the past decade.
