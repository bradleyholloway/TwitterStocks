 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2004  Tax geeks call this a "step-up in basis" system, because the general rule is that your tax basis gets "stepped up" to the date-of-death value. That's very important because it means you don't have to dig through cluttered attics to figure out what your benefactor paid.  Here's some fine print: Your tax basis is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of death, computed by taking the average of the highest and lowest quoted selling prices on that date, says Beth Shapiro Kaufman, a Washington lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale. "Your basis may also have to be adjusted if any significant events, such as stock splits or dividend reinvestments, have occurred since then," Ms. Kaufman adds. As with so many other tax-law provisions, there can be important exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the executor of an estate can choose an alternate valuation date six months after the date of death. For details, see IRS publications 550 and 551. Warning: Based on current law, the step- up- in-basis regime is scheduled to undergo major changes in 2010.
