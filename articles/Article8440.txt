 Medical Odyssey: Testing a New Drug Entails Daunting Costs And Clashing Interests --- Upjohn Labors to Recruit Suitable Stroke Patients, Dickers With Doctors --- Turf Wars and Price Pressure   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1994  Like the Dellingers, hundreds of patients and their doctors at various medical centers are waiting anxiously to see whether the drug, tirilazad mesylate, works. They are testing it as part of a large-scale clinical trial, a costly, stressful process in which drug companies gather data that the Food and Drug Administration uses to decide which proposed prescription drugs are safe and effective enough for sale and which aren't.  Human drug trials are crucial to pharmaceutical companies such as Upjohn Co., which makes tirilazad. Last year, about 2,000 compounds were tested on at least 650,000 patients in the U.S. alone, the National Institutes of Health estimates. Drug companies spent nearly $3 billion on human trials, the biggest chunk of their research and development budgets.  By the mid-1980s, Upjohn had some promising candidates. When a mouse that had received a test compound began wiggling after researchers had given it up for dead, Upjohn decided to call its potential new drugs lazaroids, after the biblical Lazarus. But before Upjohn could test them on people, it needed help from leading research doctors around the U.S.
