[...] look for him to emphasize that he wants to change government while spending more -- coupling, for instance, the renewal of the program that offers unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks with a plan, modeled on one in Georgia, to let employers try out workers for free while they continue to draw unemployment compensation. [...] widen the deficit now and shrink it more later.
