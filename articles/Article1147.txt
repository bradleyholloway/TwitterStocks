 OSHA Sets or Toughens Exposure Limits On 376 Toxic Chemicals in Workplace   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1989  The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration essentially adopted a proposal that the agency made last June, as part of an effort to establish broad workplace standards instead of its usual substance-by-substance regulatory tack. OSHA has issued individual standards for only 24 specific substances in its 17 years.  OSHA said the tighter exposure ceilings for 212 chemicals and the first limits for another 164 will "significantly reduce the risk" or potential risk of illness caused by on-the-job chemical exposure for more than 21 million workers. About 4.5 million workers currently work at exposures above the new ceilings, the agency said.  Industry groups generally backed the new OSHA plan, but sought, and often gained, increases in exposure levels for specific chemicals from last June's proposal. OSHA lowered the limit for only three chemicals from the June proposal, including perchloroethylene, a chemical used in dry cleaning. It raised limits for 13 substances from the proposed levels, although they are still lower than current limits, and scrapped plans to lower limits for 24 others.
