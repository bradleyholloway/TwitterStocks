 Leadership (A Special Report); So Many People, So Hard to Reach: Companies feel they have no choice: They have to be in China; But it isn't easy   By Fong, Mei, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2006  Ian Thomson-Banks, Motorola's marketing chief, says Motomusic is similar to Apple Inc.'s iTunes online music service -- but without the iPod -- and will hopefully help reposition the Motorola brand as "desirable and attractive" in terms of style in the world's largest mobile-handset market. Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola says its market share in China has dwindled to 21% from 50% in the past five years.  Cincinnati-based P&G, for example, is sponsoring reality TV shows following the huge success of last year's "Super Girl," a contest similar to the popular U.S. talent show "American Idol." P&G has invested close to $1 million to make the Gillette Vector razor brand the sponsor of a singing contest. The company also is co-sponsoring a dance competition to promote the Whisper brand of sanitary pads and a talent show to promote its Olay skin-care line.  Instead, the site posts warnings telling visitors that authentic merchandise can only be purchased in China at Tiffany stores. Rong Wei, store manager in Tiffany's only outlet in Shanghai, says the Web site is "to remind people only products from Tiffany's stores are authentic. We hope to expand the market in China."
