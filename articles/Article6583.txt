 Leading the News: Sullivan Says Ebbers Knew of WorldCom Methods   By By Yochi J. Dreazen in Washington, Shawn Young in New York and Carrick Mollenkamp in Atlanta, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2002  Mr. Ebbers's own future may also have become more difficult amid the latest allegation. WorldCom's internal investigators said that ex-chief financial officer Scott Sullivan told them that "Ebbers was aware that hundreds of millions of dollars had been moved" into capital expenditures accounts that wouldn't have an impact on the company's earnings, according to Ken Johnson, a spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R., La.). Mr. Tauzin and Rep. James Greenwood (R., Pa.) are leading the House investigation into WorldCom's troubles.  Mr. Ebbers's lawyer, Reid Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson, said, "[Bernie Ebbers] did not know anything about Scott Sullivan's decision to reallocate expenses on WorldCom's books. I have been led to believe that Scott Sullivan confirmed Mr. Ebbers's lack of knowledge when interviewed by the company. The chairman of the board and the present CEO of WorldCom reconfirmed Mr. Ebbers's lack of knowledge recently on the Hill when they testified that they had no reason to believe Mr. Ebbers had done anything wrong."  Besides the congressional investigation, WorldCom faces other storms in Washington. The Labor Department opened an investigation into whether plan administrators, trustees or other fiduciaries of WorldCom's 401(k) plan breached their responsibilities by failing to protect the interests of plan participants as the company stock prices plunged, said Labor Department spokeswoman Sue Hensley. Labor documents show that WorldCom stock made up one-third, or more than $640 million, of the company's main 401(k) plan in 2000. Today, those shares are nearly worthless.
