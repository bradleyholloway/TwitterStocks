 Pacific Sunwear CEO Resigns Amid A Decline in Sales   By Kang, Stephanie, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  Shares of Pacific Sunwear have dropped nearly 40% in the past five months, as it struggles to sell its collection of fleece sweatshirts, denim pants and T-shirts to teen consumers. In addition to its flagship chain, Pacific Sunwear operates d.e.m.o., a mall-based chain carrying urban brands like Ecko Red and Baby Phat, and a higher-end shoe-store chain called One Thousand Steps.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, Pacific Sunwear said it will continue to pay Mr. Johnson's salary and health insurance through October 2007 and will take a charge of about $1.1 million -- or one cent a share -- in the current fiscal quarter because of Mr. Johnson's employment agreement. Mr. [Seth R. Johnson] didn't return calls for comment.
