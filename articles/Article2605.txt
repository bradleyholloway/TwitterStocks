 Asides   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1999  A Review & Outlook yesterday, "(Bill) Bradley and Hillary Pander," said that New York's Senator Daniel P. Moynihan was opposed to a regional dairy compact that would set minimum prices for milk in his state, raising its cost by between 10 and 20 cents a gallon. In fact, Senator Moynihan was an original supporter of the compact and lobbied the state legislature for its passage. (WSJ July 15, 1999)
