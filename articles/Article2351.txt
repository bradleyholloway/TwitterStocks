 Walking Wounded: Behind Calm Exterior, Japanese Feel the Pain Of the Nikkei's Plunge --- Companies, Individuals Are Loath to Acknowledge Vast Size of Stock Losses --- Tomio Bando Rolls the Dice   By By Yumiko Ono, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1992  On Monday, the price for shares of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., his main investment, dropped to 620,000 yen (about $4,660) a share -- roughly a third of what he paid for the stock four years ago. The 50-year-old accountant, who had bought about 80 NTT shares, has lost "several hundred million" yen in stocks all together.  Nor do a lot of other investors in Japan. As the Japanese stock market has plunged to a 5 1/2-year low in recent weeks (it was down another 2.9% Monday), individual and institutional investors have gripped their seats, wondering when the downward spiral will end. The Nikkei index of stocks has lost more than half its value since its peak at the end of 1989. Mounting Losses But while that sort of relentless bear market would provoke cries of anguish on Wall Street, there is little public expression here about the financial damage the stock plunge has left in its wake. Part of that has to do with the traditional reserve of the Japanese people, and part with the acute embarrassment many feel for having been lured into the market's speculative frenzy in the first place.  Similarly, Sanrio Co., a stationery company in Tokyo, was so dependent on the stock market that at one point securities made up as much as 40% of the concern's assets, analysts estimate. During the boom years in the late 1980s, Sanrio posted about the same amount of profit from playing the market as from selling its products, analysts say. Shintaro Tsuji, Sanrio's president and an aggressive stock investor himself, even set up a special capital management division within the company to supervise its portfolio.
