 Irish Mushrooms Thrive by Feeding British Appetite --- Cottage Industry Is Competing With High-Tech Rivals Using Low-Tech Approach   By By Carole Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1993  This friendly 41-year-old in blue coveralls and rubber boots started farming part time 11 years ago with six acres near the border of Northern Ireland. The land is achingly beautiful, but hardly rich. Mr. Brennan remembers thinking how the plot "was so small we would be hard pressed to do anything with it."  Fungi have never been as strongly associated with the Emerald Isle as say, the leprechauns that sit atop them. Yet Ireland has quietly become the largest per-capita exporter of mushrooms in the world. It's a cottage industry that has, well, mushroomed, expanding five-fold in 10 years to annual production of 40,000 tons and an export market valued at 30 million Irish pounds, or punts ($44.8 million).  The little white caps present a rare bright spot in Ireland's heavily subsidized agricultural sector. Still, it hasn't been a bed of roses. Currency gyrations dizzying Europe since September have left a lot of people running for cover. But for Irish mushroom moguls, the darkest hours may now be over. A collective sigh of relief could be heard when Dublin gave up its defense of the punt Saturday, devaluing the currency 10%.
