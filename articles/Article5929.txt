 FTC Raises Scrutiny of Pepsi-Quaker Oats Deal   By By Betsy McKay and John Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  More significant, federal investigators are concerned that Pepsi products will dominate retail shelf space in the cold bottled-drink distribution channel in convenience stores and other outlets, people briefed on the FTC request said. In the Midwest, for example, investigators found that Pepsi brands, combined with Gatorade, would control more than half of this "cold-case" market. This market power is heightened in some cities by Pepsi's bottling contracts with a competitor, the U.S. unit of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, these people said.  While Pepsi and Quaker have few overlapping products, of greatest concern is Pepsi's potential ownership of Gatorade, one of the most powerful and fastest-growing beverage brands in the U.S. Having Gatorade in its stable would increase Pepsi's considerable clout with retailers, giving it more power to dictate pricing or other sales terms, opponents of the deal argue.
