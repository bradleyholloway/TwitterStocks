 Letters to the Editor: A Cry of the Heart From Dubrovnik   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1991  We are a group of citizens of Dubrovnik. None of us belongs to any political organization. We were born here, so were our ancestors. Our city is the most beautiful city in the world. It is also the most beautiful concentration camp in the world. Soon, it is going to be the most beautiful cemetery in the world. We are writing this while there are still some of us able to contact the rest of the world. The people of the city of Vukovar are now unable to call or write.
