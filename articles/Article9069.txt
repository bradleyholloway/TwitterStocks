 Resilient State Economies Defy Gloomy Forecasts   By By Ken Gepfert and John McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  And now Mr. [Matthew] Murray and seven other economists recruited by The Wall Street Journal to look ahead for the second quarter say the six-state region, while slowing in some areas, is still remarkably healthy. Indeed, on average the economists expect the region's gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services -- to expand 3.9% from a year ago. That's a notch ahead of the 3.8% that was forecast for last year's second quarter -- and still comfortably in front of the 3.3% pace predicted for the nation for the next three months.  That's not to say the region is guaranteed to glide into the next century without a few rough spots, the economists say. Despite improved overseas economies, Asian countries still are flooding the Southeast with cheap imports, causing cutbacks at apparel and electronics plants. Florida's tourist industry could be hurt by higher gas prices. Already, unstable Latin American countries are causing some foreign visitors to stay home; Varig, the Brazilian airline, has announced plans to stop flying to Orlando and Atlanta.  In Alabama, new homes and retail malls in fast-growing suburban counties such as Shelby near Birmingham helped create 9,600 construction jobs statewide last year, says Ahmad Ijaz, an economist at the University of Alabama. In North Carolina, Charlotte and the Raleigh-Durham area each have more than two million square feet of office space under construction, fueled by vacancy rates in the 7% range.
