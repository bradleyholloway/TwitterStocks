 Perot Says It Tried to Sell Advice   By By Elliot Spagat, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2002  Perot released a letter dated Oct. 22, 1997, from Jeffrey D. Tranen, head of the California ISO, that admonished the company for trying to instruct companies to exploit "potential weaknesses and shortcomings" in the system. Mr. Tranen said in the letter that he had learned Perot approached San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Using inside information would be "a flagrant violation of basic norms of business ethics and indicative of bad faith dealing," he wrote.  Officials of the ISO said the documents don't appear to contain proprietary information. Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO, said the letters released yesterday show the ISO asked Perot to institute safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and "Perot met those demands."  Perot said it billed $11,000 in July 1998 to Reliant Resources Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, but stopped selling the service because few companies were interested. A Reliant spokeswoman confirmed the company paid Perot about $11,000 for a "presentation" on the California market.
