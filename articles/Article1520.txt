 Stroh's Case Pits Feminists against ACLU   By Hayes, Arthur S, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1991  Women's rights lawyers filed a suit against Stroh Brewery Co on the behalf of five women employees who claim a Stroh's commercial featuring a fictitious Swedish bikini team arriving at an all-male campsite contributed to creating a hostile work environment at a brewery in St Paul MN. However, lawyers for the ACLU complain that the plaintiffs' attorneys are trying to censor a commercial, a violation of free speech.
