 Taste: Tony & Tacky   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  Cannabis Conundrum: There is no doubt that the police of San Luis Obispo, Calif., found marijuana on Donovan No Runner last August. They promptly arrested him and confiscated his stash. It turns out, though, that Mr. No Runner had a prescription that entitled him to smoke marijuana for medical reasons (for bipolar disorder). He was released. But now he wants his pot back. Alas, that is not so easily done.
