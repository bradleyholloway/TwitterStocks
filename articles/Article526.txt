EUGENE, Ore., June 6â€” Mary Decker Tabb's world-record performance in the women's 5,000-meter run highlighted the Prefontaine Classic track and field meet Saturday night.  Her time of 15 minutes 8.26 seconds was almost five seconds off the previous record set by Ann Audain of New Zealand last March.  Matt Centrowitz of the New York Athletic Club set an American record of 13:12.91 in the men's 5,000, defeating Alberto Salazar, who did 13:15.71.  Mrs. Tabb, who has had a cold for a week, said: ''I was surprised I felt as good as I did. My strategy was to stay with the leaders and see how I felt over the last mile.''  Carl Lewis ran 100 meters in 10.26 seconds, and Don Quarrie 200 in 20.61. Bob Roggy became the first to throw the javelin more than 300 feet at Oregon's Hayward Field. He did 302-5.
