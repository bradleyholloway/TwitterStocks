 Barron's Insight: AMR Likely to Move Upward With or Without a Spinoff   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  AMR bulls argue that the stock looks inexpensive, trading for about 11 times estimated 2007 profits of $2.36 a share and seven times projected 2008 earnings of $3.65 a share. AMR shares could get a boost if the company heeds a call from an Icelandic investment firm to spin off AMR's large and valuable frequent-flier program, AAdvantage.  The Icelandic outfit, FL Group, which holds 9% of AMR's stock, recently stated that AMR could boost shareholder value by $4 billion through a spinoff of AAdvantage, the largest frequent-flier program, with 57 million members.
