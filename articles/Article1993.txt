 Coca-Cola's Ivester Is Named to Head European Lines   By By Michael J. McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  A hard-core financial executive, Mr. Ivester seems a strange fit for the pivotal European job, a new post that will become more important after Europe establishes a unified market in 1992. Brought up strictly on the financial side, Mr. Ivester, Coca-Cola's soft-spoken chief financial officer, hasn't had any operational experience. "He's a person that you don't hear a lot about," said George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Research.  Coke has been pursuing an aggressive plan of acquisitions and joint ventures overseas to restructure and consolidate its bottling and distribution operations, similar to what it did in the U.S. with the establishment of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., its 49%-owned domestic bottling unit. Mr. Ivester was instrumental in the creation of Coca-Cola Enterprises and in the transaction that resulted in Coca-Cola's owning 49% of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
