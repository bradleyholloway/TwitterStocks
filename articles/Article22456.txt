 Election '98: Pols Try to Spur Key Supporters To Go to Polls   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1998  The Christian Coalition, which generally backs Republicans, augmented its traditional election-Sunday voter guides with millions of prerecorded telephone messages from Executive Director Randy Tate. He urged supporters to make today "a referendum on family values" at a rate of 50,000 messages an hour. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee faxed thousands of conservative talk-show hosts scripts detailing the horrors of a switch to a Democratic Speaker of the House.  Yesterday, Mr. Clinton was interviewed live by a variety of African-American and Hispanic radio stations; last night he was scheduled to be interviewed on Black Entertainment Television. Vice President Al Gore taped more than two dozen radio commercials in Spanish for airing in Hispanic communities. And a radio commercial played mainly in the South featured First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton saying Republicans are "counting on the fact that solid Democratic voters, like African-Americans, will stay home on election day."
