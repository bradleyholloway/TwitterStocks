 Barron's Insight: Sharing Microsoft's Wealth   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2004  Microsoft probably has the best balance sheet among the country's largest companies, but it doesn't get much credit for this on Wall Street. One reason is that the software giant has been stingy with shareholders. Some investors hope that Microsoft (MSFT) gets more generous later this year. If it does, Microsoft shares, now stuck around $26.50, could move into the low $30s. At the end of 2003, Microsoft had nearly $53 billion in cash and short-term investments, plus $15 billion in other holdings. That totals more than $6 a share, or nearly 25% of the current share price.
