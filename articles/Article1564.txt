 Stocks Hit New Highs; Bonds Fall --- Industrials Rise 12.30 As Investors Focus On Cyclical Issues   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1992  Stock prices had another record-busting day as investors began switching their focus from growth stocks to cyclical issues. But bond prices slumped for the fifth consecutive session.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 12.30 to a record 3258.50 in the heaviest trading since the current rally began Dec. 20. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose a more modest 0.33 to a record. But the Nasdaq Composite Index roared up another 5.07 to 630.82, also a record.  Health-care stocks, especially those related to biotechnology, took a beating yesterday after reigning as investor favorites all last year. Merck, for example, took a four-point header to 156 1/8. Bristol-Myers tumbled 1 1/4 to 84 1/2, and Johnson & Johnson slumped 5 1/4 to 108 3/8. Amgen, the leading light of the biotech stocks, fell 4 1/2 to 73. More speculative biotech issues fared even worse. Somatogen tumbled 4 3/4 to 43, and Immune Response was off 3 1/2 to 43 1/2.
