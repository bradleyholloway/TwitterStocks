 Tales From Inside the Inferno --- As Their World Was Collapsing, Ordinary People Responded With Disbelief, Bravery, Jokes   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  One woman working at the office of Drinker, Biddle & Wreath on the 89th floor of the trade center's north tower escaped to safety. Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, located 15 floors higher in the same building, couldn't account for 700 of its 1,000 employees. In the south tower, Oppenheimer Funds and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter say they believe everyone in their big trade-center work forces made it out alive. Sun Microsystems says all of its 346 trade center workers survived -- although another employee died in one of the hijacked airplanes.  Kemper Insurance executive Susan Doyle was in an colleague's 35th-floor office in the North Tower of the World Trade Center on Tuesday morning when the building began to shudder. The jolt was so strong that the tower "felt like it might fall over," she recalls. Her first instinct, in fact, was that it was an earthquake. But then, she and others peered out the windows and noticed that the rest of lower Manhattan looked normal. And that's when it dawned on them: "Whatever had happened had happened just to us. We all looked at one another and knew we needed to get out."  She was still trying to find him when the South Tower collapsed. She ran northward, a cloud of dust trailing her, and wound up at a hotel in midtown where the 44-year-old Ms. Doyle and some of her colleagues tried to contact their loved ones and check on the status of other Kemper employees. It took four hours for Ms. Doyle to reach her fiancee and children. She also eventually got word from Kemper's Long Grove, Ill., headquarters that the employee she had been trying to find was OK. Indeed, Kemper's entire World Trade Center staff had made it out alive.
