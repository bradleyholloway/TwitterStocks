 Plots & Ploys   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2004  Adapting is bittersweet for Mr. [Paul Hofer III], 56, who has lived all his life on the farm. "The day the vineyards are pulled out, that's going to sting," he says. "It's time, though. We're realistic. We realize there needs to be a change. Farming the land isn't economically viable anymore."  The national total rent index, which includes four rental-rate components -- net rent, operating expenses, real-estate taxes and electricity -- fell 1.9% in 2003 to $42.12 a square foot, from $42.96 a square foot. The tenant effective rent index fell 3.8% to $33.70 a square foot from $35.05 in 2002. Tenant effective rent is total rent minus lease concessions. The landlord effective rent index fell 11.3% to $15.44 a square foot, from $17.41 in 2002. Landlord effective rent is total rent less operating expenses, real-estate taxes, tenant electricity, concessions and commissions.  Joyce F. Geiger, senior vice president, national research services at Studley, said she found it interesting that when she did a 10-year analysis, "we still actually had total rent that kept pace with inflation over the 10 years. One would think rents had dropped [in 2001 and 2002] much further than they did." But Ms. Geiger says what happened was rents rose very sharply during the renting frenzy of the previous couple of years, "and when the bubble burst, they deflated almost as quickly and brought rents more in line with long-term growth expectations."
