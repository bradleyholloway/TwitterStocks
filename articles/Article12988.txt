 GE, Amid Slow Growth, Streamlines; Immelt's Reorganization Stresses Tech and Services Instead of Industrial Might [1]  By Kranhold, Kathryn, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2003  Last month, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said next year's earnings likely will increase 3% at most, if GE completes two multibillion-dollar acquisitions -- of medical company Amersham PLC and Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets -- and the public offering of part of its insurance business by midyear. This year's results are expected to grow at best 4% over last year's earnings, excluding an accounting charge during 2002.  Tony Boase, an analyst with A.G. Edwards of St. Louis, said he was concerned the consolidation could result in less transparency. "Over time, you're not going to get the same amount of detail," he said. Mr. Boase this week upgraded GE to a "buy," from hold, partly because he believes the portfolio changes will be mostly completed and the negative earnings surprises over by next year. Mr. [David Frail] said the company hasn't decided how it will report finances under the consolidation, but that "it makes no difference to our commitment to providing investors with the information they need to understand GE."
