 Green Groups Start Talking To Business   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1997  A funny thing happened when the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter decided to change tactics recently: The environmental group got a lot further than it expected.  Frustrated by attempts to win change through traditional appeals to government, the Sierra Club decided to take its campaign directly to big business. In this case, the business, DuPont Co., was planning to build a $150 million titanium mine near Georgia's beloved Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.  Sierra Club officials, bracing for a nasty fight, called upon their well-honed methods of protesting aggressively and rallying public support -- this time, against a corporate target rather than a government one. To their surprise, though, officials at the Wilmington, Del., chemical giant cut short the protest by suspending all work on the mine and agreeing to bring the environmentalists to the negotiating table.
