 Scanners Help Pinpoint Coronary Artery Disease   By Rosenberg, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2005  Angiograms, introduced in the 1950s, help determine whether a patient needs a balloon angioplasty, coronary stenting or bypass surgery to ease the passage of blood through the heart. The procedure takes about an hour and a half, and the patient remains in the hospital for about eight hours. Recovery can take as long as two days. "It's a substantial invasion of the patient's body," said David Marks, associate professor of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.  "The market for this type of procedure is very, very large," said Dr. Marks, who is involved in a study sponsored in part by GE to compare the accuracy of the new CT scanners and angiograms. "One reason we'd be reluctant to do a catheterization is because it's an invasive test. If we could replace it with an easier test, it could change the way we screen for coronary artery disease."  The technology initially thrills doctors with its vivid images. But, like any medical procedure, the scanning can be done well or badly. Some doctors say the images aren't as precise as those obtained through the more invasive procedure. "It's easy to be seduced by the beautiful pictures and not realize that sometimes diagnostic accuracy is being sacrificed," said David Pearle, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University in Washington. Still, he thinks it is an exciting technology and can replace some angiograms that are done now.
