 Allison Debt Draws Buyers, But It's 'Hardly an All-Clear'   By Ng, Serena, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2007  "A $1 billion sale is impressive and shows there's some life out there, but you can't push too hard," says Andrew Feltus, a high-yield portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments in Boston. "There's still a bit of a standoff in the market."  Analysts said the Allison debt sale indicates some buyers are returning to the market for especially risky corporate debt. The Allison deal was the largest sale of buyout loans to investors since a $6 billion sale by the finance arm of Chrysler LLC in late July, according to Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary & Data.  "It's the logical way forward given the backlog of long-term financing," says James Moss, a managing director at Fitch Ratings. "They are trying to figure out where the market appetite is and are putting some of their loans out."
