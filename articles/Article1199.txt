 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Scott R. Schmedel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1989  The 1987 tax act erased a key way to figure estimated tax that had let certain small concerns escape payments when they had had a loss in the prior year. Now estimated-tax payments must equal either 90% of tax eventually due for the current year or 100% of tax actually paid for the prior year. Thus, a small corporation expecting a big 1989 profit that paid only $1 of 1988 tax may choose option two and pay no estimated tax in 1989 (the amount is too small).  Yet one that paid no 1988 tax but now is profitable must use option one and make quarterly 1989 payments. This can pose cash problems for turnaround and start-up concerns in their first profitable year, forcing them to borrow or to find more investment, says Lawrence Bober of Silvertrust, Chulock & Stewart, CPAs in Skokie, Ill. The squeeze also hits larger concerns, which formerly could use the repealed break for the first quarterly installment only.  These closely held concerns are popular because they are taxed much like partnerships, but the IRS frowns on some moves to get that benefit as being too strongly tax-motivated. Recent rules deny tax-free-restructuring treatment to a spinoff by a regular corporation that is made just so the new company can elect S status; that isn't a qualifying business purpose. The rules say the tax savings from electing S status must be weighed in deciding whether a spinoff has a qualifying nontax purpose.
