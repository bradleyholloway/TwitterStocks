 The Trouble With Harry   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2002  We learned recently that Africare, an African-aid group based in Washington, D.C., disinvited Ms. [Condoleezza Rice] to its annual fund-raising dinner, which will pay tribute to Mr. [Harry Belafonte]'s humanitarian efforts. She had agreed to give the keynote address, but Mr. Belafonte, who has compared the National Security Adviser to a "Jew" who was "doing things that were anti-Semitic and against the best interests of her people," told Africare that he could not abide Ms. Rice's presence. So the organizers rescinded the invitation to Ms. Rice.  Our sources confirm Harry's account. It was C. Payne Lucas, the president emeritus of Africare, who first asked Ms. Rice to speak, before retracting the invite at the singer's insistence. Mr. Lucas isn't returning our phone calls. Ms. Rice, with customary class, simply expressed hope that this episode wouldn't taint the charity. A spokesman for her told us, "Africare is a wonderful organization. It does a lot of good work in the world, and in a part of the world that's very important to the President, to Secretary [Colin Powell] and to Dr. Rice."
