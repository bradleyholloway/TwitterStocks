 Pernod Considers Quaffing U.K. Drinks Rival   By Jason Singer and Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2005  Previously, there were big obstacles to a potential combination between Pernod and Allied. Allied's collection of fast-food chains, including Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice-cream shops, were struggling. Pernod, meanwhile, was laden with debt.  After deciding against participating in the Seagram auction in 2001, Allied Domecq built itself into one of the leading wine companies in the world, though it lacks a strong Australian brand. Pernod's Jacob's Creek brand, an Australian wine that is among the biggest-sellers in the U.K. and is growing fast in the U.S., could fill the gap in Allied's wine cellar.  The companies also are geographically complimentary. While Pernod has only 4% of the U.S. spirits market, it could help bolster Allied's No. 2 position there. Pernod is the largest spirits group in Europe, while Allied's continental European business has been struggling. Pernod is very strong in Asia, particularly China, while it has little presence in South Korea, which has been a problem for Allied.
