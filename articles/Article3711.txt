 Annan Vowed The U.N. Will Not Be Driven Out Of Iraq By Insurgents.   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2003  The pledge came even as some of the staff that survived the massive Baghdad bombing withdrew temporarily to Jordan, as did World Bank and IMF colleagues. The secretary-general cut a vacation short. He was surprised to learn U.N. officials in Iraq rejected a U.S. offer of a security detail, but added the U.S., as occupying power, is obliged to protect people nevertheless. Rumsfeld said generals see no need for more U.S. troops now. Powell and Annan meet today on expanding the U.N.'s Iraq role, but not control over peacekeeping forces.  The FBI said the huge bomb, delivered to the target by a Soviet-made military truck, was basically a pile of munitions salvaged from Saddam Hussein's old arsenal and didn't display "any degree of sophistication."  Israeli forces took up position outside Palestinian towns and were seen entering Jenin and Nablus as Sharon approved "targeted killings" of militants following Tuesday's bus bombing that left 20 dead. Abbas, at U.S. insistence, ordered arrests of people suspected of direct roles in the bombing, but said a sweeping crackdown needed Arafat's approval.
