 Refugee Scandal   By Husarska, Anna, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2007  In practice that door has been effectively closed. This became increasingly clear recently when the State Department revealed how many Iraqi refugees were allowed into the U.S. during the month of May. That count stands at precisely one. In April, the U.S. also admitted just a single Iraqi refugee.  In Istanbul, a father of two small boys showed me medals and diplomas from the U.S. military, for which he worked as an interpreter. In Damascus, a Mandaean Christian told me how close he was to dying when the U.N. headquarters was attacked while he was a security guard there. In Amman, a technician who used to install satellite dishes for GIs showed me a death threat and told me his brother had been killed. And in Beirut, a former soldier of the Free Iraqi Forces told me that he's terrified that local Islamic militias will learn that he served as an intelligence officer for the Americans and will capture and torture him. He asked me to help him hide his U.S.-issued ID, which authorized him to carry an AK-47, a pistol and a satellite phone.  In the first eight months after the end of the Vietnam War, at the direction of President Gerald Ford, the U.S. government and the U.S. armed forces facilitated the movement to the United States of over 131,000 South Vietnamese refugees. Some would say there are too many differences to compare Iraq to Vietnam, but similar exoduses have happened before. Hungarians fleeing Soviet tanks in 1956 and Cubans escaping from Fidel Castro in 1959 came in droves. More recently, Bosnians running from ethnic cleansing in the Balkans came in larger numbers than we are now allowing for Iraqis.
