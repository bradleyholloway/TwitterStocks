 NBC Talks May Revive Qintex Bid --- GE Unit Expressed Interest in Financing Offer for MGM/UA   By By Kathleen A. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1989  MGM/UA, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., abruptly announced Tuesday that it had terminated the $1.5 billion agreement with Qintex and filed suit in federal court against the Australian broadcaster and resort operator, charging that it had failed to deliver a $50 million letter of credit when it was due Sept. 22 and had misrepresented its ability to fund the acquisition. MGM/UA had given Qintex an absolute deadline of 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday to present its financing.  "We were never given the opportunity to make the NBC presentation, but we would still like to," said Kevin Wallace, an executive vice president at Qintex America, an affiliate of Qintex Australia. However, Mr. Wallace says an MGM/UA senior official called a Qintex official at 7 a.m. yesterday to say, "Gee, NBC sounded like a good idea." MGM/UA officials declined to comment on whether the company was willing to reopen the talks.  Although the Qintex-MGM/UA deal appeared on hold last evening, NBC is ready to step back in should talks resume. An NBC spokesman emphasized that Qintex approached NBC and that NBC's contacts have been only with Qintex, not with MGM/UA officials. A year ago NBC acquired an option to buy up to 15% of Qintex, but that option hasn't yet been exercised.
