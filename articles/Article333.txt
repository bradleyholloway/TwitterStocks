Two Long Island teen-agers were arrested yesterday and charged with having fired 12 shots Nov. 14 at the Glen Cove, L.I., residence used occasionally by the Soviet chief delegate to the United Nations.  The suspects - Robert Block, 19 years old, of Bayville and Evan Burke, 18, of Glen Cove - were charged with reckless endangerment and criminal mischief. Officials said the incident appeared to be a prank.  Kenneth Cynar, a spokesman for the Nassau County police, said that ''to the best of our knowledge, they are not members of the J.D.L. or any other militant group.''  The day after the shooting, a person claiming to represent the Jewish Defense League telephoned The Associated Press and United Press International to say that the league was responsible for the action. Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the J.D.L., said his group had not been involved in the incident, adding that he approved of it.  The arrests were made by two Nassau County detectives, James Moran and Thomas Palladino, who began investigating the incident shortly after it was reported by Soviet security officials. The detectives said they had obtained ''helpful information from members of the community.'' 12 Shots Fired Into Mansion  They said the two young men had driven to the Russian residence, a 36-acre wooded estate called Killenworth, on the night of Nov. 14, and fired 12 shots into a ground-floor room of the mansion, apparently with a .22-caliber rifle.  The rifle was not recovered. However, the detectives found bullet fragments in the mansion, and shell casings on a private road nearby. In addition, the police said, the suspects were accused of having fired a flare at the mansion on Sept. 18.  The flare caused no damage. The 12 shots shattered several windows. No one was injured in either incident. Oleg A. Troyanovsky, the 62-year-old chief Soviet delegate to the United Nations, uses the estate occassionally on weekends.
