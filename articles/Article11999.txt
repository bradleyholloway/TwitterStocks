 Montgomery Ward To Acquire 19.6% Of Levitz Furniture   By Miller, James P, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1995  For financially stretched Levitz, the cash infusion offers some badly needed capital. Closely held [Ward] said the buy-in, at a hefty premium over Levitz's current stock price, makes an "excellent fit" with its growth strategy.  Under the letter of understanding between the two companies, Montgomery Ward will pay $9 a share for 7.22 million newly issued Levitz shares, representing a 19.6% stake. Montgomery Ward is additionally to receive warrants to buy 3.4 million Levitz common shares at $10 apiece, and a further 10.2 million shares of Levitz at $14 apiece. The $14-a-share exercise price of the latter warrants can be lowered to $10 under certain circumstances. Exercise of all the warrants would give Ward a 42% Levitz stake.
