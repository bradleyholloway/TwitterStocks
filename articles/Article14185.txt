 White House Steps Up Pressure for Rise In Debt Limit, Won't Halt U.S. Payments   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1985  The decision means that unless Congress raises the debt limit, or unless the administration takes some other extraordinary action, the government will run out of cash on Nov. 15, when $17 billion in government interest payments come due.  Treasury officials say they know of no other method for circumventing the debt limit. Treasury Secretary James Baker "has worked through all the options," says acting Assistant Secretary John Niehenke. "We're now at the end of the line, and any other measures that would be undertaken would so evade the debt-limit process that we cannot go forward with them."  Treasury officials and credit-market analysts agree that failure by the Treasury to make interest payments on Nov. 15 would severely hamper the Treasury's ability to raise money in the future. "The government forever and ever will be paying higher rates if the interest payments aren't made," said Peter Davis, an analyst in the Washington office of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "Treasury would sell gold before they let that happen."
