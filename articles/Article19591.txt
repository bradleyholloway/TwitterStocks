 Bush Nominee for SEC Chief Is Expected Within Two Weeks   By By Michael Schroeder and Kate Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2002  Other candidates on the short list, whose names surfaced earlier, include Robert Glauber, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization funded by the securities industry, and Peter Fisher, a Treasury undersecretary. Mr. Glauber is a former Harvard University professor who was undersecretary of the Treasury during the first [Bush] administration. Mr. Fisher is a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Glauber declined to comment, and Mr. Fisher has said he isn't interested in the position.  Mr. [Stephen Hammerman], a former federal prosecutor and SEC official, was with Merrill for two decades and left in April. His affiliation with the investment-banking firm could become an issue because of Merrill's financial work for scandal-plagued Enron Corp., whose collapse helped spur the recent federal effort to better police the accounting profession. Merrill, along with other large Wall Street firms, has been embroiled with the SEC and state regulators over fraud allegations related to its stock-research operation. The firm settled with the states early this year for $100 million.
