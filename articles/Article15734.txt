 What if Linda Tripp Had Sent Her Tapes to China?   By By John H. Fund, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  From agreeing to talk with the insecure Monica Lewinsky on short notice to extensive job searches, President Clinton did a great deal to keep her quiet, even though he told the grand jury that he fully expected her to share secrets with others. She ended up discussing the matter with 11 people. One of those was Linda Tripp, who recorded their talks. But what if Ms. Tripp had taken those tapes to Chinese or Iranian diplomats instead of Kenneth Starr?  In fact, Mr. Clinton realized the security risk their relationship represented. The Starr report reveals that Mr. Clinton told Ms. Lewinsky that "he suspected that a foreign embassy was tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories" if they were ever questioned about their relationship. The president and Ms. Lewinsky had "phone sex" 10 to 15 times, so Mr. Clinton told Ms. Lewinsky that, if asked, she should say "they knew their calls were being monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on." This laughable "explanation" wouldn't have helped much if a hostile regime had intercepted the explicit calls.  President Clinton isn't likely to have used a secure phone on his calls to Ms. Lewinsky, because she didn't have one. While non-cellular White House calls go out over cable lines, they can still be monitored by sophisticated equipment. One former White House aide I spoke with was told to avoid talking near windows on an open phone.
