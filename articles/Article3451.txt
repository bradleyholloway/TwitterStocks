 Love & Money: How to Look a Gift Horse in the Mouth   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2005  His wife appreciated the gestures, "but there was a certain element of power in the money," my friend says in retrospect. Being young, he says, "neither of us recognized what was going on at the time. We didn't recognize that my parents were using it to control us, and we didn't recognize that my wife was upset about it."  In my friend's case, both he and his wife were happy to take the gifts, and never disagreed about whether to accept or not. But that isn't always the case. Sometimes, the most emotional response comes from the spouse whose parents doled out the money. The other spouse may not understand; to him or her, it seems silly to say no. Other times, the parents' child is the one who accepts the money as a generous gift, while the other spouse feels insulted by the implication that they can't provide for themselves, and worries that they will lose some of their independence.  When you're spending your own dollars, you can spend however you please and legitimately ignore concerns or criticism a parent expresses. Yet after parents or in-laws have given you money, my friend says, you suddenly feel guilty, "because now you know they're going to question it. It might be silent, they might not say anything to me, but I'll know they're wondering, 'Why did you spend the money we gave you on that? That's not how we wanted you to spend the money."'
