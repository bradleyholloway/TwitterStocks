 Eye On London: Despite the Pessimists, English Opera Flourishes   By By Paul Levy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  There will be a feast of directors: David McVicar makes his house debut with a new "Rigoletto"; there is a new "Il Trovatore" by Elijah Moshinsky; the "Macbeth" cancelled when the House closed for reconstruction will now happen, directed by Phyllida Lloyd; Haydn's "Orfeo," Cecilia Bartoli's own choice for her Covent Garden debut, will also mark the first time Jurgen Flimm has directed there; Klaus Michael Gruber stages a new "Parsifal," conducted by Sir Simon Rattle; Ms. [Francesca Zambello] directs a new "Don Giovanni" sung by Bryn Terfel; a new "La Rondine" is directed by Nicolas Joel -- not Puccini's finest hour, perhaps, but a splashy vehicle for opera's steamiest couple, Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna. Deborah Voigt sings in a revival of Strauss's dense and dismal "Die Frau Ohne Schatten," with David Hockney's superb sets. Other stars include Placido Domingo, Serge Leiferkus, John Tomlinson, Thomas Hampson, Ian Bostridge, Elena Kelessidi, and Luciano Pavarotti singing in (surely his valedictory) "Tosca."  At Glyndebourne there's been an administrative shake-up. Last year the new, artistically ambitious general director, Nicholas Snowman, was replaced by David Pickard, said to be more of a team player; and 29-year-old Vladimir Jurowski, who will make his conducting debut next year, became music director, succeeding Andrew Davis. So far this season, Glyndebourne has scored some critical bull's-eyes with a revival of Sir Peter Hall's landmark staging of Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream," with its dreamy and magical designs by John Bury, performed by a fine cast and conducted with real brio by David Atherton (in rep until July 7); and a spectacular new "Fidelio," directed by Deborah Warner and with the period-instruments Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment conducted by Sir Simon Rattle (in rep until July 11). John Kalman's set and lighting place the action in the present-day Balkans. Kim Begley is a charismatic and believably uxorious Florestan, and Lisa Milne is the first Marzelline I have ever seen to show her despair at having been -- unpleasantly -- deceived by Leonore/Fidelio.
