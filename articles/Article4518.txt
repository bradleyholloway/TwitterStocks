 Multimedia Inc. Rejects Second Takeover Bid --- Firm Says Lorimar's Offer Of $1.02 Billion Doesn't Sway Officers, Founders   By By Jim Montgomery, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1985  GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Multimedia Inc. rejected a second $1 billion takeover bid in a week, asserting that it isn't for sale and reaffirming its own recapitalization plan.  Responding to an offer by Culver City, Calif.-based Lorimar to pay $61 a share, or $1.02 billion, for its 16.7 million shares outstanding, the newspaper, television, radio and cable TV operator said that its management and founding families "have indicated no intention or willingness to sell" their stake of more than 40%.  Lorimar chairman Merv Adelson said that he believes his company's offer hasn't been rejected and that he is optimistic Lorimar can convince Multimedia that an acquisition would be a "positive move" for it.
