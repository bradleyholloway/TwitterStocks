 Regulators Probe Allegations Of Lax Northwest Maintenance   By Carey, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  A Federal Aviation Administration inspector who was temporarily reassigned from his duties at Northwest complained last week to the FAA and Mark Dayton, Democratic senator from Minnesota, the FAA said. The senator, in turn, contacted the FAA and the Department of Transportation's Office of the Inspector General, and sent a letter Friday to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey, outlining the inspector's assertions. Sen. Dayton asked Ms. Blakey to "assure me and the public that Northwest Airlines is meeting all necessary standards of reliability and safety."  Greg Martin, the FAA's chief spokesman, said yesterday that the inspector had been transferred after the agency received complaints that he was "being intimidating to replacement mechanics." But the FAA is investigating the inspector's allegations with help from the DOT's Inspector General, he said. "We don't have anything to act on right now," Mr. Martin said, because the FAA doesn't have any information or data to suggest any problems exist. The FAA stepped up its surveillance of Northwest's maintenance operations before the strike, nearly doubling the number of inspectors to 80, he said.
