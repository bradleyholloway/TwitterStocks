 FDA Is Soon Expected to Tighten Rules Covering Genetically Modified Crops   By By Scott Kilman and Chris Adams, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2000  The Food and Drug Administration is expected to propose as soon as today slightly tougher regulations for genetically modified crops. But the tightening will fall far short of the demands of biotechnology critics.  The FDA decided eight years ago to consider most genetically modified crops as identical to conventional crops. As a result, the agency hasn't required inventors to get its approval or to put special language on genetically modified food as long as they use genes that make proteins and enzymes already in the food supply.  Food-industry officials said the FDA told them it decided to reject calls from antibiotechnology groups for the U.S. government to follow the lead of the European Union, which requires labels on food containing genetically modified ingredients.
