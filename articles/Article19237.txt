 FCC Names Farber, Expert on Internet, Chief Technologist   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2000  The Federal Communications Commission named David Farber, an expert on telecommunications and the Internet, as its chief technologist.  A professor of telecommunication systems at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Mr. Farber, 65 years old, will be responsible for analyzing the strategic interplay of technology and policy for the FCC. Key issues he likely will face during his planned 18-month term include how radio spectrum can be better utilized to provide high-speed Internet access and how to address Internet-technology convergence and broadband-access issues.  A member and trustee of the Internet Society, an informal policy-making body for the Internet based in Reston, Va., Mr. Farber is seen as favoring industry self-governance and a hands-off government approach, a view shared by FCC officials.
