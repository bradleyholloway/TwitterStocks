 No Acceleration In the Recovery Reported by Fed --- `Slow to Moderate' Growth As Well as Low Inflation Noted by District Banks   By By Lucinda Harper and Melissa Levy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1993  The report, based on information gathered from businesses around the country during the six weeks ended Oct. 26, did note some encouraging economic developments, though. The manufacturing sector showed gains in almost all Fed districts, reflecting a pickup in demand for several items. There were even pockets of employment growth at factories -- something that has been elusive for most of this recovery.  In addition, inflation is still very much under control. Retail prices remain "flat or competitive" across much of the nation, the report said. There were a few price increases outside the retail sector, however. Lumber prices have been edging up in the Atlanta district and construction-related industries in Dallas have been raising their prices as well.  Robert McTeer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve bank, said yesterday that recent economic reports have been "encouraging." The remarks to reporters in Dallas come as the housing sector appears to be on the rebound and the manufacturing sector is showing new signs of life. "We've got an accelerating growth rate, inflation under control and record low interest rates," Mr. McTeer said. "Someone ought to stand up and applaud."
