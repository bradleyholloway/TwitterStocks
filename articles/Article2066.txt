 Consumer Demand For Computers Slows in Europe   By Hudson, Richard L, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1995  A slight slackening in consumer sales from last winter's boom is a main factor in the market slowdown, according to Ronnie McBryde, a London-based analyst for IDC's European operations. Last winter consumer confidence was strong in many European countries, and January sales promotions attracted many consumers to personal computer shops. Since then, Mr. McBryde said, consumer confidence has waned slightly. Also, the unusually hot summer kept many consumers away from computer dealers. In particular, industry sales in France, Italy and Spain are lagging behind the rest of Europe, due to continued economic problems.
