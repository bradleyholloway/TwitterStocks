 Deals & Deal Makers: J.P. Morgan Finds It's Not Easy Being an Internet Incubator   By By Ianthe Jeanne Dugan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2002  Cygnifi's 100 employees were thrown out of work, including chief executive officer Jay Helvey III, a 43-year-old retired J.P. Morgan managing director who helped fashion the bailout of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. "It was financially disastrous for a lot of us," says Michael DeAddio, 32, who left J.P. Morgan's London office -- and a bonus approaching $1 million -- to become chief technology officer of Cygnifi. "I would not have left my cushy job for an upstart, but it was Morgan." He now works for another Wall Street firm.  The service would expand trading in the derivatives market, giving J.P. Morgan, already a major player, a piece of a bigger pie. The Internet was increasingly making derivatives trades more transparent anyway. J.P. Morgan executives figured they may as well get paid for shining the flashlight. "A lot of people expected this to be a multibillion-dollar business," explains Cygnifi's former sales manager, Larry Schwarz.  Just over two years ago, Mr. [Vlad Torgovnik] -- who became Cygnifi's president -- and Mr. Helvey raised $22.3 million. Three investors bought 30%: Sybase Inc., an Emeryville, Calif., Internet company; NumeriX Inc., an analytics company; and Bridge Information Systems. J.P. Morgan and Cygnifi's managers owned the rest. The strategy was to go public in two to three years. J.P. Morgan incorporated Cygnifi into a separate company in July 2000 and the new company opened offices in Japan and London. The name was derived from "Cygnus" -- Latin for swan, and the name of a constellation of stars. "Fi" was for financial.
