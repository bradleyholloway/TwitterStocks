 NASD to Require Bulletin-Board Firm Filings; Tech Issues Continue to Weigh Down Market   By By Deborah Lohse, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1997  As expected, the board of the NASD, which runs the Nasdaq Stock Market, yesterday voted to require companies that trade on its OTC Bulletin Board to file quarterly financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, banking or insurance regulators. Right now, there are almost no requirements for companies' shares to be listed on the Bulletin Board, an electronic-trading forum where dealers post quotes and trading data on about 7,000 bulletin-board issues. The NASD estimates that about half of the securities now on the OTC Bulletin Board are issued by nonreporting companies.  The NASD board also voted to require brokers who recommend OTC Bulletin Board or similar so-called Pink Sheet stocks to review the companies' current financial statements before doing so. The Pink Sheets is a less-automated quotation system run by the National Quotation Bureau, which is unaffiliated with Nasdaq. Brokers also would be required to send investors a disclosure statement explaining the differences between such stocks and those listed on markets like Nasdaq. The NASD, a self-regulatory organization, has regulatory authority over the broker-dealers that are its members.  Though Nasdaq runs the bulletin board, it has been trying to distance itself from the speculative issues there, many of which allegedly have been manipulated by unscrupulous promoters or dealers. If the proposal is approved by the SEC, any stocks that get bumped from the OTC Bulletin Board still will be eligible to trade in the Pink Sheets.
