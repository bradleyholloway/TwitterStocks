 Ex-Kmart Official, Realty Broker Indicted in Case of Finder's Fees   By By Drew Ward, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 1996  The indictment alleges that the former Kmart real-estate employee, Michael J. Garzoni, helped an outside real-estate broker named Mark J. Aronds bilk Kmart through a phony real-estate brokerage firm. The indictment charges that the brokerage concern charged Kmart false tenant-finding fees on the 1991 closure of a Kmart store in Oak Ridge, Tenn.  This is the second indictment this year alleging wrongdoing in Kmart's real-estate division. In addition, the retailer itself recently sued a group including Mr. Garzoni and Mr. Aronds, a Houston real-estate broker, on charges of fraud over the Oak Ridge store and four other real-estate deals.  Attorneys for both defendants deny the charges, asserting that Mr. Aronds legitimately earned all commissions received through Mr. Garzoni. Mr. Aronds has filed a countersuit in response to the Kmart suit.
