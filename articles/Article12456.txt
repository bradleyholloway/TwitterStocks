 Your Career Matters: The Jungle   By By Tamar Hausman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1999  The Hampstead, Md., chain of 106 U.S. stores recently launched an Internet business. The operation already is expanding rapidly. "E-commerce is still not a major part of our business," but experience in that area would boost a candidate's chances, says Andrew A. Giordano, chairman and interim CEO.  Uninvolved recruiters suggest Peter Whitford, president and CEO of Structure, a Limited Inc. division, and Michael Warner, head of Country Road Inc.'s U.S. unit, would be attractive prospects for the top job. (Through a Country Road spokeswoman, Mr. Warner declined to comment. Mr. Whitford could not be reached.) Recruiter SpencerStuart is handling the search.  Executive recruiters are increasing the flow of investment bankers into private-equity firms. The bull market has increased the size and number of such firms, which invest money raised from private investors, creating more jobs for investment specialists. The market boom has also made investment bankers "more willing to take the risk, to take a longer-term view" of their money-making prospects, says Solveigh Marcks, head of Russell Reynolds Associates' private-equity group.
