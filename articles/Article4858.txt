 Italy's Position in Europe's Top Tier Is Endangered --- Nation's Financial Woes Could Hobble EC Plan for Economic Unity   By By Robert Keatley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1992  TARANTO, Italy -- The Ilva steel mill is a gritty monument to the modern Italian state. The huge plant was meant to spawn a cluster of steel-using factories and create jobs here at Italy's poor southern tip.  If Italian officials had Ilva to build again, they probably wouldn't. The same could be said of other vast swatches of Italy's economy and the government that owns much of it. Expensive, inefficient or even irrelevant to national needs, they are pushing wealthy Italy toward official bankruptcy. Unless reforms start soon, it could join Greece and Portugal in the European Community's second tier, unfit to run with the likes of France and Germany.  The Italian economy, the world's fifth-largest, is slipping downhill, and the slide could become an avalanche. The country is living far beyond its means, with the government spending half again more than it collects -- and not always wisely. The total debt equals 101% of gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services Italy produces in a year -- with the annual deficit exceeding 10% of GDP. And now the private sector's ability to pay ever-higher taxes is in doubt, just as the EC demands more fiscal discipline than Italian politicans have ever managed on their own.
