 Small-Company Pensions Spur Lawmakers' Concern   By By Ellen E. Schultz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1999  The term refers to one of many practices in which small-company owners turn pensions and other retirement plans into personal tax shelters, while providing little, or nothing, for their employees. An SEP offender? One who plays around with a tax-advantaged Simplified Employee Plan.  Because of such concerns, lawmakers in Washington are meeting this week to consider ways to modify retirement-plan laws covering small companies. Many proposed changes are backed by small-business groups, whose members maintain that government regulations make it too complicated and costly to offer retirement benefits. But some pension experts who work with small businesses say the measures would simply make it easier for entrepreneurs to treat retirement plans as tax shelters.  Small-business groups, on the other hand, argue that an easing of the rules would prompt more employers to set up retirement plans. "It's time to give small businesses that want to provide retirement benefits for their employees an extra break, not an extra burden," says Carol Sears, president of the American Society of Pension Actuaries, a professional group whose clients are primarily small-business owners.
