 Wal-Mart to Toughen Job Screening; Criminal-History Checks Of Potential Employees Follow Two Assault Cases   By Zimmerman, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2004  Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the country's largest private employer, said it will begin conducting criminal background checks on job candidates for its U.S.-based Wal-Mart stores and Sam's Club membership warehouses.  The girls in both cases are suing the retailer. David Massey, a Columbia, S.C., lawyer representing the families of both girls, said criminal background checks on Wal-Mart employees were overdue. "If I was a Wal-Mart shareholder and they were not addressing this, I would be concerned," he said.  Wal-Mart said that the criminal background checks won't be done on all applicants, but only on those who are determined to be qualified candidates for actual hiring. Doing checks on all Wal-Mart applicants could be costly; frequently, more than 4,000 people apply for 500 openings at a new Wal-Mart supercenter.
