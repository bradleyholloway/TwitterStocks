 Thrifts' Profits From Current Operations Plunged in 3rd Period, Latest Data Show   By By David B. Hilder, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1987  Thrift industry profits from current operations, which got a big boost from falling interest rates through last year's first quarter, fell sharply in the third quarter, data from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board show.  The Bank Board data, which is public but unreleased, make a distinction between "current net income," which includes operating and nonoperating items booked in the quarter, and "adjusted net income," which includes write-offs that the Bank Board believes should be attributed to earlier quarters.  Current net income in the second quarter was $210 million, a drop of 88% from the year earlier, according to the Bank Board's most recent computer data. That represents a drop of more than $100 million from the $314 million of current net income reported in a Bank Board compilation in October.
