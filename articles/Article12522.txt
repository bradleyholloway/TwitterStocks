 Blue Chips Regain 124.72, but Tech Stocks Slip --- Nasdaq Recoups Earlier Losses, Ends Off 24.15   By By Greg Ip and Robert McGough, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2000  The Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped a third of Tuesday's steep loss, rising 124.72 points, or 1.13%, to 11122.65. But the pullback in technology stocks continued, albeit at a more modest pace. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which plummeted a record 229.46 points Tuesday, went on another wild ride but ultimately fell just 24.15 points yesterday to 3877.54. The index was even in positive territory for a time, after steep selling had driven it down as many as 167 points intraday.  Although at first glance, it looks as if this week's stock-market declines -- the industrials dropped nearly 500 points on Monday and Tuesday -- were a buying opportunity, there is a twist. Money appears to be rotating out of the stocks that led the market all last year, primarily technology and Internet-related issues, and into some long-beaten-down "value" stocks. The Dow Jones Utility Average, for example, jumped 3.8%.  For example, on a day that "new economy" darling FreeMarkets, a Pittsburgh online auction firm, lost $33.5625 to $244.9375, its cross-town "old-economy" neighbor, aluminum giant Alcoa, added $4.6875 to $86. Since Monday's record high, FreeMarkets' market value has fallen 34% to $8.3 billion. Since its intraday low on Monday, Alcoa's has risen 7% to $31.5 billion. That still may not seem a reasonable relationship to traditional investors, given that FreeMarkets' trailing 12-month revenue through the third quarter was only $16 million while Alcoa's was $16.4 billion.
