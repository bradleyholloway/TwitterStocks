 REVIEW --- Books -- Children's Books: The Scary Future, the Embarrassing Past   By Meghan Cox Gurdon, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2011  In these light and funny pages, grownup Ann looks back with unmerciful self-deprecation on herself as she was in the early 1960s, and the result is a book that children ages 8-14 can enjoy as a kind of genial historical artifact and that their parents can read with affectionate winces at the quirks and obsessions of long-ago childhood.
