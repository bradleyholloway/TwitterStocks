 How U.S. Companies Are Responding --- Most Are Curtailing Travel And Cautioning Employees, But No Exodus Is Under Way   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2002  In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the U.S. needed cooperation from Pakistan to combat Islamic extremists, President Bush has lifted some sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan after their 1998 nuclear tests. But an administration official noted that, under a law known as the Glenn amendment, sanctions would automatically be reapplied if either India or Pakistan detonated another nuclear device.  Similarly, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Alto, Calif., computer and printer maker, said it is taking appropriate steps to notify employees about the State Department warning, but hasn't barred travel to the country. The company said it has 2,600 employees in India, mostly in research-and-development operations and sales and support. The company declined to be more specific about how many are American or British, citing security reasons. But it issued a statement saying that "currently, only business-critical travel is permitted to India, and all H-P employees traveling to India are required to get specific permission from senior management prior to any travel to the country. Employees must also register with the H-P office once they have arrived." The company added that it has posted the travel-risk and security information and the State Department warning on its intranet.  Both Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. have operations in India; market share between the two legendary rivals is close. A spokesman for PepsiCo, which considers India a key foreign market, said all of its employees in the country are Indian nationals and that it had no evacuation plans. A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola declined to comment. Coke does have a few expatriates in India, but most employees are Indian nationals.
