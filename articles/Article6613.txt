 SEC's Pitt Lashes Out at Critics, Accusing Them of Playing Politics   By By Paul Hofheinz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 2002  Mr. [Pitt] has said that reports that Mr. Biggs was actually offered the job are incorrect. He said that Mr. Biggs is "still in contention . . . and so are other people," and that he would most likely meet the law's Oct. 28 deadline for filling the post. Mr. Pitt could decide to assuage his congressional critics by backing Mr. Biggs for the job. But if Mr. Pitt decides against supporting him, the decision could come down to a party line vote on the SEC, dooming Mr. Biggs's chances. Republicans hold three seats on the SEC; Democrats hold two.  Mr. Pitt's blunt comments, unusual coming from a regulator, could worsen his already-tense relations with Capitol Hill. A former SEC general counsel who represented the accounting industry, among others, while in private practice, he began generating controversy almost as soon as he took the helm of the SEC last year. Over the summer and early fall, he managed to avoid political missteps. But lately he has drawn fire for his handling of the candidacy of John Biggs, chairman of TIAA-Cref, the college professors' retirement fund, for the chairmanship of a new five-member board that will oversee the accounting business.
