 Dollar Declines Against Yen and Euro On Wider-Than-Expected Trade Gap   By By Michael Casey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 1999  The dollar was dealt another heavy blow when an unexpected widening in the U.S. trade deficit for June sent the dollar tumbling against most major currencies.  With consensus forecasts earlier predicting a narrower deficit of $20.8 billion, the announcement at 8:30 a.m. EDT that the monthly trade gap had ballooned to a record $24.6 billion from a revised $21.17 billion in May hit the U.S. currency hard in the New York session.  Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 111.63 yen, down from 111.91 yen late Wednesday. The euro was trading at $1.0638, up from $1.0522. The euro was also at 118.75 yen, up from 117.75 yen. Sterling was at $1.6175, up from $1.6027.
