 Milwaukee's Schools Open--to Competition   By Fund, John H, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1990  "People outside Milwaukee have no idea how important Sept. 4 could be for parents everywhere," says Polly Williams, the gutsy state legislator who pushed through the nation's first experiment in educational vouchers for low-income children. Today, several hundred Milwaukee children will begin attending a half-dozen or so nonsectarian private schools, with the state of Wisconsin paying up to $2,500 of their tuition costs. Public education in America is about to feel the bracing winds of competition.  Teachers unions and educrats understand exactly what Polly Williams's modest experiment could lead to. The Milwaukee public schools spend an average of $6,000 a year per student. The inner-city private schools involved in the choice plan spend barely half that, and consistently provide a better education -- even for underachieving students from broken homes. If the students in the choice program do well, it will threaten the very foundations of the bureaucratic empire the public schools have become. They will either have to change or perish.  Just how bad are the Milwaukee public schools? The 97,000 students in the system (70% black) have a grade point average of 1.62 (D+). For black students the average GPA is 1.35; for whites it's 1.98. Almost half of the public school students drop out without graduating from high school.
