 Diamond Exchange Could Alter Industry   By Jeffs, Luke, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  "We are on the verge of a period of rapid change in the diamonds industry as demand becomes linked more tightly to economic factors such as foreign-exchange rates, and demographic changes shift demand from the U.S. to new economies such as China and India," he said. "By commoditizing the trading of diamonds, we can access more bank credit at lower rates at a time when the industry needs capital to realize the potential in the industry."  Mr. [Martin Rapaport] said his exchange, which he admits may take as long as two years to establish the requisite liquidity, addresses risks in the established diamond-dealing model. "We commit to prices for diamonds in the future with no idea what is going to happen to affect their value in the meantime, which exposes us to risk," he said.
