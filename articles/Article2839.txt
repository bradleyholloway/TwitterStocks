 Milwaukee Pulls Out Stops in Museum Project --- City Known for Bratwurst And Beer Seeks a Place On the Cultural Map   By By Nancy D. Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2001  Mr. [Santiago Calatrava] also is credited with raising the bar of "design sensibilities" in a city whose most noticeable contemporary structure is dubbed the "Milk-of-Magnesia building" for its bold stripes of bottle-blue glass. Specifically, two new proposals for downtown residential towers "transcend any high-rise built here for 20 or 30 years," says Robert Greenstreet, dean of the school of architecture and urban planning at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.  In Milwaukee, best known for beer, bratwurst and bowling, officials hope the expansion, along with a lineup of tourist attractions, will put the city of 600,000 on the cultural map. Since 1998, more than $1.7 billion in public and private investment has been set aside for Milwaukee hotels and attractions that run the gamut from a butterfly garden to a casino with a 2,150-seat bingo hall. Also in the works is a Harley-Davidson Motor Co. museum and restaurant, connected by a motorcycle-parking strip.  Mr. Calatrava says he considers the project "one of his best works," representing a synthesis of his ideas over the past 10 years. Trained as an architect, artist and engineer, he is known throughout Europe for his unique brand of public buildings and bridges, including the swooping Lyon Airport Station in Lyon, France, and the harplike Alamillo Bridge in Seville, Spain. Already in the design phase in the U.S. are an airport building and a set of bridges in Dallas, as well as a bridge and esplanade in Chicago. Last November, Mr. Calatrava was awarded the commission for the Roman Catholic Christ the Light cathedral in Oakland, Calif.
