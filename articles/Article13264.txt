 Moving the Market: Dear Berkshire Holders: Net Leaps; Buffett's Letter Reflects On Solid but Tough Year; P.S. Avoid Wall Street Pros   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2006  Mr. [Warren Buffett]'s stock-picking prowess has helped offset some of the pain in his company's insurance operations, which overall registered a slight profit in 2005. (Berkshire doesn't break out its fourth-quarter results for operating units in its annual report.) Berkshire's stock portfolio grew nearly 24% in value last year to nearly $47 billion, largely due to Berkshire's decision to use more of its cash to buy stocks, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Boosting investment gains was a $5 billion pretax capital gain from the merger of Gillette Co., in which Berkshire was a big investor, and Procter & Gamble Co.  Last year's hurricanes inflicted "record losses" on Berkshire totaling $3.4 billion -- in line with previous estimates of what the company would incur for the year. Berkshire's General Re reinsurance business posted a $334 million underwriting loss while Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance lost about $1.1 billion, compared with gains for both companies in 2004. Reinsurance is insurance sold to other insurance companies.  Like last year, Mr. Buffett also warned about the risks of derivatives, instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset and that can be used to hedge against risk but also to leverage bets and thereby increase risk. Berkshire lost $104 million in 2005 on General Re's derivatives book, which Berkshire inherited when it bought the reinsurer in 1998. Mr. Buffett noted that the number and value of derivative contracts had "mushroomed" far beyond where they were in 1998, "the last time that financial chaos erupted."
