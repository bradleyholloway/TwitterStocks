 Wide-Flying Moguls: Google Duo's New Jet Is a Boeing 767-200; Included Are Two Staterooms, A Shower, Seats for 50; It's 'Good for the World'   By Kevin J. Delaney, J. Lynn Lunsford and Mark Maremont, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2005  Tech moguls delight in public one-upmanship and the Google founders' 767 raises the bar. Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen owns a fleet of aircraft, but his flagships -- two Boeing 757s -- are smaller than Messrs. [Sergey Brin] and Page's 767. It also marks a new level of consumption by the Google executives, who have shunned most trappings of the super-rich despite a combined net worth estimated at more than $20 billion.  Federal Aviation Administration records show that the Qantas 767 was bought in March by a limited-liability company registered in Delaware. The contact number for that company listed in FAA records is an extension at Google's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. On a recent day, calls to that number were answered by a voicemail system announcing that "Eric Schmidt is not available. To leave a message, wait for the tone." Mr. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, didn't return a message left on the machine. He and Mr. Brin, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this article.  The Google co-founders' 767 is now in San Antonio, people familiar with the matter say, having its interior re-done by Gore Design Completions Ltd., a firm that specializes in outfitting executive jets. Previous clients include the Chinese government and the Detroit Pistons basketball team. Gore, in a May 12 press release, announced a contract to outfit a 767-200 with "a 100% VIP interior" for an unnamed U.S. customer.
