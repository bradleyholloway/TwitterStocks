We were said to be rapidly losing our basic manufacturing industry, and politicians vied for votes by pledging to find ways to rebuild American industry.  There isn't any clear-cut answer. Many American companies proudly trumpet numbers showing increased productivity, and it's easy to find workers complaining about givebacks forced upon them.
