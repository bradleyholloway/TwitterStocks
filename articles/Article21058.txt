 Most Interest Rates End Little Changed As Traders Wait for Economic Reports   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1987  The Commerce Department today is scheduled to release its index of leading economic indicators for January. The Labor Department's employment statistics for February will be issued Friday morning. Although many forecasters expect both reports to indicate the economy remains listless, individual estimates vary widely.  In the bond market, prices of some 30-year Treasury bonds rose early in the day but later retreated to wind up at about the same levels as on Friday. Corporate and municipal bond prices edged higher.  The Commerce Department report today is widely expected to show that the leading indicators index declined moderately in January. According to the average estimate of 16 economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the index declined 0.4% in January. That would follow a 2.1% surge in December. Estimates for the latest survey range from no change to a 0.8% drop.
