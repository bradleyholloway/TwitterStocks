 Breakaway (A Special Report) --- Letters to the Editor   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2000  I have 17 years of experience as a transactions attorney with a firm that grew from 16 to 50 attorneys (which is large in Detroit) and now am a name partner in my own, much smaller firm, Steffl, Flood & Gerlatch. My experience tells me that the following will happen to someone who takes such advice: A partner who bills at $400 to $600 an hour (who is worth no more than $200 an hour in terms of real value) will hand the transaction off to one or several inexperienced young associates. Those young associates will bill at the $200 that the senior partner should be billing at. No significant action will take place that will not require several attorneys, all with meters running. Further, every conceivable out-of-pocket cost (and those difficult to conceive) will be passed on to the client. The result: A significant portion of the sale proceeds will go into the pocket of the "big law firm."
