 Judge's Ruling Not to Use Trustee for Robins Upheld   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1987  A committee representing women who used the company's Dalkon Shield contraceptive device had requested a trustee, after Robins was found in civil contempt for making about $9 million in improper payments to executives and creditors. Federal District Judge Robert Merhige Jr. instead appointed an examiner, who reviews Robins's actions but has less authority than a trustee.
