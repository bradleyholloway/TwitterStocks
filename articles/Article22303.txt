 British budget avoids big tax boosts on individuals, cuts levy on business   By Bray, Nicholas, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1997  The UK's new Labor government, keeping its campaign promise, avoided imposing major tax increases on individuals and even surprised business by modestly reducing taxes on company profits.
