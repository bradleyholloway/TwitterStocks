 Ruining politics--II   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 1996  An editorial complains that special interests who decide to spend money in support of a candidate can bypass campaign reform laws, because they spend the money on their own, and are ruining politics. The editorial describes the ads run by special interests like the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO for Ron Wyden, who won a special election in Oregon for the US Senate.
