 AIDS Cases Spur Criticism of Blood Trade   By By Lawrence Ingrassia, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1985  The business is the international trade in blood products. It is vital to hemophiliacs -- but now suspected of speeding the spread of AIDS and other diseases. Big drug companies and international blood brokers long have bought and sold blood plasma like any other commodity, shipping it from surplus producer countries to places where there is a shortage.  But the paying of blood donors is controversial. Critics argue that paying donors inevitably attracts a few people whose blood is contaminated. Some European experts argue that the virus suspected of causing AIDS -- acquired immune deficiency syndrome -- probably came to Europe in blood plasma collected in the U.S.  To staunch serious bleeding, hemophiliacs need transfusions of a blood-clotting concentrate called factor VIII that is made from thousands of pints of donated blood. Blood plasma and factor VIII, the most widely used product that is made from plasma, make up the bulk of the international blood trade. (Raw blood, which has a limited shelf life, is generally used within the country where it is donated.) Earlier this year, tests were developed to screen donated blood and plasma to detect antibodies for the virus, HTLV-III, that causes AIDS.
