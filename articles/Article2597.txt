 The Heart as Career Counselor --- Lessons from turning passions into professions   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1999  The David Archer Band swings into a smooth cover of Duke Ellington's jazz classic, "Take the A Train." It's Mr. [David] Archer's favorite tune, but he knows that after a round or two of drinks, most revelers, such as those at tonight's Williams Technologies Inc. employee-appreciation night in Charleston, S.C., will demand more recent hits such as "Proud Mary."  "I just live for `Proud Mary,'" he says, his voice dripping with sarcasm. But he understands the song's popularity. "It's something they can sing, and they pay the bills." Occasionally, though, he refuses a request. "I draw the line at `Joy to the World,'" says the 47-year-old Mr. Archer, referring to the 1971 Three Dog Night hit that has become a Happy Hour favorite. "I just say we don't know it."  Still, there are moments when he has to swallow hard on the fact that working at one's first love may sound better than it really is. "A doctor told me the other night at a wedding, `If I could play music professionally, I'd never have gone to medical school,." Mr. Archer says. "I didn't tell him the truth: You're lucky you don't have to do something fun so much that it gets tedious."
