 Hot Seat: To Protect Its Box-Office Turf, Ticketmaster Plays Rivals' Tune; As Online Threat Crescendos, It Goes After Resellers With Auctions, Exchanges; Artists Get Piece of the Action   By Ethan Smith and Sara Silver, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  A division of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, Ticketmaster is overhauling the way it sells tickets, embracing new methods that it long shunned. It is now running auctions to sell seats for roughly 30% of this year's major music tours -- including Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, Barbra Streisand, Madonna, B.B. King and Melissa Etheridge. Ticketmaster also is letting customers resell some seats at its Web site. Since that lets fans sell tickets far above face value, Ticketmaster has joined the fight against state antiscalping laws, reversing its earlier position.  "The Internet has opened up the world of reselling tickets to anybody," says Arthur Fogel, chairman of concert-promotion giant Live Nation Inc.'s music division. That rankles Ticketmaster, concert promoters and musicians, who generally haven't benefited financially from this extra revenue. "That secondary-market money, we think belongs in the industry," says Ticketmaster's Mr. [Terry Barnes].  Ticketmaster's revenue jumped to $950 million in 2005, up almost 24% from 2004, partly as a result of strong sales in Canada and higher sales from recent acquisitions in Sweden, Finland and Australia. The bulk of Ticketmaster's revenue comes from fees it adds on top of the face value of tickets, accounting for 30% or more of the final cost. It is the cash cow for parent company IAC. For the quarter ending June 30, the company's ticketing division had $295 million in sales and produced $69 million in operating income, the bulk of IAC's total operating income of $81 million.
