 U.S. Economy Is Expected to Weather Turmoil in Asia With Moderate Growth   By By Christina Duff, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1997  The U.S. economy is expected to weather the Asian financial typhoon with steady growth and low inflation, newly released economic forecasts show.  The burgeoning crisis "will probably not have a significant impact" on prospects for U.S. expansion in the next five years, concluded the National Association of Business Economists in its latest quarterly survey. Moderate growth and low inflation are "likely to continue" at least through 2003, the survey said.  That was also the conclusion yesterday of two other big economic groups: the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While the financial crisis in Asia probably means those countries will be less able to buy U.S. exports, domestic demand is "perhaps a little stronger" than thought even a couple months ago, helping to offset export weakness, said Peter Jarrett, an economist with OECD, a group of 29 nations that evaluate each others' economies.
