 Cable Operators Attack Studies Saying They Deny Access to Many TV Stations   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1988  A cable television trade group attacked studies by regulators and broadcasters showing that many television stations have been denied access to local cable systems.  The fight between the broadcasters and cable operators stems from a wider debate over whether the cable industry, which has been broadly deregulated in recent years, should be subject to new and more stringent regulation. At issue in this particular battle are the Federal Communications Commission's so-called must-carry rules. The rules, which require cable systems to carry all local broadcast signals, were declared unconstitutional by a U.S. Court of Appeals last December.  The cable industry says new rules aren't necessary; broadcasters are urging Congress to restore the rules and to regulate the cable industry's ability to move stations from one channel to another. At the request of four congressmen, the FCC surveyed broadcasters, and earlier this month released a study that indicated 20% of cable systems responding had dropped or denied carriage to a broadcast station, and 30% of the broadcasters responding had been dropped by a cable system.
