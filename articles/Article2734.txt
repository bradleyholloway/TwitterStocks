 Goldman Group to Help 'Off-Line' Firms Go Online, Then Take a Stake in Them   By By Kara Scannell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2000  The three firms have invested $300 million in iFormation, after clients began asking them for help in building Internet businesses. IFormation plans to invest in 10 to 20 Web businesses a year, which it will jointly own with the established business. They will guide each venture's creation from idea, to support, to running it until a permanent management team is in place. IFormation says it isn't a venturecapital firm because it will offer a greater depth of services.
