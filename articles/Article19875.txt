 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; SEC Examines Fund-Payout Policies   By Pruitt, Angela, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2005  "The SEC is reviewing whether this is an appropriate" strategy, the person said, noting that issuers have been informed that the payouts are on hold. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.  In a recent supplement to its prospectus, the NFJ Dividend, Interest & Premium Strategy Fund, which was launched in late February, said the SEC "has indicated that it has suspended the processing of exemptive applications . . . pending review by the staff of the results of an industrywide SEC inspection focusing on the dividend practices of closed-end investment companies."  "As a result of this development, the fund has no current expectation that it will be in a position to include long-term capital gains in . . . distributions more frequently than is permitted," under the Investment Company Act of 1940, NFJ said in the filing. The fund added that it would postpone submitting an application until the SEC resumes processing them.
