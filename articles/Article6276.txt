 Conflicting Interests: Why a Brokerage Giant Pushes Some Mediocre Mutual Funds; Jones & Co. Gets Payments From 'Preferred' Vendors; Cruises and Safaris, Too; Mrs. Wessels Loses on Putnam   By Laura Johannes and John Hechinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 2004  [Jones], based in St. Louis, is also among the nation's leading practitioners of a little-understood fund-sales practice now under scrutiny by federal securities regulators. In the industry it's known by the bland name of "revenue sharing": Fund companies give brokers a cut of their management fees to induce them to sell their products. Critics call it "pay to play."  If properly disclosed, revenue sharing is legal. But the practice has come under increasing scrutiny as part of the current mutual-fund scandal, and it is now unclear precisely what disclosure is required. In November, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $50 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that its brokers didn't inform customers about revenue-sharing deals and other incentives to sell certain funds. Morgan Stanley didn't admit or deny wrongdoing. The money will be distributed to fund investors. The SEC also accused Morgan Stanley of steering customers to the funds of companies that gave Morgan lucrative stock-trading business; Jones doesn't engage in that practice.  Capital Research & Management Co.'s American Funds, the nation's third-largest fund company, confirms that it makes payments to Jones. American values being on the Jones list because it "gets us access" to the firm's brokers, American spokesman Chuck Freadhoff says. "We have the ability to meet with the individual financial advisors, [so] we can explain our products and our funds," he adds. American discloses the practice in its prospectus in a manner "consistent with" industry and SEC rules, the spokesman says. American says Jones is the top seller of its funds.
