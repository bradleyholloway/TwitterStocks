 Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow: Tech Ills Shave Barber   By By Susan Pulliam, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2001  The party, of course, now is over. For Mr. Flynn, the music stopped precisely on Feb. 15. That is when he received a "margin call," a demand from his broker that he immediately put up more money to offset losses in his portfolio. So Mr. Flynn sold shares of EMC Corp. to repay a $75,000 loan from the brokerage firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Now, his portfolio of technology stocks, which peaked in value at $834,000 on Sept. 20, has dwindled to about $250,000. "It hurts," he says. (Not just for him: Mr. Flynn recently raised the price of a haircut to $11.)  Mr. Flynn's apparently unshakable belief in technology stocks and that of investors like him, even after punishing losses, helps explain why the long slide over the last year in the Nasdaq Stock Market has proceeded in a slow, grinding fashion -- a far cry from the panicky sell-off of 1987, for instance. But that same sentiment also raises questions about whether a further market drop could trigger a capitulation by individual investors. For now, Mr. Flynn is sitting tight. "I think we'll get a second chance," he says.  Indeed, throughout last year, Mr. Flynn's stock holdings rode out the storm in technology stocks successfully. As Internet stocks were pummeled in the spring, shares of EMC, a data-storage company and his biggest holding, held up surprisingly well; they hit a 52-week high of $102.94 on Sept. 25. On April 3, 2000, Mr. Flynn told a reporter he was sanguine about his EMC shares, even as Nasdaq began in earnest its long slide, posting its fifth-worst decline at the time on that day. "I'm sure it'll come back," he said at the time. "I'm not going anywhere."
