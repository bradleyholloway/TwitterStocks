 Atlantic Southeast Air Says It Will Report Profit Tripled in 1984   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1985  Atlantic Southeast Airlines expects to report that 1984 net income nearly tripled to $5.3 million, or $1.33 a share, from the prior year's $1.8 million, or 47 cents a share, Robert L. Priddy, vice president and treasurer, said.  In an interview, George F. Pickett Jr., president and chief executive officer, attributed the earnings and revenue growth to a May 1984 marketing agreement with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines. Through the agreement, Atlantic Southeast feeds passengers into Delta's concourses at Atlanta and Memphis.
