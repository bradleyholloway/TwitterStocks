 Sprieser, CEO of Sara Lee's Food Unit, Will Leave to Head Internet Cooperative   By By Jonathan Eig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  Ms. [Judith A. Sprieser], 46 years old, said she hoped her experience running the business-to-business cooperative, known as Transora, would better prepare her for the top post at a large company such as Chicago's Sara Lee. Transora is a partnership of heavyweights including Coca-Cola Co., Nestle SA unit Nestle Holdings Inc., Unilever NV and most of the other major purveyors of food and packaged goods.  Ms. Sprieser added that her decision to leave her employer of 13 years was not connected to the July 1 promotion of 54-year-old C. Steven McMillan, who succeeded John H. Bryan as Sara Lee's chief executive. "I consider myself more of a candidate to follow him at some point," said Ms. Sprieser, who consulted with Mr. McMillan before accepting her new job. She also will leave Sara Lee's board.
