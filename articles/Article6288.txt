 Britain Signals It's Likely to Free Former Chilean Dictator Pinochet   By By Greg Steinmetz and Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2000  It is unclear when Mr. [Augusto] Pinochet will be legally free to return to Chile. Mr. [Jack] Straw has asked for comments from other interested parties within seven days. After reviewing those comments, he said, he would decide whether to release the general.  Mr. Pinochet, 84 years old, has been detained in Britain for the past 15 months while Mr. Straw deliberates an extradition request from Spain. After learning that Mr. Pinochet's health was deteriorating, Mr. Straw ordered a medical examination, which took place in London on Jan. 5. Mr. Straw didn't release the report, but said in a statement that the doctors found that Mr. Pinochet was unfit to stand trial. Three doctors and a neuropsychologist examined the general.  The health issue is seen as one of Mr. Pinochet's best chances for release. Spain has asked Britain to extradite Mr. Pinochet so he can be tried before a Spanish court on charges of torture and other crimes. More than 3,000 people, including several Spaniards, died or disappeared when Mr. Pinochet assumed power through a coup in 1973. Mr. Straw's statement suggests that Britain believes there is no point in going forward with extradition because Mr. Pinochet couldn't survive a trial. He is believed to have had two strokes. His health deteriorated in September and October, and the medical examiners believe Mr. Pinochet's poor health is irreversible, the statement said.
