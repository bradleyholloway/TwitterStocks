 Judge Kennedy's Conservative Rulings On Business Often Debated by High Court   By By Stephen Wermiel and Ellen Hume, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1987  Judge Anthony Kennedy's legal philosophy on business isn't well known in Congress, but much of it has already been reviewed by the Supreme Court -- with mixed results that are likely to be raised by both sides in his confirmation hearings.  Yesterday, as the nominee to the high court began making courtesy calls to some senators, Senate leaders met with President Reagan to discuss whether the hearings will begin next month or in January, but they reached no agreement. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), senior committee Republican, said after seeing the president that they would discuss starting dates with their colleagues and make a decision next week.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), who led conservative opposition to Judge Kennedy two weeks ago when President Reagan chose Judge Douglas Ginsburg, yesterday reversed course. After meeting with Judge Kennedy and the president, Mr. Helms told reporters, "I think he'll make a fine member of the Supreme Court."
