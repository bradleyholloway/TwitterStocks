 SmartMoney Stock Screen / Efficient Stocks   By Hough, Jack, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2005  ROE can also help investors judge the worthiness of a stock at a time when the overall stock market is going haywire. Consider electronics retailer Best Buy. Its shares lost 40% of their value between mid-2000 and January 2003. So did the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index. But Best Buy continued to put up 20% to 22% returns on equity through most of that time, while the S&P 500's ROE fell from 16% in 2000 to half that in 2001 and 2002.
