 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  A TABLE that was compiled by Wilshire Associates Inc. and was printed in last Wednesday's Florida Journal incorrectly listed National Beverage Corp. as a stock that has shown poor earnings growth. In fact, the company's earnings growth rate has been higher than Wilshire calculated, and the company shouldn't have been listed in the table. Wilshire determines growth based on the past four quarters' per-share earnings compared with average earnings the three prior years.
