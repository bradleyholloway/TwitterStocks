 New Intelligence Tests Emphasize Abilities Overlooked by IQ Exams   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1987  IQ and insight are related, but those with high IQs don't always have lots of insight. Indeed, it doesn't take a high IQ to realize that IQ tests ignore many important mental abilities. Psychologists, increasingly mindful of this, are developing new ways to assess aspects of intelligence that IQ tests miss.  "We've gotten so hung up on IQ that we have forgotten it isn't very predictive of life success," says Robert Sternberg, a Yale University psychologist. Howard Gardner, a Harvard University psychologist, adds: "IQ is enormously influential in formation of self-image. It seems that as many people remember their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores as remember their Social Security numbers."  Messrs. Sternberg and Gardner are among the leaders of a recently renewed movement to topple the IQ hegemony. Mr. Sternberg has developed a theory of intelligence based on studies of what succeeds in the real world, such as "street smarts." Mr. Gardner argues that there are several kinds of intelligence, including the mental gifts of skilled mimes, social workers and others whose talents are ignored by conventional aptitude tests.
