 Excite to Sell Debt To Help Finance Web Site Purchase   By By Kara Swisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1999  The Redwood City, Calif., Web portal and cable Internet-access provider plans to offer convertible subordinated notes to institutional investors to cover the $350 million cash portion of its $780 million acquisition of Bluemountainarts.com. The remainder of the price will be paid for with Excite At Home stock.  The high price to be paid for the Web site, said company officials in October when the deal was announced, is due to the site's large audience, who come to send and receive a wide range of free online greeting cards. Excite At Home, which also has a portal Web site, hopes to sell ads and gift products on the greeting-card site, which has remained largely free of marketing.
