 India Develops a Taste for Local Vintages   By By Stan Sesser, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2001  His friends did have a point, though. Everyone knows it's impossible to make good wine in a country like India. Wine grapes need cool nights and scattered rain, not torrid heat and drenching monsoons. And even if you could grow the grapes, who would buy the wine? India has a huge percentage of teetotalers -- even the man who runs its largest winery has never tasted a drop. Those who do drink want something cheap and with a big alcoholic kick. As for the new yuppies -- Indians with a university education who have traveled to the West and developed a taste for wine -- they wouldn't want something produced locally, the naysayers predicted. Like up-and-coming Asians everywhere, they're into French wines, which connote status.  A major force driving India's wine boom has been the changing tastes of the burgeoning middle class. Many Indians who travel and study abroad return not only with a taste for wine, but with a curiosity about the local product. The more upscale Indian restaurants are helping by following another Western trend: lightening their food so that it goes as well with wine as with beer.  Many believe that the potential of India's wine market is so vast that there's room for all comers. Ranjit Chougule, chief operating officer of Indage, does some quick calculations that are enough to make anyone drunk on the possibilities. "The annual per-capita consumption of wine in India today is seven milliliters," he states. "That's about one teaspoon per person. But the emerging upper middle class numbers 100 million. If just five million people bought one case of wine a year, that's 60 million bottles."
