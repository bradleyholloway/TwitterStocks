 Progressive Profit Rises, but Concern For Prices Persists   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2005  Progressive, the third-biggest seller of car insurance in the country, said it earned $413.5 million, or $2.01 a share, up from $357.8 million, or $1.63 a share, in the year-earlier period. The Mayfield Village, Ohio, company said its year-end results were helped by the release of $76.6 million of claims reserves. After a companywide review, Progressive said it had determined that it could reduce its estimates, and therefore reserves, for claims that it has expected to be filed. The company said it released additional reserves because some existing claims settled for less than expected.
