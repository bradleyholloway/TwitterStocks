 Disney Is Considering Splitting Off Arvida Real Estate Unit, Sources Say   By By Michael Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1986  Walt Disney Co., which acquired its Arvida real estate unit two years ago as part of its long-range plan for Florida development, now is considering splitting off those operations as a master limited partnership, according to several sources associated with Arvida.  A Disney spokesman declined to comment. But Charles Cobb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Arvida Disney Corp., said in an interview that he and several top Disney officials met with investment bankers last week in New York to discuss possible refinancing strategies for all or part of the unit, which Disney acquired in June 1984 for about $200 million in common stock. Mr. Cobb is a Disney director and a member of the board's five-member executive committee.  Mr. Cobb described the meeting as a routine discussion of financing options for Arvida, based in Boca Raton, Fla. He also said no final decisions about Arvida have been reached. What's more, he said, any eventual decision may involve less than all of Arvida's assets.
