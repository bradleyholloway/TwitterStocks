 Television: David Byrne's Brazil   By By Robert Goldberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1989  Always known as an eclectic, downtown kind of guy, Talking Head David Byrne has, over the past decade, become an ace in the import/export trade -- bringing in African, Caribbean and Brazilian rhythms to enliven his pop tunes, and pushing his music out beyond pop boundaries, to score Twyla Tharp's dance "Catherine Wheel," Bob Wilson's "The Knee Plays" and "The Forest," and Bernardo Bertolucci's film "The Last Emperor" (for which he shared an Oscar). Then, too, he's had a hand in writing, directing, composing and even designing "the look" for two amiably askew films, "True Stories" and "Stop Making Sense." But this time, the wiry postmodern popster and Rhode Island School of Design dropout has really gone and done it.  Kicking off the fifth season of "Alive From Off Center," David Byrne's "Ile Aiye (The House of Life)" (PBS, July 5, 10 p.m. EDT; the series continues Thursdays at 8:30 p.m.; check local listings) is one of the very best things you will see on television this year. An admirably eccentric piece that's part documentary, part music, part video art, "Ile Aiye" is a voyage into northeastern Brazil's Bahia region, a docupoem on the popular Candomble religion.  For the people of Bahia, Candomble is not just a faith. It's music, dance, culture, ritual, pervading every part of their lives. The divine is everywhere for them, continually touching the everyday. The Bahians say, "A stone is not only a stone -- it's a place where a god expresses himself."
