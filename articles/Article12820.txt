 Home Depot Leads Blue Chips, Rallying 9%, as Intel Rises 7%   By By Shaheen Pasha, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2002  "Typically markets have been able to move higher when they're able to discount bad news as we did with AMD," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke LLC. "AMD warned twice and sentiment got so bad, but for investors with a 12- to 24-month horizon, there's a feeling that companies like Intel which are dominant players will benefit as the conditions improve."  Sun Microsystems was boosted 50 cents, or 11%, to 4.89 after Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich made some positive comments about the company. Sun's high-end server sales improved at the end of the quarter while the low end remains strong, and the resale of Hitachi storage is "progressing well," Mr. Milunovich said.  Dow component Caterpillar lost 98 cents to 46.18 as Wall Street speculated that the machinery company may lower its full-year earnings guidance when it releases second-quarter results July 16. Company representatives couldn't be reached to comment. The consensus estimate compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call has Caterpillar earning $2.49 a share, down from $2.60 in 2001.
