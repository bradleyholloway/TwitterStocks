 Is P.I. Pankau Less Than Meets the Eye? --- Veracity of Detective's Exploits Are Questioned   By By Laura Johannes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1994  "I do not believe it is possible to produce a true, libel-free, original book about your life and career," Mr. Pack wrote Mr. Pankau last April. In an accompanying 15-page statement, which became public last week as part of a lawsuit, Mr. Pack argues that the sleuth couldn't document claims he made before signing the book deal. Mr. Pack says Mr. Pankau promised -- but never delivered -- new information on the Iran-Contra scandal, and details of big figures in white-collar crime. According to Mr. Pack's statement, Mr. Pankau's promises may "constitute fraud" against him and Macmillan. The publisher declines to comment.  The statement became public when Mr. Pankau filed a defamation suit against Mr. Pack in state district court in Houston last month. The suit, seeking more than $5 million in damages, charges that Mr. Pack "is spreading vicious and unsubstantiated statements about Ed Pankau's veracity, moral character and honor."  Mr. Pankau's attorneys, in attaching Mr. Pack's statement as evidence, filed a motion to seal it from public view. District Court Judge Michael Schneider initially left it open, pending a hearing on the motion. At Mr. Pack's request, the case was moved to U.S. district court in Houston where a motion by Mr. Pankau's lawyers to seal parts of the files is pending.
