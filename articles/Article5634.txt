 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1994  Clinton plans to dispatch several cabinet members to the Senate this morning to push for reform. One top White House aide even professes optimism that the Mitchell bill will survive largely intact. He even suggests that Senate Republicans might join Democrats to avoid a vote on excising the mandate provision if the GOP thought the vote would lose.  But a major political argument is made against the change: It would risk upsetting Florida's Cuban-American community. Clinton nearly carried Florida in 1992, losing by just two percentage points. His political advisers have hoped to make up that difference in 1996 with a strong boost from the free-spending Cuban-Americans.  House Ways and Means Chairman Gibbons, distracted by the health-care battle, shows little enthusiasm for moving quickly on the Clinton Superfund bill. Hopes of getting a world-trade pact through Congress by the August recess fade rapidly. A Clinton on-the-job safety bill runs into business opposition largely because it would require worker-management teams.
