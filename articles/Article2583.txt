 You Don't Need Oars in the Water To Go Out for Crew --- Colleges Have Plenty of Money For Tall, Muscular Women; `No Experience Necessary'   By By Barbara Carton, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1999  Anywhere a river runs through the groves of academe, chances are you'll find coaches casting a net for female rowers. Women's crew has expanded to 122 colleges from 74 since 1994-95. With each team seeking about 60 large and muscular ladies, schools can't fill their boats fast enough.  The University of Louisville in Kentucky, a state with little rowing tradition, is drumming up a team. So is Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Arid climate? No problem. Last week, Arizona State University, in the desert city of Tempe, announced it would introduce rowing in 2002. The team aims to row on a two-mile stretch of water that the city plans to create by flooding a dry gulch.  For most big schools, that means a scramble to find women's sports with teams large enough to offset football, where the National Collegiate Athletic Association allows 85 scholarships. That's where crew comes in. Each campus with NCAA Division I women's rowing can offer 20 full scholarships (or the equivalent in partial scholarships). That's the most the organization allows for any women's sport.
