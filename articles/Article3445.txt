 U.S. Puts Itself in Tricky Position With Talk of Settling Tobacco Suit   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters David S. Cloud in Washington, and Gordon Fairclough and Milo Geyelin in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  Such a gamble is unusual for the Justice Department. At least part of the impetus for the settlement strategy is to give the Bush White House breathing room on the tobacco issue so that it can pursue other elements of its agenda and leave this issue until next year, according to a tobacco lobbyist close to the White House. And the entire effort had antitobacco forces suspicious whether the administration is seeking any results at all -- or just delay. The Bush administration inherited the case from the Clinton administration and has doubts about the legal and political wisdom of suing a legal industry, especially one that strongly backed Mr. Bush's election campaign.  That response points up the difficulty the Bush administration now faces in extricating itself with any results from an inherited lawsuit that it has clearly signaled it doesn't like. Plaintiffs' lawyers who have negotiated settlement discussions with tobacco companies in the past were dumbfounded by the Justice's Department's decision to undercut the strength of its own case in public and signal a desire to settle, before assessing the industry's interest in a deal.
