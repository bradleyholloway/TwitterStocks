 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1999  The U.S. District Court judge issued an injunction blocking the four-year-old program that lets students attend private or parochial schools at taxpayer expense.

The government fought criticism of its response. Survivors were rattled by a magnitude-4.7 aftershock that hit near Ankara.  Kosovar Albanians rejected NATO demands that they let Russian peacekeepers enter Orahovac. Albanians say the Russians favor the province's remaining Serbs, who the U.N. says now number just 30,000. Meanwhile, a U.N. adviser says Serb troops used chemical arms against Albanian guerrillas.
