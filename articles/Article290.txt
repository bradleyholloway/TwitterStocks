To the Editor:  Your news story about the Metropolitan Hospital Demonstration Program accurately described for the most part this innovative attempt by the city to provide comprehensive preventive and other health services to the residents of East Harlem. However, its statement that the Health and Hospitals Corporation may seek to bolster enrollments in the program by offering ''prizes such as television sets and appliances'' is untrue.  As part of our efforts to attract more participants, we have looked at various marketing strategies used successfully both in other health-services enrollment programs and in American business generally. But giving consumer goods as bonuses for signing up would be clearly inappropriate and was never considered.  Other, more suitable inducements are available. For example, while H.H.C. is committed to providing all users of Metropolitan Hospital medical care of equal quality, we can offer special amenities to those who choose to enroll in the demonstration program: more attractive waiting rooms, 24-hour telephone access to their own physician, and so on.  Meanwhile, the program's main selling point continues to be the fact that it offers continuous, comprehensive care by teams of doctors, nurses and other professionals who are thoroughly familiar with a family's medical history. The prize for participation is not a toaster oven or even a nicer waiting room. It is better health care and better health.
