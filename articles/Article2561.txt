 Apple Computer Net Plunged 75% For Fiscal Period --- Profit Margins Continued To Shrink as Shipments Of Macintoshes Soared   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1994  Apple Computer Inc., continuing to feel the squeeze of shrinking profit margins, said net income plunged 75% for its fiscal first quarter, although shipments of Macintosh personal computers soared to a record on discounted prices.  The profit of $40 million, or 34 cents a share, for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with net income of $161.3 million, or $1.33 a share, for the year-earlier quarter. Revenue increased 23%, to $2.47 billion in the quarter from $2 billion a year ago, boosted by a year-over-year 40% jump in shipments of Macintosh PCs to a quarterly record of more than 1 million.  Apple's ongoing quandary the past year has been to cut the prices on its flagship Macintosh line while at the same time trying to keep costs in line with sliding profit margins. Apple used to be able to sell the Macintosh for a premium over rival PCs, since its operating system was easier to use. But the explosion onto competitive PCs in recent years of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, which emulates Macintosh's ease of use, crippled Apple's once-healthy market-share gains.
