 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  Consolidated Minerals Ltd. said its board unanimously recommended a 902.4 million Australian dollars (US$738.5 million) offer from Palmary Enterprises Ltd., trumping a A$822.4 million offer from the Pallinghurst consortium. Palmary, a Belize-based company associated with Ukrainian conglomerate Privat, is offering A$3.95 a share -- more than Pallinghurst's A$3.60 offer, which was previously recommended by CSM's board. The market will be waiting to see if the Pallinghurst consortium raises its bid.
