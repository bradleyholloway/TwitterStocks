 Lincoln National Convertible Faces Fight   By By John Shipman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2001  Mr. [Phillip Goldstein], who said he has been a shareholder of the Lincoln National Convertible Securities Fund for more than two years, says he is disgruntled over the discount at which the fund's shares trade when compared with their net asset value. His aim is to narrow the discount by converting the Lincoln National portfolio to an open-end mutual fund.  The fund's directors are calling on shareholders to reject Mr. Goldstein's proposals. In a proxy filing, fund director David K. Downes said the shareholder meeting is of particular importance, "in light of the hostile proxy contest threatened by Phillip Goldstein, a professional dissident who is attempting to make a quick profit at the expense of the fund's long-term shareholders."  Mr. Goldstein recently won a court fight in which the judge set aside last year's fund elections on the grounds the board breached its fiduciary duties by not allowing Mr. Goldstein to submit his proposals for vote at last year's shareholder meeting. The board said his proposals were submitted after a deadline stipulated in a 1999 proxy statement prior to the shareholder meeting, though the fund's bylaws didn't indicate any deadline for shareholder proposals.
