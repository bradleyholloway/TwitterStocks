 Australian Wants To Make Superstar Of United Artists   By By Kathleen A. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  Christopher C. Skase, the 40-year-old Australian chairman of Qintex Australia Ltd., isn't modest about his plans for United Artists, the movie studio he agreed to purchase from investor Kirk Kerkorian for about $600 million.  That would be a big leap for the studio founded 70 years ago by a group including Charlie Chaplin. Mr. Kerkorian, who owns 82% of MGM/UA Communications Co., had been trying to sell the United Artists division for months. Last summer, movie production stopped amid huge layoffs and the exodus of well-known executives such as Alan Ladd Jr. Even so, United Artists released "Rain Man," which won four Academy Awards.  Mr. Skase, who owns Australia's largest commercial television network, said he plans to focus mostly on better distribution for the studio in the growing international market, particularly in Europe. United Artists has a film library with distribution rights to 4,000 titles, including the James Bond and "Rocky" film series. The studio also has a large distribution and home video business.
