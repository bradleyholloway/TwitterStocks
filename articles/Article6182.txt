 GM, Russian Firm Consider Building Lower-Cost Car   By By Robert L. Simison, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1999  General Motors Corp. is investigating whether a joint manufacturing venture can build a car for the Russian market that would cost less than $10,000 by using the engineering resources of its Russian partner, Avtovaz, based in Togliattigrad.  David Herman, the Moscow-based GM vice president who is in charge of the No. 1 auto maker's efforts to develop its business in the former Soviet states, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show that a recently signed memorandum of intent between the two companies sets that as the principle aim of a round of negotiations. The talks are to be concluded by Aug. 1, Mr. Herman said. Avtovaz makes the Russian Lada, which is based on an aged Fiat design.
