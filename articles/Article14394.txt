 Bond Prices Slip Amid Widespread View Interest Rates Will Rise in Coming Weeks   By By Matthew Winkler and Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1987  Despite a mild afternoon rally, actively traded 30-year government bonds wound about 1/8 point lower, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Earlier yesterday in Tokyo, these issues had declined as much as 7/8 point to yield nearly 9.1%.  "I'm not comfortable the bond market will get any better and it's more likely to get worse," said Frederick W. Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer at Chrysler Corp., which sold $250 million of 12-year notes yesterday. Just two months ago, Mr. Zuckerman predicted steadily lower interest rates this year. "I've certainly been surprised," he said.  The Chrysler offering completes a $900 million refinancing of American Motors Corp. debt that Chrysler will assume when the two companies merge. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Co. priced the 12-year notes at par to yield 10.4%, or about 1.6 percentage points more than the Treasury's 8 1/2% notes due May 1997. The notes are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp.
