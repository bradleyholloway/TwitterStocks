 Bank of England Cuts Rate By a Quarter Point to 4.5% --- Weak Confidence of Firms And Consumers Is Cited; FTSE 100 Climbs 2.8%   By By Sara Calian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2001  "We expected the quarter-point cut, and it's a wise move, given the deterioration of confidence," says Mark Miller, U.K. economist with Morgan Stanley in London. "In terms of confidence, the U.S. data are almost as important as the U.K. data for the Bank of England."  "The weaker world outlook and increased uncertainty have set back U.K. business and consumer confidence, and may, for a time, restrain business and household spending," the Bank of England said in a statement yesterday.  The ECB didn't quickly follow the U.S. rate cut of a half-percentage point earlier this week, as it and the Bank of England did immediately after the Fed's Sept. 17 rate cut. Europe's central bank appears to want to keep its options open. On the one hand, central bankers speak of the ECB's last rate reduction as exceptional and say that prudence is good at a time of great economic uncertainty. But officials also point out that inflation and growth are falling more quickly than previously anticipated, suggesting that lower rates might be needed.
