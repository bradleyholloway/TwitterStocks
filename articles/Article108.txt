The two surviving teen-agers rescued from Mount Hood suffered exposure to cold that was so prolonged and extreme that it could easily have been fatal. But experience with other cases suggests that they might both walk out of the hospital in a few weeks with little or no permanent damage.  It is still far too early to make such a prediction, said doctors experienced in cases of severe cold exposure, but the two patients now in hospitals in Portland, Ore., have the vitality of youth and previous good health in their favor as well as unknown accidental circumstances that may have helped keep them alive while the six people found with them died: It may be, for example, that the two were shielded somewhat from the cold by the others around them.  ''The prognosis at this point should be guarded,'' said Dr. Michael Barmache, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. But he said that there was reason to hope that both patients would recover fully.  Dr. Barmache, an experienced mountain climber and skiier, has not participated in the treatment of the two patients, but has treated other cases of profound hypothermia, the exposure to severe cold with a drop in core body temperature. He said the medical literature contains few if any cases in which people have recovered after their inner, or core, temperatures dropped below 55 degrees Fahrenheit, but that the two Oregon teen-agers were estimated to have had temperatures in the very low 70's.  Core body temperature is that temperature deep inside the body that is usually measured by electronic sensors inserted into the digestive tract, often by way of mouth or rectum. It cannot be measured with an ordinary oral thermometer. 'A Ray of Light'  The body temperatures of the six victims found with the teen-agers on Mount Hood were in the 40's, according to Dr. Ben Bachulis of Emanuel Hospital in Portland.  Dr. Barmache said that there were no reliable statistics on the percentage of people who survive temperatures as low as those of the two survivors, but that there have been some authenticated survivals of people whose temperatures were that low. These represent ''a ray of light'' for the present cases, Dr. Barmache said.  Under the circumstances in which they were found, he said, there was probably little that could have been done for them immediately after they wre found except to replace their frozen garments with warm clothing. If they showed evidence of frostbite, the affected parts of the body surface would be kept cold until the patients reached the hospital. Chemical Activity Slowed  If heartbeat and breathing had stopped, they would be given artificial resuscitation on the trip to the hospital, but even very slow natural heartbeat and respiration might maintain vital body functions. The rates of chemical activity in the body are slowed by abnormally low temperature. Such a patient must be handled with extreme care, according to a medical reference book, because the human heart is susceptible to serious disturbances in rhythm at such low temperature.  Prolonged interruption of blood supply to the brain can cause permanent brain damage, but the cold itself can sometimes help delay this because it reduces the brain's need for oxygen.  Once in the hospital, the profound hypothermia patient would be put on a heart-lung machine, a cardiopulmonary bypass. This resort to surgical operation has two vital purposes: to keep the patient's circulation functioning to supply tissues with oxygen-rich blood and to warm the patient. Meanwhile, any frostbitten extremities would also be warmed externally by water.  The two teen-agers were fortunate in that Mount Hood is only about 50 miles from Portland where sophisticated medical care is available. ''I think these kids have received the most technologically advanced care that they could have,'' said Dr. Barmache.  Photo of rescue workers searching Mount Hood (AP)
