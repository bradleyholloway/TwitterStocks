 Internet Cartoon Transfixes Russia's Office Workers, to Bosses' Dismay --- Work Stops to Follow Exploits Of Masyanya, Who Giggles A Lot, Has Penchant for Sex   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2002  Crudely drawn, with fruity teenage slang, a maniacal giggle and a penchant for drink, drugs and sex, Masyanya commands a large following among Russia's version of Generation X, the 20- and 30-year-olds known for their free-wheeling cynicism and total alienation from politics. "They're mainly white-collar workers in Moscow illicitly surfing the Net during office hours," says Oleg Kuvayev, Masyanya's 35-year-old creator.  Others have been quick to pick up on the character's commercial potential. Political candidates with an eye on the youth vote have asked to use Masyanya in their campaign videos. Businessmen want her to sell condoms. With a video miniseries planned for Russian MTV, Masyanya would seem well positioned to arrive in the mainstream.  The character is likely to meet with disapproval from Russia's political establishment. The country has a long tradition of state censorship, and leaders are quick to condemn things they view as corrupting the nation's youth. This month, President Putin, bemoaning the lack of educational programs on children's television, called on the cultural elite to create role models that would "squeeze out squalid characters from the media." (His views on Masyanya are unknown.) Guests on TV talk shows already have condemned Mr. Kuvayev for "promoting drug use" among Russia's teens.
