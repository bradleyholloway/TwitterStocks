 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2007  At its annual shareholder meeting today, H&R Block Chief Executive Mark Ernst will be in the hot seat over the company's so-far failed efforts to unload its Option One mortgage unit. Once upon a time, H&R Block planned to sell the subprime-mortgage lender for $1.3 billion. That's now the stuff of dreams. In April, it signed a deal to sell Option One to Cerberus Capital Management, a giant investor in distressed companies, for roughly $1 billion. But the chances of even getting that done now look minuscule.  Investment firm Breeden Capital Management, led by former Securities and Exchange Commission chief Richard Breeden, is seeking today to place three directors on H&R Block's board, including himself. Mr. Breeden, who holds a 1.8% stake, wants to push the company back to its tax-preparation origins.  Given Block's slow-footed efforts, Mr. Breeden could well get the shake-up he's after. But in this environment, investors shouldn't be too sure Mr. Breeden will deliver much-better results.
