 Congress Approves Measure to Revamp Federal Worker-Training Programs   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1998  After five years of haggling, Congress passed and sent to President Clinton a bill to revamp the government's employment-training programs.  The legislation combines dozens of worker-training programs now run by different federal agencies into three separate aid grants to states and localities -- one for programs aimed at adults, one for young people and one specifically for dislocated workers.  In a potentially far-reaching move, workers are to be given "individual training accounts" -- vouchers, essentially -- to choose among training programs for which they are eligible. Most training providers would be required to disclose job-placement and earnings histories for their graduates.
