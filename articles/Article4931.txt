 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Eastern Europe Trembles   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1988  The Soviet Union's postwar empire is shaking. Instability is engulfing much of Eastern Europe. Events in Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, Estonia and elsewhere bring into focus a critical question about Mikhail Gorbachev's plans to restructure the existing system: Can it happen without a titanic upheaval?  The early evidence from Eastern Europe is suggesting that as Communist countries move away from the Stalinist model, they tend toward instability. No doubt the Communist Party leadership, not to mention the Western bankers and businessmen seeking commercial opportunities in these nations, would prefer a stable process of perestroika. But so far it is only the regimes of such die-hard Stalinists as Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu and East Germany's Erich Honecker that seem able to guarantee "stability," a condition ensured with acts such as shooting people trying to flee their countries.  Yugoslavia has an annual inflation rate of more than 200% and a foreign debt of $21 billion. (Who, by the way, made all these bad loans?) Its economy is collapsing. Police have resorted to tear gas and clubs to break up demonstrations by Serbs stirred up by none other than the region's Communist Party boss, a Serbian named Slobodan Milosevich, who is trying to consolidate Serbian power. Not surprisingly, his power grab is opposed by Yugoslavia's more prosperous northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia.
