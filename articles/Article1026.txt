 Macy Expected To Sweeten Bid For Federated --- Cincinnati Retailer Advises Shareholders to Tender To Campeau for Now   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1988  Meanwhile, both Federated and its rival suitor Campeau Corp. over the weekend disclosed moves designed at least in part to put their pending legal cases in the best light on the eve of a crucial court hearing. Federated took the extraordinary measure of recommending to its shareholders that they tender their shares to Campeau, but withdraw them at a later date and tender to Macy; a countermove yesterday by Campeau, however, may cause Federated to rescind that recommendation today.  Improving its bid for Federated is an attempt by Macy to hedge its risk if it loses a lawsuit that attempts to delay Campeau's offer. That offer currently is scheduled to expire this week -- three weeks ahead of the Macy bid -- and it is expected most Federated shareholders would tender to the Canadian concern. Macy has bid $74.50 a share in cash for 80% of Federated's shares and securities for the remaining 20%; Campeau has bid $75 a share in cash for 80% and $44 a share in cash for the remainder, or a blended value of $6.18 billion, or about $68 a share.  Federated characterized its move to recommend that holders tender to Campeau as an effort to warn shareholders of the possibility of receiving a far lower price for their shares in a Campeau takeover of Federated. The company pointed out that, in a Campeau-Federated merger, holders who didn't tender to Campeau would receive only $44 a share. Those who tendered would receive about $68 a share.
