 Prominent Conservatives Are Set for Posts At Treasury, Economic-Advisers Council   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger and Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2001  Messrs. [John Taylor], 54 years old, and [R. Glenn Hubbard], 42, would help fill what has been until now a big void in President [Bush]'s economic team: the lack of a prominent academic economist. Both served in Mr. Bush's father's administration: Mr. Taylor as a member of the CEA and Mr. Hubbard as a member of the Treasury's tax team. Both also were part of an economics braintrust assembled for the new president's White House campaign, with Mr. Taylor sometimes appearing on stage with the candidate.  Mr. Taylor's likely appointment as undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs comes as a bit of a surprise. He is widely respected by academics across the political spectrum for his work on monetary policy and is considered a potential candidate some day to be Fed chairman. His Taylor Rule formula is used by central banks around the world to help set interest rates.  Associates say Mr. Taylor found the Treasury slot appealing because it would give him more administrative responsibility than the more academic CEA job. Besides, the Treasury international post can be an important stepping stone to higher office. That was Harvard professor Lawrence Summers's first assignment in the Clinton administration before he ultimately rose to Treasury secretary.
