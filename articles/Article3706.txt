 Mortgage Woes Force Banks To Take Hits to Sell Homes   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2007  Jeffrey Frieden, chief executive officer of REDC, called the auction a success. About 90% of the homes offered were sold, he said. Some deals fell through because buyers couldn't qualify for financing. He estimated that 1,000 bidders attended the sale in San Diego's Convention Center, where REDC workers in tuxedos shouted and whooped in the aisles to fire up bidders.
