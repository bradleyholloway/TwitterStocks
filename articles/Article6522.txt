 Fuel Sell   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 2002  President Bush sent Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to announce that he is reorienting federal research away from the conventional fuel-economy car in favor of a fuel-cell-powered vehicle, a project he dubbed the "freedom car." And with terrorism springing out of the Middle East, noise about energy independence is being heard again. This brand of isolationism holds that if the U.S. could just spend enough to junk the gasoline engine, we'd no longer have a stake in peace and security in the Mideast.  The downside is that by joining the fuel-cell chorus, the Bush Administration hastens the day we'll have to fight down a national fuel-cell mandate. Detroit's enthusiasm for research owes more than a little to California's "zero-emissions vehicle" mandate, which requires companies to offer such cars as 2% of their model lineup by 2003. Detroit realizes that spending a few billion to explore the technology now will make it less embarrassing to explain later why unsold ZEV cars are rusting on showroom floors.
