By United Press International Federal investigators are ''very close to a solution'' in the slaying of Federal District Judge John Wood Jr. in Texas, William H. Webster, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said yesterday.  Mr. Webster, speaking to reporters at the White House, was asked about the Wood case, and whether the bureau was close to solving it.  ''We believe that we are,'' he said. But he refused to ''project indictments.''  ''We are very close to a solution,'' he said. ''We intend to solve it. We already know the players.'' Meanwhile, The Dallas Times Herald reported that Jimmy Chagra, an alleged drug dealer who was said to be unaware that the bureau was taping his conversation, had told his brother that he had arranged Mr. Wood's slaying.  The newspaper said that the conversation was recorded in an interview room while Joe Chagra, a lawyer, was visiting his brother at the Federal prison in Leavenworth, Kan., and that a Federal judge had authorized the recording.  Judge Wood, known as ''Maximum John'' for his tough sentencing of drug offenders, was shot to death in San Antonio on May 29, 1979.
