 Business World: Silly Trial, Silly Law   By By Holman W. Jenkins Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  Nobody came out looking a hero in the trial of A. Alfred Taubman, who was convicted last week for his role in the price-fixing scandal at the famous Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses. The media lapped it up, but it's a sad thing when the government sponsors the degradation of reputable people by threatening them with jail for something that nobody should go to jail for.  There was Diana "Dede" Brooks, once a figure to be reckoned with as Sotheby's CEO, now describing herself as an errand runner for Mr. Taubman, the aged shopping-mall mogul who acquired Sotheby's in the early 1980s. "Don't act like a girl," she quoted him telling her. Her message to jurors: I'm just a girl.  Another big gun for the prosecution was Christopher Davidge, the fired head of Christie's, whose severance package was riding on his performance. He reportedly locked up $8 million when he agreed to testify against Sotheby's so Christie's could avail itself of the Justice Department's Orwellian "corporate leniency" program.
