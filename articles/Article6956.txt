 Strong 10-Year Note Sale Eases Fears   By Stoyko, Shayna, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2005  While the first two legs of the government's $44 billion refunding earlier this week weren't a complete disaster, they weren't anything to write home about, either. Each auction "tailed," meaning the issue was awarded at a higher yield than where it traded at the auction deadline in the "when-issued market," where bonds are traded before being formally issued. That indicated a lack of aggressive bidding.  Shorter-dated securities are highly sensitive to Fed policy, so their prices have nowhere to go but down if the Fed keeps raising rates. Thus, investors were reluctant when the Treasury sold $13 billion of five-year notes the day after the Fed meeting. Longer-dated securities have fared better during the latest tightening cycle. This has fueled the overwhelming popularity of the "yield curve flattening trade" -- where investors bet that yields on two- and 10-year notes will converge. Thursday, the difference in yield between these two notes was just 0.25 percentage point. In January 2004, it had been 2.50 percentage points.  The banking syndicate includes Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Royal Bank of Scotland, according to a person familiar with the syndicate. Officials at CSFB, Deutsche Bank, Goldman and J.P. Morgan declined to comment; officials at Citigroup and RBS weren't available to comment.
