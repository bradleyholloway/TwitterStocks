 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus: Someone Is Always Watching   By Gibson, Eric, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2004  Perhaps as memorable was the moment when he spoke about what had brought him to the hearing room in the first place. "You read [about the abuse] and it's one thing," he said, referring to Gen. Antonio Taguba's report. "You see photos and you get a sense of it, and you cannot help but be outraged." The scandal has been public knowledge since January. But it was not until the first photographs appeared on "60 Minutes II" that it became a front-page story.  This is surely the lesson of the Abu Ghraib photographs -- beyond the obvious moral one. At every turn new technologies, new modes of capturing and disseminating images of war's horrors -- glass-plate photography, photo mechanical reproduction, newsreels, TV, digital media -- have emerged to reignite photography's incendiary power in unexpected and, as we've seen, devastating ways. It's a lesson that soldiers of all ranks -- and their civilian leaders -- will ignore at their peril.
