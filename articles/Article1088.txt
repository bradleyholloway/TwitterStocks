 Let's Play the Yankees' Who Is to Blame Game   By Barra, Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  The accounts of how and why the Yankees once again folded in the postseason could fill volumes -- and no doubt will between now and the flurry of baseball books that will be published next spring. The explanations range from the sensible -- the front office saddled itself with too many elderly free agents, such as 43-year-old Randy Johnson and 37-year-old Gary Sheffield, both of whom were likely candidates to break down, and did -- to the nonsensical, as in "The Yankees aren't built to win in the postseason." If the Yankees weren't built to win in the postseason, why did the majority of experts name them as the favorites before the playoffs started?  There are no known statistics that can explain this. As Alex Belth of the Bronx Banter Web site puts it: "Somehow, for some as yet unexplainable reason, the Yankees' concentration falters and the wind goes out of their sails after they take a lead in a series. I just don't know what would explain this." Steven Goldman of Baseball Prospectus and the YES network doesn't know either, although he sees a common thread in all those collapses: "[Joe Torre] has been the manager. No one can say for certain that he has created the circumstances which bring about those collapses, but what is clear is that he hasn't been able to do anything to reverse them." Or as Mr. Torre himself said in a radio call-in show after his press conference on Tuesday, "Sometimes you just sit in the dugout and feel helpless."
