 New Chinese Shipping Port to Ease Bottlenecks   By Stanley, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2005  Construction of Yangshan's next phase, which will add four more berths, is to begin next year. Operation is expected to involve foreign companies, though the Shanghai city government has yet to name them. Among the foreign port-operating companies reported to be eager to participate are Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.'s Hutchison Port Holdings of Hong Kong and APM Terminals, a unit A.P. Moller-Maersk Group of Copenhagen. Both companies declined to comment. Upon completion in 2020, the port is to have as many as 50 deepwater berths that will more than double the capacity of greater Shanghai's container-handling facilities.
