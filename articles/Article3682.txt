 The Office Copier: We Fight It, Love It, Get Naked With It   By By Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  Forget HAL. Beneath its innocent surface the copier is a machine that vacillates between simplicity and baffling complexity, innocence and guilt, goofiness and gloves-off intimidation. The copy machine, arguably the first office intruder from the machine world, has become the village idiot-savant.  SO VEXING IS the machine that some have resorted to spells. Prolific witch-author Patricia Telesco advocates in her book placing "a bay leaf under each leg of the office copier to keep it running smoothly." In a pagan newsletter a decade ago, another witch, Laurel Olsen, noting the copier's guts "are very sensitive to negativity," advised businesses to hang a totem made of construction paper, string and a glue stick. Even she had a caveat: "Nothing except divine intervention can make a copier completely breakdown-proof."  Since its introduction into the office in 1959, the copy machine has so bullied its way into our popular culture that it is the stuff of urban legends. One apocryphal story goes that police duped a suspect into confessing by straping a metal colander to his head, wiring it to a copy machine, and having the machine repeatedly print "he's lying" every time he answered a question. Another legend has it that a man was found dead one morning sitting atop a shredder, which he mistook for a copier.
