 Moving the Market: How a Fledgling Credit Card Cuts Fees   By Sidel, Robin, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2007  The formation of Gratis is a big change for 35-year-old Mr. [Jason Hogg], whose family has been entrenched in the traditional credit-card industry for years. His father, Russell, spent nearly a decade at American Express Co. in the 1970s and was named chief executive of MasterCard International Inc. in 1980. During his nearly 10-year tenure at MasterCard, the elder Mr. Hogg poured money into technology and advertising, promoting so-called smart cards that carried information on an embedded computer chip. He also played a big role in MasterCard's push into premium credit cards. The elder Mr. Hogg, 77, is currently on the board of Gratis.  As a child, the younger Mr. Hogg played with prototype credit cards that his father brought home from the office. Later, the son entered the credit-card industry himself, and eventually became an executive at MBNA Corp., one of the biggest card issuers. At MBNA, he met Dax Cummings, who is now chief operating officer at Gratis. Mr. Hogg left MBNA in 1998, joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and eventually started developing the Gratis product.
