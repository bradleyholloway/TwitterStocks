The audience crammed into Rumsey Playfield in Central Park on Sunday afternoon was standing on chairs, clapping raised hands, dancing in place, twirling scarves and T-shirts in the air and shouting approval for favorite lines of songs, like a heavy-metal crowd. But onstage were eight seated musicians and singers led by a middle-aged man, without a guitar or an electrified instrument in sight, playing traditional music that dates back centuries. It was just one more jubilant show by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Party, the world's best-known group performing the Sufi devotional music known as qawwali. The group played a free concert, presented by the Association of Pakistani Professionals, in honor of Pakistan Day.
