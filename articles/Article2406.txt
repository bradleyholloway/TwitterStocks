 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Fear Stalks Britain   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1992  Britain tumbled into depression last Wednesday -- not economically, but psychologically. News that the Major government would close 31 state-owned coal mines and fire 30,000 miners brought to a head three years of national anxiety.  Those of us who listen to the radio call-in shows and read letters to the editor are struck by the raw fear set off by last week's announcement. People are afraid that the recession will now drag on and on and that no job is safe. They are afraid that a long national decline, reversed during the Thatcher years, is now back and even accelerating. Threats to mining touch deep in the British soul.  The Tory press, loyal to Mr. Major until a few weeks ago, turned with a vengeance. "What on earth is going on?" an editorial in the Sun asks Mr. Major. "Where the hell is this once-great country of ours heading? When will you tell us your master plan? Do you even have one?" The Sunday Times is even more scathing: "The scale of the government's incompetence is breathtaking."
