 KFC, Hot Stuff Overseas, Looks To Rekindle Flame Back Home   By Gibson, Richard, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2004  "The rude reality" is that "our customers don't think about KFC as often as we'd like. We're not as relevant," Yum Chief Executive David Novak told a Wall Street audience last month.  Piper Jaffray & Co.'s Peter Oakes and Scott Waltmann cite another concern: The advanced age of many KFC inner-city stores. "Given that KFC has some of the oldest facilities and real-estate locations in QSR-land, we sense that this is proving to be a subtle but continual drag on same-store sales, especially when the engine's other cylinders are misfiring," they said. QSR stands for quick-serve restaurants.  One pivotal factor will be KFC's advertising. Remember "Finger- lickin' good," and "We do chicken right"? Those previous taglines are part of Madison Avenue lore. The brand has since gone through a series of forgettable messages.
