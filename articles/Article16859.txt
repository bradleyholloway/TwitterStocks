 There's Rich, and There's the 'Fortunate 400'   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2008  The income yardstick used by the IRS for its study is known as "adjusted gross income," and it doesn't include tax-exempt interest income from state and local government bonds. (An IRS spokesman says nearly 4.5 million investors reported tax-exempt interest income for 2005 totaling $57.7 billion.) Moreover, adjusted gross income, or AGI, is arrived at after deducting various items, such as moving expenses, alimony payments and the self-employed health-insurance deduction.
