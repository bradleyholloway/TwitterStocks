 Letters to the Editor: Hard Corps   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1987  With reference to James P. Sterba's article "Real Marines Don't Practice Diplomacy" (editorial page, Dec. 16), please tell your bleeping reporter that he needs to do some bleeping research. I am not a bleeping Marine, I am a bleeping Army officer, but I would be bleeping proud to be either.
