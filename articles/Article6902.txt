 High Tech Computer Gets Hot; Taiwan Contract Builder's Growth in Cellphone Sector Lifts Shares   By Ramstad, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 2005  HTC started out in 1997 as a contract manufacturer to companies that wanted to build personal digital assistants based on Microsoft's then- new Windows CE software. When signs emerged four years ago that smartphones were likely to render the organizer functions of a PDA obsolete, HTC built the first smartphone based on Microsoft's software and sold it to Orange SA, the cellphone unit of France Telecom SA, which offered it to the public in October 2002. But the product, riddled with design and software problems, sold poorly.  HTC continued to work with Microsoft designing phones that had PDA features and PDAs that had wireless features, such as access to Wi-Fi networks. Last year smartphones and wireless PDAs accounted for more than half of HTC's NT$36.4 billion (US$1.19 billion) in revenue.  Its work for palmOne represents a significant diversification that also reduces bottom-line volatility. HTC could build more than 500,000 Treo units this year, accounting for 15% of its revenue, according to an estimate by Tony Tseng, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Taipei. But because palmOne designs the Treo devices, HTC's margin on manufacturing them is less than with the products it develops.
