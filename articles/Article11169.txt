 Air-Traffic Errors Force FAA to Cut O'Hare Landings   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1988  The Federal Aviation Administration sharply reduced the number of landings permitted at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during peak evening hours, following a rash of mistakes by air-traffic controllers.  Since Monday, landings between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. CDT have been cut to 80 an hour from 96 to reduce congestion and slow the swift flow of traffic at O'Hare, said John Ryan, director of air-traffic operations at FAA headquaters.  Controllers at O'Hare have committed four errors within a week -- two Friday, one Sunday and one yesterday. In fiscal 1988, which ended Friday, Chicago controllers made 30 errors, up from 16 in fiscal 1987, according to agency spokesman Robert Buckhorn. The errors involved allowing aircraft to fly closer to each other than regulations permit.
