 How Do You Say This Diplomatically? U.N. Is Off the A-List iii Snubbed by Socialites, Envoys Mingle With Each Other; A Lunch for Liechtenstein   By Daspin, Eileen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2003  High society, much like the world itself, has moved on. As the U.N.'s reputation has sunk in the eyes of many Americans, so, too, has the organization's appeal for New York's power party-givers. "My friends say, why do you bother?" says Connie Spahn, a trustee on the board of New York's Museum of Natural History, who says she's one of the few who still entertains U.N. diplomats regularly. "Socially, it's not a big plus" to have U.N. people in the mix, she says.  Some of this has to do with the recent controversy over Iraq that has turned some Americans against the U.N. Others say there's a feeling that the U.N. just isn't the same influential institution it once was. "The average person doesn't think about the U.N," says Mrs. Duke, who says she feels sad about this "diminishing attitude." Plus, these days, there are simply more U.N. members in town: 191, in all, up from 159 in 1988. Many are from developing countries, operating on tight budgets. Ambassador Mahbubani says one embassy, which he declines to name, recently told him it was having trouble paying its electric bill.  In important ways, America's social elites and philanthropists have come to the U.N.'s aid throughout its history. The Rockefeller family donated the funds to buy the property on which the U.N. headquarters now sits. Eleanor Roosevelt provided the organization with years of good publicity with her work on behalf of the organization. Billionaire George Soros's support has included a $36 million donation to a U.N. agency to aid Bosnia in 1993. And Ted Turner gave the U.N. a huge boost in 1997 when he handed the struggling institution a donation of $1 billion that was going to be paid out over 10 years. (That has since been stretched to 15 years.)
