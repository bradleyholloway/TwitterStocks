 Investors Face Challenge to Get Cut of Settlements   By DeBaise, Colleen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2005  More money could be available down the road if other WorldCom underwriters settle pending suits, and criminal defendants are ordered to pay restitution. WorldCom's former chief executive, Bernard Ebbers, goes on trial next week on charges he led an $11 billion accounting fraud. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy last year and now operates as MCI.  In fraud cases, the SEC tries to collect ill-gotten gains and financial penalties from defendants, ranging from fallen executives to big Wall Street firms. The Fair Funds provision allows the agency to use financial penalties to pay back investors. Previously, penalties went to the Treasury. Mr. [John Nester] said investors shouldn't expect a huge payout, but chances of recovery are greater than in the past, when investors were victimized by pump-and-dump or Ponzi schemes. "Here you have large institutions who absolutely in order to stay in business must make the payment," he says.
