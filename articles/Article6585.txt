 Brazil's Crash Course in Economics --- Presidential Candidates Are Increasingly Talking Wall Street's Language   By By Pamela Druckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2002  Meanwhile, Brazilian central bank head Arminio Fraga said in New York yesterday that he expects the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to continue backing Brazil's economic program. Mr. Fraga said he "explored possibilities" for a new credit line from the multilateral organizations when he met with IMF and U.S. officials in Washington Wednesday, but that he doesn't see a need for new funds before the elections.  For now, the economic discussions appear aimed at winning support from key decision makers in finance, industry and the Brazilian media, and members of Brazil's small but influential middle class. Analysts say these groups have become more economically savvy following recent financial crises and Brazil's growing global ties. Candidates "cannot say the economy will grow 7% per annum -- I don't think people will buy that," says economist Mario Mesquita of ABN Amro Inc.
