MOSCOW, March 2â€” Three Jews have been questioned in the case of Viktor Brailovsky, a Jewish activist who was arrested and jailed in November, his wife, Irina, said today.  The three - Vladimir Prestin, Ilya Essos and Leonid Shabashov, all of whom have been waiting for permission to emigrate - were asked whether they knew Mr. Brailovsky and had read an underground journal, Jews in the U.S.S.R., of which he had been editor, Mrs. Brailovsky said. The journal ceased publication, under official pressure, in 1979.  Before being taken to Butyrskaya Prison on Nov. 13, Mr. Brailovsky told his wife that, in preliminary questioning, he had been charged with disseminating slander against the state, an offense punishable by up to three years in prison.  Mrs. Brailovsky said the three who had been questioned had given evasive answers; yet the investigators took the answers down. Five others called in for questioning ignored the summons and have not been troubled further.  ''This leads us to the impression that the summons and the questioning were a mere formality, to enable the investigators to show their superiors that the pretrial examination is still continuing,'' Mrs. Brailovsky said.  The three were questioned three weeks ago, she said, at the end of the third month of her husband's detention. To detain him any further, she said, the investigators, under Soviet law, had to obtain the approval of the chief prosecutor of the Russian Republic, one of the Soviet Union's 15 states. After the sixth month, the approval of the chief prosecutor of the Soviet Union would be required.  ''I think the investigators have failed to turn up any substantive evidence against my husband,'' Mrs. Brailovsky said. ''They don't know what to do and are just stringing the case out. But they had to have something on paper to support their request for another extension.''
