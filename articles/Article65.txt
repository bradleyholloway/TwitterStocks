WASHINGTON, May 16â€” President Reagan will remain in the White House during the Democratic National Convention in July instead of ''getting into a campaign mode,'' a top aide said today.  James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview that Mr. Reagan is expected to begin his campaign with a speech on Labor Day, the traditional starting day in Presidential election years.  Mr. Baker predicted that ''This will be the year for a nip-and-tuck election.''
