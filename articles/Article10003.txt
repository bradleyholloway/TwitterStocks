 Book Excerpt: Post-Bubble, Property Still Pays   By Crook, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2007  Don't waste your money. You can learn a lot more driving around with someone like Jack Friedman, a philosopher-musician-landlord in Nashville. He'll take you around to his properties in his '99 Ford Escort with all his tools -- wrenches, pliers, hammers, whatever it takes -- in the back seat. And he will tell you what 20 years of investing has taught him, all for the price of the barbeque platter at Corky's.  "I am in most ways an anomaly," he avers. "I borrowed relatively little. I was lucky enough to find a few below-market buys, and I do 95% of my own work. In short, I've never done one of the sexy ways people envision doing real estate."  -- Sellers: It's quite common to have a seller "take back" 5% or 10% of the purchase price and carry it as a second mortgage for a few years. You can expect fairly low borrowing costs and few hassles, but the seller likely will insist on a higher price if he agrees to lend you money. Investing truism: "His price, your terms; your price, his terms."
