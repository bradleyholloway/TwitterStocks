 Bonds Rally With New Issues; Big Foreign Interest Marks First Leg Of U.S. Refunding   By Blumberg, Deborah Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  "It's really going to be the refunding that's the main theme" this week, said Mr. [Jason Evans]. "The big question will be whether the wake of supply in the next two days keeps the market in check. That, really, is the million-dollar question."  Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & Company, said that given "the distortions" present in results for the three-year note auction -- based on the possible elimination of the note in August -- "it would be a risky gambit to assume that [yesterday's] results signal an end to the two-month selloff in the bond market."
