SALISBURY, Zimbabweâ€” ''If you want to know how it's going here,'' a banker said, ''look at maize.'' Black politicians and white farmers made the same suggestion. Corn, as Americans call it, is as good a clue as any to what has happened in Zimbabwe since it became independent last April under black political control.  The corn crop last year was 680,000 tons. When it is harvested this April and May, the Ministry of Agriculture expects 1.5 million tons - and some experts think the figure will be over 2 million.  That staggering increase is a result of the new Government's policy, helped by good weather. It is a dramatic demonstration of Zimbabwe's economic resources and its potential as a food source for hungry neighbors. But look deeper and the huge corn crop also demonstrates some of this country's problems.  The Government action that made the difference was a decision, soon after independence, to raise the price paid to farmers for corn from $136 a ton to $192. Denis Norman, the Minister of Agriculture and one of two whites in the 26-member Cabinet, urged the increase to stimulate local production of what is the basic food source here.  ''It wasn't easy,'' Mr. Norman said the other day, ''but I persuaded my colleagues in the Cabinet.'' The country's 5,000 white commercial farmers responded by raising their acreage planted in corn 50 percent. ''And we know there has been a significant increase in the tribal area, too,'' Mr. Norman said.  Zimbabwe will need only about 700,000 tons to make the staple mealie-meal, as cornmeal is known, for domestic consumption. The rest will be available for export. That is where the potential and the problems both come in.  ''East, north and west of us they're all short of grain,'' Mr. Norman said. ''My guess is that they'd rather buy from us than from South Africa. But our railway system is mainly single-track, we are short of rail cars, road transport is limited. And to get to a port we have to use the South African or Mozambique railways, which have limited capacity.''  Subsidy is another problem. A Government board buys the corn from the farmers - and then sells it to millers for $50 a ton less. Mr. Norman, concerned about the burden on the budget, wants to start raising the price to millers. He has an ally in the Finance Minister, Enos Nkala, who is known for his fiery political speeches but is a fiscal conservative. But others worry about public resentment of higher meal prices.  The corn bonanza touches another sensitive question: whether the Government does too much for the 5,000 white commercial farmers and not enough for the 650,000 African peasant farmers. They and their families live in the overcrowded Tribal Trust Lands, where much of the soil is depleted.  ''I think there are large areas of the T.T.L.'s that can be made more productive,'' Mr. Norman said. ''But that's the second step. The first is to reduce the pressure by resettling people on vacant commercial farmland.''  A quarter of the white-owned land now lies fallow. But the Government is bound by the independence settlement to pay hard currency for that land, and it does not have the money. That was the main purpose of the $1 to $1.5 billion aid fund for Zimbabwe suggested by Henry Kissinger in 1976.  People of all kinds here speak resentfully of the West's failure to come up with that fund. The United States has so far provided about $50 million in aid. Britain has promised around $180 million over the next few years.  The Agriculture Ministry is giving some immediate help to the peasant farmers. It has started making crop loans to them for the first time, 23,000 this year. It is building collection points in the tribal areas so families can sell their surplus corn and cotton. And there are plans for irrigation of large new areas.  ''If we can do what we did with maize,'' Mr. Norman said, ''we can do it with other crops. We have the land, we have the water, we have the people. All we lack is the capital. I get excited when I think of the potential.  ''But you have to bring the peasant sector up,'' he said, ''not the commercial down. If the white farmers left, the economic fabric would fall apart. They grow 80 percent of our food, and 1.3 million people live on those farms.''  Denis Norman came here to farm in 1953 from a farm in the Cotswolds in England, and he still has an English country accent. He had never held political office before Robert Mugabe put him in the first Zimbabwe Government. The amazing thing, listening to him, is the matter-of-fact way this burly white farmer talks about life under the majority rule that whites here resisted for so long.  ''Of course I am new to politics,'' he said, ''but I don't find any problems. It's a good country, I want to keep it that way, and I believe it's going to work.''
