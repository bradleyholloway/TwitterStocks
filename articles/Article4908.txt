 Boston Is Integrating Public Housing --- U.S. Pressure Affects A Project in "Southie"   By By Joseph Pereira, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1988  In November 1978, Faith Evans, a 20-year-old liberal arts student attending Brandeis University, moved into a housing project in South Boston. She was threatened, harassed and jeered by other residents. By May she was out, unable to bear the abuse.  Yesterday, under pressure from the federal government, Boston again moved black families into that public housing development nestled in the predominantly Irish, working-class neighborhood. How they are accepted is being viewed as a litmus test of how much Boston has, or hasn't, changed. "Southie" -- as South Boston is called -- "is a symbolic benchmark for Boston," says the Rev. Charles Stith, a local black Methodist minister.  Until now, however, the Mary Ellen McCormack and other projects in South Boston have been largely segregated. After reviewing the placement of minorities in Boston's 69 housing projects from 1983 to 1985, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development charged the Boston Housing Authority with racial discrimination. HUD says housing officials bypassed about 500 minority families to keep certain housing projects, in effect, white preserves. Failure to ensure fair housing could deprive Boston of $75 million in annual federal aid, the agency threatened. BHA itself is under pressure. Unhappy with its plan to integrate the projects, it and the city have been sued by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and two black applicants still seeking public housing.
