 Bond Surprise: Say Hi to Fannie and Freddie; Mortgage Titans' Debt Makes Up Huge Part of Portfolios Bearing No Hint in the Funds' Names   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 2003  It is well known that mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac help finance home purchases and issue securities that are held in thousands of mutual funds and other investment portfolios. But what many investors don't know is that Fannie and Freddie debt often constitute the vast majority of bond mutual-fund portfolios that give no hint of such holdings in their fund names. Instead, funds loaded with Freddie or Fannie debt frequently have secure-sounding words such as "government" or "federal" as part of their formal names.  More than 80 bond funds invested at least half their assets in Fannie and Freddie debt, Morningstar says, and 74 of those used the words "government" or "federal" in their names. The Lord Abbett Limited Duration U.S. Government Securities Fund, for example, had about 85% of its assets in Fannie and Freddie debt or mortgage-backed debt guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie.  "Clearly, they're not on par with Treasurys," but "there is an implicit guarantee" in Fannie and Freddie debt, says Tony Coffey, portfolio manager of the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund, which has 81% of its assets in Fannie or Freddie- related debt. The manager doesn't anticipate any change in the companies' government-sponsored status, but says that down the road, "if Congress decides to change that, then we'll have to look at the issue."
