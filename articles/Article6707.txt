 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2007  In a 2004 paper, Georgia State University business professor Vikas Agarwal and London Business School professor Narayan Naik analyzed the returns for a variety of stock hedge funds and found that, in essence, the funds were making bets against volatility, too. "If you look at all these hedge-fund strategies, they look similar to somebody selling out-of-the-money put options," says Mr. Agarwal.  Better known as the VIX, the index is based on prices for S&P 500 put and call options, which let investors buy and sell the S&P 500 at prearranged prices. When stocks get more volatile, options become more valuable, driving the VIX higher. Implied volatility for corporate bonds, currencies and emerging-market debt has also been rising. It is a far cry from January, when the VIX hit its lowest level since 1993 and implied volatility in other markets was similarly low.
