 House of the Week: Rushmore   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2001  Due Diligence: Financier and attorney Charles E. Rushmore, for whom Mount Rushmore is named, built this 25-room, Spanish Colonial-style manor in 1908. In 1986, theatrical director Joumana Rizk and her brother, Khalil, an Asian art dealer, paid $3.5 million for this Hudson Valley estate. At the time, it encompassed about 400 acres -- most of the property has since been subdivided. In 1992, Ms. Rizk founded the Rushmore Festival, an annual arts festival held on the estate's grounds. Now, she says, she can no longer get the funding necessary to keep the festival going, and is spending less and less time at the property.
