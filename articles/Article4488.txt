 Soviet Industry Grows Its Own Potatoes   By By Vladimir Kontorovich and Vladimir Shlapentokh, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 1985  The most consistent pessimists on the prospects for the Soviet economy are to be found not in the West, but among many Soviet managers and economists themselves. They gloomily attribute economic stagnation to the vested interests of the bureaucracy, which resists any serious organizational change and seems itself impossible to dislodge. However, dynamic forces in the "informal economy" may yet at least stem the decline.  This informal economy must be distinguished both from the official economy, where everything is done in accordance with the law, and from the "second economy," the underground sector in which participants are absorbed in personal enrichment. The informal economy is the sphere of economic activity in which Soviet managers seek to achieve official, legal goals -- above all, the fulfillment of the plan -- through illegal means.  The informal Soviet economy is, to some degree, reminiscent of the European absolute monarchies of several hundred years ago. The then-emerging capitalist class employed thousands of tricks to combat the countless royal rules that blocked economic growth. Today, Soviet managers similarly seek to outsmart the authorities in order to increase production and implement technological innovations. Some of the most significant procedures are those used to cope with procurement problems, the devices used to prevent production stoppages resulting from the caprices of numerous suppliers.
