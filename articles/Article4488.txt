 Quagmire's End Opens Doors for Moscow --- Afghanistan Withdrawal Aids Soviet Diplomatic Offensive   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1989  As it becomes increasingly certain that he will fulfill his pledge to withdraw all Soviet troops from Afghanistan by next Wednesday, a humiliating military defeat is significantly enhancing his own credibility around the world. Ending the nine-year occupation of Afghanistan clears the way for the kind of diplomatic maneuvers Mr. Gorbachev excels at and that could reap multiple benefits for Moscow.  The retreat from Afghanistan is the biggest step yet in Mr. Gorbachev's liquidation of the flawed interventionist policy he inherited from the Brezhnev era. So far, his words about disengaging from regional conflicts have been matched by initial moves in southern Africa and southeast Asia -- though there hasn't been any action in Central America. But in Afghanistan, by convincingly closing out an old account, the Soviet leader is eliminating the most egregious symbol of Soviet aggression.  "Of all the things that have happened in international relations (under Mr. Gorbachev) that have affected perceptions of the Soviet Union, the Afghanistan withdrawal is the watershed event," says Arnold Horelick, director of the Rand Corp.'s Center for the Study of Soviet International Behavior.
