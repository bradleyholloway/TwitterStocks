 Illinois Judge To Rule Quickly On Philip Morris   By By Gordon Fairclough, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2003  The plaintiffs allege that Philip Morris misled them about the dangers of so-called light cigarettes. They are seeking more than $7 billion in compensatory damages, their estimate of the money spent by Illinois smokers on Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights from 1971 to last year. The plaintiffs, representing an estimated 1.1 million Illinois smokers, are also seeking a punitive award.  The Illinois legislature is considering a bill, backed by Philip Morris, a unit of Altria Group Inc., that would put a $25 million limit on the size of any bond the company would have to post to appeal an adverse verdict. Under current law, losing defendants must post a bond equal to the size of the entire judgment.
