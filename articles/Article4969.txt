 Market Edges Up as Industrial Stocks Rebound, Insurance Issues Rise Again   By By Sonja Steptoe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1989  The Nasdaq Composite Index grew 0.72 to 385.31. The index got a lift from its largest nonfinancial issues, which had dragged it down recently. The Nasdaq 100 Index of those stocks grew 1.06 to 355.19. Largely on the strength of the insurance group, which posted its fifth consecutive advance, the index of the largest financial issues was up 0.25 to 369.60. The Nasdaq Insurance Index gained 1.97 to 440.35, its highest level in almost a year.  Institutional trading accounted for much of the volume in OTC stocks, traders said. "It was a big day of buying and selling," said Robert O'Toole Sr., manager of institutional OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. "That made it a good, fun trading day." Mr. O'Toole said his department handled a big chunk of the 1.9 million shares of Wheelabrator Group that changed hands. The stock, which closed at 8, up 1/4, was the day's second-most-active issue.  Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody, said most of the institutional trading he saw was in bigger stocks that traditionally grab the institutions' attention. But he also noticed "decent volume" in some stocks that normally aren't active, such as the Class A shares of children's apparel maker Oshkosh B'Gosh. Almost 318,000 of the shares were traded, more than five times the stock's average daily volume. Oshkosh B'Gosh closed down 1/8 to 23 1/4.
