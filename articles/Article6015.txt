 Tastings: Warm Up, Chill Out --- We Experiment to Determine The Right Temperature; A `Time Out' for Reds   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 2001  All that said, readers ask us all the time about the best temperatures for serving wines, so we decided to conduct a little experiment. The results in a moment, but first, let's say this: For our taste, most red wines are served too warm and most white wines are served too cold, especially at restaurants. Red wines that are too warm become too diffuse, their tastes all over the map, and their alcohol often becomes far too apparent. White wines that are too cold are hard to even taste, their fruit obscured by mind-numbing chilling (although, of course, perhaps inexpensive, drink-by-the-pool, summer whites can never be cold enough).  We need to mention exceptions yet again. In our most recent tasting of the great first-growths of Bordeaux, we drank all the wines directly out of our little wine cooler, which keeps bottles at 55 to 57 degrees. The temperature was perfect, giving extra richness and stature to these young, tannic wines. But later, we opened a great California Cabernet, Diamond Creek from 1990, from the wine cooler and found it needed to warm up before it really showed its stuff. And during a recent tasting of Amarone, Italy's remarkable, raisiny red wine, we found that they tasted best as they warmed up toward true room temperature.  We prefer Champagne well-chilled and we prefer bigger, richer whites such as Chardonnay slightly warmer than lighter whites. In fact, we find that some California Chardonnays are simply stunning at room temperature, which is warmer than cellar temperature. We prefer Beaujolais fairly well-chilled, along with most dessert wines. We prefer older red wines slightly warmer than younger red wines, which seem to need more of a chill to calm them down (think of them as rambunctious children who can benefit from a time out).
