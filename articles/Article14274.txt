 A.H. Robins to Sell Unit That Operates Two Radio Stations   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1986  RICHMOND, Va. -- A.H. Robins Co., facing increasing criticism from creditors' lawyers, said it plans to sell its unprofitable Robins Communications Inc. unit.  Several attorneys for creditors in Robins's bankruptcy-law proceedings say that the unit isn't related to the company's health-care products operations and that Robins shouldn't subsidize it. The lawyers also have objected to loans that Robins has made to the unit, without court approval.
