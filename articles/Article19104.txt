 Core Business: Apple Growers Set to Launch New Ad Campaign   By By Janet I. Tu, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1998  That might be a hard sell in the nation's caffeine capital, but Washington apple growers are staking some $60 million on the notion that snack-happy Americans will buy into the idea of the state's trademark fruit as an afternoon bracer.  The Wenatchee-based Washington Apple Commission, with some 4,000 members, will launch a new national ad campaign in February in a bid to put the bite back into domestic apple sales, which have been flat for the past 10 years.  The print and electronic ads won't focus solely on the virtues of crunchiness, as earlier promotional efforts did. Instead, the ads, produced by the Seattle office of New York-based advertising firm McCann Erickson Worldwide, will play to the swelling national appetite. "Americans are generally eating ... three meals and a snack," says Tom Swearingen, the apple group's ad director. "And they're looking for low-calorie, high-fiber snacks." So, he says, the ads will position apples "as the ideal fourth meal, the ideal pick-me-up."
