 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Theater -- View: The Ultimate Stage Mother   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2006  "Hamlet" and "Merry Wives" are currently being performed in repertory with "Enchanted April" and a double bill of two new one- woman plays, "Martha Mitchell Calling" and "No Background Music." If you come early enough on Saturday or Sunday, you can catch three shows in one day. I suspect I would have found that a bit much, but seeing "Hamlet" and "Merry Wives" in one fell swoop -- especially in productions like these -- is an experience I can recommend unreservedly.  Yes, the high concept of Ms. [Eleanor Holdridge]'s "Hamlet" is both trendy and illogical. (If the "action" takes place in the dying Hamlet's mind, how does he know what was happening when he was offstage -- and why doesn't the play end when he dies?) Yes, the costumes are...well, weird. And none of it matters in the least, for this "Hamlet" is an incisive, fast-moving production full of fresh line readings and directorial touches that light up Shakespeare's lines like fireworks in the summer night. Here's one of my favorites: When Polonius reels off the first-act speech in which he advises Laertes, among other things, to "neither a borrower nor a lender be," he whips out a clipboard and officiously ticks off each cliche, just like the career bureaucrat he is.
