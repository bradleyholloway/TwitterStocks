 PURSUITS; Food & Drink -- How's Your Drink? The Basques' Beverage   By Felten, Eric, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2007  The drink takes its name from the brand of the central ingredient, Amer Picon. "Amer" is the French word for "bitter." Gaston Picon concocted his own aperitif of bitter orange peel, herbs and alcohol as a tonic, and started bottling it commercially in 1830. But Amer Picon hadn't been doing boffo business in the States of late, and the brand abandoned the New World. Fortunately, there is a worthy substitute, Torani Amer, now the staple for Picon Punches.  The Star's bartender, Miguel Leonis, puts a stemmed goblet on the bar and fills it with ice. After putting in a healthy dash of grenadine, he fills the glass with Torani Amer, leaving just enough room on top for a float of brandy. He takes a twist of lemon and rubs it around the rim of the glass before tossing it in. "Some people add club soda to water it down a little," says Mr. Leonis. "But we don't. This is the real deal." The result is a delicious cocktail with a subtle orange flavor that isn't so much bittersweet as perfectly balanced between bitter and sweet.  The real deal is still possible because, shortly after Prohibition, R. Torre & Co., a California firm making flavored syrups and liqueurs, came up with its own version of Amer Picon to sell to the many Basque restaurants in San Francisco. Torani Amer is now the only liquor marketed by the company, which focuses instead on its Torani syrups for baking and flavoring coffees. Amer isn't a big business line, but it is a steady one -- especially since Amer Picon took a powder. Ask for Amer Picon at your local liquor store, and you're almost sure to come up emptyhanded -- unless you're lucky enough to find a dusty old bottle languishing on a back shelf. Unfortunately, ask for Torani Amer and you will likely be just as frustrated.
