 Bank Board Seeks To Limit Lending By Certain S&Ls   By By Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1985  The Federal Home Loan Bank Board asked Congress to restrict the activities of state-chartered thrifts covered by federal deposit insurance, in an effort to limit the institutions principally to lending for home mortgages.  The Bank Board proposal, if passed by Congress, would force some state-chartered thrifts to phase out portions of their business, including commercial lending, real estate development and insurance activities. The proposal also would result in an impingement on states' rights, industry representatives and congressional aides said.  The Bank Board asked Congress to bring the powers of the state-chartered thrifts in line with those for federally chartered S&Ls and multiple S&L holding companies. "Basically, these institutions are required to engage mostly in making home mortgages, and the legislation would reassert this housing focus on the state-chartered thrifts," explained one Bank Board official.
