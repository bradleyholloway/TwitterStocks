 Affordable Senior Housing: a Waiting Game   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  To be eligible for these programs, individuals or couples have to fall below certain income limits, which vary by region and household size. People generally need to have income that is less than 50% of the area median. (Income includes Social Security, wages and interest income.) For specific figures: From the HUD seniors page, click on "Find affordable rents" and then, in the "More from HUD" box, click on "income limit."  "We have two-year waiting lists at a lot of the properties," says Charles Gould, president of Volunteers of America, which operates over 150 affordable-housing communities. "We open [the communities] up and they're full in a matter of weeks because there is such a need for affordable housing."  Often they make simple changes such as putting in brighter lights, installing grab bars in bathrooms or adding railings to a home's front steps so seniors have something to lean on while getting out their keys. Widening doorways to accommodate a wheelchair is common. "Sometimes we'll bring a bathroom from upstairs to the downstairs," says Bishop Sheen's Ms. [Allynn Smith].
