 Handyman Etiquette: Stay Calm, Avert Eyes   By Bounds, Gwendolyn, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2005  "You have to be polite but firm," is Mr. [Steve Cohen]'s guidance. "You don't say, 'You are a messy housekeeper,' but you do say, 'I can't work here until this is cleaned out,' " he notes.  Individual franchise owners often develop their own measures to judge tech people's skills. Mr. [Brendan Julian]'s boss, Gina Chapman, says she always puts job candidates on the spot during interviews by abruptly handing them a pen and asking them to sell it to her. The point: to see how they will react on their feet. "We had a customer answer the door naked," she says. Fortunately, her tech met the challenge gracefully, she says, and quipped: "Now, I don't know what kind of service you think you called . . ."  For his part, Handyman Matters' Mr. [Andy Bell] coaches techs to carry dog biscuits and to learn the animal's name (which is put into the company's computer database). That guidance doesn't suffice at all times, though: "Golden retrievers are nice, but they will carry off our tools or wag their tails in wet drywall," Mr. Bell says.
