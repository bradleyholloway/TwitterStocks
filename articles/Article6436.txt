 Another Gain For Tech Stocks Raises Hopes Among Investors   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2001  Some traders said the tech-stock advances were spurred by positive comments about semiconductor stocks from Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jonathan Joseph. But they were divided on whether these gains are going to prove enduring, or shrivel as have all previous rallies since March of last year. What really is behind the gains, a number of traders said, is simply that many professional investors have decided that stocks are due for a rebound after their thudding losses, and have decided, for a while at least, to do some bottom-fishing.  The latest news "wasn't enough to sustain a rally," said Phil Marber, head of trading at Cantor Fitzgerald. That, he said, helps explain the decline in the Dow industrials and the S&P 500. "I think the worst is over. But to sustain the kind of upmove we have had, you need some good news now," he added.  Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.83%, or 1.14 points, to 138.80.
