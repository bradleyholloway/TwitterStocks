 Volvo Acts in No Hurry to Make a Deal --- Auto Maker Insists Size Isn't the Same as Profitability   By By Almar Latour, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1999  Why the debutante act? Propelled by a need to reduce production overcapacity, the car industry is rapidly consolidating. And Volvo makes an attractive takeover target. Volvo is one of the most profitable automotive producers in the world, with a well-established brand name and a reputation for producing safe cars. Its truck and bus divisions -- which each generate far larger revenues than its car division -- are leading players. And Volvo's ownership structure is broad, making a takeover easier for prospective buyers.  But a merger isn't a necessity for Volvo now, although the company has said a deal is always in the realm of possibilities. "Volvo is not in a hurry to do something," says Lars Soederfjell, analyst with Myrberg Securities in Stockholm. "The company has a nice profitability, and it's not really suffering."  Volvo's top managers know bigger isn't always better. The company lived through a painful failed merger attempt with Renault SA of France in late 1993. A bloated conglomerate of unrelated businesses -- from food processing to pharmaceuticals -- the company licked its wounds and started divesting itself of holdings, focusing strictly on its automotive businesses. Because of that, the company's 1997 net financial assets increased 59% to 19.1 billion kronor ($2.45 billion) from 12 billion kronor a year earlier -- which left plenty of cash for acquisitions. Last year, for example, Volvo snatched up Samsung Excavators of South Korea, still leaving net financial assets at an estimated 13 billion kronor for the first nine months of last year.
