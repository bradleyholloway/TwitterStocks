 Cross Country: Arkansas Underdog   By Paul Greenberg and Kane Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  Hillary Clinton's in the race, right? Officially now, we mean. She's said to have been a first lady of this state way back when. Also, former NATO commander Wesley Clark, now of Little Rock, Ark., ran for president last time out and, far as we know, hasn't ruled out a reprise in '08.  The Huck's tendency to go into vendetta mode violates the first rule of smart politics and public discourse in general: Never get into a fight with someone who's not as well known as you are. It bumps up their status and lowers yours. Mr. [Mike Huckabee] needs to learn to cut down the big trees, not mess with the little saplings. Besides being unworthy of him personally, it wastes all his high-powered rhetoric. If this candidate isn't more careful, a nickname like Gov. [Petty] may stick to him the way Slick Willie did to another presidential hopeful from Arkansas.  Mike Huckabee's campaign will be history soon, too, unless he learns to cool it. Which may not be possible for the Huck, given his showman's personality and rhetorical impulses. The man is a Baptist preacher and former radio broadcaster who may secretly yearn to be a stand-up comic. He can't pass up an opportunity to say something that sounds clever at the time, but then comes back to haunt him on Tim Russert's show.
