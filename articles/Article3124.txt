 Schwab Announces Further Cost Cuts as Volume Falls   By By Susanne Craig and Ken Brown, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2003  Another bright spot for Schwab is its stock-picking effort. In its first six months of recommending stocks to investors, Schwab's top picks beat the market by about eight percentage points. Schwab is now angling to be included in stock-picking contests with other big brokerages. But one reason Schwab remains popular with investors is that the company pitches itself as an honest alternative to the allegedly questionable practices of some Wall Street firms. A recent ad campaign featured brokers of a generic Wall Street firm being pushed to sell a lousy stock to clients. "Let's put some lipstick on this pig!" a character says.  [Schwab]'s push into advice has brought it closer to Wall Street. Last month, for example, Schwab's U.S. Trust unit hired Thomas Galvin, the former strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, to oversee part of its money-management operation. While Schwab has criticized Wall Street for pushing investors to buy stocks, Mr. Galvin was among the bull market's biggest bulls, predicting the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would end 2000 at 1680 and 2001 at 1600. The index now stands at 831.90.  In announcing more cost cutting, Schwab yesterday said it plans to reduce quarterly expenses by about $40 million until the market improves, but added that it doesn't plan any more large-scale layoffs. One move raised eyebrows: Schwab, which always has touted the benefits of tax-deferred retirement plans, said it would stop its generous match for employee contributions to its 401(k) retirement plan.
