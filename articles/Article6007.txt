 Apocalypse Now: Stocking Up to Survive the Worst   By By Barbara Carton, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2001  David Sheets, owner of Emergency Essentials, an Orem, Utah, purveyor of preparedness items, says a 72-hour kit should contain a minimum of a gallon of water per person per day. It should also contain high-calorie food you don't have to cook or refrigerate, like trail mix, beef jerky, dried fruit, peanut butter and crackers. Freeze-dried meals from camping stores are a more expensive option.  For the first month, Mr. Sheets recommends one 55-gallon drum of water per person -- drums because they are more easily stored in most basements than endless jugs of water. Thereafter, he suggests a portable hand-pump and filter, such as the $159 Katadyn-brand Combi Filter, widely available on the Web, which will allow you to draw a quart per minute from rivers or lakes, and to filter out bacteria, fungi, parasites and chemicals.  For those who don't want to go to the trouble of stockpiling a year's worth of their own food, lots of survival stores sell prepackaged dry food. Mr. Sheets's "premium" selection contains 12 cases of dried food, packaged in gallon-size cans, with dried vegetables, fruits, grains and more, at $1,099 per person. The "traditional" package, at $839 per person, contains basics, including powdered eggs, milk and margarine, also in the premium item.
