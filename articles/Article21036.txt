 Year-End Review of Markets and Finance: Stocks Climb for the Fifth Straight Year --- Oil Price Drop Looms Large For Big Losers, Winners as Well   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1987  The most obvious impact of the energy woes came in the losers' column, where four of the 10 companies with the biggest declines in percentage terms -- Extex Energy Development Ltd., Ensource Inc., Kaneb Sevices Inc. and Tidewater Inc. -- were oil and gas companies.  Cheaper oil eased inflationary expectations, in turn lowering interest rates and boosting price/earnings multiples for all stocks. At the same time, lower gasoline prices and interest rates put more money in consumers' pockets, which helped a broad swath of consumer-related stocks.  Four of the 10 biggest gainers on the Big Board-Reebok International Ltd., Circuit City Stores Inc., Roper Corp. and Gap Inc. -- sell consumer goods. Reebok sells trendy sneakers, Circuit City is an electronics retailer, Roper sells appliances and tools, and Gap stores sell clothing. A fifth winner, Patten Corp., sells rustic home sites to individuals.
