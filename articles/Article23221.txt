 EDS Wins Big U.K. Contract   By McWilliams, Gary, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2005  EDS Chairman Michael H. Jordan said the experience with the U.S. Navy contract helped EDS craft its bid for the British military and guided its negotiations. "We've gone to school on the mistakes we've made on the Navy."  In recent years, Computer Sciences has gained share in the commercial outsourcing market on the back of EDS's woes. "We are naturally disappointed," a CSC spokesman said. He declined to comment on whether it would bid on later phases or appeal the initial award, saying CSC hasn't yet been briefed by the U.K.  Cindy Shaw, a computer-services analyst at brokers Moors & Cabot Capital Markets, estimated first-year cost of the project would reduce EDS's earnings by between 15 cents and 30 cents a share this year but would contribute 60 cents a share over the life of the deal. "This was a big surprise and a vote of confidence in EDS's ability to execute" large deals, Ms. Shaw said.
