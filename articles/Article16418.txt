 Inheriting IRAs: Beware   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 4, 2004  A 46-year-old man inherited an IRA valued at $150,000 from his mother, a widow, who died at age 70 1/2. The son's stockbroker told him simply to roll the money into a "beneficial IRA" (the formal name for taking an inherited IRA and setting up a new one) where it would continue to grow tax-deferred. ("You don't want to take this money out; it's an IRA," the broker told the son.) Nearly two years later, the son learned his mistake.  In another case, a woman, age 53, inherited an IRA valued at $50,000 from her 50-year-old sister. A banker told the woman that if she took the money and opened a beneficial IRA she wouldn't have to take any distributions -- or pay any taxes -- for five years. Assuming that the money earned 5%, she would have $63,814 in the new IRA at the end of the five years. At that point, she would have to withdraw all the money and pay the necessary taxes.
