 Spyware Is Easy to Get, Difficult to Remove, Increasingly Malicious   By Gomes, Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2004  Then, predictably, it happened to me. I had done nothing I shouldn't have online, but one day I noticed that when I searched for something in Yahoo, a new browser screen popped up, showing me links from advertisers connected with the spyware. Worse, the spyware program often crashed, causing Windows to constantly display error messages about going down. And worse still, I didn't know how to get rid of it. I ran Ad-Aware, a popular antispyware program, but to no avail.  This new breed of spyware is a fusion of all the Web's black arts, combining the tricks of virus writers and spammers. In some cases, you don't even need to do anything to become infected, save visit a spyware-dispensing Web site. Other times, you might click "No" inside some pop-up screen making you some dubious offer, thus opening the door to scumware, which doesn't take No for an answer.  The situation isn't entirely bleak. The most egregious form of spyware -- the "drive-by downloads" you get by simply visiting a Web page -- most commonly rely on flaws in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. You are usually protected if you keep the security patches for your Windows PC up to date via the Windows Update section of the Tools menu in Internet Explorer. These flaws are found all the time, so you need to do this every week or so.
