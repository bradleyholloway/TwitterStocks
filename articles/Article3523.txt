 Dell Boosts Estimates for Profit and Sales   By By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  Still, Dell's profit forecast calls for earnings to slip 9% from the year-earlier fourth quarter on lower revenue. A year earlier, Dell earned $508 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $8.67 billion.  In the home-PC business, "Dell is taking a little bit of business from everyone," said Kumar Cidambi, a PC analyst at Raymond James & Associates. Mr. Cidambi estimates Dell's home-PC sales contributed $1.7 billion, or 21% of the fourth quarter's total sales, up from about 15% of revenue in the past several quarters.  Benefiting from a price war it began more than a year ago, Dell is gaining market share during a period of lackluster sales. According to estimates by industry researchers, Dell's share of world-wide shipments rose 2.5 percentage points to 14.2% during the final quarter of 2001. In contrast, second-ranked Compaq's market share fell 1.7 percentage points, to 11.2%, and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s was unchanged at 8%.
