 Yahoo Hopes to Make Network Flop a Net Hit   By Kevin J. Delaney and Brooks Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  Mr. [Lloyd Braun] had earlier backed "The Runner" while chairman of Walt Disney Co.'s ABC Entertainment Television Group. ABC poured millions of dollars into developing the series starting in 2000 and then killed it because of concerns about cost, logistics and whether it could draw viewers. Reality TV mogul Mark Burnett and LivePlanet, a production company co-founded by actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which originated the concept, have been developing "The Runner" for Yahoo for about six months, say the people familiar with the matter.  "The Runner" represents the sort of video-intensive, Web-based narrative projects some major players in the TV and Internet industries are cooking up as consumers spend more time online. The production company of Mr. Burnett, who has been responsible for such hits as "Survivor" and "The Apprentice," is working on other unannounced multimedia Internet projects, including one with Time Warner Inc.'s America Online unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. "This is the tip of the iceberg," the person says.  Mr. Braun began resuscitation efforts on "The Runner" shortly after he arrived at Yahoo in November 2004, say people familiar with the matter. Six months ago, Yahoo paid to option the concept and recruited Mr. Burnett, they say. Since then, the involved parties have been working on how to adapt "The Runner" to the Web and integrate it with Yahoo's existing offerings, such as instant messaging, online maps and search. They believe they have worked out the biggest logistical and insurance issues. One of the fixes is that the fugitive will not be a contestant but instead will be played by an actor, says one of the people familiar with the matter. Officials for Mr. Burnett and LivePlanet declined to comment.
