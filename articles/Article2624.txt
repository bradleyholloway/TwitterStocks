 Herbalife's Hughes Plans to Take Firm Private in Buyout   By By Frederic M. Biddle, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  Herbalife said Mr. (Mark) Hughes has agreed to tender for the 46% of Class A Herbalife shares and 42% of nonvoting Class B shares he doesn't already own or control for $17 a share. The offer represents a premium of 42% to yesterday's closing price for the Class A shares and 86% to the Class B shares, the company said.  The acquisition would be highly leveraged. It calls for the company to raise $440 million in senior bank debt and high-yield debt and use a further $60 million of its own cash to finance the tender offer. Herbalife would make loans totaling $214 million to two entities controlled by Mr. Hughes as part of the transaction.
