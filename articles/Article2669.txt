 Iowa Farm Aid Helped Rich Most, Study Says   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2000  Iowa's farm owners and operators collected slightly more than $2 billion in farm subsidies between 1996 and 1998, analysts for the Environmental Working Group report. Half of that money went to just 12% of the subsidy recipients -- mostly farm partnerships and corporations -- while 51% of the state's farmers made do with less than $6,000 each during the first three years of the Freedom to Farm subsidy program.  The findings have major political implications for the presidential candidates vying for votes in the Iowa caucuses, and for farm-policy makers in Congress and the [President] Clinton administration. For one thing, the study confirms a widely held belief that current farm law favors big farm operators and absentee landowners over the family farmers. The study doesn't identify the big aid recipients.  The study is certain to bolster the hand of farm-state Democrats and farm lobbyists who want to overhaul the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, primarily because it doesn't protect farmers well enough against the farm sector's inevitable down cycles. The law was to have weaned farmers from most traditional subsidies during a seven-year transition to free-market agriculture by guaranteeing them fixed payments and letting them plant whatever they wanted. But when commodity prices dropped, Congress approved two farm bailouts: $6 billion in 1998 and $8.9 billion last fall.
