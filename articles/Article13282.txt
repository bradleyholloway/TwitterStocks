 Hot Topic: The Devil in Darfur   The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2006  At last, the news about Darfur appears to be good. In Abuja, Nigeria yesterday, the government of Khartoum and the largest of the Darfuri rebel factions, the Sudan Liberation Army, agreed to a peace deal. Terms include disarming the Arab Janjaweed militia, a proxy force through which Khartoum has killed 200,000 Darfuris and sent another two million into exile. The deal also calls for compensating refugees, transferring some of the government's oil wealth to the region and enlisting thousands of Darfuri rebels into the regular Sudanese Army.  Mr. [Omar Bashir] has established a similar pattern in Darfur, a war which began as Khartoum's battles against the south were ending. In April 2004, his government signed the Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement with rebel groups in N'Djamena, Chad. But Khartoum continued to kill Darfuris via the Janjaweed. In November, Mr. Bashir agreed to grant unrestricted access to humanitarian aid groups.  Put simply, Sudan's track record inspires no confidence that it will abide by the agreement it has now signed. Unlike the 2005 deal with [John Garang], Khartoum isn't under any serious military pressure from the rebels, nor is there any looming threat of external military intervention. It may serve Mr. Bashir's purposes to co-opt the main rebel faction, not least as a way of breaking the back of the movement and destroying the rebels who remain. That doesn't bode well for ordinary Darfuris, whose most realistic hope of salvation is their ability to mount an effective self-defense.
