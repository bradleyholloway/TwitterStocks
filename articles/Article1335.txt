 Letters to the Editor: Harried Subway Riders Beg to Differ   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1990  For many of us who are struggling with the challenge of making New York City and this region a more livable place despite its density and congestion, it's "nice" to be lectured to by someone who combines the perspectives of Ames, Iowa, and New York network-news suites with a dash of Russian imperial history. He rightly condemns our society's refusal to address the underlying causes of homelessness, but implies that subway begging is "saving the lives" and enshrining the freedom of homeless people.  Agencies such as the Transit Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey understand that attracting as many travelers as possible to subways and other transit services is vital to the region's economic and environmental health. We compete for those customers with individual auto use and other private-transportation options, and cannot succeed if transit patrons are subjected to aggressive panhandling in the confined subway environment or find that their transit terminals have become homeless shelters of last resort. Transit patrons should not be singled out to bear this burden while more well-heeled citizens insulate themselves in cars, taxis and limousines.  Most of the disadvantaged people we encounter do not prefer the existence of panhandling in transit facilities that Mr. Gartner so ardently champions. The underlying objective of our court appeals is to protect the legitimate rights of our customers while urging more appropriate societal responses to the complex causes of homelessness. Mr. Gartner's essay misses the mark. Transit agencies are not trying, like Potemkin, to erect sham village facades, but to protect the viability of real cities by providing attractive public-transit services essential to their survival.
