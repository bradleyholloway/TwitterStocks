 Family Finances: Trading Dispute? Try Mediation   By Jaime Levy Pessin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2007  "The best part of mediation is you can say 'Yes' or 'No,'" says investors' attorney Phil Aidikoff.  Finra and the securities industry say arbitration is a quick, fair and effective way to resolve disputes. But investors' advocates and some members of Congress say Finra's arbitration forum is unfair to investors, partly because of the presence of industry arbitrators. At the very least, they argue, investors should have the option to sue in the court system.  Lawyer Steven Caruso, past president of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association, a group of attorneys who represent investors, says a potential conflict of interest exists for mediators: "They want to do a fair job, but they're going to get more business from the brokerage firm than the claimants' attorneys." That said, he and other investors' attorneys say they know mediators that both they and defense lawyers trust.
