 Health Costs: Help to Buy Prescriptions   By Landro, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  The largest and most comprehensive program, the drug industry's Partnership for Prescription Assistance, has been running broadcast ads featuring TV talk-show host Montel Williams to promote its "Help is Here Express." That's a bus tour making stops in all 50 states and more than 500 cities to help consumers connect with more than 475 public and private assistance programs.  While pharmaceutical companies have long made free drugs available to some patients, those arrangements "tended to be confusing and not very well advertised," says Ken Johnson, a senior vice president for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group overseeing the Partnership program. Since the industry got regulatory clearance to launch the joint effort last year, 36 member companies have given away 35 million prescriptions valued at more than $5 billion, Mr. Johnson says.  Doctors can also help steer patients to resources and fill out the required paperwork -- but it is up to patients to admit they need aid. "You need to be upfront and tell your doctor, 'I cannot afford this medicine,' " says Richard Sagall, a physician who co-founded NeedyMeds.com, a nonprofit Web site on drug-assistance programs.
