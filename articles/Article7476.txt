 Coastal Accuses Valero Energy in Suit Of Violation of Gas Supply Settlement   By By Thomas Petzinger Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1986  Coastal Corp. filed suit against Valero Energy Corp., a former unit, seeking $243 million in damages.  In addition, Coastal also is suing the South Texas cities of Austin and San Antonio and 207 other current or former Valero customers involved in the settlement, and Houston's Texas Commerce Bank, trustee of the accord.  The imbroglio dates to Coastal's abrogation of contracts to supply gas following the Arab oil embargo. Coastal's move left many customers bereft of gas supplies and made Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., Coastal's chairman, seem more to blame for the energy crisis in that region than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
