KOLWEZI, Zaire, Aug. 13â€” After seven years and many delays, the construction of the Inga-Shaba power line, the longest and most powerful in the world, will be completed this month.  The line runs 1,100 miles from the Inga Dam near Kinshasa on the Congo River to this remote copper-mining town in the heart of the southern, mineral-rich Shaba Province. It cuts through forest and bush and stalks over rivers, its 8,500 120-foot-high towers posing a striking contrast to the villages of straw-roofed huts in their path.  When it comes on stream next year, carrying half a million volts across a great swath of Africa, the line will stand as a monument to engineering tenacity, and as a symbol of a developing country's vulnerability to market forces beyond its control.  For critics it will also represent a lasting, large-scale reminder of the hubris of the country's leader, President Mobutu Sese Seko. Copper Boom and High Hopes  Work on the line by an American-led consortium began in 1974 when the price of copper - the mineral that fuels Zaire's economy - was high. The copper boom, economists say, swelled state coffers, individual pockets and presidential visions of grandeur. General Mobutu took credit for the idea of a line that would build a new unity between the north and south of his vast country and provide Africa with power.  Then, the price of copper fell drastically, oil prices went up and the cost of foreign technology rocketed. Critics say the line is just one of a number of projects that were conceived in the boom years on a scale that has now outstripped the nation's resources.  Its original purpose was to link the Inga Dam complex with Shaba Province in order to fuel a 200 percent expansion of the copper mines. It was also, critics say, a matter of presidential prestige.  Shaba already had its own hydroelectric resources, which are still, experts say, enough for present production. When the bottom fell from the copper market, the plan to expand production was dropped too, so the power needs of the industry could have been met at lower cost by rehabilitating Shaba's own aging hydroelectric system. Cost Overruns and Invasions  Initially planned for completion in three years at a cost of $350 million, the line will now cost over $800 million. Delays have been caused by problems with financing, invasions of Shaba from across the Angolan border in 1977 and 1978, the soaring price of imported equipment and Zaire's inability to pay its debts. America's Export-Import Bank is guranteeing the loans for the project.  The line has brought some employment and improved roads to the areas its crosses, but it does not provide power for these regions. For instance, halfway down its length at Kananga, the railways run on diesel fuel and electric power is provided by fuel-oil generators and hydroelectric equipment. A switch to power from the Inga-Shaba system would sharply reduce local bills. However, the line marches straight past Kananga and, according to officials, a spur into the town would cost a further $80 million.  There are those who defend the line. An official from Morrison-Knudsen International of Boise, Idaho, the concern that leads the construction consortium, said that sooner or later towns like Kananga would be connected to the Inga-Shaba line. In addition, the official said, Shaba's own hydroelectric equipment, some dating back to the 1920's, is in poor shape, so the completion of the line will be timely. Potential for Development  In the long term, an American official said, the vast power resources of Inga-Shaba - the great waters of the Congo River basin contain enough power potential to light up all of West Africa -could play a central role in Africa's development, a process that has been slowed in this region by high oil costs, low mineral prices and falling agricultural production.  Morrison-Knudsen, which has 280 Americans and 2,000 Zairians working on the line, has faced mammoth logistical problems. Equipment is imported by sea, unloaded at Matadi on the Atlantic, sent by road or rail from there to Kinshasa, loaded onto barges for a river trip and then put back onto the railways or onto trucks for onward transport, often to places where there were no roads before the line crews moved in. One hundred and forty thousand tons of equipment has been moved this way.  The line crews, some American, some Italian, have cut 4,000 miles of roads through inhospitable land. In some places, large trees have grown up around sections of the line built only three years ago. Tropical storms whip the shield wire with lightning. Local people, engineers say, have found uses for the steel from which the towers are made and have taken to unbolting sections and carrying them off. Maintenance is thus a never-ending job.
