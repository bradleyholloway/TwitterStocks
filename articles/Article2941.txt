Democratic Senator Bob Byrd was angry about this at the time. Now, it's true that then-Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch went on record saying he'd prefer the "acting" appointment for Mr. [Bill Lann Lee]. But that was a reflection of Mr. Hatch's own political timidity. The difference between acting and recess appointments may seem a legal technicality, but that's precisely the point. Mr. [George W. Bush] is following the law that Mr. [Bill Clinton] did an end run around.
