 Investors Snap Up 'Spider' Puts Amid Volatile Session for Stocks   By Schreiber, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2005  There are signs that some investors may be bracing for a move in the broad market. At the CBOE, for example, a customer bought 50,000 April 117 puts on the Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts, or "spiders," according to Emmanuel Liontakis, a CBOE trader. He and others said the 50,000 puts -- more than half the day's volume -- were purchased with 1.65 million shares of the fund -- probably in anticipation of a move in the S&P 500 index.  Friday's moves came ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on short-term interest rates set for tomorrow.
