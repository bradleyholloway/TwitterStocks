 Turbulence in the Gene Pool   By Schulz, Nick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2005  It was over breakfast one February morning in 2001 that Tom Legare, a precocious but otherwise typical American teenager, learned from his mother that his real father "was a Nobel Prize winner." The man married to his mother for so many years, it turned out, was in fact not biologically related to him. Rather, another man was, presumably a "brilliant scientist" (name unknown) who had contributed to the Repository for Germinal Choice, a "genius" sperm bank founded by businessman Robert K. Graham in 1980. Thus Tom was one of a far-flung brood, since many other infertile couples -- like the Legares -- had availed themselves of this high-end gene pool.  As [David Plotz] tells it in "The Genius Factory," a wonderfully readable and eye-opening account, Graham feared that, in late-20th- century America, "cradle-to-grave social welfare programs paid incompetents and imbeciles to reproduce. As a result, 'retrograde humans' were swamping the intelligent minority." The only way to save mankind was for the best intellectual "specimens" of the species to reproduce at a higher rate. And the best way to make that happen was to have the planet's brightest -- Nobel Prize-winners -- donate their genetic material for the betterment of humanity. "Ten men of high intelligence," Graham mused, "can be more effective than 1,000 morons." He envisioned replacing Darwin's natural selection with "intelligent selection."  The plan met resistance. "It's pretty silly," Max Delbruck, a Nobel winner in medicine said at the time. Nobelist Linus Pauling joked that "the old-fashioned way is still best." Such caviling was a problem. Graham's sperm bank had no hope of being marketed "to a skeptical public," Mr. Plotz writes, unless he scored some blue-ribbon sperm.
