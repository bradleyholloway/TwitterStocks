 Continued Weakness Raises Anxiety --- Lean Firms Face More Cuts, As Investment Pros Could Feel the Knife This Time   By By John Shipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2002  "There is pressure to do something, whether it's headcount-related or compensation-related," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. Because bonuses for portfolio managers often are tied to relative, as opposed to absolute, performance, managers doing well compared with their peers may be eligible for a hefty bonus, while profits from their fund, or at the company overall, are flat. Mr. Schorr suggested fund companies may look at tying compensation to earnings rather than relative performance as a way of controlling costs.  A few companies that concentrate on fixed-income investments seem to be holding up better than others. Three companies expected to post profits above their year-ago mark -- BlackRock Inc., Federated Investors Inc. and Legg Mason Inc. -- are market leaders in areas other than stocks. BlackRock and Western Asset Management, a Legg Mason unit, are strong players in the institutional fixed-income market, while Federated is a dominant player in the institutional cash-management business with its money-market funds.
