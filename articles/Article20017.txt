 Tenet CEO Tries To Erase Effects Of Scandals   By Rundle, Rhonda L, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2006  In their investigations, the Justice Department and U.S. attorneys in half a dozen cities didn't prove that Tenet had committed crimes. But Tenet acknowledges that a flawed culture led to an aggressive pricing strategy, which blew up when Medicare officials and private insurance companies discovered they were paying too much. "I hope we have changed the culture," Mr. [TREVOR FETTER] says, "because ultimately your culture is your only protection."  Dr. [Jennifer Daley] took her current job after Mr. Fetter pledged that Tenet's quality efforts would be real and transparent. "I'm not going to be part of window dressing," Dr. Daley says. "My goal is [for Tenet hospitals] to be in the top 10% to 20%."  Tenet's efforts are paying off: United Health Group Inc.'s UnitedHealthcare, the big health insurer, gave its "premium" designation to 18 Tenet cardiac care centers. And in December, the American Heart Association awarded 12 of 50 performance achievement awards to Tenet hospitals. The awards go to hospitals that adhere to guidelines aimed at ensuring that patients get the right medicines and instructions to prevent a second heart attack or stroke.
