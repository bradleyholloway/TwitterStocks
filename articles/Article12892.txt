 Currency Trading: Dollar Gains on Counterparts, Getting Lift From Powell Speech   By By Tyler Lifton, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  Mr. [Colin Powell]'s appearance has been widely signaled as a critical event for U.S. asset markets, to which traders paid close attention, with many anticipating that it would prove somewhat of a watershed event for the dollar.The overall direction for the dollar in response to the day's events was higher, as the currency market appeared convinced that Mr. Powell's presentation would convince U.S. allies that a firmer stance toward Iraq is necessary, reducing the chance of unilateral action by the U.S. and U.K.  Late yesterday in New York, the Australian dollar was trading at 59.01 U.S. cents, down from 59.15 U.S. cents late Tuesday, while the New Zealand dollar was worth 54.94 U.S. cents, down from 54.96 U.S. cents. The dollar was valued at C$1.5211, up from C$1.5147 Tuesday.
