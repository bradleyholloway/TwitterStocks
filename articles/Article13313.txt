 Click and Slip: What's Wrong With Tech   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  "Even when one of these companies reports remarkable numbers, as [Google] did, the prevailing sentiment leads to the stock's selling off on concerns things can't get better," mutual-fund manager Bill Miller of Legg Mason Value Trust recently wrote to his investors.  "Tech stocks are highly sensitive to changes in the economy and the group has virtually no pricing power to pass increased costs along," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. He rates technology as the least attractive sector for purchase now. "As long as consumers believe that the price of flat- screen TV sets will be lower six months from now, [these companies] are toast," he says.  Adds Tobias Levkovich, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Citigroup: "It can be misleading to only look at the lowered stock price as a guide" to buying beaten-up tech stocks, because the multiples may not have come down far enough to make the stocks attractive. "In our opinion it is still too early to wade in" to the tech world, says Mr. Levkovich.
