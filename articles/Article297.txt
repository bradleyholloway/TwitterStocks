TO promote its newest James Bond film, "Goldeneye," MGM/United Artists has produced a 30-minute infomercial that may confound even ardent followers of 007 with its masquerade as a regular program.  The infomercial, titled simply "James Bond," is being broadcast nationwide on dozens of television stations in the format of a slick television entertainment magazine, complete with charming co-hosts, trivia quizzes and the behind-the-scenes snippets one finds on programs like "Entertainment Tonight" and "Extra."  The show aims to promote the latest 007 movie and sell a digitally remastered set of 16 James Bond films from the MGM/United Artists home video library. The infomercial blends behind-the-scenes details about "Goldeneye" with clips from older Bond movies. (MGM/United Artists, which is owned by Credit Lyonnais, took the films out of distribution last year to repackage them, in an effort to create stronger demand.)  The program is winning praise from some within the infomercial industry who see it as a new way to promote movies and market film-related merchandise in a format that might compete with regular programming.  "It's doing gangbusters," said Jack Schember, publisher of Response TV, a magazine that tracks the direct-response television marketing industry. "It's doing two things: It's a behind-the-scenes look, but they're also liquidating their film library."  Although several studios have produced behind-the-scenes programs about the making of a movie, industry officials said this was the first time a studio had created its own movie infomercial and paid for it to be broadcast on national television. (Earlier this year, however, NBC used an infomercial to promote "JAG," a new television series.)  According to the Jordan Whitney Greensheet, a publication in Tustin, Calif., that reports on the direct-response television industry, "James Bond" was one of the most frequently broadcast infomercials last week, ranking 21st in the report's weekly top 40. And this week it is expected to see its heaviest run because "Goldeneye" opens at theaters today with its new 007, Pierce Brosnan.  The studio would not release sales figures for the video collection, but it said the infomercial, which has been shown for about six weeks, had surpassed its expectations. The media buyer for the project, Mercury Media Inc. of Santa Monica, Calif., has already purchased more than $2 million worth of television time, and the program is being broadcast on Fox Television, in the network's "prime access" time slots, between 7 and 8 P.M. and 10 and 11 P.M.  The infomercial opens with a disclaimer that says it is a paid program, but then the male and female co-hosts introduce the show as if it were a regular television program called "MGM/UA Presents." "On this edition," says the co-host, James Hill, "a special tribute to 007, James Bond."  Beth Bornhurst, vice president of market developement at MGM/UA Home Entertainment, said the studio had decided to use the familiar magazine format to appeal to filmgoers. "I felt it was important to do it in a format that people would recognize," she said. "The goal of any television programming is that you want it to be engaging. It's our goal to make it as entertaining as possible."  Ms. Bornhurst said the infomercial cost about $100,000 to produce. There are plans to develop similar programs, she said, but which movies are chosen will depend on whether a film can be tied to MGM/United Artists' video library or other movie-related merchandise.  Like other studios, MGM/United Artists is moving aggressively to increase its earnings through cross-promotional contracts and merchandising. In fact, several leading brands, including BMW and Yves Saint Laurent, signed product tie-in contracts in connection with "Goldeneye."  In its infomercial, though, MGM/ United Artists focused on promoting sales of the home videos. During the broadcast there are several breaks, or what the industry refers to as "calls to action," during which a toll-free telephone number is displayed that allows consumers to order the videos.  "This is the first of what will be a lot of movies using infomercials to promote what's happening," said Terry Finn, president of Infinnity Productions Inc., the Beverly Hills, Calif., company that produced the Bond infomercial. "Studios may try merchandising with a half hour tie-in with theaters."  As infomercials continue to blur the lines between advertising and programming, they allow marketers like MGM/United Artists to become less dependent on regular television programs or 30-second spots to achieve visibility for their products.  "You're going to see a merge of marketing and programming," Mr. Finn said. "Now, instead of getting two or three minutes on 'Entertainment Tonight,' you get a half-hour."
