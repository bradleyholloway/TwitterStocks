 Middle South Unit Facing NRC Fine On Training Data   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1985  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed a $500,000 fine against Mississippi Power & Light Co. for allegedly falsifying the training records of 46 reactor operators at its $3.4 billion Grand Gulf Unit 1 nuclear power plant.  The fine, one of the largest ever requested by the NRC, is the second proposed for alleged "material false statements" to the agency by the unit of Middle South Utilities Inc., New Orleans. Earlier this year, the NRC proposed a $125,000 fine against Mississippi Power for making five alleged false statements between 1980 and 1984 regarding its procedures for monitoring operations at the problem-plagued Grand Gulf plant in Port Gibson, Miss. That proposed fine is being appealed.
