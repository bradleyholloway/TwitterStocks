 IBM to Sell Linux Ware in Brazil   By Bulkeley, William M, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2004  IBM has been a big booster of Linux since 2000, viewing open-source programs as a way for its consultants to sell more of Big Blue's hardware and software programs. The new program for Brazil standardizes the service in what IBM views as a large potential market.  Peter Nielsen, director of Linux services strategy for IBM's global- services group said, "There's consistent customer demand [for Linux] in some emerging markets of which Brazil is the first." IBM is studying demand for such services in other emerging markets including China, India and Russia, he said.
