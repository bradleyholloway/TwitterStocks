 India Renews Atom Tests as U.S. Sets Sanctions --- Two More Blasts Set Off; Penalties Would Halt U.S. Credits, Other Aid   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robert S. Greenberger in Washington And Jonathan Karp in New Delhi, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1998  President Clinton, in Germany, said that the actions by India have "clearly created a dangerous new instability in their region," and called the tests "deeply disappointing." The sanctions the president imposed, the first to be invoked under a 1994 antiproliferation law, would halt U.S. credits, guarantees and other forms of aid and trade; bar U.S. banks from extending loans or credit to India's government; and require Washington to oppose lending by international financial institutions.  Japan, India's largest donor, suspended about $25 million in aid, and -- stung by the second round of tests -- added that it might also scrap $1 billion in pledged loans. A World Bank meeting of donor nations to discuss aid to India was canceled when Tokyo refused to host it. Sweden canceled $119 million in aid, the Netherlands temporarily suspended aid payments, Germany froze development aid payments, and Denmark canceled a business-promotion trip to have been led by Crown Prince Frederik.  If the international denunciations are bothering India's government, it isn't showing yet. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, basking in enormous domestic support for his decision to declare India a nuclear power, told reporters at his residence that the country can withstand any difficulties. Outside, supporters of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu-nationalist group that came to power in March at the head of an unwieldy coalition of more than a dozen parties, set off firecrackers to celebrate India's show of strength. An opinion poll published by the Times of India newspaper yesterday said 91% of urban Indians approved of the tests and 82% believed India should now build deployable nuclear weapons.
