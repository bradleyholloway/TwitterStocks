 KPMG Trial, Pared in Scope, Nears After Stormy Prologue   By Paul Davies and Chad Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2007  Judge [Lewis A. Kaplan] concluded that KPMG refused to pay the legal fees "because the government held the proverbial gun to its head." The judge accused the prosecutors of being "economical with the truth" in responses regarding the pressure tactics.  Messrs. [John Larson], [Robert Pfaff], [David Greenberg] and [Raymond J. Ruble] have been charged with conspiracy and multiple counts of tax evasion. They have denied wrongdoing. Attorneys for Messrs. Larson and Pfaff didn't return calls for comment. Mr. Greenberg's attorney, Richard Strassberg of Goodwin Procter LLP, said: "We'll be vigorously defending the case." Mr. Ruble's attorney, Jack Hoffinger, said, "We're proceeding to trial."  The government's case is expected to be bolstered by the guilty plea last month of David Amir Makov, a one-time currency and fixed-income derivatives trader, who said the "sole purpose" of the Blips shelter was to generate "paper losses" and fees.
