 Money Funds Rise $4.39 Billion in Week To a Record Level   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1989  Money-market mutual funds recorded a sharp increase of $4.39 billion for the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said.  The rise, to a record $328.15 billion, came despite lower average yields for the week and a net outflow of about $200 million in general-purpose money funds. It was the largest total inflow since mid-November, but assets at that time stood at only around $280 billion.
