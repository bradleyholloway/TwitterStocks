 Letters to the Editor: It's Unfair to Presume Guilt by Association   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1994  During my years in the Senate I have proven my willingness to investigate unpopular matters. I was the first to expose Oliver North's private aid network; I exposed Manuel Noriega's drug connections and first uncovered the link to BCCI; I produced an unmatched record of the BCCI scandal; I sought full investigative powers from the very committee you encourage to investigate now, and received no support from the Republicans you defend.
