 Pimco Stock-Fund Manager Quits; Civil Complaint Said He Was Central to Scheme For Market-Timing Trades   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2004  dThe manager, Kenneth Corba, who ran the $845 million Pimco PEA Growth Fund and the $95 million Pimco PEA Growth & Income Fund, hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. New Jersey regulators said in civil fraud allegations filed against Pimco Funds in February that Mr. Corba was instrumental in setting up arrangements to allow a hedge fund to engage in short-term trades that violated Pimco's own rules and skimmed profits from long-term investors.  According to the New Jersey complaint, hedge fund Canary Capital Partners was allowed to trade $100 million a maximum of four times a month in and out of three funds, including the PEA Growth Fund, which Mr. Corba ran. At the same time, the complaint said Canary agreed to make a $25 million long-term investment in another fund run by Mr. Corba that has since been merged into another portfolio. Regulators contend these agreements benefited Pimco because the firm was able to earn increased management fees off the timing money and the long-term investments. In February, PEA Capital pledged to repay $1.6 million to fund holders as compensation for damages caused by timing. Pimco is a unit of German insurer Allianz AG.
