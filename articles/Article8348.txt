 Afrocentrists wage war on ancient Greeks   By Lefkowitz, Mary, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1993  Mary Lefkowitz says Yosef A. A. ben-Jochannan, lecturing at Wellesley College recently, asserted that Greek civilization dates from only 1000 BC, suggested that Socrates was a figment of Plato's imagination and claimed that Aristotle sacked the Library of Alexandria and stole his philosophy from the Egyptians. She says such an Afrocentric view of history is paranoid and should be called into question.
