 J.C. Penney Posts Loss for Quarter Of $284 Million   By By Ann Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 23, 2001  Still, both the company and analysts said Penney faces a rough road. "They have a long, long way to go, and comments from management seem to be saying that it will take longer than previously thought," said Richard Church, retail analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "But I'll give [Allen Questrom] the benefit of the doubt. He's being upfront and not setting expectations high."  The latest quarter included a $285 million pretax charge for, among other things, closing 47 underperforming Penney department stores and outlet centers, consolidating Eckerd drugstore regional offices and reducing the company's work force. The company also took a $135 million charge related to inventory reduction at the department stores and Eckerd.
