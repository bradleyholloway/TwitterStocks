 Don Box May Make Bid To Buy Out Family Firm   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1996  Though such a transaction is far from certain, the sources say that Enron Capital & Trade Resources, the marketing-services unit of Houston-based Enron Corp., could help Don Box raise more than $200 million, mainly through debt, to buy Box Energy's 20.8 million voting and nonvoting shares. Enron would gain majority control and probably place someone within Box Energy to run the company, the sources say.  The bid could go higher if Enron looks favorably on the potential of Box Energy's current exploration program. For a per-share bid to reach into the middle teens, the sources say, Enron would have to be comfortable that Box Energy, which currently has about 11.5 million barrels of proven reserves, will find roughly 25% of the equivalent of 108 million barrels of oil and natural gas it's seeking this year. Such a success rate would push Box Energy's net asset value -- a key valuation measure in the oil patch -- to about $14.25 a share from less than $9 currently.  Owen Blicksilver, a Box Energy spokesman, says Don Box "has been speaking to Enron since about February, but there's been no discussion about a transaction. It would be misleading to shareholders to suggest that any deal with Enron is imminent." Don Box does have a friend at Enron -- Mark Warner, a former Box Energy petroleum engineer now in investment banking with the Houston firm.
