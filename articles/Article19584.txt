 A Split Fed?   By By Brian Wesbury, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2002  In September, Mr. [Bob McTeer] and Fed Governor Edward Gramlich dissented from the majority, calling for an immediate rate cut. Some recently well-placed newspaper articles suggest that this minority may be growing and the biggest split at the Fed in at least 15 years looks to be widening.  As a result, to compare the U.S. to Japan is misleading. Japan increased the capital gains tax rate in 1990 and then boosted the value-added-tax. It spent trillions of yen in a misguided attempt to boost economic growth and has attached many technically dead corporations to life support, diverting precious resources to lost causes. Most importantly, it took the Bank of Japan five years to lower real interest rates to zero and even then it did not hold them there. The Fed accomplished this task in just one year.  Further interest-rate cuts in the U.S. will only serve to inflate the demand side. And as we learned in the 1970s, once out of the bottle, the inflation genie is not so easy to put back. It's the supply side of the economy that needs help, not the demand side. Tax cuts and other incentives to increase the reward for taking risks in this highly uncertain environment would help much more than further interest rates cuts. Fed policy is not always the best therapy. This time, the fault does not lie with the Fed.
