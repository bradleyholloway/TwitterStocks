 Barron's Insight: Long-Term Gains On Tap For Anheuser-Busch Cos.   By Williams, Christopher C, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2005  "Investors think Americans won't drink as much beer as they used to, but it goes in and out of cycles," says Steven Roge, co-portfolio manager of Roge Partners Fund, which own Anheuser shares. "When beer is fashionable again, Anheuser will benefit greatly."  Beer isn't its only business. Anheuser is one of the largest theme-park owners in the U.S., operating Busch Gardens. It's also the nation's largest aluminum-can recycler. The brewery business generated 76% of revenue for 2004 and 90% of profits. The company boasts a portfolio of about 40 products, headlined by the top-selling Bud Light.
