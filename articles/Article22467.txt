 Helluva Town   By By Vincent J. Cannato, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1998  These days, New York no longer feels like a city in decline. Its current revival of fortunes -- fueled in part by the Wall Street boom -- seems to have shunted aside the dark and forbidding portrait of the city that has dominated the American imagination in recent years. The image of a burned-out South Bronx has been replaced by that of a Disney-fied Times Square. It is thus the right moment for Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace's "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898" (Oxford University Press, 1,383 pages, $49.95), a massive tome 20 years in the making.  Make no mistake: A comprehensive history of New York City is a bold undertaking, if not a foolish one. But Messrs. Burrows and Wallace -- history professors at Brooklyn College and John Jay College, respectively -- have pulled it off with style. (The second volume of their project, taking New York's story to the present, is due in the year 2000.) They cheerfully attempt the kind of all-encompassing, "synthetic" history that is now frowned upon by many of their colleagues in the historical profession.
