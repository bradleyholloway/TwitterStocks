 Hot Topic: The Arms-Control Illusion   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2006  The case of Iran has followed a similar arc of deception and U.N. failure. Tehran also signed the NPT, only to pursue its own secret bomb-building effort. The U.N. inspectors working inside Iran didn't discover any of this until they were tipped off by an Iranian opposition group that clearly had better intelligence than the U.N. The International Atomic Energy Agency has since produced report after report documenting Iran's violation and deception, and, under the explicit terms of the NPT, Tehran should have been referred immediately to the Security Council.  Yet the IAEA declined to do so for years. And only this summer, after Iran repeatedly rejected European entreaties to stop enriching uranium, did the Security Council finally agree to cite Iran for its arms-control violations. That resolution set an August 31 deadline for Iran to stop enriching uranium, promising dire consequences. But Iran keeps enriching, and so far the U.N. keeps begging it to cooperate. If neither Tehran nor Pyongyang takes these U.N. warnings seriously, this is why.
