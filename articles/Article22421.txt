 Upstart British Stock Exchange Seeks SEC Permission to Operate in the U.S.   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  Tradepoint Financial Networks PLC is seeking permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow American institutions and brokers to send orders to trade British stocks directly from Tradepoint terminals inside the U.S. The application, submitted last fall, is expected to be put out for comment any day now, said Stephen Wilson, head of commercial development at the London-based firm.  Tradepoint has competed with the London Stock Exchange for trading in British shares since 1995, but still has only a tiny share of that volume -- just 1% in most months, Mr. Wilson says.  Mr. Wilson says the firm has sought to register as an exchange with a limited volume exemption, which relieves it of the full regulatory burden borne by normal stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. The privately owned Arizona Stock Exchange has a similar exemption.
