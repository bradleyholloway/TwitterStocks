 Canadian Court Awards Gold Mine In Ontario to Corona Resources Ltd.   By By Mark Schacter, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  LAC Minerals Ltd. must hand over its new Hemlo, Ontario, gold mine, valued by some experts at more than $1 billion (U.S.), to International Corona Resources Ltd., the Supreme Court of Ontario ruled.  In its decision, the court ruled that LAC had improperly used information it was given by Corona to acquire the gold-mining property. At the time, the two were considering a joint venture on Corona's land. Corona, which had been seeking to acquire the same property independently, claimed that LAC cheated it out of the prize.  If upheld on appeal, the decision would transform Corona, which only a few years ago was a tiny gold-exploration company, into one of North America's biggest gold producers. Believed to be the largest legal settlement ever in Canada, the ruling is also a potential bonanza for Vancouver-based Teck Corp. Teck is Toronto-based Corona's partner in a Hemlo gold mine adjacent to the huge LAC mine.
