 Reagan Administration's Deregulation Drive Often Thwarted by Appeals Court in Washington   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1985  Significantly, these clashes between federal agencies and the appeals court haven't been limited to the predominantly liberal judges appointed by President Carter and earlier administrations. The more conservative judges named to the appeals court by President Reagan, although personally more sympathetic to deregulation and philosophically more inclined to defer to agency judgments, have also joined the fray.  Many federal regulators assumed at the start of the Reagan administration that while Congress set limits on the power to regulate, those same laws gave them more freedom to deregulate. But, says Merrick Garland, a Washington lawyer, it hasn't worked out that way. "The D.C. Circuit has overturned Reagan administration deregulation actions with much higher consistency" than it did on strictly regulatory decisions, says Mr. Garland, who in 1982 successfully challenged the Transportation Department's decision to rescind a requirement for passive restraints in automobiles. "And it isn't just the liberal judges."  Of course, most cases in which the appeals court reviews federal agency decisions are routine, and the agencies win far more than they lose. Furthermore, the court's membership is changing, and there is no way to predict what the newest judges will do. While the appeals court has had 10 judges in recent years, it is now legally entitled to 12. By early next year, half the court's members will have been named by President Reagan, three of them chosen in recent months.
