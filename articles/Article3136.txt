 FedEx Pilots Act to Call Off A Strike Vote   By By Douglas A. Blackmon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1998  During an extraordinary meeting of the board of the union representing the 3,500 FedEx pilots, leaders of the in-house union voted to effectively abandon their strike vote and ask the company to offer the terms of a contract proposal made by the company late last month, according to union Vice President Byron Cobb. The decision was triggered after the company concluded agreements under which all air operations in FedEx's vast international network will be outsourced to other airlines, according to FedEx and union executives.  As word of those unannounced agreements filtered out into the pilot corps, the leadership of the union split, according to people present, with veteran FedEx pilots urging the union to drop its wage and benefit demands and strike a deal before thousands of FedEx pilot jobs were eliminated.
