 Now if Only This Would Happen Over at Publishers Clearing House   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1989  The people at Kraft USA, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., are finding out fast, and neither they nor the hundreds of supposed winners are very happy about it.  This past Sunday, newspapers in metropolitan Chicago and Houston included ads for a contest called "Ready to Roll." The rules were simple: If the game piece in the ad matched the one in specially marked packages of Kraft Singles cheese slices, you were a winner. First prize: A Dodge Caravan, valued at $17,000. Other prizes included 100 bicycles, 500 skateboards and 8,000 packages of cheese. The odds of winning the van were one in 15,160,000.
