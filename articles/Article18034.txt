 McKinney Excels as IBM's Europe Chief But Faces Test From Slowing Demand   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1989  When International Business Machines Corp. named David McKinney for its top job in Europe last year, it needed somebody to trust. Its European operations, the source of one-third of its revenue, were making a fragile recovery.  Mr. McKinney, a 55-year-old career IBM executive with broad experience, has carried the ball well -- but the game may get rougher. Industry gurus say IBM and rivals will smart next year from slower computer demand in Europe, as economies cool and the number of computerless businesses shrinks. Sales of a few key IBM products, such as its 18-month-old AS400 line of minicomputers, are especially vulnerable.  IBM's Mr. McKinney says he's keeping a weather eye out but doesn't expect much trouble. Computer-industry growth in Europe, he says in an interview, "may be marginally slower" in 1990 than in this year. "We'll be very cautious with the way we approach 1990, to make sure we don't get too far out in our investments."
