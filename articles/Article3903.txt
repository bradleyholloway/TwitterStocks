 Technology (A Special Report); Who's Got Your Number? This was supposed to be the year for a national wireless directory; It isn't looking so good   By Drucker, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2005  Meanwhile, officials from Qsent Inc., the Portland, Ore., company hired by cellular carriers to assemble a national directory before the chill set in, say they are continuing their preparations. They predict that the privacy concerns will fade once cellphone customers start using the service and see the benefits. "We call it wireless 411, but the reality is: It's just 411," says Greg Keene, Qsent's chief privacy officer. "Consumers call 411 looking either for a person or a business. If those people or businesses are now in 411 . . . that's a benefit to the consumer."  It'll cost you: Verizon's current service requires customers to pay an initial sign-up fee to list cellphone numbers or other "foreign" listings, as it calls them, like 800 numbers or non-Verizon numbers. Verizon's sign-up fees range from $12.32 in Rhode Island to $35.90 in New York. There is a monthly fee as well, ranging from $1.05 in New Jersey and Maryland to $3.05 in Rhode Island.  Verizon Wireless says there isn't enough demand to justify setting up a wireless directory. In addition to the company's other objections, "we just don't see enough of a demand for this service to put the resources behind it to pursue it with the privacy safeguards we need," says Verizon Wireless spokesman Jim Gerace. "The industry doesn't need to be pursuing this when it ought to be putting resources into improving service."
