 China Restricts News of Cnooc Bid   By Pottinger, Matt, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2005  Cnooc, China's largest offshore oil producer, on Tuesday abandoned a months-long effort to buy Unocal, of El Segundo, Calif., blaming the political atmosphere in Washington. Thus far, Beijing has refrained from commenting on the aborted bid to distance itself from Cnooc and deflect allegations in Congress that the pursuit of Unocal reflected Chinese state policy.  The leadership in Beijing is intent on keeping relations with Washington as smooth as possible. For a few weeks after Cnooc's announcement in June that it was challenging Chevron Corp. to acquire Unocal, coverage in China's state-owned media was relatively freewheeling, with some criticizing the bid and others attacking U.S. lawmakers' efforts to thwart Cnooc.  Beijing's desire for smooth U.S. relations notwithstanding, the Cnooc saga still could cause repercussions for American interests. The handful of permitted commentaries published in recent days have emphasized U.S. hypocrisy on free trade. The China Daily ran an editorial yesterday saying the consequences of the failed Cnooc bid "may be more serious than some U.S. politicians have calculated."
