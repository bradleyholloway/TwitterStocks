 By the Numbers Duke: No. 1 for Now   By By Allen Barra & George Ignatin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1999  Duke -- for now -- is No. 1. That's not such a surprise since the Blue Devils have been at or near that spot most seasons for the past 15 years. What is unusual is the size of Duke's lead -- and the fact that the other three spots in the Final Four are likely to go to teams that weren't even supposed to have a shot at the championship.  Our computer, Mad Max, says Duke is nearly five points ahead of its nearest contender, the University of Connecticut. That's a heck of a gap in Max's "power ratings." Only 6.6 points separate Connecticut from Max's No. 10 team, Syracuse.  Duke's potential challengers for the crown, however, are what make 1998-99 the most interesting National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball season of the decade. Everyone who was supposed to be in is out, and some of the teams who were supposed to be way out are in. Take Auburn, for instance. No one picked them to win the Southeast Conference, let alone be among the top five teams in the country. And how about St. John's, Ohio State, Wisconsin (which had been picked by some to finish last in the Big Ten), Miami and Northwestern? Hardly anyone but their die-hard fans expected any of them to finish in the top 20, and now all of them have at least a shot at the Final Four.
