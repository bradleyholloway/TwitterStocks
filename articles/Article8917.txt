 Money Order: Nuns' Zeal for Profits Shapes Hospital Chain, Wins Wall Street Fans --- But as Daughters of Charity Builds $2 Billion Reserve, Some Question Its Goals --- `No Margin, No Mission'   By By Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1998  ST. LOUIS -- How did the Daughters of Charity -- an order whose nuns live on $40 a month, wear modest blue habits and pray and light candles daily in their provincial house here -- come to be known as the Daughters of Currency?  The health system's financial success demonstrates just how profitable many of the nation's so-called "nonprofits" have become. With return on investments running more than three times the return on hospital operations -- 12% vs. 3.6% in 1997 -- Daughters now gets about 60% of its income from its investment portfolio. That compares with a historical 50-50 split of profits between hospitals and investments. Nonprofit entities must use all profits for charitable purposes; because its reserves are held for the benefit of the hospitals, Daughters' investment income is tax-free.  Some even say Daughters is stingy when it comes to charity: Bowdoin Street Health Center, a Boston clinic that had been featured in a Daughters' video about the order's commitment to the poor, pulled out of the system in 1995, complaining of lack of significant financial support. The clinic, which had been set up in an old bank building with used equipment from a Daughters hospital, was swamped with patients. But the order turned down its request for $2 million for a new building.
