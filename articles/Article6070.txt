 Please Mister Postman   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2002  Mr. [John E. Potter]'s ambitious push to enlarge the Postal Service's mandate comes amid the latest price increase, to 37 cents for a first-class letter, which yesterday received the formal stamp of approval from his board of directors. If Congress does not approve his new "transformation plan," Mr. Potter warned the National Press Club on Friday, "the only post offices our children's children will know are the ones they'll see in museums."  Beware of bureaucracies bearing such gifts. Making the Postal Service more like Wal-Mart might sound like a good idea. That's what some of us have been urging for years. But the Post Office has always resisted, and meanwhile the private sector has adapted as entrepreneurs exploited new technology. This includes Fedex and UPS, which found ways around the postal monopoly to deliver letters and parcels faster, and simple fax machines and email that allowed people to bypass the mail system altogether.
