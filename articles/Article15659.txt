 Startups Aim to Launch New Generation of Spacecraft   By By Quentin Hardy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1998  "A lot of people have a problem with my concept," concedes Michael Kelly, president and chief executive officer of Kelly Space & Technology Inc. "But it's going to happen," adds Michael Gallo, his chief operating officer.  If so, here's how. Unlike a conventional rocket's explosive start from the ground, a Kelly Space "Eclipse astroliner" spacecraft is towed behind a cargo jet to a height of 40,000 feet, saving on fuel compared with a conventional rocket. The astroliner then flies to 400,000 feet on small reusable rockets and launches its satellite cargo to the final altitude. After gliding back part of the way, the craft returns to the runway on modest aircraft engines. After a two-week checkup, it goes up again.  Decades of conventional rocket launches make the Kelly Space approach seem improbable, but there are believers. Motorola Inc. has given Kelly Space an $89 million launch contract, contingent on the company's proving its tow-launch idea. Others are selling space on a company prototype, expected in November, for zero-gravity experiments. A full-size spacecraft is expected in mid-2001. Motorola and other satellite manufacturers are also talking with the company about more launches, at about one-third the cost of a conventional rocket.
