 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  A: The Kyocera was a big step forward when it came out. It was a real phone, small enough to use, with a Palm inside. The Samsung was another good step. It was a Palm with phone functionality, in a phone-like shape -- smaller than the Kyocera, and with a color screen.  The Treo, which goes on sale next month, beats them both. It is smaller than the other two, and has a real phone keypad like the Kyocera (the Samsung has only virtual dialing buttons on a screen.) And the Treo has a full keyboard, which really makes e-mail easy. The others lack that.  The Treo also has a much better way of quickly dialing contacts in your address book than any Palm, including the Kyocera or Samsung. It also will soon have a color screen like the Samsung, and optional "push" e-mail, like the RIM BlackBerry, which constantly receives e-mail without user intervention. The others don't have that.
