 Stocks Set Records in Broad Rally As Technology Shares Pace Gains   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1987  The advance wasn't confined to just blue-chip stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up 3.64 to 322.09, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 1.83 to 180.37. Both indexes closed at highs. Gainers had nearly a 2-to-1 lead over decliners on the Big Board.  Smaller capitalization stocks also advanced. The American Stock Exchange's Major Market index rose 1.71 to a record 361.38. The Nasdaq OTC composite index ended up 4.54 to 440.80, exceeding its previous high of 439.64, set March 20. There were 1,328 issues advancing and 954 declining in the OTC market.  After being in the forefront of the stock market's rally early this year and then languishing in the past few months, technology stocks were suddenly back in vogue. Worries about a slowdown in the economy, the reception of new personal computer products introduced this spring and some second-quarter earnings reports that fell short of expectations caused some investors to kick these stocks out of their portfolios in late June and early July.
