 Why Today's Soaring Deficits Don't Inspire Fears; Though New Threats Loom, Complacency Has Reigned Since '80s Concerns Faded   By Ip, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2004  Given that outcome, many of today's conservatives seem to have concluded that President Reagan's example shows that tax-cutting brings enormous political benefits while deficits come with few costs. Earlier this year, in his book "The Price of Loyalty," author Ron Suskind, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, wrote of then-Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill being told by Vice President Cheney in 2002: "Reagan proved deficits don't matter." Asked for comment this year, Mr. Cheney said he believes deficits do matter, but the budget shouldn't be balanced at the expense of "adequately funding our military operations," or of "pro growth" tax cuts.  The fact that Mr. Stockman's worst fears weren't realized seems to have drained deficits of the menace they once carried. "Oddly, the lesson many Americans seem to have drawn from the experience of the past two decades is that nothing need be done," Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman said last month at a conference on fiscal policy sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  he asserted, the idea that Mr. Reagan proved deficits didn't matter economically "is just wrong on the facts." Deficits crowded out private investment, reduced economic growth and, he estimated, left annual GDP $500 billion a year smaller today than it otherwise would be, an amount equal to about 5% of today's GDP.
