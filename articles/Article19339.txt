McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2000  In an effort to streamline operations following a four-year acquisition spree, Aon Corp. said it plans to take pretax charges of $250 million to $325 million and cut 3,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of the insurance company's work force.  The company also will outsource some technology jobs in the United Kingdom. The restructuring is expected eventually to produce pretax savings of $150 million to $200 million a year, Aon said.  Aon employs about 50,000 people world-wide in its insurance brokerage, underwriting and consulting businesses.
