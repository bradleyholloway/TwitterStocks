 On Sports: Football: The Pats 'Squish the Fish'   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1986  The New England Patriots revealed themselves to be philosophical Fordians here Sunday. With scarcely a slip, they turned the yoke of history into a joke and beat their old oppressors, the Miami Dolphins, 31-14, in the American Football Conference championship game.  In doing so, the Patriots accomplished a formidable list of firsts, not the least of which was qualifying for their first Super Bowl appearance. They hadn't won in the Dolphins' Orange Bowl home in 18 tries since 1966, and they did it against a team that had never lost a conference championship game in five previous appearances.  "When we were two and three, our coaches told us not to worry, that we'd be OK," said Ronnie Lippett, a defensive-back who contributed mightily to the Sunday triumph by dogging the Dolphins' swift wide-receivers. "I thought to myself, 'Yeah, the way we were playing, the other teams' coaches must be saying the same thing about us.'"
