 Moving the Market: AIG, Long Traded on Big Board, Adds a Listing on Archipelago   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2005  The move also comes as federal prosecutors in New York investigate whether AIG Chairman and Chief Executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg attempted to manipulate AIG's share price when he contacted the New York Stock Exchange to express his dissatisfaction with the specialist handling AIG shares. At issue is whether, in Mr. Greenberg's contacts with the office of NYSE's then-chairman, Dick Grasso, he improperly asked for help in shoring up the firm's share price, people familiar with the matter have said. In the past, AIG officials have said Mr. Greenberg and AIG did nothing illegal and hadn't attempted to manipulate AIG shares.  Analysts called the dual listing a move less of practical significance for AIG shareholders and more symbolically significant in light of Mr. Greenberg's past criticism, both public and private, of the NYSE. Indeed, shareholders already can trade AIG shares on Archipelago's exchange, and the Chicago exchange's share of trading in AIG stock may not rise as a result of the dual listing.
