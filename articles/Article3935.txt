 Moving the Market: Grasso Rebuffs Pay-Package Settlement Talks   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2005  Mr. [Dick Grasso] doesn't seem to have budged, beyond adopting a more conciliatory tone. When asked about his position, he referred to a 2004 letter by his lawyer Brendan Sullivan that said Mr. Grasso "has no intention of returning any portion of his compensation to the exchange." Mr. Grasso maintains his compensation was awarded fairly and that his contract should be honored. In the past, he has blasted the case as politically motivated.  He even said nice things about Mr. [Henry Paulson]. "He's doing a great job" in the deposition, Mr. Grasso said. "He'll tell the truth. Hank's a great leader." Mr. Grasso didn't attend previous depositions in the case, but said he plans to go to one or two more in coming weeks.  Mr. Grasso's co-defendant in the case, former NYSE board member Kenneth Langone, who had been accused of misleading the board about Mr. Grasso's compensation, reiterated yesterday that he would like Mr. [Eliot Spitzer] to drop the case and apologize. "I feel very good about where I am" in the case, said Mr. Langone, who like Mr. Grasso has been fighting Mr. Spitzer's claims.
