 West Germans Take Precautions in Wake Of Nuclear Accident --- Flood of Bewildering Advice Causes Some Confusion; The French Only Shrug   By By Peter Gumbel and Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 1986  BONN, West Germany -- Duesseldorf changed the water in its open-air swimming pools, just in case. Hamburg's senator for education told parents he "completely understands" if they don't send their children to school. In Berlin, officials tested a soccer field for radiation before the start of an international cup final. And the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a respected daily, advised readers not to sunbathe naked in the grass.  Since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, West German sales of milk and fresh vegetables have plummeted, special TV and radio phone-ins have been beseiged with calls from anxious parents, and people are buying gas masks. Demand for Geiger counters has doubled their price on the black market.  While governments and nuclear experts generally say there's no serious health risk, most countries are taking some precautions, such as monitoring levels of radioactivity in milk and advising people to wash green vegetables. West Germany has banned sales of lettuce, spinach and chives.
