 One Year Later, Disney Attempts Smoother Ride   By Marr, Merissa, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2005  At this time last year, Mr. [Michael Eisner] was facing the fight of his life: shareholders wanted the 20-year veteran out; cable giant Comcast Corp. was knocking at Disney's door with an unsolicited takeover offer; and trouble spots like the company's ABC television network were still hounding the company's performance. At the annual meeting in Philadelphia, shareholders issued a historic rebuke of Mr. Eisner's leadership, with 45% of the shares voted withholding support for his re-election to the Disney board.  Some investors appear more tolerant of a possible transitory role for Mr. Eisner, but many believe it wouldn't be in Disney's best interest to keep him around. "I find it hard to believe that a truly arms-length board would want Mr. Eisner's services for anything," says Richard H. Moore, state treasurer for North Carolina, whose pension fund owns 3.3 million Disney shares. "He'd bring too much baggage."  Ultimately, the challenge for the company isn't to lose sight of its financial recovery, especially in light of tough comparisons this year. One of the keys will be keeping ABC's nascent comeback, driven by hits like "Desperate Housewives" and "Lost," on track. Another factor that could rock the boat: the renegotiation of its NFL deal. How Disney fares in animation is also crucial; while the future of its relationship with Pixar Animation Studios still hangs in the balance, Disney has been highlighting its own animation efforts of late.
