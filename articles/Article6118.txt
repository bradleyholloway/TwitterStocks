 Theater Hamptons Shakespeare; Wartime Sartre   By By Donald Lyons, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1998  Arguably, the greatest legacy of Joseph Papp, the founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival, can be expressed in five words: free Shakespeare in a park. Beginning in 1954 in a riverside park on the Lower East Side and moving to Central Park in the late 1950s, Papp pioneered an idea that has spread throughout English-speaking countries. In Central Park itself "Cymbeline" (the only Shakespeare play of the summer) will open next week. From Sydney to London, and in many American cities, Shakespeare on summer evenings has become a civic habit, a cheerfully democratic pastime, a family picnic for the spirit. The comedies and histories are preferred to the tragedies, and the Bard diet is varied, according to local tastes, with modern fare.  When Rosalind (the sharp-featured, amiable and intelligent Amy Prosser) gets to play a boy playing a girl teaching Orlando, her smitten swain, how to make love to a girl, the production comes to life. Remy Auberjonois makes a finely infatuated lover. And when Rosalind takes all the threads of amorous silliness into her hands and smartly unknots them, settling everybody's love-hash with brisk brio, the production gets up and dances. But the good stuff is a long time coming. Mr. (Michael) Landman slows down an already prolix tale with much solemn spectacle: processions, revels, a wrestling bout in slo-mo. Worse are his gratuitous and weird stylizings: Renaissance courtiers look and carry on like Spanish Inquisitors; woodsmen resemble Restoration fops or Ben Franklin. Simple, funny and romantic are best in summer Shakespeare; far-fetched academic concepts can wait for colder times. It was, at last, a merry evening.
