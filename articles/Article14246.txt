 Stock Prices Decline in Response To Inflation Fears, Weaker Bonds   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1986  While the blue chips recovered a bit, the broader indexes ended with wider declines. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.57 to 243.94, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.84 to 140.20.  In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 0.43 to 399.05. But volume of 122.7 million shares exceeded Big Board activity for the second consecutive day; more than 120.2 million shares changed hands in the OTC market Tuesday. There were 990 issues advancing and 1,059 declining yesterday.  Some traders noted the declines in the stock market were mild compared with the slump in bonds; the June futures contract on U.S. Treasury bonds closed down the limit of two points. By contrast, "The stock market hung in there a like a champ," said Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. in New York.
