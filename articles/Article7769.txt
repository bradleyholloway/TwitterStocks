 Small Classes Are Better for Whom?   By By Richard Vedder, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1988  The school-reform movement of the past five years has pointed out deficiencies of our current system. The educational establishment (teacher unions, state education departments, school boards and administrators, and colleges of education) has seized on concerns about these matters to demand more funding for education. The presidential hopefuls will have a lot more to say and promise on this score before this year's race mercifully ends.  Virtually none of the debate, however, has focused on a shocking trend in American education -- the dramatic decline in educational productivity. In 1950, our public elementary and secondary schools educated 16.5% of the nation's population at a cost of barely 2% of the nation's output; in 1986, it took 3.5% of the nation's output to educate the same proportion of the citizenry. In constant-dollar terms, expenditures per pupil more than tripled.  Under this assumption, the chart shows what has happened to "output" per instructional staff member between 1940 and 1986, compared with output per worker in the economy as a whole. While the output of workers outside education more than doubled, that of teachers fell as class sizes grew smaller and the number of non-teaching professional staff grew.
