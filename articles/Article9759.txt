 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Books: Kicking the Habitat   By Fukuyama, Francis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  This and other environmental cautionary tales form the core of [Jared Diamond]'s "Collapse," in effect the counterpart to his immensely popular "Guns, Germs, and Steel." That 1997 book explained the rise of different societies by their endowments of plants, diseases (or lack thereof), animals and metal ores. The new one tells the story of vanished peoples like the Anasazi Indians in the American Southwest, the Maya in Central America and the Viking colony in Greenland, as well as some modern cases of conflict and decline such as Rwanda and Haiti, where, in Mr. Diamond's view, the mistreatment of the environment has played a crucial part.  "Collapse" is not a book of history alone. Mr. Diamond draws parallels between these past collapses and our own global situation today, where he believes that we are exploiting natural resources in an unsustainable way. He says: "I have often asked myself, 'What did the Easter Islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it?' Like modern logger, did he shout 'Jobs, not trees!'? Or: 'Technology will solve our problems, never fear, we'll find a substitute for wood'? Or: 'We don't have proof that there aren't palms somewhere else on Easter, we need more research, your proposed ban on logging is premature and driven by fear-mongering'?"
