 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian Ridge, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2000  Scientists in the U.S. and abroad experiment with ways to "grow" teeth. Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio are genetically engineering mouse and human cells to produce dentin (the inner hard tissue of a tooth), enamel and other tissues in a lab dish. Eventually, they hope that self-regenerated teeth may replace dentures and dental implants in humans.  The research aims to find a way to trigger cells in a person's mouth so that a new tooth starts to grow at the site of the old tooth, says Mary MacDougall, associate dean of the center's dental school. Such targeted gene therapy has also identified two clusters of genes that cause tooth diseases such as faulty development of enamel and improper formation of dentin, researchers say.
