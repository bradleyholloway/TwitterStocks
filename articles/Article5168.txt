Stocks bounced around in an inverse relation to oil prices throughout the day. Crude oil for October delivery rose above $31, but closed down 54 cents to $30.76.  Among the broader indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.59 to 321.04, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.31 to 176.39 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 0.41 to 297.73. Declining issues topped advancers by 835 to 609 on the Big Board.  Meanwhile, investors received a reminder that earnings growth is still a driving factor in the stock market: Tandem Computers, which shocked investors with disappointing third-quarter results in July, said it might not meet fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Tandem's stock fell 2 1/8, or 15.6%, on 2.8 million shares, making it the most active issue and the day's biggest loser on the Big Board in percentage terms.
