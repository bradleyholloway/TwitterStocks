 Sales Numbers for Nine Months Confirm Slowdown in U.K. Insurance Industry   By By Catherine Taylor, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1998  New business figures released Tuesday by three of the United Kingdom's largest life assurers for the first nine months of 1998 confirmed an expected slowdown in the industry.  Prudential Corp. PLC said new business fell 7.6% in the nine months, with a 28% reduction in the sales force from a year ago largely to blame. Norwich Union Life Insurance Society saw sales rise only 1%, and Sun Life & Provincial Holdings PLC's new business was flat.  Prudential and Sun Life fared better, with a strong stock market buoying up the shares. Prudential's shares were up 39 pence, or 5.2%, to 784 pence, while Sun Life's shares were up 14 pence, or 2.8% to 522 pence. Expectations were that Prudential's new business could have suffered more, analysts said, and the market was also relieved by the fact that sales through independent financial advisers were up strongly.
