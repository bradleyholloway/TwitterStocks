 Sale of Buitoni to Nestle Is Called Unfair to Holders   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1988  Analysts said the assertion by Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole, a large French farm bank, could lead to a court case and thus delay completion of the transaction. Under the accord announced two weeks ago, Nestle, a giant Swiss food company, agreed to buy all Buitoni's Italian and French industrial assets for 1.8 trillion lire ($1.47 billion). But Mr. De Benedetti would retain control of the Buitoni food group's operating units, which have effectively become cash-rich financial holding companies.
