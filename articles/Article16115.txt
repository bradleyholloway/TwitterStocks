 BMW Chairman to Leave A Year Ahead of Schedule --- Joachim Milberg Will Depart In May, Be Succeeded By Finance Chief Panke   By By Scott Miller and Marcus Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2001  Mr. [Joachim Milberg] became BMW chairman after his predecessor, Bernd Pischetsrieder, and another executive, Wolfgang Reitzle, abruptly left the company following a boardroom fight over what to do with the money-losing Rover Cars unit. Mr. Milberg, who had just overseen the successful launch of BMW's 3-series car, took over and along with Mr. [Helmut Panke] engineered BMW's exit from the failed Rover investment last year.  BMW's next chairman, Mr. Panke, 55, has spent a long career with the car maker after working for consultants McKinsey & Co. He headed BMW's U.S. operation from 1993 to 1996, and has said he holds fond memories of his U.S. experiences, which included opening a BMW plant near Spartanburg, S.C. The U.S. is a critical market for BMW.
