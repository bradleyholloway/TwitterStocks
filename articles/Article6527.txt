 Attacks to Cost U.S. 1.64 Million Jobs, Survey Forecasts   By By Andrew Caffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 2002  Hence his pessimism about metro regions that depend on air-travel-related industries. On an annual basis, the study says, Las Vegas will lose a higher percentage of jobs -- an additional 5%, or nearly 41,000 jobs -- than if there had been no attacks. For Myrtle Beach, S.C., the additional job loss is 3.6%, or 3,680 jobs; Reno, Nev., 3.15%, or 6,380 jobs; Orlando, Fla., 2.85%, or 27,030 jobs; and Honolulu, 2.6%, or 10,710 jobs. Cities with airport hubs or dependent on aircraft construction also will be disproportionately hurt: Wichita, Kan., will lose an additional 2.8% or 8,250 jobs, while Fort Worth, Texas, will lose 2.45%, or 20,270 jobs, the study says.
