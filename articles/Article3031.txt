 British Energy Seeks Government Aid   By By Andrea Chipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2002  Wholesale-energy prices in the U.K. are at 10-year lows and that is hobbling the nuclear operator's bottom line. The company posted a GBP 500 million loss ($770 million) in the financial year ended in March, chilling investors, who have sent shares 55% lower in the past six months. By comparison, the FTSE-250 index has lost about 20% over the same period.  All U.K. electricity generators have suffered from low wholesale prices. The bearish price climate is due to excess generation capacity and the imposition in March 2001 of a new wholesale-power trading system that benefits generators that can adjust output on short notice. Nuclear plants can't turn their facilities on and off to react to demand and price fluctuations.  Indeed, British Energy's North American business remains the company's sole bright spot. Its Canadian Bruce Power Station and the U.S. AmerGen joint venture contributed GBP 83 million profit before minority interests in 2001-2002 fiscal year, compared with a GBP 41 million loss in the U.K. business.
