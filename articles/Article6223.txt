 'Station Domination' Takes Over Transit   By By Erin White, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1999  Commuters passing through the lower level of the World Trade Center these days can see a total of 138 advertisements covering much of the walls and even parts of the floors. Nothing out of the ordinary there, except for one thing: All 138 messages ballyhoo the wares of a single advertiser.  Indeed, a station-domination display can be striking. Last fall, in the first such campaign in the U.S., Teligent saturated the World Trade Center with ads featuring dramatic lettering on fire-engine red backgrounds all promoting the Vienna, Va., telecommunications company.  Since then, five more brands -- AMR's American Airlines, Spiegel's Eddie Bauer, DaimlerChrysler's Dodge, Dow Jones's Wall Street Journal and Bridge Information Systems -- have taken over the World Trade Center. Other saturation advertisers are booked at the site through February 2000.
