 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): A Trillion Isn't Peanuts   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1986  President Reagan yesterday morning handed Congress a fiscal 1987 budget that falls only $6 billion short of one trillion dollars. You would have thought he had sent warmed-over baked beans. Is this all we get? the legislators asked. But before Congress embarks on yet another chaotic effort to rearrange the president's priorities, its members should ponder a few things.  First, this is a congressional election year, which means the clock is already racing toward the October campaign. Two, Gramm-Rudman is waiting out there to make the chaos truly profound by, let us say, September. Three, the president's budget, for all its ritual slaughter of redundant agencies and its typically optimistic economic assumptions, will look to many voters like a rather neat way of solving the nation's fiscal woes.
