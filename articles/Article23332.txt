 Shell Profit Falls On Lower Margins For Oil Refining   By Cummins, Chip, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2006  The energy company, the world's largest by market value behind Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC, benefited from last year's run-up in oil, gas and fuels prices spurred in part by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Profit at Shell's core exploration-and-production unit rose 22%, even as the storms contributed to a 9% drop in oil and gas production. For the year, Shell earned $25.31 billion, a record for the company and 37% higher than in 2004.  In addition to the year-earlier gains, Shell was held back by its oil-products division, which includes its refining and marketing operations. Shell saw a weakening in its refining margins, or the difference between the price of crude oil and the price of selling fuels such as gasoline, especially in the West Coast, Europe and Asia.
