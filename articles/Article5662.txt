 EU Warns U.S. Not to Impose Sanctions in Banana Dispute   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Julie Wolf in Brussels and Michael M. Phillips in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1998  A European Commission spokesman said there would be "extremely damaging consequences" if the U.S. goes ahead with plans to retaliate against the EU's banana-import rules, which Washington considers discriminatory. The U.S. Trade Representative will publish a preliminary list today naming products to be saddled with 100% import duties early next year if the EU and U.S. fail to negotiate a settlement. Among products on the list will be agricultural goods, including some wines, household and consumer goods, textiles and apparel, wood and paper products and electrical appliances, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. A final list, expected to be shorter, will be published Dec. 15.  His comments came as EU foreign ministers approved proposals to launch talks with the U.S. on reducing trade barriers. But French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said this so-called action plan for a trans-Atlantic economic partnership could be jeopardized by U.S. sanctions. "The trans-Atlantic partnership depends on the United States renouncing unilateral sanctions," Mr. Vedrine said.
