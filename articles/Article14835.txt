 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Compiled by Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1991  His policy is an embarrassment as Iraqi dissidents are crushed. "We're back to the old George Bush who is a lot more comfortable dealing with chiefs of state than with rebels," charges Ann Lewis, a Democratic consultant who backed Bush on the war. GOP analyst Kevin Phillips predicts Bush's policy "will speed his decline in the polls, albeit from a very high starting level."  Bush advisers argue that Americans' distaste for involvement in Iraq's internal morass outweighs sympathies for the rebels. GOP pollster Richard Reed suspects another reason officials wish to hold back: "I don't think they want to tamper with consumer optimism" that has surged after the war. Calls for tougher action by Democrats who opposed the war are seen as hypocritical.  House Democratic leaders, who oppose the Social Security tax cut, may stall all tax legislation to which the proposal could be attached. Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen also resists the tax cut, fearing Democrats would be accused of undermining the Social Security system. Bush aides say they won't hesitate to make that argument.
