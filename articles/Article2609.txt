 Federated Loses Round in Court Battle Against Search Firm as Suit Is Dismissed   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1999  Stern's had accused Mines of tortious interference for luring away Mr. (Matthew) Serra, who had an unexpired four-year employment contract. He quit last September after more than five years as chairman and CEO of the retailer, which has 25 stores in New York and New Jersey. Stern's claimed the court held jurisdiction because it is an Ohio corporation and Mines had handled seven executive searches for three Ohio companies since 1996.  But Stern's "principal place of business is in New Jersey and Serra was hired away from Stern's New Jersey operation," Judge (Herman J.) Weber wrote in a 17-page decision. "Plaintiff did not cause a tortious injury in this state but allegedly injured Stern's in New Jersey," the ruling continued. "The fact that Stern's is incorporated in Ohio does not make Ohio the locus of the injury."
