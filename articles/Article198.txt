The National Football League commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, met with Dexter Manley, the Washington Redskins' defensive end, yesterday in New York and said he would announce Monday whether Manley would be reinstated from a drug suspension. Manley was banned for life last Nov. 18 as a three-time offender, but can appeal for reinstatement after one year.  Bob Woolf, Manley's lawyer, said Tagliabue gave no indication on how he would rule. "It was a very open, very frank, very honest discussion," Woolf said. (AP)  To see the full article, subscribe here.
