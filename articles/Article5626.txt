 A Variable-Annuity Portfolio Beats Funds   By By David Franecki, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  Safeco RST Growth, a variable-annuity portfolio, or "subaccount," returned an annualized 30.2% in the five years ended July 31, or a cumulative 274.4% gain, net fees, according to financial researcher Morningstar Inc.  Variable annuities are essentially mutual funds in an insurance wrapper. They invest like mutual funds, but carry insurance-like benefits, at extra cost. As a subaccount, Safeco RST Growth is the underlying investment portfolio in a number of variable-insurance contracts, including variable annuities. It isn't directly sold by Seattle-based Safeco Corp.  In both the annuity subaccount and the similar no-load mutual fund, Safeco RST Growth portfolio manager Tom Maguire has assembled a smorgasbord of stocks. Small and large, growth and value, the fund holds stocks of all stripes. Mr. Maguire has a taste for small caps because he likes their cheap valuations, but you will also find such names as Philip Morris Cos. and Green Tree Financial Corp. among his top holdings.
