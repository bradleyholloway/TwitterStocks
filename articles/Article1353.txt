 Iraq Slashes Its Oil Production to Meet Domestic Needs Plus Trickle of Exports   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1990  Leading monitors of production by the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries estimated Iraqi output has dropped as low as 600,000 barrels a day. That's barely one-sixth of the 3.5 million barrels the country was pushing out during a brief surge just before the last OPEC meeting in late July.  Current output is covering Iraq's domestic needs, with a little margin to support the tiny flow of exports "leaking" through the near-blockade of the country. The refusal of major oil-buying nations to trade with Iraq means oil tankers aren't showing up at the usual Middle East ports to pick up oil as they normally would. Storage facilities have become choked, leaving Iraq no choice but to cut the flow from its wells.  For a while, world oil supplies are expected to remain plentiful because of indicated production increases elsewhere and high inventories, including a large number of cargoes of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude still at sea. But the reduction in Iraq production suggests an eventual tightening of world oil supplies unless the lost Iraqi oil is replaced by others in OPEC.
