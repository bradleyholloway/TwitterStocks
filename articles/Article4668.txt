 Stock Market's Technical Analysts Get New Respect After Price Drop   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1986  For insights on how to beat the stock market, Boston money manager Dean LeBaron has investigated Zen and even fractal geometry. But there's one thing he has always found just too outlandish: technical analysis.  Technical analysis is the study of stock-price charts for clues about where the market will go next. That approach hasn't made sense to Mr. LeBaron, who oversees $12 billion of institutional portfolios at Batterymarch Financial Management. "These analysts might as well look at random numbers and try to predict the next one," he scoffs. And yet this week's market action leaves him a little unsettled.  The collapse came shortly after John Mendelson, the widely followed chief market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., told clients to sell because his technical indicators had deteriorated. Several other market technicians also turned bearish just before the drop.
