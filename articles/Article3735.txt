 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  The departure leaves Republicans without their best strategist and raises the question of whether the party will continue his hardball tactics. The White House's deputy chief of staff played a leading role in shaping the Bush record, but Rove slipped badly in the past year over Iraq-war policy, immigration reform and the U.S. attorney firings. With Rove gone, the Republican presidential nominee likely will find it easier to separate himself from the unpopular incumbent.  Leahy said the resignation won't end the pursuit of several panels seeking Rove's testimony about the firings of U.S. prosecutors.  Turkey's ruling party picked Gul, an ex-Islamist, as its candidate for president, a move likely to anger the country's secular elite.
