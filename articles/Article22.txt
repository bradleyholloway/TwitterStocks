 Arkla Will Buy Unit of MidCon For $305 Million --- Sale Should Clear the Way For Occidental's Merger With Gas Pipeline Firm   By By Matt Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1986  Arkla Inc. said it agreed to acquire MidCon Corp.'s Mississippi River Transmission Corp. subsidiary for about $305 million.  The company also will assume about $47 million in long-term debt. Lombard, Ill.-based MidCon said the sale should clear the way for its previously announced merger with Occidental Petroleum Corp. for $3 billion in cash and stock. MidCon agreed last week with the Federal Trade Commission to divest itself of the unit to resolve antitrust issues arising from the proposed merger.  Analysts said that Shreveport, La.-based Arkla's acquisition of Mississippi River's 2,200-mile pipeline system, which stretches from eastern Texas to central Illinois, will allow Arkla to move its large supplies of low-cost gas into metropolitan St. Louis and other attractive Midwest markets.
