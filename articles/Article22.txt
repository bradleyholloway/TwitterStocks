NICOSIA, Cyprus, Jan. 18â€” Saudi Arabia will renew temporary crude oil supply contracts with 11 of the 12 countries it had been aiding after their fuel supplies were reduced by the Iran-Iraq war, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Sunday.  Shipments would cover the first three months this year. In a report quoting unidentified ''reliable sources,'' the weekly newsletter said Japan, previously the largest recipient, getting 140,000 barrels a day, was excluded because of reports of irregularities in setting oil prices for buyers of the crude.  The war relief contracts, involving a total of about 600,000 barrels daily, had covered the last quarter of 1980. The buyers were France, Italy, Brazil, Greece, Spain, Turkey, Yugoslavia, India, Pakistan, Morocco and Somalia.
