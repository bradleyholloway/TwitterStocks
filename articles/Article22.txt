TRINITY CHURCH was packed with organ worshippers Monday night. It was not surprising given the confluence of musical assets the evening offered.  First there were the power and clarity of Trinity's instrument, then music by Bach, Mozart, Schumann, Liszt, Franck and Durufle and finally the playing of Simon Preston, organist of Westminster Abbey.  In his phrasing and use of rhythm, Mr. Preston is a sober and direct musician; but he managed to make Mozart's F-minor Fantasia a dramatic occasion and Liszt's Prelude and Fugue on B A C H a booming exercise in Romantic extravagance. The fineness of Mr. Preston's technique and the remarkable lack of distortion in Trinity's acoustics worked wonders here.  Mr. Preston's program was careful in its contrasts, with Bach's brilliant Fantasia on ''Komm heiliger Geist'' set against the limpid abstractions of the Canonic Variations on ''Von Himmel Hoch'' and Schumann's jovial B-minor canon and the quiet lyricism of Franck's Cantabile juxtaposed with Durufle's brilliant Toccata from the Suite, Opus 5. The audience gave Mr. Preston a standing ovation at the end.
