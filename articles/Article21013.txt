 Tokyo Share Prices Post Sharp Decline; Major Correction Could Be Under Way --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1986  Prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday, sending the Nikkei stock average to its second-biggest loss ever in terms of points.  The sharp drop left some traders and analysts with the belief that the market has entered a full-fledged correction. Shoji Oshima, the manager of the Tokyo branch of Vickers da Costa, a British securities firm, said a decline has set in because share prices have risen too fast this year.  Traders said profit-taking in the stocks of a few of Japan's major industrial companies triggered broad selling by nervous investors. Such companies, including Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., a maker of ships and heavy machinery, and Nippon Kokan K.K., a steelmaker, have accounted for as much as one-third of the volume during recent morning and afternoon sessions, the traders said.
