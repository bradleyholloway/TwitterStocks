 Equities' Woes Brighten Treasurys --- Stock-Market Downturn Prompts Investors to Move To a Realm Seen as Safer   By By Steven Vames, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2002  Meanwhile, issuance Friday included Golden West Financial Corp.'s sale of $300 million of five-year debt via Lehman Brothers. The notes yield 4.202%, or 0.90 percentage point over Treasurys, and are rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and single-A by Standard & Poor's.  In the junk-bond market, Manitowoc Co., a maker of equipment for the food-service and construction industries, sold $175 million of 10-year Rule 144a senior subordinated notes via Deutsche Bank Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston. Noncallable for five years, the notes were priced to yield 10.50%, or 6.13 percentage points over Treasurys. The debt was rated single-B-2 by Moody's and single-B-plus by S&P.  In the mortgage-backed securities sector, most issues underperformed Treasurys as falling market interest rates kept investors focused on the risk of prepayments. Investors in mortgage-backed bonds may suffer losses if interest rates drop enough to spur refinancings of home-mortgage loans backing the bonds, leading to redemption well ahead of expected maturity.
