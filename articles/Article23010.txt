 Currency Trading: Dollar Gains Modestly on Euro On Bush's Talk of Strong Currency   By By Agnes T. Crane and Grainne McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2003  After shooting higher in the wake of President Bush's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to a strong currency, the dollar ended the New York day only moderately higher against the euro.  Much of the dollar's slippage from its session highs appeared to stem from a sense that Mr. Bush -- while apparently supporting a strong U.S. currency -- hasn't shifted from the administration's perceived benign support for a weaker dollar, which helps shore up exporters and lift the sluggish U.S. economy.  While Mr. Bush's statements may appear to differ from the stance taken publicly by Mr. [John Snow], analysts believe they actually don't. In fact, in a roundabout way, Mr. Bush has assured, if anything, that further adjustment in currency markets will remain fairly gradual, which should continue to help U.S. exporters by making their products more competitive abroad and help lift the U.S. economy before the 2004 presidential election.
