 Reagan Names Angell, Johnson To Fed Board --- Nominees Have Criticized Recent Monetary Policy, May Urge Looser Stand   By By Alan Murray and Jane Mayer, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1985  Mr. Angell, 55 years old, would take the seat vacated by Lyle Gramley, who left the board Sept. 1. Mr. Johnson, 36, would succeed Charles Partee, whose term expires Jan. 31. Both nominees are expected to win the required Senate confirmation.  As members of the powerful Fed board of governors, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Angell would have the opportunity to play an important role in forming monetary policy in coming years. Both have been critical of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker's policies, and possibly could try to nudge the central bank toward looser monetary policies.  The nomination of Mr. Johnson is a victory for supply-side economists and politicians, who contend Mr. Volcker's anti-inflation policies have slowed economic growth. Mr. Johnson is considered a member of the supply-side camp, and as a Treasury official, frequently has been critical of Mr. Volcker's tight-money policies.
