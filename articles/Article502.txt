 9 P.M. (Comedy Central) COMEDY CENTRAL PRESENTS -- Rickey Smiley (left) specializes in down-home Southern humor. His prank phone-call routines include ''Hogs Need Oxygen,'' ''Window Fan,'' ''Donut Wreath'' and ''Granny Viagra.'' He does a half-hour on his favorite topics in the 10th-season premiere of this stand-up series, taped at the Hudson Theater in Manhattan. Then, at 9:30, Ty Barnett will hold forth, probably on race, religion and family (''My grandma is the only person I know with a tattoo of the Last Supper''). In the past he has explained that being black was tough from the beginning - when the doctor made him cut his own umbilical cord.   8 P.M. (NBC) 2006 OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES -- On Day 7 of the competitions in Turin, Italy, tonight's events are figure skating (ice dancing), snowboarding (women's cross final), Alpine skiing (women's combined), skeleton (men's) and ski jumping (large hill).   8 P.M. (USA) LAW & ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT -- A rich book publisher is murdered in this 2002 episode, and a young author of his may have been involved. But, as Detectives Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Eames (Kathryn Erbe, above right, with Mr. D'Onofrio) investigate, it turns out that the author may not even exist. JT Leroy will probably watch.   8 P.M. (Sci Fi) STARGATE SG-1 -- Genetically engineered alien insects. And they turn carnivorous.   8:10 P.M. (IFC) THE OPPOSITE OF SEX (1998). Reviewing this film in The New York Times, Janet Maslin called Christina Ricci's character ''Lolita's evil twin.'' Ms. Ricci stars in this joyfully vicious satire as a very unpleasant teenager who goes to visit her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and steals his boyfriend (Ivan Sergei). Lisa Kudrow plays the brother's last boyfriend's sister, who hates sex. Johnny Galecki, currently appearing in the Second Stage hit ''The Little Dog Laughed,'' plays a gay student who decides to blackmail his teacher.   11 P.M. (HBO) REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER -- Season premiere. The highly political Mr. Maher (right) and his guests, who will include the fearless White House correspondent Helen Thomas, plan to discuss various topics on this live show. One of them is definitely going to be Vice President Dick Cheney's recent hunting trip.
