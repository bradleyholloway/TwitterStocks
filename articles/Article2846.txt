 Animal Activists Protest EU Plan to Prop Up Prices --- Destruction of Healthy Cows To Counter a Beef Glut Is Proving Controversial   By By Geoff Winestock and Konstantin Richter, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  What they didn't count on was the passion of animal-welfare activists like Ines Odaischi, a German Evangelical Church minister in Mannheim, near Frankfurt. Ms. Odaischi, who grew up on a farm and says cows are like "brothers and sisters," has been circulating petitions and faxing letters to politicians to protest the EU's plan to burn beef in order to bring European beef supplies closer to demand.  Ms. Odaischi is a member of a broad coalition of animal-rights activists and religious leaders who have taken to the streets, pulpits and talk shows of Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to condemn the EU's agricultural policy. The coalition has disrupted the implementation of a program meant to offer relief to farmers who are suffering financially from the mad-cow scare. And the activists are likely to force governments to spend hundreds of millions of unbudgeted euros on an alternative.  The EU moved last month to salvage the program, revising it to allow governments to store rather than burn beef until the EU can find a market for it. Under this renamed "special purchase scheme," millions of cows would still be killed, but animal-rights campaigners say that it is morally preferable because the slaughtered cows could be used -- eventually -- to feed people. (Germany is trying to figure out how to donate the beef to North Korea.) Member governments are to discuss and perhaps vote on the revised plan Friday.
