 For Some Mutual-Fund Investors, Losses Are Getting Rubbed In by Penalty Fees   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2001  Zurich Scudder, while declining to comment on the specifics of that situation, notes that a declining balance due to fund performance wouldn't trigger such a letter, but switching a small balance between funds could. The firm, a unit of Zurich Financial Services Group, last year increased its weeding out of some accounts below $2,500, urging investors to make monthly investments to boost their balances if necessary. "It's pretty industry standard to make sure we don't have a bunch of small accounts," a spokeswoman says.  To be sure, some fund firms are resisting fee increases. In its funds' prospectuses, Janus Capital Corp., another Stilwell unit, "reserves the right" to charge a $10 annual fee for fund balances below $2,500, but a spokeswoman says Janus hasn't done so. And Vanguard doesn't collect its $10 fee when a stock-market decline -- as opposed to investor withdrawals -- causes balances to slip below its minimums.  Fidelity customers with balances under $2,000 in a fund face the possibility of an additional $12 fee this fall when the company takes its annual measurement of investors' accounts. Fidelity customers whose accounts are too small have usually either paid the fee, increased their balance or chosen to leave the firm. But a spokeswoman for the No. 1 fund firm in terms of assets managed says "the vast majority" of its customers have fund balances higher than $2,000.
