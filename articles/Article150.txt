The Twenty-Seventh City By Jonathan Franzen 517 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $19.95.  The 27th city in Jonathan Franzen's wildly ambitious first novel is named St. Louis.

It provides the backdrop for Mr. Franzen's spawling epic about political conspiracy and social conflict in America today.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
