 CBOT-Eurex Partnership Plan Faces Problems   By By Peter A. McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1999  Instead, the plan may be in jeopardy as the world's two largest futures exchanges begin two days of previously scheduled meetings in Burgenstock, Switzerland. At issue are five amendments that Eurex, a German-Swiss all-electronic exchange, proposed recently to the deal CBOT members approved in June to link the markets online.  "It is our belief that major developments have taken place . . . that are significant enough in order to require a reassessment of our agreement," Eurex Chief Executive Officer Jorg Franke and CEO of Deutsche Bourse Werner G. Seifert wrote in an Aug. 20 letter to CBOT Chairman David P. Brennan. (Deutsche Bourse is one of the parent companies of Eurex.)  The two went on to propose that CBOT and Eurex form a separate unit to manage their joint efforts, particularly CBOT's electronic trading. Eurex would pick a majority of the joint venture's board members, while CBOT would pick the chief executive.
