 Big Board's Member Firms Had Losses Totaling $622 Million in 2nd Quarter   By By Anita Raghavan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1994  The New York Stock Exchange said member firms that do business with the public posted a pretax loss of $622 million in the second quarter -- the first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1990.  But an interesting revelation in the Big Board report is that when it comes to cutting costs, there's more talk than action on Wall Street. Although member firms' revenues fell 8.4% to $16.42 billion, expenses climbed 9.4% to $17.05 billion.  Some of the higher costs were due to increased interest expense. As short-term interest rates have risen since the start of the year, brokerage firms have had to pay more for the money they borrow to carry inventory positions.
