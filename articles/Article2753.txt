 Democratic Convention 2000: Gore Is Expected to Hammer on Health Care --- Democrats Hope Convention Will Highlight His Strength on Issue   By By Laurie McGinley and Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2000  The selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Mr. [Gore Bush]'s running mate also may muddy the matter. The Gore campaign labels Mr. Bush as a pharmaceuticals-company shill, and cites heavy campaign contributions from the drug industry to the GOP. But Mr. Lieberman ranks sixth in the Senate for the contributions he's received from drug companies, according to a study by Public Citizen, the consumer group founded by Ralph Nader. Mr. Lieberman received $102,850 from pharmaceuticals political action committees over the last eight years, and another $34,750 from industry executives.  In that respect, prescription-drug coverage is probably Mr. Gore's strongest issue. Many senior citizens complain of steep drug bills -- and their children understand how strapped their parents have become. Mr. Gore proposes a Medicare drug benefit that would cover half the cost of prescription drugs, up to $5,000 in drug costs. He also would have Medicare pay all the cost of drugs after a beneficiary has paid $4,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. The plans would cost $253 billion over 10 years, Mr. Gore estimates.  The Gore campaign believes that their attacks and press criticism ultimately will force Mr. Bush to provide details. If not, Mr. Gore can make an issue of it in the presidential debates, where he is at his best drawing broad points about his opponent's character and fitness for office by analyzing policy differences. "Either Bush emerges and steps in the quicksand of Medicare," says Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani, "or he doesn't, which says he doesn't understand the issues."
