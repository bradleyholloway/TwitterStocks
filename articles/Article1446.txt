 Letters to the Editor: Curing America's Own Socialist Ills   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1991  I could not agree more with the conclusion in your editorial about federal housing policy ("Poor Housing," Feb. 7). Federal housing policy has long helped perpetuate the social ills it ostensibly was trying to cure. But you erroneously implied that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has blocked innovative ideas in Philadelphia and Baltimore to replace high-rise structures with new, low-rise housing.  In reality, it is Congress that requires one-for-one replacement of demolished public housing, and it is Congress that has denied HUD the authority to replace demolished public housing with tenant-based assistance such as vouchers or with rehabilitated private housing -- even though these options can serve twice as many people for the same cost as new public-housing construction and can empower tenants with choice of where to live. The law also requires that modernization funds be used exclusively for public-housing rehabilitation, even though we would prefer to use those funds for other housing options that are more cost-efficient and beneficial.
