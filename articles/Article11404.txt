 USX Hails Project In Dying Steel Town As a Return to Roots --- But the People of Braddock, Carnegie's First Mill Site, Do Not Expect a Rebirth   By By Dana Milbank, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1990  The company says the investment -- in a continuous slab caster by its USS steelmaking division -- ensures the survival of steel in the industry's cradle, the depressed Mon Valley region near Pittsburgh. The steel giant had considered abandoning the region entirely during steel's skid in the 1980s.  There aren't many steelworkers left in Braddock to celebrate, though. In the past decade, USX reduced employees in the area to 4,000 in three plants from 30,000 in five plants as the company focused its activities more on flat-rolled sheet steels for such customers as auto and appliance makers. The union says the new caster will actually cut employment by as much as 400, but the alternative -- shutting down -- was worse.
