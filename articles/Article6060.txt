 Ex-Lyonnais Head Quizzed by Police Over Big Losses   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1998  The losses, estimated at between 120 billion francs and 200 billion francs ($20 billion to $33 billion), have sparked numerous probes, but this is the first time investigators have detained Jean-Yves Haberer, the former chairman of Credit Lyonnais and of a key subsidiary, Altus Finance.  The 66-year-old Mr. Haberer is being questioned as part of an investigation into whether Altus played an improper role in the bankruptcy of a wholesale food distributor, Financiere Marland, and its units, judicial authorities said. Mr. Haberer couldn't be reached for comment. In the past he has denied any wrongdoing.
