 Meese's Avoidance of Criminal Charges Won't End Justice Department Turmoil   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1988  An independent prosecutor's announcement last week that he doesn't plan to seek an indictment means that Mr. Meese will retain his post as long as he -- and his old friend President Reagan -- are willing to put up with an anticipated steady barrage of criticism and personal attacks.  Although prosecutor James McKay said he expects that his investigation technically will continue "at least through the end of April," prosecutors already are wrapping up their work and preparing to write their report "covering all the matters which have been under investigation." Law enforcement officials have no expectations that Mr. Meese will face any charges.  Moreover, Mr. Meese already has become an inviting target for Democratic presidential candidates. And Vice President George Bush, who has tried to distance himself from the issue, is bound to face increasing pressure to criticize Mr. Meese's ethics and the decision by the White House to let him remain in office.
