 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  The rules require cargo manifests to be filed with U.S. Customs 24 hours before a U.S.-bound vessel leaves the dock, as opposed to two weeks after it sets sail, as had been common practice. After the deadline, ocean carriers will be faced with either holding noncompliant shipments at Hong Kong's docks or possibly being fined or having their cargo detained when it reaches the U.S.  U.S. Customs figures showed about 50,000 cargo containers set sail for the U.S. from Hong Kong each month in 2001 -- the most recent year for which data are available -- more than from any other port. Many fear even a small disruption in the flow could wreak havoc with the just-in-time delivery schedules that have become the mainstay of U.S. manufacturers and retailers.  Germany's central role in the war on terrorism was highlighted again yesterday when prosecutors charged a Turkish man and his U.S. fiancee with conspiring to attack a U.S. military base last year. Also yesterday, authorities banned a Central Asian-based group, Hizb ut-Tahrir, accusing it of extremism and spreading anti-Semitic propaganda in universities.
