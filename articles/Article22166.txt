 Legal beat: Panel of experts to study breast implants   By Schmitt, Richard B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1996  US District Judge Sam Pointer on May 31, 1996 named a search team to help find neutral experts who would be available to advise judges and juries around the country on scientific evidence on the health effects of silicone-gel breast implants, in a rare move that could affect the course of the sprawling litigation. The decision comes as more and more implant cases are being set for trial, and as women are having to consider whether to accept a pending industry settlement offer.
