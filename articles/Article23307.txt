 Investing in Metals Hits a Fever Pitch; Wall Street Woos The Small Investor, But Know the Risk   By DeBaise, Colleen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  "We have investors who think they want [metals] but don't understand the risk of volatility in the marketplace," says Fred Whaley, managing director of Raymond James Financial Inc.'s alternative-investments group in St. Petersburg, Fla.
