 Class-Action Is Approved Against DaimlerChrysler   By By Ann Keeton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 2003  Michael Schell, attorney for DaimlerChrysler, called the judge's certification of the class action "routine." He said the company believes the suit has no merit because the transaction was in fact a merger of equals. Mr. Schell also said that shareholders suffered no damages and that the suit came after a one-year statute of limitations expired on litigation related to the merger.
