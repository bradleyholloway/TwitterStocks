Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply yesterday under what analysts said was the influence of another increase in the prime lending rate and forecasts of improved growing conditions and a bumper crop of winter wheat.  Precious metals prices experienced a steep drop as a result of the higher interest rates, analysts said, while the financial futures market ignored the higher prime rate and posted losses based on expectations of further tightening of the money supply.  The key financial news was the announcement that New York's Chase Manhattan Bank increased its prime lending rate to 19 1/2 percent from 19 percent, according to Bob Lekberg, analyst for Shearson Loeb Rhoades in Chicago. Chase's increase was soon matched by other major banks.  Soybean futures led the decline on the Chicago Board of Trade. Traders said one commercial house sold 6 million bushels, initiating a downtrend that was followed by speculators.  Renewed strength of the dollar exerted pressure on soybean markets, Mr. Lekberg said, as the European soybean trade reportedly came almost to a standstill in the wake of Socialist Francois Mitterrand's election as President of France.  According to a source on the trading floor, chart watchers believe the June soybean contract's plunge through the $7.75 price level could signal the beginning of a further decline in prices.  Corn futures prices fell under pressure from commercial selling, traders said. Oats futures chalked up gains in nearby contract months. Traders said the market was dominated by a small number of commercial firms whose intentions were not clear.  A freeze over the weekend caused some damage to wheat and oats crops, analysts said, and futures prices in those grains fell amid speculation that the cold weather would result in diminished yields.  At the close, wheat futures were 1/4 cent to 4 1/4 cents lower, with the May contract at $4.07 1/4 a bushel; corn futures were 2 1/2 cents to 5 cents lower, with the May contract at $3.48 3/4 a bushel; oats were 3 1/4 cents lower to 3 3/4 cents higher with the May contract at $2.18 1/4 a bushel; and soybeans were 10 3/4 cents to 16 3/4 cents lower, with the May contract at $7.51 1/4 cents a bushel.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold was $8 to $10 lower, with the contract for current delivery at $483.50 an ounce, and silver was 27 cents to 31 cents lower, with the May contract at $11.17 an ounce.  At the close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were 0.55 cent to 1.05 cents lower, with the June contract at 69.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.10 cent to 1.50 cents lower, with the May contract at 67 cents a pound; hogs were 0.17 cent to 0.47 cent higher, with the May contract at 48.95 cents a pound; and pork bellies were 0.40 cent to 1.47 cents higher, with the May contract at 50 cents a pound.
