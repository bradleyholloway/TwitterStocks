 Style & Substance: Knockoffs Go Suburban; 'Purse Parties' Are the Place Soccer Moms Go to Buy Fakes; 'Bag Ladies' Face Arrest, Jail   By Ingrassia, Caitlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2004  As the hostess, Ms. [JANE DETORRE] received the equivalent of 20% of the woman's $1,000 in sales that evening, in the form of free merchandise, including three bags and a wallet. Ms. DeTorre says she doesn't believe she did anything illegal by holding the purse party. "I didn't sell any bags, and no money [was] exchanged [through] my hands," she said. "The bags and wallet I acquired were a gift for opening my home to the party."  Back at the Middletown purse party, legal concerns didn't seem to damp spirits when the bag lady arrived. She set up two large folding tables, two coat racks (for displaying scarves and small bags) and opened up six colorful burlap sacks, each filled with about 10 purses, plus wallets and scarves. Guests browsed over the next two hours; most left with a bag, and some bought as many as three. Hot-sellers were knockoffs of [Kate Spade]'s $195 "Sam Bag"; Prada's $265 silk hobo and Louis Vuitton's $735 Ellipse.  No one interviewed complained of guilt pangs. On the contrary, they said it was fun and exciting to find the most authentic-looking imitation. "I don't care that I'm buying fake," said Toni Hayes, owner of a Middletown beauty salon. "I see the bags at that price and I'm like, 'Oh yeah, oh yeah!' "
