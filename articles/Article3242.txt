 World Watch   By Compiled by David I. Oyama, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1999  NEWBRIDGE CAPITAL Ltd. agreed last week to pay 500 billion won ($416 million) for a 51% stake in Korea First Bank of South Korea. An item in yesterday's World Watch column misstated the purchase price as $416 billion. (WSJ Sept. 22, 1999)  Thai Farmers Bank said it plans to set up a new company to manage the assets of Phatra Thanakit, its ailing nonbank lending unit, for five years, after which the new company will be liquidated. Thai Farmers' president, Banthoon Lamsam, said the central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund, or FIDF, will inject between 4.3 billion baht and 4.4 billion baht ($107 million and $110 million) into Phatra Thanakit to allow it to make full provisions against its nonperforming loans. Phatra Thanakit's assets will then be transferred to the new company, which will be fully owned by Thai Farmers, the country's No. 3 bank. The new unit will buy Phatra Thanakit's assets based on a price to be calculated after the full provisioning, but Mr. Banthoon didn't elaborate.
