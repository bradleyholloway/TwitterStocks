 Red Cross Cited Detainee Abuse Over a Year Ago; Agency Filed Complaints About Abu Ghraib Prison Months Before U.S. Probe   By Cloud, David S, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2004  Pentagon officials declined to comment, saying that they had a confidentiality agreement with the ICRC that prevented them from discussing the report. The head of the Geneva-based agency's delegation in Washington, Christophe Girod, last night said he couldn't comment on the report, which he said was "confidential" and intended only for the U.S. and its coalition partners.  The report also documents eight instances in which coalition forces opened fire -- in some cases from watchtowers -- on unarmed prisoners, killing seven of them and wounding as many as 20. "These incidents were investigated summarily by the coalition forces," the report states, noting that in all cases the coalition determined that "a legitimate use of firearms had been made."  The ICRC, however, disagreed, saying that in all cases "less extreme measures could have been used to quell the demonstrations," according to the report. In one case, a prisoner throwing stones was shot through the chest by a guard in a watchtower. The military said the shooting was justified. The ICRC, however, said the shooting "showed a clear disregard for human life and security" of prisoners.
