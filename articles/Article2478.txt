 Code of Silence on Burma   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  Three days after Burma's military regime detained 18 foreign human-rights activists, authorities are now allowing diplomats in Rangoon to visit their nationals. With luck, the ruling State Peace and Development Council will live up to its name for once, and deport the activists instead of sending them to jail.  Since some of those detained for handing out leaflets are citizens of Asean member states, a mild slap might avoid the necessity of members breaking the organization's own rules to comment on the internal affairs of a member state. Burma has been the chief beneficiary of this code of silence, so the generals may see the wisdom of safeguarding this handy policy by bringing the activist episode to a quick and tidy close.
