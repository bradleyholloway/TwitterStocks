 Group of Seven Meets Next Week on Dollar's Drop   By Truell, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1990  SEOUL, South Korea -- Senior officials from the Group of Seven industrialized countries will meet in Paris Monday and Tuesday to discuss the dollar's recent decline and to review developments in the world economy, a U.S. Treasury official said.  The meeting comes at a time when the economic slowdown in the U.S. has pushed the value of the dollar down sharply against foreign currencies. The dollar-yen exchange rate, for instance, is at its lowest level this year. The officials will have to decide whether any action is needed to stem the dollar's decline.
