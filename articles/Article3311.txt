 H-P Weighs On Computer Stocks; Wal-Mart Rises   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 13, 2004  Retail was where investors put money to work. Dow industrials component Wal-Mart Stores rose 1.02, or 2%, to 52.65. The world's largest retailer posted a strong increase in fiscal second-quarter profits, citing leaner inventories leading to more full-price selling and cheaper buying costs from sourcing overseas as catalysts in a challenging consumer-spending environment.  Dow Jones Industrial Average component General Electric fell 59 cents, or 1.8%, to 31.61 after saying it agreed to buy the leading Visa credit-card issuer in Russia, DeltaBank, marking GE's entry into that country's consumer-lending business.  Brinker International continued declining after a 7.6% fall Wednesday as the company reduced its outlook for fiscal 2005. Yesterday, some analysts trimmed their estimates, and the stock fell 1.85, or 5.9%, to 29.75. The comments from Wall Street seemed to temper investors' appetite for other restaurant stocks, with Dow Jones Industrial Average member McDonald's dropping 50 cents, or 1.9%, to 25.85, Outback Steakhouse losing 1.39, or 3.5%, to 37.97, and Ruby Tuesday losing 1.02, or 3.7%, to 26.23.
