 Waste Management, Browning-Ferris Are the Subjects of Grand Jury Inquiry   By By Bill Richards, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1987  Sources familiar with the investigation said it centers on units of Waste Management Inc., Oak Brook, Ill., and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., Houston. The panel is looking into allegations that beginning in early 1981 and continuing at least into 1984, Michigan and Ohio-based units of the two companies divided up customers in the Toledo area and rigged bids and fixed prices for garbage-hauling service.  The sources said the grand jury was empaneled last year after Ohio's attorney general, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., filed a civil complaint in federal court in Toledo citing Waste Management and Browning-Ferris for price-fixing and bid-rigging.  The existence of the federal investigation was disclosed in documents filed in U.S. District Court in Toledo last month by Gregg A. Asciutto, one of the Waste Management officials cited in the Ohio civil complaint. Mr. Asciutto, a former general manager of Waste Management's Toledo-based unit, declined to reply to parts of the state's complaint about his role and that of other Waste Management officials in the alleged bid-rigging scheme, citing the federal grand jury's investigation into similar allegations.
