 The Politics of Elian   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  We know that Juan Miguel Gonzalez called his relatives in Miami on November 22 to let them know that his son Elian was on his way to America; a Sprint phone bill confirms the collect call. Three days later, on Thanksgiving morning, Elian was rescued off the Fort Lauderdale coast by two fisherman. Elian's Miami family arrives at the hospital, where his uncle Lazaro confirms the boy's identity and calls Elian's father with the happy news; Juan Miguel asks his uncle to take care of the boy.  The first call for the boy's return to Cuba did not come from Elian's father, but from Fidel Castro's government. On November 27 it delivered a note to the U.S. Mission in Havana seeking the boy's return. Not until that Monday did we hear from the boy's father, who was quoted as having had second thoughts about Elian and now concluded that he'd been kidnapped.  On December 5, demonstrators appeared in front of the U.S. Mission in Havana chanting, "Long live Fidel, Long live the Revolution, down with the Yankees, down with [Bill] Clinton." The rest of the month featured more or less regular mass rallies led by Fidel himself, who was canceling school so kids could march and busing people in from 100 miles away. In sharp contrast, the Cuban-Americans in Miami, accused of having "politicized" the case, didn't hold its own protests until the first week in January.
