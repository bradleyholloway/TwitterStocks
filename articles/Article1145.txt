 Whose Program Is Best? It All Depends   By By Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1989  That doesn't mean OnePass is everyone's best bet. Much depends on who has the most flights out of the nearest airport. That makes the Worldperks program for NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines popular in Minneapolis, while Trans World Airlines' Frequent Flight Bonus is a favorite in St. Louis. Route systems that blanket the country help make AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Air Lines popular with business travelers.
