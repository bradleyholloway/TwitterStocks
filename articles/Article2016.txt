 Greenspan Predicts Economy Will Slow, Says There's Risk of Substantial Downturn --- Fed Chief Thinks Recession Unlikely; Board Poised For Further Rate Cuts   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1989  The Fed chairman's comments were a far cry from his testimony at the beginning of the year, when he warned of the dangers of excessive growth and emphasized the risk of inflation. While noting that inflation still "remains high -- clearly above our objective," he said "the balance of risks may have shifted somewhat away from greater inflation."  The Fed chairman refused to comment directly on his plans for interest-rate policy in the coming weeks. But his testimony made it clear that the Fed is poised for further rate reductions.  Underscoring the shift in Fed policy, Mr. Greenspan also said the central bank has tentatively decided to leave its targets for money growth next year unchanged. In recent years, the Fed has lowered those targets slightly each year to demonstrate its commitment to eliminating inflation. The Fed chairman said the decision to leave the 1990 targets unchanged was "only a pause" in the central bank's efforts to achieve price stability.
