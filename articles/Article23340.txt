 U.S., India Seal Nuclear Deal, but Hurdles Remain; Congress, Supplier Nations Would Have to Endorse Exceptions to Global Treaty   By John D. McKinnon in New Delhi and John Larkin in Mumbai, India, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2006  The two sides must first convince the U.S. Congress and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the 44 nations that sell the most advanced nuclear technology, to lift longstanding restrictions on civil nuclear trade with India. Congress must first amend the Atomic Energy Act to permit nuclear sales to a nation that isn't a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, making an exception for India. The U.S. also will approach supplier nations such as France to amend their guidelines. The nuclear agreement, if approved, would be phased in between 2006 and 2014.  While the India nuclear agreement drew applause from U.S. business groups, the reaction wasn't uniform. Congress has put the White House on notice that it will scrutinize the deal. Key lawmakers have warned that giving an exemption to India -- which secretly developed nuclear weapons and has refused to sign the nonproliferation treaty -- could make it harder to contain the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.  Mr. [Bush] acknowledged that he faces a tough sell on Capitol Hill, but urged lawmakers to look beyond Washington's rocky past with India. "The first thing I will say to our Congress is that our relationship is changing to the better," he said. "People in the United States have got to understand that trade with India is in our interests, that diplomatic relations with India is in our interests."
