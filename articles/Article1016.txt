 Interest-Rate Climb Nicks Small Stocks   By Karen Talley and Mohammed Hadi, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2006  James Furey, head of small-stock strategy at Lehman Brothers, is among those voicing caution on small stocks. He currently has a "neutral" stance on the group. His year-end price target for the [Russell] 2000 is 750; the small-stock benchmark closed Friday at about 726. "We don't think we'll be down, but we don't feel we'll make much money" in small stocks, he says.  Within the small-stock universe, all stocks are clearly not made alike. Mr. [Satya Pradhuman] of Merrill Lynch recently downgraded small-cap semiconductor stocks as a group to "underweight" from "overweight," partly because of concern that expectations for those companies have gotten too lofty.  For investors willing to take a risk, Mr. [Eric Barden] of Texas Capital Value and Growth says the small-stock universe continues to be where you'll find "undiscovered companies with great businesses." One of his favorite investments is tiny Poway, Calif.-based Aldila (ALDA), which makes golf-club shafts that are used by a lot of professional golfers and also appeal to the average duffer.
