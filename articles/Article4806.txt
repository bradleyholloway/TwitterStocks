 Jaws of a Dilemma: London Is in the Grip Of the Denver Boot --- Illegal Parking Has Traffic All Tied Up, So the Police Immobilize the Offenders   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1987  No conveyance capable of a parking violation can be sure of avoiding the dread metal jaws. The Denver boot, as the contraption often is called, was introduced in Colorado in the early 1950s, but London is now the world's clamping capital. Police here use yellow auto cuffs on about 400 cars a day, in an effort to make a point with drivers of the 300,000 cars and trucks estimated to park illegally on the average workday.  In London, no offense is too trivial to risk the boot, whereas in Los Angeles, for example, it takes five unpaid tickets before police move in to paralyze a car. New York waits for three tickets to go unpaid for at least 18 months. New Orleans offers parking scofflaws an informal hearing before resorting to the clamp. But here, the first little infraction invites the car cuffs. Liberating an immobilized car costs a London motorist 37 pounds (more than $60) and hours (sometimes days) of waiting.  London's 14 clamping squads, consisting of a private clamper and a police officer, dispense curb-side justice swiftly. On patrol, Mr. McClay stops his van on a commercial street in the chic Chelsea neighborhood. Hopping out, Officer Bennett spots a driving-school car parked at a yellow curb line. He nods to Mr. McClay, who, with much clanging of keys and chains, locks up the red Austin Metro in 25 seconds flat. "I've done one in 17 seconds," Mr. McClay boasts.
