 Arithmetic Problem: New Report Urges Return to Basics In Teaching Math; Critics of 'Fuzzy' Methods Cheer Educators' Findings; Drills Without Calculators; Taking Cues From Singapore   By Hechinger, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  According to their report, "Curriculum Focal Points," which is subtitled "A Quest for Coherence," students, by second grade, should "develop quick recall of basic addition facts and related subtraction facts." By fourth grade, the report says, students should be fluent with "multiplication and division facts" and should start working with decimals and fractions. By fifth, they should know the "standard algorithm" for division -- in other words, long division -- and should start adding and subtracting decimals and fractions. By sixth grade, students should be moving on to multiplication and division of fractions and decimals. By seventh and eighth grades, they should use algebra to solve linear equations.  Chester E. Finn Jr., the foundation's president and a former top official at the U.S. Department of Education, blamed the earlier math- council guidelines for state standards that neglect the basics. He described the new advice as a "sea change," saying that "it's a little bit like Lutherans deciding to become Catholics after the Reformation."  Ken Mayer, a spokesman for TERC, says many parents have a "misconception" that Investigations doesn't value computation. He says many school systems, such as Boston's, have seen gains in test scores using the program. "Fluency with number facts is critical," he says.
