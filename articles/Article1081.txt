 Bookshelf: Renaissance Number Crunching for Profit   By By Joel E. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1988  In the late 15th century, Venice was the commercial capital of the Western world, the center of a vast network of international trade. The spirit of the period was captured by the merchant Francesco di Marco Datim, who headed every page of his ledgers, "in the name of God and Profit."  To meet the need for commercial computers, reckoning masters in many European cities founded schools for teen-age boys and wrote manuals for them. Unlike the Latin mathematics texts used in universities, which aimed at a small elite, the commercial arithmetic texts were written in vernacular languages for the children of merchants and civil servants. While university texts continued to teach arithmetic in Roman numerals, texts of commercial arithmetic taught the new and controversial Hindu-Arabic numerals, known as "mercantile figures."  The first known dated book of mathematics printed with movable type was a commercial arithmetic text published in Italy, where the demands for it from practical businessmen were greatest. It appeared in 1478 in Treviso, a center of trading and industry a day's travel north of Venice. Lacking both title and author's name, it is known simply as the Treviso Arithmetic.
