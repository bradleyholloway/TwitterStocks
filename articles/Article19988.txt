 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; Reading the Minds of Top Money Managers; Their Favorite Books Cover The Birth of Mass Media And the Story of Aspirin   By Karmin, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2006  This "reality check" on China should be read before someone decides to invest in companies from this emerging economic superpower, says Mr. [David Herro], who has traveled to China at least once a year since the late 1980s. "I'm bullish on China's economic growth," he says, "but that doesn't necessarily translate into being bullish on the stocks."  Part pop economics, part pop sociology, the best seller tries to explain why suede Hush Puppies shoes made a comeback with suburban youth, and how Apple's iPod crushed competing MP3 players from Samsung Electronics and other companies. "Investors don't appreciate the speed of product acceptance and the resulting financial consequences to competitors," Mr. [Reiner Triltsch] says. "That creates opportunity."  George Greig, head of international investing at William Blair & Co. in Chicago, has one of the best foreign stock-investing records. He draws insight from Marshall McLuhan's "Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man" (MIT Press, reprint edition, 1994), the classic 1964 treatise on what was then a new phenomenon of mass media. Long before CNN or the Internet, Mr. McLuhan popularized the terms "global village" and "the medium is the message."
