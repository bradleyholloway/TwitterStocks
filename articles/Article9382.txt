 Toyland Sounds a Call to Arms --- Sales of G.I. Joe, Cap Guns Are Buoyed by Patriotism, To Some Parents' Dismay   By By Joseph Pereira, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2001  Thanks to such sentiment, sales of G.I. Joe doubled in September at KB Toys Inc., the nation's largest mall-based toy retailer. Other military toys are also taking part in the action. Strombecker Corp., the largest maker of toy cap guns in the U.S., says sales in the four weeks after the terrorist attacks were up more than 20% over both the previous four weeks and the comparable period a year earlier. "It was definitely 9/11 related," says Daniel Shure, chief executive of the Chicago company.  All of this is quite a change from recent years, when several states banned the sales of realistic-looking toy guns after police mistook them for the real thing in several incidents and shot children who were wielding them. Toys "R" Us Inc. pulled all toy guns from its shelves nationwide. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. banned realistic models but still carries other toy guns, such as the cap guns Strombecker makes.  Following the 1991 Gulf War, [Joe] faded so badly that Hasbro pulled its kid-oriented line of 3 3/4-inch figures from the market in 1997, leaving a "collector's" line of 12-inch models. This past summer, Hasbro started trying to rev up the miniature line, reintroducing a few of the popular pre-'97 characters. Last month, it also began airing new G.I. Joe commercials, with the familiar "fighting man from head to toe" slogan incorporated in a hip-hop tune.
