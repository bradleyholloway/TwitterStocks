 Vodafone Group of Britain Makes Offer To Buy AirTouch for Over $45 Billion --- Proposal May Spark a Battle With Bell Atlantic Corp. For the Wireless Firm   By By Steven Lipin and Stephanie N. Mehta, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1999  The proposal, which hasn't been made public, sets the stage for a possible battle over San Francisco-based AirTouch, the nation's biggest independent wireless company. AirTouch and Bell Atlantic, which confirmed Sunday that they were in talks, declined to comment, while Vodafone officials couldn't be reached.  A merger between AirTouch and Vodafone, the U.K.'s largest mobile-phone provider, would create a global cellular giant. AirTouch has major overseas holdings, particularly in continental Europe, that would fit with Vodafone's operations in Europe and elswhere.  Vodafone's interest in AirTouch has been well known in telecommunications circles. Indeed, Bell Atlantic and Vodafone have been the two names long rumored to be looking at AirTouch, an entity that was spun off in 1994 from Pacific Telesis Group, the San Francisco-based Baby Bell since swallowed up by SBC Communications Inc.
