 REGIONS: Philadelphia Books Congress For a One-Day Stand July 16   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1987  FOR A SINGLE DAY next summer, the Pennsylvania city that gave birth to Fabian, the cheese steak and the Declaration of Independence will also be able to argue that it is the capital of the United States. On July 16, for the first time ever, Congress will leave the seat of government (Washington, D.C.) and meet in session somewhere else (Philadelphia).  THERE IS A MINOR technicality. Congress hasn't actually voted to make the trip. But a concurrent resolution to travel to Philadelphia passed the Senate unanimously last session, and leaders expect similar resolutions to sail easily through both houses in the next few weeks. The House has already reserved the entire 437-room Hershey Hotel in downtown Philadelphia for the night of July 15, and the Senate is looking at a hotel of its own. U.S. Capitol police have reconnoitered the area for security purposes.  Congress's part of the extravaganza is expected to run something like this: On July 15, members gather in Philadelphia for a reception and dinner ("This could be their first time they've all had dinner together," Ms. Semingson notes.), followed the next day by separate sessions of the House and Senate. Business will be conducted inside an ersatz Capitol -- a 60,000-square-foot structure built of tubular steel with a translucent roof and interior walls decorated to resemble the House and Senate chambers in Washington. The building will be used for various bicentennial events from May to October and then demolished.
