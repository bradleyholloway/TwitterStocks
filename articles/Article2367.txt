 Congress Approves Foreign-Aid Budget Totaling $13.1 Billion, Then Adjourns   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1997  Congress adjourned after approving a $13.1 billion foreign-aid budget stripped of money sought by the White House for the United Nations and International Monetary Fund.

The year-end fight dramatized the long reach and power of abortion politics even amid political and financial instability abroad.  The action came in a last-day rush that saw lawmakers approve a major adoption-law overhaul and a $2.3 billion measure to shore up the finances for the Amtrak passenger line. A $31.8 billion budget for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments was cleared last night, carrying with it amendments affecting immigration law and the census in the year 2000.
