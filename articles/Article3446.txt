 Opel's New Chief Outlines Recovery Plan   By By Scott Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  Since joining Opel on April 1, Mr. [Carl-Peter Forster], previously a board member at BMW AG, has been working with management consultants Booz-Allen Hamilton on the overhaul plan. It's a big job: Opel has lost ground in western Europe as makers such as Volkswagen AG and PSA Peugeot-Citroen have come out with popular designs and highly regarded diesel motors. It also is having trouble in the midsize-car market as luxury brands such as Audi steal market share.  Analysts say Opel may also seek to clarify its relationship with GM's headquarters in Zurich. That office is responsible for coordinating the auto giant's European brands, which include Vauxhall, Saab and a stake in Fiat. Veteran Opel executives have long complained that Zurich interferes in Opel's operations too often, creating internal fights that distract Opel management.
