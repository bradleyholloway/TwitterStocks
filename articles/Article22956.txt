 Nails in the Coffin   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2003  The decisions expand the freedom to sell wine and caskets. The latter victory came in a federal appeals court decision upholding a lower court's finding that a Tennessee law making it a crime to sell caskets without a license was unconstitutional. The other successful challenge was to a state law making it illegal for out-of-state wineries to sell directly to New Yorkers, primarily over the Internet.  We don't plan on ordering caskets anytime soon. But we're happy that the heirs of those who need them will get them at better prices, and that people who had previously been criminalized simply for bringing those caskets to market at lower prices can now make an honest living. And since we live in New York, as soon as Judge [Richard Berman]'s stay is lifted we're thinking about going to the Web and ordering a nice Napa Valley sparkling wine to celebrate.
