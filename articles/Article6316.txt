 Market Fall Puts Damper On Offerings   By By Brenda L. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2000  Recent market volatility has put a damper on what has become an increasingly common strategy among high-tech start-ups -- chasing a successful initial public offering with a quick sale of newly issued and insider-held shares less than a year after the IPO. These so-called follow-on offerings allow companies to bolster their cash reserves and insiders to cash in more quickly than allowed by most lockup rules. (Lockup rules require company insiders and early investors to hold on to their shares for a given period following an IPO -- usually 180 days -- in order to control the flow of the stock.)  Now that many technology stocks have suffered pullbacks from their sky-high valuations, some companies -- such as Ventro, a business-to-business e-commerce company in Mountain View -- have pulled their plans for follow-on offerings altogether. Others, including Finisar of Sunnyvale and InterTrust Technologies of Santa Clara, which held their offerings last week, are settling for smaller proceeds than they originally expected.  Meanwhile, three relatively new firms are poised to launch follow-on offerings this week: Mediaplex, a San Francisco Internet-advertising-technology concern; PCTel, a Milpitas maker of Internet communications software; and QuickLogic, a Sunnyvale semiconductor maker. The way the numbers are stacking up, all three will have to settle for less than their historic highs, all set last quarter. And they will probably collect less than they hoped for when filing for their offerings.
