Senior Government officials said the Lebanese President realized that the United States could not save his deteriorating Government and army with military support. (Page A1, Column 6.) American marines will begin moving from the Beirut airport to ships offshore in two or three days, a senior White House official said. (A14:1-2.)  Only about 12,000 troops of the 22,000 combat troops in the Lebanese Army are still loyal to the Government of President Gemayel after two major defeats in the last 10 days, according to estimates by Lebanese and Western military officials. (A1:4.) U.S. officers continually sent optimistic reports to Washington on the progress they were making in the 14 months that they trained the Lebanese armed forces, according to senior Pentagon and Administration officials. They said most of the progress reports failed to discuss in any detail the doubts that many American instructors had about the Lebanese army's ability to fight. (A1:5.) The first American to win a downhill in Olympic skiing is Bill Johnson of Van Nuys, Calif. In capturing the gold medal in the men's downhill at the XIV Winter Games, the 23-year-old Johnson toppled the European powerhouses of Alpine skiing. (A1:1.) National A ground collapse after a bomb test Wednesday, injuring 12 workers at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons proving ground in Nevada, was attributed to unexpected geological conditions in the desert by the program's manager, Thomas R. Clark. He denied Soviet assertions that the test had violated an unratified Soviet- American agreement not to test nuclear arms more powerful than the equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT, or 150 kilotons. (A1:2-4.) A 10-year school desegregation case was settled in Cincinnati.

The Iowa caucuses next Monday are looked upon by many political strategists to clarify a muddled political situation that prevails in New Hampshire in advance of the nation's first Presidential primary on Feb. 28. Every public opinon poll places Walter F. Mondale in first place in the Democratic primary, but the major question that has strained the predictive skills of the experts is who will be second. (A18:1-2.) Telephone service has declined markedly around the country in the seven weeks since the Jan. 1 breakup of the Bell System and even in the few months or so before, according to customers and some telephone company executives.

Major surprises were the number of specialized, relatively low-budget movies that were nominated for two or more major awards. (C21:1-2.) Metropolitan A state crackdown on health costs was dramatized by a decision by the New York State Health Commissioner, David Axelrod. He has recommended that the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center be denied a nuclear magnetic resonance machine, which is considered the most promising technological advance in diagnostic medicine since the advent of CAT scanners. (A1:2-3.) A release of two narcotics suspects who were being held in Manhattan in $1 million bail was described by the authorities as apparently ''an unfortunate mistake.'' Officials said the two major defendants, Severo Escober-Ortega and Victor Mera-Moscera, were freed on Tuesday when a deputy marshal ''misinterpreted'' a document concerning their bail after a hearing. Officials did not rule out deliberate wrongdoing. (A1:1.) College seminarians may date women under a new policy of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester, which is faced with a shortage of young men who want to become priests.
