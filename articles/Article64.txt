 AIDS Panel Chairman Urges Increase In Spending, Hiring to Fight Epidemic   By By Joe Davidson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1988  The chairman of the presidential AIDS commission, in a forceful report released yesterday, urged a $2 billion increase in annual public spending and the hiring of thousands of additional workers to fight the disease.  The Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic will vote Monday on the report by retired Adm. James Watkins, who expects its endorsement. The report will be delivered to the president the following week.  Adm. Watkins said that 32,000 additional drug-abuse workers may be needed to curb the epidemic, which is spreading rapidly among intravenous drug users; that the number of Food and Drug Administration reviewers for AIDS related products should be "immediately doubled," and that the number of employees involved in clinical trials of AIDS drugs should quickly increase to 120 from 47.
