 Politics & Economics: In Peru, 'Hidden Vote' for Leftist May Tip Election   By Matt Moffett and Robert Kozak, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  Backers of Mr. [Humala], a leftist who worries investors, insist that the answer is yes and that their man will do much better than polls indicate. According to adherents of the hidden-vote theory, Mr. Humala's largely rural and mostly impoverished support base is either overlooked by pollsters or reluctant to speak to them frankly about its preference for the controversial Mr. Humala. Economic populists like Mr. Humala, a former military officer who rose to prominence by staging an unsuccessful rebellion against the government in 2000, have expanded their influence in Latin America in recent years, and the vote in Peru will serve as a test of whether the pendulum is now starting to swing against them.  Many analysts are skeptical that the hidden vote is large enough to turn Peru's election in Mr. Humala's favor. Skeptics note that during April's first round of voting, Peru's pre-election polls were quite close to predicting the results. Mr. Humala got about 31% of the vote, only four points more than polls had indicated.
