 FAA Sees No Y2K Glitches In Air-Traffic-Control Test   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1999  The test, conducted Saturday night, found no problems in any of the systems and confirmed that air-traffic controllers were able to communicate flawlessly with one another after the clock was set forward to the night of Dec. 31. FAA officials had expected a successful outcome because they had gone through four drills of various parts of the test, including a complete dry run in late March.
