 A Day of Terror: Health Workers Launch Effort To Treat Injured   By By Sarah Lueck, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson activated all of the nation's 80 special disaster teams. It was the first-ever general mobilization of the teams, which are set up to help during natural disasters, plane crashes and bombings. The teams, made up of 7,000 private-sector medical personnel, were preparing for deployment to New York and Washington as needed. Other teams, including burn and surgery units, as well as forensic doctors and dentists charged with finding and identifying the dead, were told to be ready.  "A single area can't handle a disaster of this magnitude -- nobody can," said William Cordell, an emergency-room physician from Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. Two doctors and four paramedics from his hospital were among those pulled off duty to go to the East Coast. "Everyone is just going into disaster mode," he said. "We've been aware of this possibility, and plans have been made."  The New York University downtown hospital, less than five minutes from the blast, treated some 300 patients shortly after it occurred. Some had broken bones and lacerations; others required major surgery, said a spokeswoman. At NYU Medical Center's main campus, the emergency room had seen about 100 patients by mid-afternoon -- not the massive influx staff had been expecting. "I have this horrible feeling that we don't have as many wounded. It is a little eerie," said Lynn O'Dell, a spokeswoman.
