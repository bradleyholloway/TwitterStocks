 Digital Equipment Plans to Introduce Color Workstation   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1986  The company said its new VAXstation II/GPX, which will cost between $35,000 and $60,000, performs certain tasks more than twice as quickly as competitively priced workstations. The new workstation, available in April, will complement Digital's year-old monochrome VAXstation, which has sold well. Analysts said Digital's new workstation should sell well too, in part because engineers are used to using Digital's larger VAX computers and the workstations run much of the same computer software.
