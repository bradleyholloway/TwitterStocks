 Letters to the Editor -- Dolphin-Safe Tuna: No Real Net Gain   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1990  Mr. Croft's letter also fails to acknowledge that U.S. fishermen have pioneered dolphin-safety techniques and technology. America's tuna fleet has a 99.4% dolphin-safety record -- three to four times better than foreign fishermen. Every day, American tuna fishermen jump into the water to rescue dolphins. Indeed, the U.S. fleet's annual dolphin kill represents only one-half of what is permitted under federal law. Federal observers are on board for every trip taken by an American tuna boat. Few foreign boats are equipped with the special safety netting that American fishermen invented; fewer still have observers on board.
