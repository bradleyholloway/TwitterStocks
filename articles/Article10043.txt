 Developing Nation: Japanese Clothiers Update Their Lines; Changes in Diet Produce Curvier Bodies in Women; The 'Love Bra' Catches Fire   By Chozick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2007  All over Japan, retailers are scrambling to keep up with a new look known as "bon-kyu-bon." It means "big-small-big" and it signals a change in the way Japanese women look: They're getting curvier.  Other young women are buying special items to flaunt their new physique. "It's just more fun to show some skin," says Ayami Arii, a 19-year-old vocational-school student, who recently sported a tiny denim miniskirt and an iridescent pushup bra that peeks out from below her low-cut blouse. Her bra, a big seller at boutiques in Tokyo's Shibuya 109 department store, is called a "Showy Bra." Similar to a string bikini top, the $60 bras, made to be peeking out of a low-cut blouse, started appearing last year and come in a variety of colors, from red patent leather to leopard print and orange sequins.  "If I'm feeling confident, I'll show it off," says Ms. [Toraiwa], "but lately a lot of it just depends on what my boyfriend likes."
