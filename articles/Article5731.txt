 Leaders Worry `Some In-Some Out' Plan For Currency Union Spells Conflict   By By Charles Goldsmith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1995  European Union leaders are increasingly worried that allowing some EU member states to remain outside a monetary union could be a recipe for currency instability and trade conflict.  Some EU leaders who gathered here for a minisummit want an urgent debate on the issue at the union's Cannes summit at the end of the month. And new French President Jacques Chirac, the summit host, acknowledged that implications of the EU's multispeed approach to a currency union hadn't been fully thought out.  "We should have a discussion in Cannes about what we should do if some countries are inside [a single currency] and some are outside," Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said Friday night, after EU leaders dined at the Elysee Palace on stuffed rouget with basil, chicken with truffles and sauteed mushrooms. Expressing concern about "instability on the markets," he said the EU "will have to create monetary coexistence that the markets can't disturb."
