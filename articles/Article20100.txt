 When the Market Shudders, It's Quality Time   By Gregory Zuckerman and Jaclyne Badal, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  "I tell clients to expect more swings like this, because there are more aggressive 'hedgies' in the market now, and they operate differently," Mr. [Andersen] says. "So brace yourself."  "As far as I can tell, no one gave a [sell] signal Monday," says Mr. [Mark Hulbert]. "Had they really felt that this was coming, they wouldn't have been building back their exposure." (Hulbert Financial Digest is owned by MarketWatch, which, like The Wall Street Journal, is a unit of Dow Jones.)  After the Tuesday tumble, he says, "We asked ourselves a simple question: What's changed? Our simple answer was really 'nothing.'" He likes Cisco Systems (CSCO) and mutual fund Legg Mason Value Trust (LMVTX).
