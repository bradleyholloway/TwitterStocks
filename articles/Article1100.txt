 Highway Headache: An Epidemic of Fires In Ambulances Defies Efforts to Find a Cure --- Recalls and a Federal Probe Leave Owners Frustrated And Ford Motor Groping --- Off to the Rescue at 30 MPH   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger and Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1988  Ford has quit making new ambulance chassis with gasoline engines, using only diesels, which use less volatile fuel. Even with that switch, however, it will take years for all current models to fade away. Just now, Ford is recalling the old vehicles once again for new repairs that it insists this time will do the trick. With the onset of colder weather, fire incidents have waned, as they did the past two fall-winter seasons. But even so, just last Thursday evening another ambulance with a Ford chassis caught fire in Richmond, Va., while its crew was picking up a patient inside his house. The unoccupied ambulance and its equipment, worth $120,000, were destroyed.  Critics allege corporate and regulatory indifference. "Ford is worried about the overall cost as opposed to safety," charges Warren Isman, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. The government "has been very slow-paced," complains Robert Forbuss, president of the American Ambulance Association. Both chide the NHTSA and Ford for not spending more time and money earlier on causes and solutions and for not better informing owners. They also criticize Ford for not better supporting its dealers during the recall process.  Ford and federal regulators defend their efforts to solve what they say is a technically and bureaucratically complex problem. "We are really trying hard on this one," says John P. King, Ford's chief service engineer. Diane Steed, the NHTSA's administrator, says her agency's progress is slow because "there are so many players." Instead, Ford and the agency blame mistakes by the dozens of companies that convert Ford chassis to ambulances, and poor maintenance by ambulance owners.
