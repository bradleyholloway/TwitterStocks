 O'Neill Praises Financial Systems' Resilience   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said U.S. financial systems reacted "extraordinarily well" after terrorists attacked the U.S.  "Our nation's financial markets are strong and resilient. In the face of today's tragedy, the financial system functioned extraordinarily well, and I have every confidence that it will continue to do so in the days ahead," Mr. O'Neill said from Japan, where he had been participating in bilateral meetings with the Japanese government. The Treasury said he will remain there until further notice. U.S. financial markets including the New York Stock Exchange shut down and will stay closed today.
