 Unisys Reports 20% Drop in Net For 2nd Period --- Computer Concern's Profit Didn't Meet Estimates, But Revenue Rose 3.5%   By By Laurie Hays, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1995  Unisys Corp. reported disappointing earnings on a slight revenue gain, and set another reorganization of the struggling computer concern as well as the departure of a top executive.  In the second quarter, net income fell 20% to $39.8 million, or six cents a share, compared with $49.9 million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-ago period, which included earnings from Unisys' former defense unit. Earnings from continuing operations, without the $27.2 million defense gain, rose 75% to $39.8 million, or six cents a share, from $22.7 million, or a loss of four cents a share a year ago.  Despite the large gain in profit on continuing operations, earnings were below Wall Street's expectations and Unisys' promises. Unisys shares fell 50 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
