 China's Foreign Minister Will Resign, Pledges to Sign Political Rights Pact   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 13, 1998  One of China's most effective internationalists, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, said he will retire and announced a parting gift: a commitment to sign a United Nations pact on political rights.  For the U.S., the move could alter the balance in the perennial debate between business groups -- which generally want to improve ties with economically dynamic China -- and proponents of narrower economic links with China because of its record of human-rights abuses.  Mr. Qian didn't provide a timetable for the move, but his statement came days before the U.N. Human Rights Commission convenes in Geneva. For several years, the U.S. and other Western countries have used the annual meeting to criticize China for its poor human-rights record; their motions never pass. The announcement also comes as Washington and Beijing are finishing plans for a June visit to China by President Clinton.
