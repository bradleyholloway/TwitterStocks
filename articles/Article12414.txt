 Clinton Leaves the Door Open to a Tax Hike   By By Gareth Davis and Mark Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1999  "The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is not to . . . raise payroll-tax rates," Mr. (President) Clinton said. But as the president well knows, there are two ways to raise payroll taxes: by boosting the rate, or by increasing the amount of wages subject to the tax (it currently applies only to the first $72,600). By not ruling out any payroll-tax increase, the president signaled that raising or eliminating the Social Security wage cap might be an acceptable policy option.  Indeed, some policy makers have already proposed such an increase -- an idea that could gain momentum as more people realize that the president's Social Security plan does little to improve the program's finances. But what would happen if the Social Security wage cap were removed?  Despite its enormous cost, removing the tax cap would not save Social Security from bankruptcy. According to the office of the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, removing the cap in 1999 would extend Social Security's financial lifetime by only six years, until 2019 rather than 2013. Social Security would also continue to run a deficit -- projected at $1.2 trillion in 2046, as compared with $1.5 trillion under current law.
