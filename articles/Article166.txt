 Stocks End Mixed Despite Rise In Bond Prices on Fed Decision   By By Caitlin Mollison, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1993  The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the 3500 level again, ending 14.95 points, or 0.43%, higher at 3507.78, after some manic swings intraday. The industrials shot up about 19 points in early afternoon trading on some program-buying activity.  Broader indexes stayed higher throughout the session. The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 2.16 points, or 0.48%, to 448.00, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.80 point, or 0.32%, to finish at 247.07. But Big Board advancers trailed retreating issues, 950 to 992.  The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Federal Reserve officials voted to lean toward higher short-term interest rates at their closed-door meeting last week. The government's long bond reacted to the news by cruising more than 1/2 point higher, depressing its yield to the critical 7% mark.
