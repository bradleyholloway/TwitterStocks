 Korea Ruling Party Mobilizes Its Forces To Improve Roh's Presidential Fortunes   By By Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1987  Local pollsters, who aren't allowed to publish their findings, say the contest is still too close to call ahead of Wednesday's vote, the country's first presidential election since 1971. The winner will be determined by the one-fourth of the country's electorate still believed to be undecided. While opposition candidates Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung are appealing to resentment of South Korea's long military rule, the ruling Democratic Justice Party is mounting a more-sophisticated home-stretch effort. Party organizations -- ranging from those representing 50,000 voters to groups as small as 25 households -- are drumming up support. Members get gifts and "expenses" to attend rallies and help get out the vote.  The party is also trying to raise uncertainty about what would follow an opposition victory in a country where the government has never lost a presidential contest and where the capital, Seoul, is only a 40-minute drive from North Korea. Western diplomats and South Korean analysts say it isn't clear if the last-ditch government campaign can bring victory, but they believe ruling party tactics have helped slow Kim Young Sam's recent momentum.  "What it boils down to in the last days is Roh Tae Woo is running a climate-of-fear campaign," says a Western diplomat, who holds a minority view that Mr. Roh is pulling ahead. He says ruling-party strategists have customized the campaign for three different audiences that pollsters say make up most of the undecided: older people and conservative rural voters who deeply fear the North Korean threat, workers between ages 20 and 40 who worry that slower economic growth could cause unemployment, and thousands of senior corporate salary employees and mid-level government officials who worry about their jobs under a new government.
