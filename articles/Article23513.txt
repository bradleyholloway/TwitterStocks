 How Vote May Turn Japan's Markets; Opposition Party Has New Power to Reject Current Bank Line   By Hayashi, Yuka, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2007  Tokyo -- Japan's financial markets took in stride the heavy defeat that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his ruling party suffered in Sunday's upper-house election. But the outcome may have an impact on markets in coming years by affecting another decision: Who will be the next central-bank governor?  Until the July 29 vote, Mr. Abe's ruling coalition had majorities in both chambers. The DPJ, as the opposition party is known, now has more upper-house seats than the coalition parties' combined total, meaning it can likely block any candidate it doesn't like.  Prior to Sunday's vote, economists thought the front-runner for next central-bank governor was Toshiro Muto, one of the two deputy governors. Mr. Muto, a former top official at the Ministry of Finance, holds policy views similar to Mr. [Toshihiko Fukui]'s and likely would continue current policy.
