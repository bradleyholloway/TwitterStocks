 Asian IPOs to Accelerate; Chinese Issues May Lead Charge as Thailand, Malaysia Follow   By Ubels, Helen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2003  Kenneth Poon, Merrill Lynch's managing director of equity capital markets for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, expects the number of Asian IPOs to increase next year, citing international money flows into the region as the No. 1 influence. In the second half of 2003, money flowed into Asia and out of the U.S., Europe and Japan, and "if that money flow continues into 2004, it is going to be the bedrock of strength in terms of demand for IPOs," he says.  The new-issues market certainly went on a roller-coaster ride in 2003. The year got off to an ugly start, with activity slowed by the deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the war in Iraq. Still, 450 Asian IPOs have raised $23.97 billion in just the first 11 months, according to Thomson Financial, more than the $23.07 billion raised in 500 IPOs in all of last year. The data for 2003 don't even include an offering of about $3 billion from China Life Insurance Co., which would be the world's biggest IPO this year and it is expected in the next few weeks.  The Fast Track of Asia's IPOs The rising stock markets of most Asian countries have brought on a wave of initial public offerings of stock this year.
