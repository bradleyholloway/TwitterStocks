 Ferruzzi Group's Shares Begin to Rise After 2-Year Lows --- Anger Over Restructuring Wears Off; Speculation Also Boosts Stock Prices   By By Laura Colby and Michael T. Kinnicut, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1988  Shares of companies in the giant Ferruzzi-Montedison group have begun to climb again, just a few weeks after hitting two-year lows following the market's nearly unanimous rejection of the group's restructuring plan.  "The initial reaction (to the Ferruzzi restructuring) was very emotional," says Maurizio Musatti, a financial analyst at Booz-Allen Hamilton Italia Ltd. But the Ferruzzi family's decision to join a consortium of underwriters for its public share offering, and Ferruzzi's purchase of Lesieur SA's edible-oil interests in France, he says, "showed that they didn't lack resources as some had originally feared."  The plan calls for Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the family holding company that controls the Ferruzzi-Montedison group and is now closely held, to absorb Iniziativa Me.T.A. unit in a stock swap. Iniziativa is a publicly traded financial-services unit of Montedison S.p.A., which is 41.5%-owned by Ferruzzi Finanziaria.
