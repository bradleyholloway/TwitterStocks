 Daily Packs Increase Adherence to Prescriptions; Study Finds Senior Citizens More Likely to Take Doses That Are Labeled by Time   By Winslow, Ron, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2006  In the study, which was also published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association, 200 patients older than 65 who were taking at least four medicines were assigned for six months to a program that included consultations with a pharmacist and the blister- pack dispensing of medicines. Then they were randomly selected to either continue on the aggressive program or return to a conventional approach that included getting monthly supplies of each drug in separate pill bottles. The study was conducted at Walter Reed, where patients aren't charged for prescription drugs.  In an editorial in JAMA accompanying the study, Ross J. Simpson, a physician at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, noted that results from such a study at a military facility may be difficult to achieve in the general population, where such factors as out-of-pocket costs for patients and the ability of pharmacists to provide such individualized service may hinder compliance. Dr. Simpson, who described the program as "imaginative," also said it was difficult because of the design of the study to determine whether the blister packs or the intense role of a pharmacist was more responsible for the gain in compliance.
