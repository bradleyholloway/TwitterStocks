 Shuttle Panel To Add Members For Broader View   By By J. Lynn Lunsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2003  The evidence so far suggests the shuttle broke apart after the failure of the protective heat shield in the vicinity of the left wing, possibly from damage that was caused when a piece of foam insulation struck it shortly after liftoff. Adm. [Harold Gehman Jr.] said investigators have ruled nothing out and drawn no conclusions about a photograph taken by an Air Force telescope that some experts believe may show a jagged leading edge on the orbiter's left wing and a plume trailing behind it. That photograph was taken after other witnesses say they saw pieces of it peeling away above California and Nevada.
