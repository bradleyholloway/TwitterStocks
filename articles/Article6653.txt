 PURSUITS; Picks -- Comedy: Video; Filming in his basement, a rising comic talent takes on Hollywood   By Jacob Hale Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2007  SPOOFING Hollywood's excesses is a great tradition of "Saturday Night Live" and movies like "Airplane."

Portraying Wallace Shawn's wine-tasting "battle of wits" in the "Princess Bride," he fills two goblets from a Tupperware container of iced tea, launching into a dead-on impression of Mr. Shawn's squinting grimace as he gestures across the table to his masked rival. That character is also Mr. Hardesty, wearing a mask made from boxer shorts and filmed from a different angle.
