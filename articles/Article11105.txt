 Futures Markets: Minor Rally Ends in Gold, Other Metals As Energy Market Drops on OPEC Gossip   By By William Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1988  Reacting to scuttlebutt about Saturday's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price-monitoring committee, including an unfounded rumor that the meeting had been canceled, traders sent May delivery crude oil down 22 cents, to $16.79 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil and gasoline also fell.  Partly because of such oil-futures weakness, gold for April delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange slipped $3.30 an ounce, to $453.40, in light trading. The gold slippage came a day after gold and other precious metals were boosted by the Labor Department's report of a nine-year low in unemployment, which many traders took as an inflationary sign.  Vincent McCrudden, a Comex trader with New York Gold Brokers Inc., said that Monday there was probably an "overanticipation" of inflation fears based on the Labor Department report. Such fears never grew among Comex speculators as some gold bulls had hoped. "People talk up the inflation fears, you see it in the paper, but it's just not here in the ring," he said.
