 Treasury to Reverse Clinton-Era Rules On Research Credits   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2001  Treasury officials say the proposed new rules would replace a heavily criticized regulation issued by the [Clinton] administration in early January, less than three weeks before President Bush was sworn in. The National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups assailed that regulation as being too restrictive in defining what types of research qualify for the credit. Critics also said the Clinton Treasury rules included overly burdensome documentation requirements.  The Clinton Treasury regulation required that "qualified" research must be undertaken to "obtain knowledge that exceeds, expands or refines the common knowledge of skilled professionals in a particular field of science or engineering." Critics say it was an unworkable rule that led to major, time-consuming disputes with Internal Revenue Service agents and wasn't even intended by Congress. A Treasury official says this test has been "the single greatest source of controversy" between businesses and the IRS in figuring out what type of research qualifies for the credit.  Treasury and IRS officials "recognize that the research credit presents a particular burden for taxpayers" because of such requirements, according to the proposal. They also make the IRS's job difficult.
