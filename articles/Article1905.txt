 Illinois Suspends Its Investment Ties To Merrill Lynch   By By Anita Raghavan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1994  Since last year, the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been looking into whether Merrill Lynch employees made payments to a firm with ties to a top aide of then-New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio in return for part of that state's turnpike-bond business. And in February, Massachusetts barred Merrill from a lead underwriting role in a state bond sale, citing the "unresolved controversy" over allegations by the Massachusetts inspector general of impropriety by the New York-based firm. Merrill has said that the firm itself is not a target of the investigation in New Jersey and that it is cooperating with the inquiry. It has denied any wrongdoing in the Massachusetts case.
