 World wire: Russia may curb some prices   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1996  Russia is expected soon to freeze or cut electricity, natural-gas and rail-freight prices to energize industry and spur economic growth, officials said. The order would stay in effect until prices can be set by market forces rather than monopoly suppliers. The move is aimed at satisfying terms of a $10 billion IMF loan.
