 The Next Clause Calls for the Finest In Paper Towels   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1999  In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dallas-based Chancellor, which is looking for a buyer, included its five-year employment agreement with Mr. [Jeffrey A.] Marcus. It's not a bad deal, providing for an initial annual salary of $1.1 million and bonus of $2 million to $4 million, stock options, an end-of-employment payment of $6.3 million (assuming he doesn't leave without reason, or get terminated for cause), club memberships and access to a Gulfstream jet. Chancellor says these are typical for the chief executive of a large media company.
