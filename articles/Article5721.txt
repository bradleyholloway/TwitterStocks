 The Netherlands May Open Up To Takeovers --- Amsterdam Bourse Agrees To Plan to Shake Up Stodgy Stock Market   By Martin du Bois, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1995  "With the kind of defense constructions you've got in the Netherlands you can block a takeover if you want to block it. We want to give [unsolicited bidders] at least the prospect of acquiring control" over a target company, said a spokesman for the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.  "Mergers and acquisitions lead to more dynamism in society. But [the proposed takeover rules] aim to keep these dynamic considerations at bay. This is unjustifiable for shareholders, undesirable from an economic point of view and in contradiction with the principles of modern enterprise," said Robert de Haze Winkelman, director of the Dutch Shareholders' Union.  On deciding the issue, the panel would take into consideration various, ill-defined factors such as the interests of the company and of its workers, financing of the takeover, the buyer's "track record" and his long-term intentions for the company and whether all shareholders were treated equally in the buyout. This would allow the panel to bar highly leveraged takeovers or asset stripping.
