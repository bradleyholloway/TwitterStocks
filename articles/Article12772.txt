 Lerach's Enron Gambit   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  As with any dead carcass, Enron is attracting downstream scavengers. Of course this includes the lawyers, especially lawsuit king Bill Lerach, who recently posed before TV cameras in Houston with a carton of what he claimed were shredded Enron documents. But before he cashes in one more time, Mr. Lerach's own legal practices deserve some greater public scrutiny.  With Enron's failure, a movement is also afoot to make tort lawyers the big beneficiaries. They're mobilizing to repeal a modest 1995 tort reform bill that reined in the worst of the tort bar's securities lawsuits. Mr. Lerach is himself now posing as a defender of Enron shareholders, and he's even been retained by Calpers, the big public pension fund that had invested in Enron partnerships. Mark this down as wildebeest hiring hyenas as bodyguards.  The story begins, as many [Milberg] stories do, with a drop in the share price of a company, in this case Copper Mountain Networks. Milberg quickly moved in. But Milberg's wasn't the only suit, so when it came time to choose a lead counsel, Judge [Vaughn Walker] asked for rival bids. When he looked at the price sheets he found that another firm's lower fees served the interests of the shareholders better than Milberg's hefty ones.
