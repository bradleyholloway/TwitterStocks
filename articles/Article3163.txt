 El Paso Corp. Sees Over $1.5 Billion In Write-Downs   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2003  As of March 31, El Paso valued its investment in the Aruba refinery at $1.2 billion and its telecom business at $375 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. A spokeswoman said other petroleum assets were included in the charge, so the company isn't writing off the entire value of its Aruba and telecom investments.  El Paso, operator of the nation's largest natural-gas pipeline system, plunged into energy trading in the 1990s with disastrous results. The company recently fended off a proxy fight and continues to search for a new chief executive. For the first quarter this year, El Paso reported a $394 million loss, including more than $500 million in charges related to bad investments and asset write-downs.
