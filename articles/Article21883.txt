 A Bond Bull Stands Pat After Rout --- Manager of Top Fund Doesn't See Inflation Threatening Treasurys   By By Leslie Scism, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1994  Her Advantage Government Securities fund is loaded with long-term bonds -- exactly the kind most vulnerable to interest-rate fluctuations and the ones investors were dumping Thursday. But Ms. Patel just kept clearing the mail and research reports off her desk, not tempted to join the sell-off.  Holding more longer-term securities than many colleagues' funds, Ms. Patel's portfolio benefited mightily from 1993's sharp decline in interest rates. She logged an 18.01% total return in a broad-spectrum government-fund field with an average return of 8.71%. (When interest rates fall, longer-term securities profit more than shorter-term securities. However, they also lose more than shorter-term bonds when interest rates rise.)  Ms. Patel isn't the only portfolio manager who believes that the inflation rate will be 3% or less in 1994, setting the stage for a bond rally. But many others are fair-weather bulls. That is, they've redesigned their portfolios in recent months to include fewer longer-term securities, bracing for the bumpiness of a potential rebound in the first-quarter economy. These firms expect to load themselves back up with longer-term bonds as the first-quarter unfolds, taking advantage of any uptick in yields as bond bears shuck long-term Treasurys on news of a strengthening economy.
