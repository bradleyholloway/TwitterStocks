 These Little Laptops Are No Lightweights For Traveling PC Users   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2001  I've long loved IBM's small laptops, and the X20 didn't disappoint me. Once again, IBM has managed to squeeze a superb keyboard into a small space. The cursor is controlled by IBM's trademark pointing stick, which I prefer to a touch pad. The X20 also has top-mounted power, volume control and muting buttons, and a pretty decent speaker. The screen is sharp and has an excellent resolution of 1,024 by 768, as does the OmniBook's. The hard disk is a huge 20 gigabytes.  The OmniBook makes up for these flaws with a lower price. The model I tested costs $2,284, which is $315 cheaper than the ThinkPad I tested. And that understates the H-P's price advantage, because the current ThinkPad price of $2,599 is a special sale price that goes up by $150 after Jan. 15. Also, the OmniBook includes a built-in Ethernet network connection and an external floppy drive in its lower price. To get these on the ThinkPad, it would cost $269 extra.  The H-P's expansion base costs $400, including CD-ROM and floppy drives if you buy it in a bundle with the PC. The less capable ThinkPad base costs $308 with a CD-ROM and floppy. When these bases are included, the OmniBook costs $2,684 and the ThinkPad costs $2,907, during the current sale, and that still doesn't include Ethernet.
