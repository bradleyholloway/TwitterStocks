 A Special News Report About Life On the Job - and Trends Taking Shape There   By By Glenn Burkins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1999  The AFL-CIO plans to lobby Congress to extend more health-and-safety protections to people who work part-time or on a contingency basis. It also applauds a Labor Department lawsuit seeking to force Time Warner Inc. to pay pensions and benefits to workers classified as temporary. Labor also may begin a push to organize more contingent workers, federation officials say.  No one knows exactly how many contingent workers there are in the U.S., mainly because definitions vary. Using one of the government's more conservative definitions -- people who've worked on a job for a year or less and who expect to work there another year or less -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics put the number at just over three million in 1997, down from 3.4 million in 1995. Of those, only 9.4% had employer-sponsored health insurance, and just 13% were offered pension coverage.  While the number of federal workers declined in the 1990s, the U.S. Postal Service added about 31,000 jobs, says the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. The institute finds Postal hiring down significantly from the 1980s, when 166,000 jobs were added.
