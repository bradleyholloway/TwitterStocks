 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Breakaway!   By By Jean Torkelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 2001  The Rev. Ken Ross, who resigned from his Episcopal clergy position in December, notes that the Episcopal Church recognizes alternative sexualities but hesitates to proclaim the physical resurrection of Jesus. It "is not a great place to live anymore," he says. He now conducts services at a donated church space with virtually all his Denver flock. And the Rev. Gerry Schnackenberg, now pastor of another AMIA church in Denver, says that it was hard to stomach chastisements from the Episcopal hierarchy "for just trying to be faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ, when nothing's been done about Bishop Jack Spong, who's denied every basic tenet of the Christian faith." He is referring to the notorious, and now retired, bishop, of Newark, N.J.  The day of the AMIA consecrations, the Rev. E.M. Womack, a conservative still within the fold, delivered a rousing sermon 10 miles away at Denver's soaring Episcopal cathedral. To a burst of applause, he advised giving God time to sort out doctrinal disputes: "Allow nothing, and no one, to separate us." But AMIA members counter that contradictory doctrines have already destroyed unity.  The AMIA faces challenges, too. It has agreed to reconsider women's ordination, which Episcopalians granted in 1976 but which is not allowed in Southeast Asia, the home of one of the consecrating bishops. Ms. [Elizabeth Sausele], one of two women among 75 AMIA clergy, says that she'll accept whatever happens.
