 Building Awards Rose 5% in August To a Record Rate   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1987  New-construction contracts awarded in August rose 5% from July to a record annual rate of $268.3 billion, according to the F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Inc.  But residential building held steady in the month at an annual rate of $122.1 billion. In non-building construction, two major public works projects, a $400 million waste-processing facility in Detroit, and a $330 million LeFlore, Okla., co-generation plant, represented a disproportionate amount of the new contracts total.  Contracting for nonresidential building overall rose 5% to an annual rate of $92.4 billion. New construction in the busiest sector, public works and utilities, surged 15% from July's level to an annual rate of $53.8 billion.
