 Dark Questions Lurk Beneath Apple's Ties to Microsoft --- U.S. Probers Look at Aborted Compaq QuickTime Deal and Browser Issues   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1998  Apple executives have privately fumed about what they regard as Microsoft's attempts to stifle an Apple multimedia technology called QuickTime. According to a previously undisclosed account that Apple supplied to state and federal investigators, engineers at Compaq Computer Corp. were interested in licensing QuickTime in a deal that might have given Apple a $2 royalty for each Compaq machine using the software. At a March 1998 meeting, however, senior Compaq executives overruled subordinates for fear that Microsoft might object to a licensing arrangement, Apple executives said.  Partly to ensure that Microsoft would update Office for the Mac, Mr. (Steve) Jobs negotiated a broad alliance that included making Microsoft's Internet Explorer the default Web browser on Apple computers. Microsoft bought a $150 million stake in Apple, and is believed to be paying about $100 million more to license Apple patents for QuickTime and other technologies.
