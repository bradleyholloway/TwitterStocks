 Executive Rules   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1998  The courts have been shooting down President Clinton's various interpretations and assertions of executive privilege of late, but he has also pursued an "executive order strategy" that goes way beyond trying to guide federal agencies in how to implement laws. Instead it actively seeks to put in place policies Congress would never adopt. Last week, the White House admitted that a May executive order gutting certain powers of state and local governments had been drafted in secret without consulting them. It has delayed its effective date by 90 days and pledged to "start with a clean slate" in revising the order.
