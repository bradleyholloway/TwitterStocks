 World Watch   By Compiled by Paul J. Deveney, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1997  In a surprise move that could touch off a round of bidding for Britain's Vickers PLC, a much smaller British auto-parts maker says it's considering making an unsolicited bid for the engine giant. Mayflower Corp. said it's "considering all its options, which may or may not include an offer for Vickers." The bid would be an audacious move for Mayflower, which makes auto-body panels. Analysts estimate Vickers would fetch more than GBP 850 million ($1.43 billion), or nearly twice the total market capitalization of Mayflower.  The European Union has had enough. Just two months before Europe deregulates much of its $160 billion telecommunications market, the European Commission has started legal action against seven EU member nations, charging that they have failed so far to establish appropriate laws to encourage competition. The commission began legal proceedings against Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal, saying that these countries have failed to mold national laws to comply with EU legislation and are dragging their feet in the liberalization of the sector.  President Boris Yeltsin took a step in the direction of purging the Kremlin of the murky ties between big business and the state. The sacking of billionaire-turned-top-official Boris Berezovsky from the post of deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council comes amid infighting over the country's most recent big round of privatizations. The feuding, which has seen Mr. Berezovsky attack his business rivals from his Kremlin perch, has become increasingly disruptive to the reforms pushed by a young team of liberal ministers. Mr. Berezovsky yesterday denied lobbying for his companies while in the government over the past year, telling reporters that Mr. Yeltsin acted "incorrectly" by dismissing him.
