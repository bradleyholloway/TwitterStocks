 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2005  An example would be if the charity makes "a significant intervening use" of your donated car, such as "regular use to deliver meals on wheels." Another example would be if the charity gives away the car -- or sells it at a significantly below-market price -- to a "needy individual," as long as that transfer furthers the charitable purpose of helping a poor person who needs transportation. A third example would be if the charity makes a "material improvement" to the vehicle.
