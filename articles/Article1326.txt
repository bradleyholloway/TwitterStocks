 Alabama's Law on Waste Roils Interstate Activity   By Paul, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1990  Alabama's new hazardous-waste law prohibits out-of-state hazardous waste from being disposed of in Alabama unless the state where the waste was generated has similar facilities of its own. This law is raising costs for plants who now have to take their hazardous waste farther than before.
