 Home & Fanily: Back in at Milan: Basic and Retro Furniture; Designs Featured at Fair Include Scandinavian Styles, Bright Colors, Office Pieces [1]  By Kirwan-Taylor, Helen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  After years of eye-catching, technically advanced but ultimately short-loved products by designers such as Philippe Starck, the pendulum has swung the other way. "People are tired of plastic and artificial materials," says Manlio Armellini, managing director of Cosmit, the Milan furniture fair's organizers. "Minimalism is over. What people want is well-made products that are comfortable, classical and won't go out of fashion in two years."  In recent years, manufacturers have tended to focus on technical achievements in their products. Now designers are starting to rebel. "Since the 1920s, the industry has been about making a tube one year then learning to bend it the next," says Dutch designer Marcel Wanders. "At the same time we throw away our hand-carved chairs," he says.  Another throwback: "There is a huge resurgence in interest in Scandinavian furniture of the '30s, '40s and '50s," says Mike Walsh, the London-based CEO of advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather Europe, Africa and Middle East.
