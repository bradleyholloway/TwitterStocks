 The Flamingo in the Garden   By By Allen Lacy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1985  It was a torrid and sultry July day in Raleigh, N.C. At the repeated urging of a good many horticulturally minded friends from the area, I had finally worked in a visit to the North Carolina State University Arboretum, where, I was told, I would find an extremely fine herbaceous perennial border designed by a young woman named Edith Eddleman, following the principles laid down by Gertrude Jekyll, the leading British garden theorist of the early 20th century. What's more, I had Ms. Eddleman, who serves as curator of the border, as a guide. She had very graciously consented to drive over from her home in Durham, a trip of more than half-an-hour, to meet me in the arboretum's parking lot. We had exchanged pleasantries there, the usual bits of autobiography passing between us. Ms. Eddleman, I learned, had majored in Chinese history at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, then earned her master's at Duke, in divinity.
