Donald G. Carney, 50, has been named president of the Specialty Stores Association, a New York buying office for 19 specialty and department stores around the nation with volume of $600 million annually.  Mr. Carney said yesterday that the principal function of the office, founded in 1921, was ''timely fashion information and trend merchandising to our member stores.''  The office, which is owned by the member stores, also buys overseas for them.  ''Independent stores are hard pressed to keep pace,'' Mr. Carney said. ''Our people live the market for them and the excitement of the market is made available to them.''  Mr. Carney succeeds Martin Richter, who resigned in May. The new president comes to the association from William H. Block, an Indianapolis department store owned by the Allied Stores Corporation. He was president and chief executive there.  Earlier he had been president of the retail division of the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation and corporate vice president of merchandising for Hart Schaffner & Marx Inc. Before that, he had been executive vice president and general merchandise manager for Wallach's. He is a graduate of the New York University School of Retailing.  Member stores, mostly in medium-sized cities, range from the B. Forman Company of Rochester to Gottschalk's of Fresno, Calif., to Frost Brothers of San Antonio.
