 Study Says Curb On Japan's Cars Lifts U.S. Prices   By By Art Pine, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1985  The "voluntary" import quotas on Japanese autos have cost American consumers $15.7 billion in higher prices on U.S. and Japanese cars since mid-1981, a new government study shows.  The report, compiled by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which monitors trade, also concludes that without the export restraints Japanese auto makers probably would have been able to sell about 998,000 more cars here last year than the 1.95 million they sold, assuming they could have produced that many. That alone would have added about $4 billion to the $33.9 billion trade deficit the U.S. amassed with Japan in 1984.  The ITC report is expected to add fuel to the controversy over whether the quotas should be continued. Some of its figures differ from those of private analysts. For example, most auto analysts contend the Japanese producers wouldn't be able to produce more than 650,000 more cars even if the restraints weren't there. And the U.S. auto makers themselves have contended they've become more efficient than the ITC report would suggest.
