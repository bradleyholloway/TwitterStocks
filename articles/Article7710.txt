 Halt by Argentina to Most Debt Payments Is Called Likely Within Next Few Months   By By Peter Truell, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1987  BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina is likely in the next few months to declare a moratorium on most of its $35 billion foreign bank debt, according to Argentine officials, politicians and some of the country's creditors.  The breakdown in Argentina's payments to foreign bankers could come at the end of the first quarter, when the country will probably once more fall out of compliance with its economic program with the International Monetary Fund. That would mean that Argentina couldn't get any more foreign loans, which it has been using to stay current on its debt.  Such a breakdown, coming amid world-wide economic uncertainty spawned by the October stock-market crash, would compound problems for international banks in particular and the world financial system in general. Brazil, which declared a moratorium on its foreign bank debt in February, is slated to resume interest payments next year. But it isn't likely Brazil will have reached a final debt settlement with its foreign creditors by then.
