 The Few and the Brave   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  Informed that the department chairman and the chancellor were advancing investigations of Professor [Linda McCarriston]'s alleged offense -- and that they were promising to report to the complainants against her -- the president of the university fired a directive off to the chancellors of all three campuses. In it Mr. [Mark R. Hamilton] made clear that there could be no toleration of attempts to assuage anger or to demonstrate concern that would in any way qualify the university's support for free speech. He took special note of a tendency to say things like "we support the right to free speech but we intend to check into this matter" or "but I have asked Dean X or Provost Y to investigate the circumstances."  Those who have watched the erosion of free speech on the nation's campuses have been waiting a long time to hear words like that: There is nothing to investigate. We must, he informed the chancellors, "remain a certain trumpet on this most precious of Constitutional rights." Then, with a dispatch whose crispness may have had something to do with his 31 years of military service, Mr. Hamilton directed the chancellors to see that the letter was widely disseminated. Professor Alan C. Kors, of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), which took up Professor McCarriston's defense, suggested that freedom of speech was in peril on campus and that the university president was on watch. We'd say Mr. Hamilton proved a most admirable watchman.
