 Futures & Options: Getting Away From the Mall   By By Jonathan Welsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 2002  HENRY CLAY FRICK'S restored 19th-century mansion will be dressed for the holidays and open for seasonal tours. The mansion, which Mr. Frick and his wife purchased for $25,000 in 1882, is near Pittsburgh's shopping areas including the downtown "Golden Triangle," Station Square and Shadyside. Tours last about an hour and 15 minutes. Reservations are recommended, though walk-ins are welcome. Holiday hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays; 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesdays and Fridays; and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Admission is $10 for adults, $8 for seniors and $8 for students.  SANTA CLAUS'S image has varied widely over time and from one culture to another. This display looks at 18 paintings by American illustrator Haddon Sundblom, thought by some to be the inventor of the American conception of Kris Kringle. Coca-Cola Co. hired Mr. Sundblom in 1931 to create a version of Santa to anchor the company's holiday advertising campaigns. His red-cheeked and rotund images, conceived during the Great Depression and developed into the 1960s, are recognizable and continue to exude a traditional American flavor. The museum is near Atlanta's sprawling shopping district. Daily museum hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $8 for adults, $5.50 for seniors age 60 and older, students with identification and children ages 3 to 12.  PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING to escape the famously driven hordes of New York holiday shoppers might seek refuge in something soft and soothing -- a quilt, perhaps. Long regarded as a homey craft, quilting is now bidding for a place among higher art forms. Meant for home use, quilts often were made from old denim work clothes, handkerchiefs and other fragments of daily life. This exhibition includes about 70 of them made from the 1920s to the 1990s by more than 40 African-American women from Gee's Bend, Ala. Museum hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m, Tuesday through Thursday and Saturday and Sunday. Admission is $10 for adults, $8 for seniors age 62 and older, $8 for students with identification and free for children under age 12.
