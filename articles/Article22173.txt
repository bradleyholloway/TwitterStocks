 Man of Many Parts: How a Tough Boss Managed to Salvage A Messy Unit at GM --- Delphi's Battenberg Seeks Union Deal to Become A `Ruthless Competitor' --- Why Clients Want a Spinoff   By By Rebecca Blumenstein and Gabriella Stern, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1996  If that sounds like placing the cart before the horse, consider this: GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit is the biggest player in the highly fragmented $720 billion-a-year global auto-parts industry. With 1995 sales of $26.4 billion (15% of GM's total revenue), Delphi is three times larger than its nearest competitor, employing 179,000 workers world-wide -- 25% of GM's work force.  A UAW strike in March at two Delphi plants in Dayton, Ohio, underscored both Delphi's importance and the simmering labor tensions involving the unit. The 17-day walkout at the brake-parts plants eventually forced the shutdown of virtually all of GM's North American operations and cost the No. 1 auto maker $900 million. Remaining issues, both national and local, are so profound for both GM and the UAW that there could be another huge confrontation before this year's talks are over.  This is a highly sensitive subject at Delphi, which after all has to live with its unions. Mr. Battenberg, the president of Delphi and one of a few top GM executives the UAW regards as hawkish on labor, readily credits the UAW with helping him turn Delphi around and emphasizes that he doesn't blame the UAW for all of Delphi's problems. He acknowledges that Delphi has other cost issues to tackle, too. And in certain of the more capital-intensive operations, labor costs aren't as significant as material costs.
