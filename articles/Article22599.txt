 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 1999 --- Hedge-Fund Managers Sought To Regain Investor Trust in 1999 --- After 1998's Heavy Losses, More Investors Turned Their Attention to Risk   By By Mitchell Pacelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  For an industry that was vilified in late 1998 with the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management LP, the past year represented a resurrection of sorts. The average hedge fund returned 14% through November, but it was dragged down by lackluster performance in sectors such as macro global funds and short-selling funds, which lost money, according to the Credit Suisse First Boston Tremont Index. In comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 15% through November. Year-end data won't be available until later this month.  After heavy losses by some hedge funds in 1998 left the average fund flat for that year, banks forced the industry to scale down its reliance on borrowed money, making it more difficult for managers to juice up returns with leverage. Investors too became much more attentive to risk, and how managers were producing returns.  Hedge funds specializing in stock-picking, both long and short, returned an average 30% through November, with the average emerging-market fund up 26%, according to the Credit Suisse First Boston Index. The worst-performing strategy, funds that specialize in short-selling -- a bet that prices will fall -- fell an average 8.2% through November.
