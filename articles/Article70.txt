A summer counselor was arrested yesterday and charged with sexually abusing a 6-year-old girl at the Frederick Douglass Community Center in Manhattan last month, the police said. He is the seventh employee of a city-financed day-care center to be arrested and charged with sexual abuse in recent months.  The counselor, Dwayne Lance, 19, of 870 Columbus Avenue, was charged with abusing the child at the center at 885 Columbus Avenue, according to Officer Anthony Vallelong of the Police Department.  It was the first arrest involving an employee at the Manhattan center. Thirty-nine children at six Bronx day- care centers have reported being abused, and six arrests have been made at three centers.  Also yesterday, the Koch administration announced that the city's Department of Investigation would immediately begin conducting background checks of all current and prospective employees at city-financed day-care centers.  The city will conduct the checks until legislation is passed in Albany. The legislation has not been written yet, but city officials say it will probably require the private, nonprofit agencies that run the centers to conduct the background checks.  The city said the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services had agreed to help process requests for such checks until the legislation was approved. The city also announced that it was beginning a $1.7 million staff-expansion program for the 385 city-financed day-care centers to try to improve the reporting and prevention of child abuse and that $1 million more would be used to finance the assignment of workers to prevent child abuse in six day-care centers.  In addition, Mayor Koch directed the Agency for Child Development to begin a review of the standards, regulations and procedures governing child-care providers.  City Council President Carol Bellamy said that the Mayor's plans did not go far enough and that she and Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin would present a program of day-care reforms to the Board of Estimate at its next meeting on Sept. 13.
