 Recent Price Rally by Many Junk Bonds Offsets Declines Linked to Boesky Case   By By Tom Herman and Edward P. Foldessy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1987  Prices of many junk bonds have surged back to or even above their levels of Nov. 14, when news of the Boesky case broke. In the past week alone, many issues have risen about three points, or $30 for each $1,000 face amount. That's far better than U.S. Treasury bonds did last week, although long-term Treasury bond prices have performed better since mid-November than most junk bonds.  The rally has been "exceptionally strong," said Jonathan Kolatch, director of the corporate bond research department at Goldman, Sachs & Co. James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a longtime critic of junk bonds, agreed. "The strength of the rally has been impressive," he said. "The walking dead have started dancing."  After Nov. 14, junk bond prices tumbled amid fears that the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of Mr. Boesky's activities might hurt Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the largest dealer in junk bonds. That, in turn, might affect the liquidity of the whole junk bond market, money managers said then.
