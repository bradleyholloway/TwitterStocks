 La-La Land Gets Real   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2001  The state Democratic Party strongly backed Mr. Villaraigosa, and he won the votes of self-identified liberals by two to one. Some are now bitterly complaining that his failure to become L.A.'s first Hispanic mayor in over a century was due to prejudice. In reality Mr. Villaraigosa lost because he was too liberal in a city that gave George W. Bush only 22% of its votes last year. L.A. has sent a message.  There should be. No one of any significance in the U.S. is governing from the liberal agenda. Democratic mayors in urban centers such as Chicago, Cleveland and Milwaukee have been governing from the center, not least on the issue of schools. It will be interesting to see how much of the L.A. reality sinks in with New York City's Democratic Mayoral hopefuls. Too bad Al Sharpton isn't trying to duplicate Mr. Villaraigosa's ethnic triumph.  Even the ethnic card collapsed in L.A. A couple of points here: Whatever the Democrats' hopes for L.A.'s newest voters, it's worth noting that most of the "Hispanics" who didn't emigrate to California only recently elected the conservative Vicente Fox President of Mexico. With 46% of L.A.'s population, Hispanics will continue to play a major economic and political role, but it's a vote that belongs to no one yet. Meanwhile, the U.S.'s most prominent Hispanic Mayor will now be Ed Garza of San Antonio, who won election last month as a moderate consenus-builder and openly admitted he had often voted for Republicans.
