 details: Trying to Build A Better Bathtub   By By Nancy D. Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 2000  "I'm constantly dumping stuff in my air-jet tub and it's always clean," says Ms. [Catherine Devine], who used to have a whirlpool bath that spit out "all sorts of disgusting things" into the water.  Though whirlpool tubs still are top sellers, the market for air-jet tubs is growing fast. At $1,000 to $4,500, the cost of air-jet tubs is comparable to whirlpool systems. Air-jets account for about 25% of the therapeutic baths sold at Tubs & Stuff Plumbing Supply Inc. in Ansonia, Conn., compared with 10% three years ago, says Kenneth Shortell, president. Sales are rising even faster at McGuckin Design Center, a division of Hight Enterprises in Boulder, Colo. Manager Phil Iwane says 70% of therapeutic tubs he sells this year will be air jets, up from 15% three years ago.
