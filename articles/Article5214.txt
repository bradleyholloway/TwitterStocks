 Sears Fourth-Quarter Net Falls 37% After Big Charge --- No. 2 Merchandise Executive Quits in Shake-Up, 9,000 More Jobs to Be Pared   By By Francine Schwadel and Timothy D. Schellhardt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1991  Sears, Roebuck & Co., taking a $155.2 million charge to restructure its faltering merchandise group, posted a 37% drop in fourth-quarter net income.  Including the restructuring charge, the merchandise group's earnings slid 74%, overshadowing improved earnings for Sears' Dean Witter Financial Services, Allstate Insurance, and Coldwell Banker Real Estate units. The merchandise group's earnings plunged to $95.6 million from $368.6 million a year ago as its core domestic operation in the critical Christmas-buying quarter reported earnings of only $156.1 million, down from $263.4 million a year earlier.  The merchandise group's continuing problems apparently contributed to the resignation of Michael Bozic, 50 years old, its president and chief operating officer. Mr. Bozic, whom Sears said plans to pursue other business interests, couldn't be reached for comment. But it's understood he was frustrated by the company's failure to address more quickly what he considered important issues in making Sears more competitive.
