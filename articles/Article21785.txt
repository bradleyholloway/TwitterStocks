 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Winning Bankers' Trust   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1993  If he can ever assemble a quorum at Justice, a place to start might be the government's lawsuit with California's Glendale Federal Savings Bank. In the early 1980s, regulators were trying to keep the thrift industry afloat by encouraging healthy S&Ls to buy up sick ones. Glendale obliged by acquiring Florida's First Federal of Broward County. As part of the deal, the purchase price was to be treated as capital and written off over 40 years.  Last summer Chief Judge Loren Smith of the U.S. Court of Claims ruled that Glendale had, in effect, been rooked by the federal government. The case is now on appeal, but a decision probably won't come until after the sun sets on Glendale.  Judge Smith thinks that would be "an historic irony of unparalleled waste and cost." Though he can't compel anybody to do anything, in an order last month he strongly urged regulators to reach "a voluntary agreement" that would keep Glendale open until the appeals run their course. Glendale's lawyers yesterday mailed out a plan by which the government would recapitalize the bank with $700 million in preferred stock. If Glendale continues to turn around, the final cost to taxpayers could be zero, according to attorney Joe Hollingsworth.
