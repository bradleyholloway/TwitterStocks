 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Futures & Options: Wearing It Well   By Hughes, Robert J, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 2004  THIS EXHIBITION LOOKS AT how textiles have enhanced living spaces in Europe, China and the U.S., from the 15th to the 20th centuries. On view are items ranging from 15th-century Flemish tapestries to 17th- century Mughal tent panels. Europeans lavished great attention on the detail of their bed hangings, while Americans concentrated on quilts, producing equally elaborate but homey and message-laden specimens to adorn their beds and settees. Open noon to 8 p.m. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday; noon to 9 p.m. Friday; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekends. Admission is $9 for adults, $5 for seniors and students; children 17 and under admitted free.  HOW VARIOUS CULTURES celebrate the hedonistic displays of carnival is explored in this show, which has on view exuberant carnival costumes from Bolivia, Trinidad & Tobago and New Orleans. This exhibition in the museum's Neutrogena Wing is a preview of a larger show opening in the fall. That show ("Carnaval!") recreates different carnival traditions, in Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean. Sites range from a rural community in Spain to cities such as Basel, Switzerland. Admission is $7 for adults, free for those 16 and under. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday.  THE CLOTHES THEY are a-changing. Just as modern fashion evolves (or devolves) constantly, the 18th and 19th centuries had distinct fashion eras. In the 18th, for example, they included baroque, which looked grand and massive; rococo, which conveyed a sense of delicacy; and, with the discovery of Pompeii, neoclassical, influenced by ancient Greek and Roman styles. On view here are 25 such items from the two centuries amid period paintings and furniture. Open 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; 10 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. Thursday; noon to 4:45 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $5, $4 for seniors, $3 for children 7-18.
