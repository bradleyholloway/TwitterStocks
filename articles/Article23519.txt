 EuroLinks Daily View: Ghosn Seeks to Defend Emerging-Market Flanks Online edition  By Connolly, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 2007  MILITARY TRANSPARENCY: Beijing has been criticized for not being forthcoming about its military, and countries such as the U.S. and Japan have questioned the pace and amount of China's defense spending. Now Beijing says it will make its military operations more transparent by giving the United Nations information about its spending and arms sales. The issue arose last week after Chinese Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan visited Japan, and Japanese Defense Minister Masahiko Komura said that Mr. Cao had failed to address Japan's concerns over surging Chinese military spending and that Tokyo would keep pressing Beijing for more transparency. Though China's military has remained secretive, Beijing has been more open in the past five years as it has engaged in multilateral military activities and U.N. peacekeeping missions, according to military analyst Robert Karniol in Bangkok.  Mr. [Daulet Ergozhin] declines to specify what the Kazakh side is seeking but says the question of changing the operator "remains on the agenda" because the government is "not fully satisfied" with the current operator. While Kazakhstan isn't insisting that state oil company KazMunaiGaz become the operator, he says the government would "look positively" on a proposal to put a Kazakh company in control or to jointly operate the project.
