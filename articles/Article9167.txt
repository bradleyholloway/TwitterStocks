 Small-Stock Focus: Tech Helps Nasdaq Set Record, Small Caps Climb; Cor Therapeutics and RMH Teleservices Surge   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2000  Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks turned in a heady week, putting distance between themselves and the rest of the market so far this year.  The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 33.16, or 0.79%, to a record 4244.14 Friday, surpassing the previous all-time high set Jan. 21. For the week, the Nasdaq surged 357.07, or 9.19%.  Cor Therapeutics, a San Francisco drug developer, surged 14 15/16, or 58%, to 40 1/2, after setting a 52-week high of 41 1/4. Cor and Schering-Plough halted a heart-treatment study early after determining the treatment reduced deaths and heart attacks by almost 50% in patients undergoing coronary intervention. Cor said that the study was stopped when an independent committee reviewing it unanimously agreed that the drug, called Integrilin, showed sufficient efficacy that study participants receiving placebos shouldn't be denied treatment with it.
