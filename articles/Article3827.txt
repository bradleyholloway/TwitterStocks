 Google and Harman Post Gains; Synopsys Falls on Weak Quarter   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 2004  Hormel Foods tumbled 1.65, or 5.9%, to 26.49. The maker of Spam and other packaged foods reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates and also projected fiscal fourth-quarter per-share earnings of between 40 cents and 46 cents, compared with Wall Street's estimate of 53 cents.  Petco Animal Supplies rose 3.18, or nearly 11%, to 32.90 on the Nasdaq. The pet-product retailer saw second-quarter earnings increase 43%, handily beating analyst expectations on higher same-store sales and it increased its full-year earnings guidance. Petco's strong performance was said to have played a role in the 1.46, or 4.9%, decline to 28.36 by rival PetsMart (Nasdaq), which also posted solid second-quarter results, but which, unlike Petco, didn't raise its outlook for the year.  Siebel Systems (Nasdaq) gained 26 cents, or 3.5%, to 7.64. Sanford Bernstein upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform, saying the battered shares -- which are down more than 40% so far this year -- sufficiently reflect investors' fears. It added that the application software provider's stream of maintenance revenue and cash balance should limit downside risk.
