 PURSUITS; Leisure & Arts -- Masterpiece: Still Vivid In VistaVision; 'The Searchers' has suspense, action, wit and moments of elegiac catharsis   By Cowie, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2006  "The Searchers" plays as well today as it did in the Eisenhower era. Maybe better. I used to prefer "Stagecoach" and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," but each time I watch "The Searchers," fresh layers of significance emerge, and the medium of DVD has resurrected the film, like so many others, so that it stands before us in all its Technicolor and VistaVision glory.  "The Searchers" plays like a 19th-century "Odyssey," tracing the five-year search for a homesteader's missing daughter in the Texan desert. Little Debbie has been captured by a Comanche buck, and her uncle Ethan, obsessed with loathing, yearns to scalp his foe. Worse still, Ethan wants to kill the niece who, raised by the Comanche, would no longer be "white." But one man, a foundling named Martin Pawley ("one-eighth Cherokee, the rest Welsh and English"), rides with Ethan through heat and snow, determined to retrieve Debbie and to shield her from her uncle's wrath.  Time and again, [John Ford] found in the 1,000 square miles of Monument Valley a metaphor for that utopian wilderness so beloved of writers and painters in the 19th century -- resplendent in its primeval purity and as yet unspoiled by "Western" civilization. If the mind of "The Searchers" is Ethan's obsessive quest, then its heart is the poignant recognition that America's "manifest destiny" amid its majestic plains and peaks was turning sour. "The Searchers" begins in 1868, and eight years ahead lies the massacre of Custer and his men at the Little Big Horn.
