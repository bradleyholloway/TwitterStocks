 Pride and Prejudice Strategy Aims To Hit Deep in the Heart of Texas   By By Alfredo Corchado, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1989  As the ad's tone implies, the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days, and Lone Star isn't alone in trying to take advantage of that. From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks, the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders.  While advertisers have long appealed to Texans' state pride and prejudices, the latest trend has been sparked, in part, by the state's recent hard economic times. That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation, but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders. In the past, writes Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow, outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the "right" Texas attitudes and "of course they had to be dipped for parasites."  There is no small irony in the fact that some of the most-jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of -- you guessed it -- outsiders. Lone Star's Bond Corp. parent, for instance, hails from Perth, Australia. North Carolinians, New Yorkers, Californians, Chicagoans and Ohioans own Texas banks. All kinds of landmark Texas real estate has been snapped up by out-of-staters. Even the beloved Dallas Cowboys were bought by an Arkansas oil man.
