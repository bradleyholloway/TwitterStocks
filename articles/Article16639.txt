 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- details: Designers Jump Into the Frying Pan   By Sokol, David, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2006  Manufacturers say they're trying to reach a new segment of the market, who has had little to choose from other than Le Creuset and All-Clad. Tefal's pieces by Mr. [Marc Newson] are about four times more expensive than the company's other offerings. Jack Markuse, a consultant to Tefal parent company Groupe SEB, calls the line a way "to introduce an upscale consumer to the trademark." Finnish company Iittala and Swedish furniture designer Bjorn Dahlstrom just expanded their Tools line, with pieces from $165 to $250; it's available in stores that don't typically stock fryers and casseroles, including furniture galleries and museum shops.  Julie Chung has checked out several new designs, but says that she found Royal VKB's screw-top lids hard to operate, and was disappointed in the look of Mr. Newson's pieces. "He's done really sexy furniture," says the exhibition designer in New York. "But I don't see it carrying over."
