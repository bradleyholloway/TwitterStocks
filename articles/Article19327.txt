 After Mixed Results With Tech Stocks, Pros Turn to Old Economy for Fourth-Quarter Picks   By By Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  To avoid taking on debt, [Kellstrom] is forming a joint venture with Aviation Sales that will hold inventory, paying for items as they are sold off. Kellstrom expects to pay $50 million initially.  It's a double case of deja vu: Mr. [Barry Stouffer], previously an analyst at J.C. Bradford, the Nashville securities firm that sold to PaineWebber Group this summer, has reappeared, helping set up a Nashville office for Richmond-based BB&T Securities.  Mr. Stouffer says it's time for a second look at his first-quarter pick, Rare Hospitality International, an Atlanta-based restaurant chain that owns LongHorn Steakhouse. His reason: "They've had nine straight quarters of better-than-30% earnings growth," even though the stock lost 10% in the first quarter. Now, at about $22 a share, the company is trading at 16 times the $1.35 in earnings Mr. Stouffer expects next year.
