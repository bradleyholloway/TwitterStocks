 Common Interest: The President and Fed Appear to Be in Step On Latest Rate Rise --- Though Markets Are Rocked, The White House Praises Greenspan's Steady Hand --- Could Inflation Kill Romance?   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1994  When the Fed broke with tradition Friday and publicly announced the rate increase, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and chief White House economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson were preparing to brief reporters on new unemployment figures. Mr. Bentsen had eaten breakfast with Mr. Greenspan, but says he avoided asking whether the long-advertised rate increase was coming. Alerted by the Fed moments before wire-service headlines carried the news, Mr. Bentsen first huddled with Ms. Tyson, White House economic adviser Robert Rubin and presidential image meister David Gergen. He then talked by phone with President Clinton.  Around noon, the Treasury secretary went to the White House press room. Choosing his words more carefully than usual, he emphasized that inflation is "well-contained," but said that the Fed's "pre-emptive strike against inflation" wouldn't "inhibit growth." On Saturday, the Treasury secretary and the Fed chairman played tennis. On Sunday, Mr. Bentsen said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that "the biggest controversy that I have with the chairman of the Federal Reserve was expressed . . . on the tennis courts." (Mr. Bentsen won the first set 6-2; Mr. Greenspan the second in a tie-breaker.)  Mr. Clinton has at least one big advantage over George Bush in dealing with Mr. Greenspan. With the economy slumping, Mr. Bush needed the Fed to cut interest rates swiftly. All Mr. Clinton needs is for Mr. Greenspan to do what comes naturally: move very slowly.
