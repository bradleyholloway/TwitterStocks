 Gearing Up for the Big Game With a Full Roster of Clients   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2005  For years, DDB's sister agency BBDO has reigned as the biggest producer of the big-game ads, but this year DDB finds itself responsible for generating buzz-worthy spots for the likes of McDonald's Corp., Ameriquest Mortgage Co., McIlhenny Co.'s Tabasco, PepsiCo Inc.'s Diet Pepsi and Anheuser-Busch Cos.  Mr. [Bob Scarpelli]: Everyone at the agency gets energized. It's so high- profile that it's almost a benchmark for how well an agency's clients are doing. It's not right for every client. It's an exciting process for the entire agency -- creative executives, account executives and planners. To have your ads play on the biggest game is wild and fun. It is also very stressful. The process is now part of our annual calendar. We start in October.  WSJ: Given the rash of obnoxious ads in last year game -- Bud's flatulating horse and the bevy of erectile-dysfunction ads -- and the brouhaha over Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction," will advertisers tread lightly this year? Does that mean the ads will be flat and lack humor?
