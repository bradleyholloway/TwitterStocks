 Love & Money: Readers: Don't Ask Grandma to Baby-Sit   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2005  "I am feeling my way as far as policy goes, because I don't want to give up huge chunks of my long-awaited freedom," she says. "But I want to serve and bond with my children and grandchildren." Moreover, Ms. [Kathryn Bankhead] says, "I love going to their cities, their churches, their stores and meeting their friends. I feel like I live in several exciting cities and neighborhoods, and get to know what their life is really like." While she returns to her own home "tired and behind in my own responsibilities, it's worth any inconvenience."  "You've got to be kidding -- your son is 8 years old," writes an incredulous Jan Gray, of St. Paul, Minn. "When I was that age, the biggest decision I had to make was what was the one thing I could buy at the grocery store. For Pete's sake, a kid at 8 is interested in everything his friends are interested in. What kids need is to have downtime to play outside, read books, look for bugs. And you decide what he should do -- you're the parents! An 8-year-old is way too tiny to make these decisions."  "During the school year my daughter has 29 holidays, not counting the early-release days, and 111/2 weeks of summer vacation," Ms. [Ann Berasley] says. "That totals 87 weekdays, or just over 17 weeks a year. With both parents working, our combined vacation/holiday time totals eight weeks a year -- not even half the days she has off. I don't want to believe that a lazy summer is a relic, but I don't know how I'll be able to offer my daughter both a long Christmas break and more than two weeks of lazy summer days a year."
