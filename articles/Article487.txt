''ONE NIGHT STAND'' is an unpleasant Canadian romance-cum-thriller about two peppy, overbearing people who meet in a disco and immediately develop the kind of awful intimacy that, under other circumstances, might take years. A lonely and much too vivacious woman named Daisy (Chapelle Jaffe) picks up a penny-dreadful street singer, Rafe (Brent Carver), who looks a little too much like her brother.  They go home to her apartment, which he describes, rather charitably, as a place that might be Mary Tyler Moore's. The people next door are supposed to be having an orgy, which is supposed to be funny. From time to time, these neighbors are seen wearing idiotic lounging clothes or romping on their waterbed.  The singer doesn't seem very interested in sex, although the predatory Daisy, who keeps smirking and putting her foot in his lap, evidently cannot take a hint. Eventually, Daisy discovers that this fellow may be funny in the head. The audience has discovered this a good deal earlier.  ''One Night Stand,'' at the Film Forum, was directed by Allan King and based on a play by Carol Bolt, a play that would certainly work a little better if it were staged and acted less pushily. Mr. Carver trembles and shakes his head expressively virtually every time he speaks, while Miss Jaffe leers disagreeably. The timing is so poor that the singer is supposed to seduce and dispatch someone else while Daisy is merely taking a shower. Daisy must be very clean.
