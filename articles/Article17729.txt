 Floating Point Slips in Science Computers As Competitors Leapfrog Its Technology   By By Carrie Nolan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  Floating Point Systems Inc.'s problems selling high-performance minisupercomputers have given the rest of the fledgling but fast-growing industry the chance they have been seeking.  Competition is heating up in a market that Floating Point pioneered, and for several years, had nearly to itself. Floating Point developed array processors, add-on devices that allow computers to do intensive number-crunching tasks, often called scientific computing. But in the past few years, start-up companies have developed computers that can do scientific functions without an add-on.  "The scientific (computing) market is growing at 40% to 50% a year," says Richard Shaffer, editor of Computer Letter, "and a lot of that growth is coming off Floating Point's hide."
