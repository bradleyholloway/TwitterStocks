 Letters to the Editor: All That Glitters Isn't Profit   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1991  Regarding Jonathan Dushoff's Jan. 16 editorial-page article, "There's Gold Buried Under Capitol Hill": It takes talent to approach a complex, multifaceted issue such as the reform of the Mining Law of 1872 from a single vantage point and come away with an analysis you can comfortably share with others. Mr. Dushoff has displayed admirable skill in this regard, but at the same time performed a disservice to his cause and to the American people.  The hard-rock mining industry creates tens of thousands of jobs, requires large sums of risk capital, and carries its fair share of the federal, state and local tax burden. The mining law is not being abused by legitimate mine operators/mineral explorers, and a claim "patent" -- the process of actually purchasing the land -- is now being granted on fewer than 40 active, unpatented mining claims (fewer than 800 acres) a year nationwide.
