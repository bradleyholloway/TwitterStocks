 Panel Proposes Tax Concessions For Health Bill --- House Committee Offers Flexibility for Business And Extended Coverage   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1994  The new plan, which modifies a bill approved this spring by the panel's health subcommittee, would extend Medicare-like insurance to millions of workers. But it would drop a 1% payroll tax on big business that was approved by the subcommittee. It also would increase cigarette taxes only 60 cents a pack -- half as much as the subcommittee proposed and less than the 75 cent increase sought by the Clinton administration.  These tax concessions could help the acting committee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, consolidate support in his party for the bill. But the Florida Democrat already faces skepticism regarding the plan's assumptions about how health-care reform would be financed. At a briefing late yesterday, Ways and Means staff still referred to several major elements of the plan as not set in stone. And while there is immense pressure on committee Democrats and Mr. Gibbons to show progress after the indictment of former Chairman Dan Rostenkowski last week, the rush to begin action on the bill on Thursday is creating strain.  The core of the bill still resembles the measure approved by the health subcommittee, and it still would meet the president's proposal that employers be required to pay for part of their workers' insurance costs to help reach the goal of providing coverage for Americans. But the Medicare-like insurance option, a device for covering workers in small companies that lack private insurance, would be available only to firms with 50 or fewer workers, compared with 100 workers in the subcommittee plan. And a tax credit would be added to help defray costs for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees and annual wages averaging less than $26,000 a worker.
