 Mexico Acts to Cool Its Economic Recovery Due to Drop in Oil Prices and High Inflation   By By Steve Frazier, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1985  Officials say they will announce soon additional budget cuts totaling $1.25 billion to compensate for an almost-certain decline in Mexican oil revenue. That revenue decline might total as much as the budget cuts. The move also is meant to help slow the economy and keep government budget deficits closer to desired targets.  Mexico has delayed setting its June oil prices until it sorts out what is happening in the world energy market. A decision on prices is expected within the next few days. Mexican officials continue to insist that they don't want to participate in a price war, and say they may choose some combination of price and production cuts to avoid further disrupting the oil market.  To some extent, lower international interest rates will make up for lower oil prices. One analyst figures Mexico will save about $2 billion from an originally projected foreign interest bill of about $12 billion. However, one Mexican official said an increase in domestic interest rates would cost the government slightly more than $2 billion this year, wiping out the savings from lower international rates.
