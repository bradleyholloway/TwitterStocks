 YODER & SONS: It's Good for Us -- and Maybe for the Country   By Stephen Kreider Yoder; Yoder, Isaac S; Yoder, Levi, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2010  Under this economic theory, our snap decision to go to Mexico last month meant Levi and I injected about $2,000 in new stimulus funds to airport workers and airline staff in the U.S., and to hotel janitors, bus drivers, food-stall operators and many others in Mexico. [...] when Karen and I ignore our shrunken 401(k) and take the kids out to eat, or drive up to Tahoe to ski, or buy Levi a new backpack even when his old one is repairable, we are circulating our dollars into the hands of real people with real jobs -- instead of leaving those bucks in a bank that's lending out precious few of them. [...] heaven knows, the big checks we're cutting for our older sons' college bills this year had sure better be helping stimulate the economies of two college towns.
