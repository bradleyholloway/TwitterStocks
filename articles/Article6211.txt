 Safety: Arkansas Crash Puts a Spotlight On Seat Safety   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1999  After long debate, that question is moving into the spotlight as regulators prepare a rule that would force the entire U.S. jet fleet to upgrade its seats. And new evidence in the probe of last week's crash of American Airlines Flight 1420 in Little Rock, Ark., could add more urgency to the issue.  During that crash, according to investigators and the airline, some passenger seats came out of their tracks on impact and scattered about the cabin. It isn't clear whether this contributed to the nine fatalities and dozens of injuries suffered by the 145 passengers and crew on board, but it is precisely why aviation-safety advocates have been pressing since 1970 for sturdier airplane seats.  The Boeing 777 is one of the few new models designed since then. But expecting that the new standard eventually would be applied to all their planes, airlines in the 1990s voluntarily began installing the new seats on other models as well, either when taking delivery of new planes or redoing cabin interiors on older planes. Seat makers report that they no longer manufacture seats to the old standard but make all their products hew to the new specifications. The FAA estimates that 53% of the U.S. commercial jet fleet's nearly 700,000 seats are compatible with the new rules, although most haven't been tested as being certified to that standard.
