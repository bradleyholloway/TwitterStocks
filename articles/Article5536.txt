 Delta's New CEO Lays Out Big Agenda To Upgrade Airline's Customer Service   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1997  Delta Air Lines' new chief executive officer, Leo F. Mullin, offered the first comprehensive look at his plans to tackle customer-service woes.  In an interview yesterday, Mr. Mullin said Delta's ambitious program will cost "a little bit more than we had budgeted, but it isn't material to the total" expenses budgeted for the fiscal year ending next June 30. He said he expects Delta to continue to operate at lower costs than its peers.  Among the more visible upgrades: Delta will speed up its schedule to replace the interiors of the passenger cabins on all of its 550 jets within 16 months, a project originally slated to stretch more than two years. Mr. Mullin said that the entire fleet will get, among other things, new seat covers, carpets, walls and curtains. Quicker repair of customer annoyances, such as broken seat trays, will also get heightened priority, he said.
