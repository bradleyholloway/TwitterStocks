 Tax Police Raid a Russian `Untouchable' --- A Search of Sibneft Shows Tycoon May Not Hold Vast Powers at Kremlin   By By Jeanne Whalen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 2000  Russia's tax police searched the one company few analysts believed they would touch -- oil firm OAO Sibneft, run by tycoon Roman Abramovich -- putting a question mark on Mr. Abramovich's reportedly vast powers within the Kremlin.  Speculation began that Sibneft could come under attack when a Finance Ministry report criticizing the oil company was leaked to the press two weeks ago. In documents prepared for Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, a deputy finance minister said Sibneft paid the lowest tax of all Russian oil firms and recommended enlisting the tax authorities to probe all oil companies' use of offshore zones to evade taxes.  Sibneft has never revealed the names of its individual shareholders, but Mr. [Boris Berezovsky] this spring said that he owned 7% of the company and that, together with Mr. Abramovich, he controlled Sibneft, suggesting Mr. Abramovich holds at least 44%. Mr. Abramovich holds the title of senior director at Sibneft.
