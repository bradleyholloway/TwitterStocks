 Garuda Plans Overhaul With Larger Fleet --- Indonesian Airliner Revamps In Effort to Be Leader In Asian-Pacific Region   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1991  NUSA DUA, Indonesia -- Garuda Indonesia's recent aircraft orders, $3.7 billion of jetliners from the world's leading manufacturers and lessors, are an embarrassment of riches: riches because the company needs to freshen up its fleet, but embarrassing because it won't be able to handle the influx.  Garuda looks like it has fallen under the spell of airplane salesmen. Along with the Airbuses on lease, the government-owned carrier has on order or has committed to lease Boeing Co. 737s and 747s, McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-11s, Airbus A-330s and N.V. Fokker F-100s in the next six years.  Mr. Sunarjo justifies this lineup by saying Jakarta doesn't want the airline to rely on just one manufacturer. Moreover, he says, the Fokkers are for domestic subsidiary PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines, and the MD-11s and A-330s will replace Garuda's old DC-10s.
