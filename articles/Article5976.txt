 The Earth Rebalanced   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  Anthony Palazzolo, an 80-year-old retired auto wrecker, wanted to build on coastal property in Rhode Island that he'd owned for 40 years. The problem? At some point in his tenure the land had been designated protected wetlands. Mr. Palazzolo's many requests for building permits were denied; he finally sued for compensation. The state courts said he had no case. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, and ordered Rhode Island's courts to revisit the question of whether he is owed "just compensation" for the lost value of his property.  What happened to Mr. Palazzolo is an increasingly common and nefarious practice known as a "regulatory taking." The Constitution prohibits the government from taking a citizen's land for public use, such as bridges or roads, without just compensation. But regulatory "takings" are trickier: The state doesn't actually grab your land; it just bars you from doing anything with it. Politicians and activist groups figured out that regulatory takings were a speedy -- and extremely cheap -- way of delivering on environmental promises.
