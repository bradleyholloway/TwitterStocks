 Mulheren Buffaloes His Way Back onto Wall Street   By Cohen, Laurie P, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1991  Once-powerful stock trader John A. Mulheren Jr, who was indicted in 1989 for alleged illegal stock trades with convicted former trader Ivan Boesky, is back on Wall Street with a new firm, Buffalo Partners, and about $50 million to trade. In 1990 Mulheren was convicted of stock manipulation but in Jul 1991, a federal appeals court reversed the fraud and conspiracy convictions. In Dec 1991 the SEC lifted its order barring Mulheren from the securities industry.
