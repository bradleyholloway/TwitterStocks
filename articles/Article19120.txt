 1998 Year-End Review of Markets and Finance: The Year of Investing Dangerously --- Asia's Pain Resulted in Global Distress   By By Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1999  A SAFE BET WAS HARD TO FIND in international stock markets last year. Investors who put their chips on Europe, where markets anticipated economic and monetary union, probably stayed ahead. But those who bet on Russia, Brazil or many other emerging markets learned costly lessons about devaluation and contagion.  It was "a year when contagion and fear took hold; if you were in emerging markets, it was bad," says Leila Heckman, managing director of global-asset allocation at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "The European markets were hit by Russia, but they are ending the year higher, so looking back, Europe has been good."  Currencies from South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines continued to slump against the dollar in early 1998, which helped hammer stock markets across East Asia. Despite huge International Monetary Fund bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea announced in 1997, financial-market turmoil continued to rock the region, and many investors feared Hong Kong and China would be forced to devalue their currencies, too.
