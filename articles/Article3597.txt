 Review / Books: On a Collision Course With the SUV   By By Mark Yost, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  For instance, Mr. [Keith Bradsher] claims that SUV-car accidents are particularly dangerous because SUVs are likely to hit cars and keep right on rolling, crushing the car's occupants. But engineers have already corrected this problem, installing a new front frame rail on most SUVs that matches up with the protective frames of cars. In fact, Ford engineers have dubbed the new device the "Bradsher bar" because it was Mr. Bradsher's reporting, in the New York Times, that helped to prompt the change.  Meanwhile, SUVs are changing in other ways to minimize the mismatch. Mr. Bradsher argues that the "truck-like underbody of an SUV does little to absorb the force of collisions" and that "truck-like brakes and suspensions" lead to more accidents. But in fact the industry has shifted, along with consumer taste. The most popular SUVs -- like the Acura MDX -- are based on car platforms, not those of trucks. And Mr. Bradsher's claim that SUVs are more dangerous to occupants because of their stripped-down, truck-like interiors is just plain wrong. The new Lincoln Navigator -- like other SUVs -- has posh seats that are even air-conditioned and heated.  The new safety features in SUVs are astonishing. No wonder they are expected to account for 52% of new-car sales. The Ford Motor Co., Mr. Bradsher's favorite whipping boy, recently introduced the Volvo XC90, for instance, an SUV (built on a luxury-car chassis) with gyroscopes to detect and prevent rollovers, traction control, an array of side airbags and seat belts that increase tension automatically when the vehicle senses a crash. The seats are designed to prevent whiplash, and the roof will remain intact even if the SUV rolls over.
