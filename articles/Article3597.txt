 Bargain Chain Steve & Barry's Signs an NBA Star   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2006  Though it has generally kept a low profile, on Thursday Steve & Barry's plans to make its first major product launch, a shoe endorsed by Mr. [Stephon Marbury]. The basketball sneaker -- dubbed the "Starbury One," after Mr. Marbury's self-given nickname -- will retail for $14.98, one of the few products Steve & Barry's has priced above $10.  "If you went to the top basketball players and say, 'Wear these sneakers, they cost $15,' they would say, 'No way,'" said Mr. [Howard Schacter]. "But once they have them on their feet, they say, 'This is great.'"  Online forums for basketball fans and sneaker aficionados have been buzzing about the Starbury One, a high-top style that comes in all- black or white with the blue-and-orange accents of the Knicks' uniforms. Some are praising Mr. Marbury's effort to sell a low-price shoe. "I won't wear them for fashion, but if they're practical and durable for a rough pick-up game, then I'm his biggest supporter," one basketball player wrote in a discussion forum for RealGM.com, a professional-sports Web site.
