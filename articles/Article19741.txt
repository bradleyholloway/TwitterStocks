 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2004  Here's how to specify that you get the My AOL QuickView page when you log on, instead of the usual Welcome Screen. In AOL 9.0, click on the Settings icon in the toolbar. In the window that opens, find the Essentials tab and scroll down until you see the item called "Start-up Settings." Click on this item, and, under "Content Window," select "My AOL QuickView" instead of "Welcome Screen." Then click on "Save."  A: Word can detect and correct Caps Lock errors like the one you cite, via its Auto-Correct feature. Just go to the Tools menu, select Auto-Correct options, and check off the option for "Correct accidental usage of cAPS LOCK key." I have found that option to be quite effective. For instance, if I hit the Caps Lock key and type the word "wASHINGTON," it instantly changes to "Washington."
