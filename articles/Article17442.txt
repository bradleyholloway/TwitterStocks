 South Africa Grain Is Again Suffering From Dryness, Heat   By By Wendy L. Wall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1985  Extreme dryness and heat are damaging South Africa's young grain crop, threatening to turn that major corn exporter into a net importer for the third consecutive year.  The troubles in South Africa, once the world's third-largest corn exporter, have helped in recent days to buoy corn prices in the U.S., the largest source of corn in world trade. Corn for March delivery rose 0.75 cent a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, to $2.715 a bushel, up 2.2% from a week earlier.  The same high-pressure weather patterns that are causing South Africa's problems are bringing about the severe famine that plagues Ethiopia and other nations. South Africa's problems bode ill for its African neighbors, not only because it shares certain weather patterns, but because it is a major source of grain for other African countries.
