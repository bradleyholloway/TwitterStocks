 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Compiled by Rich Jaroslovsky, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1989  Easing U.S. interest rates in recent weeks have led some to expect the greenback to drop; instead, it has climbed to new heights. "The fundamentals don't suggest the dollar should be strong," says a Treasury official, "so this must be due to short-term considerations of some sort."  Some officials see political instability in Japan and Germany prompting a flight to the dollar; others believe higher oil prices are pushing the U.S. currency up. The Treasury wants the dollar to drop from its current level, fearing effects on the trade deficit. Fed officials are less committed, since the strong dollar helps hold back inflation.  Yesterday's new charges against North associate Secord could be the first of a string of accusations based on alleged perjury before the congressional investigating committee. Among those under scrutiny is Donald Gregg, the former Bush aide whose already-troubled nomination to be ambassador to South Korea comes before the Senate Foreign Relations panel today.
