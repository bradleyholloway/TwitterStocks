 Letters to the Editor: Trustees Must Protect Their Universities   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  We were surprised that you took issue with our concern that state governments, rather than governing boards, might take it upon themselves to set admissions policies.

Your readers should know that AGB since 1921 has been (in the words you cite) "explaining trustees' statutory responsibility to protect their institutions." We offer some 100 publications, programs and services for the 34,000 individual trustees, chief executives and other senior academic officers on 1,850 campuses who comprise our membership.
