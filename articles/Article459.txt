 Small Business: Four Ways to Trim Your 2007 Tax Bill   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2007  Here's an exception: Business owners expecting to get hit with the alternative minimum tax -- a parallel tax system originally intended for high-income earners -- may be better off collecting extra income in 2007. That's because boosting income can help some taxpayers avoid the AMT, so their income gets taxed at a lower rate, says Bill Fleming, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers's Hartford, Conn., office.  Though Congress's actions are hard to predict, you might still get an idea of whether you're at risk of getting hit by AMT by plugging this year's numbers into last year's tax software, Mr. Fleming suggests. There's also an AMT estimator available at HRBlock.com. Click on the green "Calculators" tab near the top. The calculator currently assumes Congress won't approve a temporary fix, which many expect will happen next month.  Again, if you're expecting to get hit with the AMT, you're generally better off delaying deductions, because AMT doesn't allow some deductions to be taken. "The advice is opposite when it comes to AMT," Mr. Fleming says. "You want to accelerate income and postpone deductions."
