OAKLAND, Calif., March 31â€” Marijuana smoking and cocaine use seem to have become a tradition for some fans at Golden State Warrior home games. The Hayward Daily Review newspaper said Tuesday that last Friday and Sunday nights more than 800 people were seen openly using marijuana, cocaine or other drugs at halftime on the unlighted ramps of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena.  ''The way we look at it is that it's not causing any problems and we feel that if we come down on it with police, it's going to be more hassle than it's worth,'' said Joe Dearborn, the Warriors' director of media services. ''These people are basically having a good time. They're not hurting anybody.''  In California, possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for personal use is a misdemeanor. Possession of cocaine is a felony. A security guard, who identified himself only as Ray, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that the drug use had been going on for three or four years. ''It's just an accepted part of the game, but only at halftime,'' he said.  The newspaper quoted a source as saying that when season ticket holders were asked in 1979 which halftime show they most enjoyed, many answered, ''The ramp.''
