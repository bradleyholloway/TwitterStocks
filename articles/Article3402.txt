 NCAA Basketball Tournament (A Special Report); Where Are They Now? Their tournament is over; Here's how one Final Four team was built -- and what happened to it in the years after the buzzer sounded   By Fatsis, Stefan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2005  Mr. [Russell Walters], 31, remembers the college sports grind: practicing twice a day, missing classes for games, working hard for B's and C's, watching "Days of Our Lives" with teammates to unwind. His one regret: not taking more care in selecting a major. "I just really didn't know what I wanted to do," he says. "I just wanted to play basketball."  Why does he want his degree? Mr. [Erick Dampier] says it wasn't clear he was NBA material until he was a sophomore. Even then, there were no guarantees. So he studied -- he made the SEC's academic honor roll the Final Four year -- and wants to finish what he started. Also, he says, "I have two little sisters. They're always talking about it: 'We're going to graduate before you.' "  [Dontae]' [Jones]'s pro career hasn't been as lucrative. He was taken as the 21st pick in the first round by the New York Knicks and signed a three-year, $2.3 million contract. When he was traded to the Boston Celtics, the team's coach called Mr. [Richard Williams] to ask about Mr. Jones. "I told him he's more talented than you think, he loves to play and is fun to be around if he's getting to play," Mr. Williams says. "If he's not playing, he's miserable and will make you miserable." Mr. Williams ran into the coach a few years later. "He told me I was dead on about Dontae'," he says.
