 Bush Is Finding House Republicans Wary of His Agenda --- Ties Are Strained by Lingering Resentments, Concerns About Midterm Elections   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  After Mr. [George W. Bush]'s attempts during his "compassionate conservatism" campaign to distance himself from the House caucus, attempts at a closer partnership are showing some early strains from both conservatives and moderates. After an early demonstration of unity in favor of Mr. Bush's tax-cut bill, renegade Republicans have lately defied the White House and handed the administration defeats by voting to boost funds for energy conservation and to bar U.S. safety permits for Mexican trucks. At the same time, House leaders have pressured the administration from the right amid talk of a compromise on the issue of embryonic stem-cell research, firing up GOP grass-roots opposition.  Administration officials believe time is on their side. While campaign finance overhaul -- an issue low on Mr. Bush's priority list -- dominates House action this week, Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney will ratchet up their lobbying efforts on energy and patients' rights. Mr. Bush personally plans to travel to Capitol Hill this week to meet with House Republicans and thank them for past support and "look at the . . . months ahead," a senior White House official says.  Interviews with House members suggest Mr. Bush still has ground to make up since his 1999 assertion that congressional Republicans were trying to "balance the budget on the backs of the poor." A tone-deaf performance by White House aides since January isn't instilling confidence, some members say; for instance, at a time when the White House was emphasizing party loyalty, some members felt blindsided when Mr. Bush decided to stop Navy bomb tests on the Puerto Rico island of Vieques following protests from Hispanics, an increasingly politically influential group.
