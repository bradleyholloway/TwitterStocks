 Microsoft Tries to Lob Monkey Wrench Into AOL-Time Warner Deal   By By John R. Wilke and Julia Angwin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2000  The FTC has a tentative agreement with Time Warner in which the New York media giant would open its high-speed cable TV lines to AOL's competitors before AOL itself can offer Internet service over those same lines. Time Warner last month struck a deal with a smaller AOL rival, EarthLink Inc., as a first step toward meeting the FTC's demand that it open up its lines.  Enter Microsoft, which has told the FTC that Time Warner is refusing to negotiate further with the software maker because it prefers to deal with a weaker competitor, like EarthLink, and that the EarthLink deal doesn't go far enough to bring costs down. Before talks stalled, Microsoft was seeking Internet access through Time Warner based on a flat fee that would decline over time, those close to the talks say; both Time Warner and Microsoft declined to comment last night.  There remain strong misgivings at the commission that Time Warner did not want a deal with Microsoft, which would be a stronger competitor to AOL, people briefed on the deliberations said. Fueling these doubts, Microsoft met with commissioners to argue that the EarthLink deal should go further, but it isn't clear if Time Warner will be willing to alter the deal. Indeed, there are signs that the companies are digging in their heels and want a vote.
