 Mysteries With a Literary Twist   By By Tom Nolan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2002  In this book's version of Britain in 1985 (when the Crimean War is in its 131st year), Thursday Next, a female member of the Literary Detective Division of the Special Operations Network, does battle with an arch-villain. He is Acheron Hades ("Don't ever call me mad . . . I'm just . . . differently moraled"), who has seized control of an invention that affords humans a literal entryway into works of prose and poetry. Unless his demands are met, Hades threatens violent injury to Charlotte Bronte's character Jane Eyre.  "Some things are more important than rules and regulations," Thursday Next tells an overly careful colleague. "Governments and fashions come and go but Jane Eyre is for all time. I would give everything to ensure the novel's survival." That "everything" eventually draws Thursday into Bronte's text, where (aided by Mr. Rochester) she does battle with those who would harm Jane Eyre -- and "Jane Eyre."  It's satisfying to see [Sam McCain] sort things out, and even more satisfying to spend time with him in 1960. He chews Blackjack gum, drinks J&B scotch out of a Peter Pan peanut-butter glass and listens to the latest singers with old-fashioned reluctance. "Hearing Bobby Rydell ruin a Jerome Kern song," he dryly confesses, "wasn't something I dealt with very well."
