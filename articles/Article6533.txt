 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Show Me the Monet   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2006  Museums are a bit conflicted, though, about throwing open their archives to garden-variety gawkers. Few want outsiders to know too much about what's in the basement and where, exactly, they're keeping the extra Pollocks. Many warehouses are dark and cramped. They're often built with library-style, rolling stacks that allow only a few feet of space between metal cabinets. To protect their archived works, most museums have a long list of don'ts: No snacks, ink pens, bags or cameras, no high heels and, in some cases, no children. One biology lab at the Smithsonian even has a no-head-scratching rule. (It doesn't want to contaminate its DNA samples.)  Many museums, of course, continue to guard their annex space. New York's Whitney Museum of American Art used to allow people into its storage areas, but says it no longer has the space to accommodate even researchers. The Met keeps the vault doors closed to everyone but the occasional trustee and donor (usually those who've given $20,000 and up). MoMA and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts won't let visitors beyond its study rooms, where works can be pulled from storage. The New-York Historical Society, with a big collection of Hudson River School paintings, also limits backstage visitors to a small study room, but says it will fulfill serious requests with two weeks' notice. "So long as your interest is legitimate, you're in," says museum director Linda S. Ferber.  If museums ask her for accreditation, she has one last trick up her sleeve. "I just say, 'Cambridge,'" says the Boston-area resident. "I've lived there for ages."
