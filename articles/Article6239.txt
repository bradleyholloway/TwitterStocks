 Court Says Wal-Mart Broke Labor Laws By Not Paying Its Pharmacists Overtime   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1999  A federal court in Denver ruled that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. violated labor laws in not paying its pharmacists overtime and must pay back wages.  Wal-Mart said yesterday that it plans to appeal the ruling in the class-action lawsuit. "We're confident that we have been very fair in the treatment of our professional pharmacists and have been fully compliant with the Fair Labor Standards Act," said Les Copeland, a Wal-Mart spokesman.  About 700 pharmacists are covered in the lawsuit, said Jon Neil Barclay, a lawyer with Franklin D. Azar & Associates in Denver who is representing them. Another 400 current and former Wal-Mart pharmacists, who missed the deadline for joining the class, are covered in another class-action suit, he said. A ruling is still pending in that case.
