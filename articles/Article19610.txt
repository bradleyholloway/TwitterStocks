 War Jitters Yield Spring Break Deals   By By Melanie Trottman and Kortney Stringer, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  Orbitz, the airline-owned reservations site, is experiencing slow bookings to Europe as well as cancellations, says Jeff Katz, chief executive. Leisure travelers have been the first to back out, and Mr. Katz expects business travelers will follow.  Hotel chains including Loews say the threat of war is affecting their booking patterns, too. The most cautious travelers are making reservations less than 30 days before departure, an increasingly common practice amid war and terrorism concerns. Dynamic Travel in Southlake, Texas, hasn't seen outright cancellations, but says reservations have slowed. Families are "just waiting to see what happens with the war -- and then what happens with the economy after the war," says owner Steve Cosgrove.  There has also been a drop in the number of foreign travelers planning on coming to the U.S. That's producing some hotel bargains in cities like San Francisco and Orlando, says Bob Diener of Hotels.com, a reservation site. For instance, the three-star Commodore Hotel near Union Square in San Francisco is going for $95 most nights in mid-March, down $40 from the typical rate during that time, according to Mr. Diener. The nearby Britton Hotel books for $89.95 a night, a similar savings.
