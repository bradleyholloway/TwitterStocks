 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Lawyers vs. Defense   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 13, 1987  On Wednesday, Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, released a report on the Reagan administration's strategic defense initiative. In 147 pages, the senator never said whether to deploy SDI or what to do about the Soviet radar at Krasnoyarsk or how to defend ourselves against the still-growing Soviet missile force.  Instead, the top dog of the Senate and the Democratic Party on defense matters has been devoting his attention these past months to discovering what was in the minds of the senators who voted in favor of the ABM treaty back in 1972. He's decided they had in mind the "restrictive" interpretation of the provisions on tests of systems based on "exotic" technologies, and that if the administration proceeds on the basis of the "broad" interpretation it will have a "constitutional confrontation" with the Senate.
