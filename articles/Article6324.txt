 A Rude Awakening   By By Nancy Ann Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  Barry Barnett is starting to think so. The health-benefits consultant was delivering a presentation to some new dot-com clients, when one of them suddenly cut him off and barked, "I don't care." So is famed restaurateur Danny Meyer, who watched with dismay recently as a customer interrupted a waitress to answer his cell phone -- but grabbed her and told her to keep talking. And flight attendant Lori Vitto, who had to intervene when one passenger told another: "I hope you die."  Talk about a rude awakening. While impolite behavior has always been a fact of life, there is mounting evidence that incivility not only is on the rise but has become almost the norm in many parts of the culture. A recent University of North Carolina survey of 775 workers nationwide found that every single person had experienced some type of rude behavior on the job, including insults, curses, nasty e-mails and denigrating gossip. Restaurant reviewer Zagat Survey LLC found that gripes about service have tripled over the past five years. Meanwhile, air travel has practically become a combat zone, with customer-service complaints more than doubling last year alone, according to the U.S. Transportation Department.  But the rise in rudeness is by no means just a Silicon Valley phenomenon. The Ohio Farm Bureau recently warned farmers to keep their tractors off the road at rush hour because of an uptick in aggressive driving behavior. In Michigan, more than half the residents surveyed in a statewide poll last month said they curse daily. Even the South, though still associated with hospitality, "is very much like the rest of the country now," says Wyck Knox, chairman of Atlanta law firm Kilpatrick Stockton. Mr. Knox's particular pet peeve: people who scream into their cell phones in public places, oblivious to the sensibilities of those around them.
