 Southland Corp. Buyout to Force Some Unit Sales --- Thompsons Must Pare Back To 3 Basic Businesses To Fund $4 Billion Pact   By By Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  The Thompson brothers' proposed $4 billion purchase of Southland Corp. will force the founding family to pare back the diversified concern to its 7-Eleven stores, distribution centers and half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., Southland said.  To help pay the $5.1 billion in new debt the family will take on to buy shares outstanding and refinance current debt, Southland will have to sell its ice-making unit, Southland's original business, along with its dairies, snack foods manufacturing plants and chain of 465 Chief Auto Parts stores.  Neither Southland nor the Thompsons will discuss why the brothers are offering to buy the concern. But according to the tender offer document filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Canadian investor Samuel Belzberg approached Southland and said he was interested in acquiring the company in a leveraged buyout during one of several meetings with Southland's Chairman John P. Thompson. Mr. Belzberg said he owned 4.9% of Southland's stock. He also said he was interested in considering a leveraged buyout at $65 a share, perhaps in partnership with the Thompson family.
