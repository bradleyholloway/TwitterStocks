 Business World: Magnificent Obsession   By Jenkins, Holman W, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  Personal retirement accounts have been run up the flagpole and Congress hasn't saluted. Now President Bush has hauled another pennant to the top of his mast, with his endorsement of the Pozen plan, brainchild of former mutual fund chieftain Robert Pozen. There is perhaps genius here if rubbing the country's face in Social Security's finances will get Congress over the hump of recognizing the need for some kind of private savings alternative. But don't get overly excited.  Pay-as-you-go programs can't be made "solvent," as the Pozen plan gamely attempts, because we can't dictate to future generations how much they should pay in taxes or offer in benefits. Nor does it really make sense to talk about Social Security's "solvency" in isolation from the other pay-as-you-go demands on future taxpayers, such as Medicare -- and pretending otherwise should just deepen the cynicism of younger workers. Here's why:  Don't misunderstand: This column has long surmised that Social Security and Medicare were destined to become poorhouses providing only for those who couldn't or wouldn't provide for themselves. That much is clear to anybody who looks at the taxes future workers would have to pay to maintain Social Security and Medicare as universal entitlements. But this is a dead horse, and no urgent purpose is served by yet another symbolic attempt to cut benefits decades hence to fit revenues expected to be available decades hence.
