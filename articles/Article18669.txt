 Canadian Brokers Bolster for Wave of U.S. Competitors --- Brisk Government-Bond Sales Unsettle Cozy Domestic Business   By By Solange de Santis, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1995  A wave of new competition is washing north as major U.S. securities firms expand operations here, mainly to underwrite and trade Canadian government debt. That's making the largest Canadian securities firms -- most of them bank subsidiaries -- nervous.  The Americans are moving in because Canadian government debt is no longer a cozy domestic business. In order to finance its growing debt, the federal government has kept bond yields high to attract foreign investors. Now, nonresidents hold some 40% of Canada's combined federal and provincial debt, which totals about 780 billion Canadian dollars ($557.42 billion), making Canada one of the most highly indebted of all industrialized countries.  In the past couple of years, the Canadian operations of Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group L.P. have leveraged their expertise in international markets to win business co-managing a number of global bond deals of C$1 billion and more from government and quasi-government issuers, such as Ontario Hydro, the big electric utility.
