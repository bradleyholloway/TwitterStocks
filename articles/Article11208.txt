 Aylwin Chosen by Chile Opposition Party To Run for President, Is Expected to Win   By By Imogen Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1989  SANTIAGO, Chile -- The largest political party in Chile chose Patricio Aylwin, a 70-year-old lawyer and former senator, as its presidential candidate yesterday.  While Mr. Aylwin has a few more hurdles to clear, he is widely expected to win next December's elections and succeed Augusto Pinochet as president in March 1990. General Pinochet took power in a bloody coup in 1973.  Mr. Aylwin, seven-time leader of the moderate Christian Democrat Party, must forge a consensus with the 16 other opposition parties, ranging from socialists to liberals and conservatives.
