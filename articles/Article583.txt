PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y., Aug. 2â€” The Giants made a trade today for Bill Matthews, a reserve linebacker from the New England Patriots and , after a 27-hour absence, Gary Jeter, the veteran defensive end, came back to the training camp.  Jeter, a Giant since 1977, left camp Sunday following an afternoon practice.  He met today with Coach Ray Perkins,who said that Jeter's absence was due to ''personal problems'' and that the player would be fined for missing meetings and two practices today.  Jeter, 27, who lives in Secaucus, N.J., was unavailable for comment. The addition of Matthews, a pro player for four seasons, brings the number of linebackers to 16, 10 of them veterans. Matthews, an inside linebacker, started nine games for the Patriots last season as a replacement for the injured Steve Nelson. Matthews had been a reserve and special teams player in previous seasons. The trade, for a future draft choice conditional upon Matthews's making the final squad of 45, was completed with the endorsement of Ron Erhardt and Bill Parcells, former Patriot coaches on Perkins's staff.
