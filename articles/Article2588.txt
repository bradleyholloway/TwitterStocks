 Health-Care Compromises Appeal to Some Small Firms --- Certain Trade Groups Warm to Mitchell Proposal but Others Balk at Mandate   By By Michael Selz, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1994  Leading groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business still staunchly oppose a mandatory health-care system. But other important voices are responding more favorably to compromise proposals, such as those outlined by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) last weekend.  "Several months ago, it seemed that everybody had dug in their heels and our frustration level had hit a high," says John Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council, a coalition of 100 trade groups that represent small businesses. "Now, we're beginning to see actions by Sen. Mitchell and some House members that don't fully address what we're worried about, but at least acknowledge our concerns." Mr. Satagaj says he feels more encouraged now than a few months ago about prospects for reaching a compromise on the health-care issue.  Mr. Mitchell spelled out several ways to cut the expense of universal health care, including requiring employers to pick up 50% instead of 80% of a standard benefit package's cost and targeting subsidies to low-wage workers instead of entire businesses. His proposals did little, however, to thaw resistance of the 600,000-member NFIB, the nation's largest small-business group.
