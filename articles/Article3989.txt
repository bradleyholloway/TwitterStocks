 WSJ(12/21) Calpine Announces Chapter 11 Filing   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  A series of legal skirmishes with investors plagued the company. A Delaware court this week ruled that Calpine must repay $313 million it took from proceeds of an asset sale to buy natural gas for its power plants. An earlier ruling in the same matter last month helped spur Calpine's board to oust Mr. [Peter Cartwright] and Robert Kelly, the company's longtime finance chief. People with knowledge of the matter say the board wanted Messrs. Cartwright and Kelly to have a backup plan, in case the company's business continued to struggle, but the men remained committed to the path the company was on and declined to develop a bankruptcy alternative.  Also at issue will be billions of dollars in wholesale power-supply contracts entered into by Calpine. Mr. May said the company intends "to commence discussions tomorrow [today] to modify those contracts" but added he is hoping to do so without a court fight. The California attorney general already has said he will defend contracts in which Calpine supplies the state's utilities with power at below-market prices. In the past, bankruptcy courts and federal regulators have been reluctant to disrupt power-supply contracts if that would hurt consumers.
