 Tip of the Week: Go Digital With Photos   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2007  You may want to go with 600 dpi -- and ask for "TIFF" files, as opposed to the more common "JPEG" files -- if you plan to make enlargements or manipulate photos on your computer.  The low-frills 30MinPhotos.com scans up to 1,000 pictures for $49.95. Expect to pay more if you want photo-enhancement services, like red-eye removal or digital scratch repair. A couple of higher-end services include ScanCafe.com, at $0.27 for 600 dpi, and DigMyPics.com, at $0.39 for 300 dpi.
