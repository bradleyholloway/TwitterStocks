 The Buzz -- Bids & Offers -- Wall Street Bonuses Enhance American Dream: In New York, It's 2BRs and a Meditation Garden   By Colter, Gene, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2006  THE AGENDA at the subtly dubbed "Acquire or Be Acquired" conference -- feeding the merger-and-acquisitions frenzy since 1995 -- this year is ripped from the headlines. The scheduled keynote speaker for the day-one session on Jan. 29 is Jay Sidhu, president and chief executive of Sovereign Bancorp. The program for the conference, to be held over several days at the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa, says that Mr. Sidhu will reveal how he has "grown his bank into one of the 17 largest banking institutions in the country." A Sovereign official confirms Mr. Sidhu will take to the dais.  Sovereign's latest deal has its largest outside shareholder, Relational Investors, questioning Mr. Sidhu's strategy, notably a three-way deal to sell nearly 20% of the Philadelphia lender to a Spanish bank and use proceeds to help buy a regional bank in New York. The past few months have brought many twists in this tale, including: Sovereign having to restructure that deal in order not have to put it to a shareholder vote; Sovereign suing Relational; a banker praising Sovereign and lashing out at Relational in an editorial column (in which he neglected to mention his firm has worked for Sovereign); and Sovereign scheduling its annual meeting later than usual, after the stake sale to the Spanish bank is due to wrap.
