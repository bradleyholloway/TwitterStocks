 Ford Probes Work Conditions At Part Makers in China, Mexico   By McCracken, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2006  He said Ford cited suppliers for substandard worker living areas, such as dormitories that lacked fire escapes or were located above toxic-waste dumps. Ford also found suppliers violating local labor laws by paying a training wage below minimum wage for weeks or months at a time. Ford has hired the Swiss goods-inspection company SGS SA to do the audits and has trained about 900 buyers in Ford purchasing on working condition standards.
