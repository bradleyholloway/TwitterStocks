 Microsoft Verdict: The Day After --- Now What? Remedies Raise Many Questions   By By Gary McWilliams and Ted Bridis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  The court order also spells out how Microsoft must deal with rivals. Microsoft can't threaten others or withhold information from other companies to protect its own products. During the trial that found it a monopoly, Microsoft was accused of undermining rival products with a refusal to provide needed information.  Some companies say its behavior couldn't be nicer. John McHale, chief executive of Netpliance Inc., a developer of an Internet-access device and online service that competes with Microsoft's MSN network, is in the process of licensing Microsoft's Embedded Windows software for a new product. "They have never mandated to us what we had to install," he said. "Microsoft isn't telling us to drop anything or put their brand on it."  The rules, called behavioral remedies, spell out how Microsoft must treat customers and rivals for the next 10 years. They also guide the prices charged to its largest customers for its operating software and even the manner in which Microsoft must provide details on the inner workings of its cherished Windows software. Lawyers for Microsoft yesterday argued in a court filing that the judge's order would inflict "grievous and irreparable harm" on the company, and they complained that the changes sought by the government were "radical." The company asked that all the remedies be blocked until a final appeals review.
