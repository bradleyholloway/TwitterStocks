 FDA Petitions Cytosol to Recall Therapy Used After Eye Surgery   By Suzanne Sataline and Sylvia Westphal, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2006  The agency asked Cytosol to retrieve the entire inventory of the solution, which is marketed under the brand names Cytosol Ophthalmics, AMO Endosol and Akorn. Distributor Advanced Medical Optics Inc., of Santa Ana, Calif., issued its own recall in November of AMO Endosol, after doctors reported about 30 cases of TASS and testing linked it to the saline solution, a spokeswoman said.
