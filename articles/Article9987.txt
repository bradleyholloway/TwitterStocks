 Ford Lifts Convertible Offering That Has Won Hedge-Fund Fans   By Aneiro, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2006  "It's one of the few convertibles that constitute a real arbitrage opportunity," said Michael Schram, managing partner of Stamford, Conn.-based hedge fund Schram Capital Management. The main drivers for these arbitrage trades are the underlying stock price, equity volatility, credit-risk premiums and interest rates. An investor buying the Ford convertible bond can hedge out those risks in varying degrees and still book a profit.  Mr. Schram cites in particular an unusually ideal relationship between the deal's coupon rate, which is relatively high for a convertible issue, and its conversion premium. "Typically you either get a lesser credit with a relatively substantial coupon and sometimes a larger premium, or you get something that's extremely volatile but the coupon is much lower," he said. "Here you get both."  Fitch Ratings, which on Tuesday gave a B rating to the convertible debt offer, on Wednesday downgraded Ford's senior unsecured rating to B-minus yesterday, citing the increased the size of the convertible deal and credit facility. Standard & Poor's on Tuesday assigned a CCC- plus rating to the convertible offering, and Moody's Investors Service assigned an equivalent Caa1 rating, placing it deep in speculative- grade territory.
