 The Worst Part Is, Al Gore Really Believes It   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1997  Most politicians will settle for passing a reform or two. Vice President Al Gore has bigger ambitions. He's out to save the Earth from the ravages of humanity. When your goal is that grand, the U.S. Senate is just a speed bump on the road to salvation.  That's the only way to appreciate what Mr. Gore and his band of negotiators were willing to concede this week in Kyoto. To mollify Europe, they bound the U.S. to greater reductions in carbon emissions than even President Clinton proposed. Then they let poor countries off the hook from similar obligations -- flying in the face of a bipartisan Senate warning. Their only goal was a deal, on any terms.  Not that this will be easy. "To do so requires humility," Mr. Gore also said, "because the spiritual roots of our crisis are pridefulness and a failure to understand and respect our connections to God's Earth and to each other." In Mr. Gore's vision, humankind is the despoiler of earthly Eden and the internal combustion engine is the fruit of original sin.
