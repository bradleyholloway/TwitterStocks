 Wyly Wins Backing of Key Group In Battle at Computer Associates   By By Jerry Guidera, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2001  The dissident slate is being advanced by Ranger Governance Ltd., which is funded by Mr. [Sam Wyly], a Texas investor and former software executive. Ranger first put forth a 10-person slate to unseat the entire Computer Associates board, but withdrew that proposal, along with Mr. Wyly's own nomination, after failing to get much support.  Mr. Wyly last year sold his own software firm to Computer Associates. His proxy fight has been dogged by questions over governance practices at companies he has operated. Those and other issues were cited by both ISS and Proxy Monitor in rejecting the previous Ranger proposal.  Charles Wang, Computer Associates chairman, said the company was "disappointed" by the ISS recommendation. The Ranger plan, he said, "would create a divided board and hurt the company and its shareholders" because it would "include four of Wyly's own hand-picked appointees who would be likely to push a plan designed by Wyly that, in our view, has been discredited."
