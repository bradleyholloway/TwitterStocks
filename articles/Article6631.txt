 Bally Total Fitness Chief Quits; Flagging Stock Falls Nearly 20%   By By Thomas M. Burton, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2002  In recent years, Bally's revenue grew from $576 million in 1998 to $852 million in 2001, and membership revenue has increased 7% annually during the past four years. But Bally's share price hasn't followed suit. It has fallen from about $30 a share in January 2001 to the low $20s in January of this year -- and has gone mostly downward this year. At 4 p.m., Bally shares closed at $6.82, down $1.69, on the Big Board.
