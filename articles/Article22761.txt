 CFTC Files Three Cases Alleging Broker Fraud In Currency Contracts   By By Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2001  The CFTC effort has been aided by legislation that took effect in December, which gives the regulator the authority to pursue unregistered brokers who sell foreign-currency options to individual investors. The CFTC's ability to fight fraud in this area previously had been limited by appeals-court rulings in California and Florida, which said it lacked jurisdiction. Consequently, many of the nearly 200 foreign-currency brokers in the U.S. are now concentrated in South Florida, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Last month, the CFTC also filed two other cases alleging a similar pattern of fraudulent currency-contract sales. The regulator filed suit in federal court in Miami against SunState FX Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., alleging that $1 million had been misappropriated. CFTC also brought a case in federal court in Atlanta against Infinite Trading Group LLC, based there.
