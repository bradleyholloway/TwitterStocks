 Bookshelf: Chinese Puzzle: The Two Faces of Zhou   By By Ronald Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1985  In "Zhou-Enlai: A Biography" (Viking, 349 pages, $17.95), East Asian scholar Dick Wilson focuses on the political deeds by which Zhou left a vast mark on China. Although this is the most complete English biography of Zhou so far, Mr. Wilson ignores the ends toward which Zhou worked: the creation of a totalitarian state that systematically denied its citizens even the most basic freedoms.  On orders from his superiors, Zhou joined the Nationalist Chinese Guomindang and returned to China to work under Chiang Kai-shek at the Huangpu Military Academy. This first period of communist-Guomindang cooperation ended after Chiang brutally suppressed the Shanghai uprising led by Zhou in 1927. Zhou escaped, despite Chiang's offer of a $200,000 reward for his capture. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he traveled twice to Moscow where he was hailed by Stalin as a loyal ally.  By 1934, the Guomindang's increasing pressure forced the Red Army to leave its base in Jiangxi and begin the legendary "Long March" to the north of China. At a crucial Politburo meeting during the Long March, Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), with Zhou's tacit support, finally captured the leadership of the Communist Party -- which he would never relinquish. That Zhou did not oppose Mao for the chairmanship is puzzling, and Mr. Wilson suggests that Zhou must have later regretted it. The two men had often seriously disagreed about party and military policy and were not on friendly terms.
