 HCA Issues Earnings Warning Due to Storms, More Uninsured   By Davies, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2004  HCA said the hurricanes disrupted business at all 40 of its hospitals and 28 surgery centers in Florida. Some hospitals were evacuated, and patients were transferred. Other facilities were badly damaged, forcing their closure and cancellation of operations. HCA is insured for the damage to the buildings, but patient volumes remain down since many tourists and residents fled the state or postponed surgery.  HCA said it is using the Dutch auction, as opposed to the more traditional approach of buying stock in the open market, to complete the large stock purchase in a short period of time within a set stock price, and to lock in the interest rate on the money borrowed to buy back the stock. Shortly after the stock buyback was announced, Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded HCA's credit rating to double-B-plus, which is below investment grade, from triple-B-minus.
