 Bill Clinton Reads Own Audio Book in Pricing Twist   By Trachtenberg, Jeffrey A, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2004  "Many discounters wouldn't let us put audio books on the same rack as the hardcovers, because only items of the same price can appear on the same display," says David Naggar, president of Random House Audio Publishing Group. "Now we can sell both together." All will debut June 22. Bertelsmann's Knopf imprint is issuing 1.5 million hardcovers.  Booksellers believe the opportunity to listen to Mr. Clinton's voice should give "My Life" a boost. "We consistently see that it makes a huge difference when a high-profile person whose voice is well-known reads their own book," says Donald Katz, chief executive of Audible Inc., a publicly traded Internet venture that offers digital audio books. The book also is coming out at the peak season for vacation travel, which tends to benefit audio books.
