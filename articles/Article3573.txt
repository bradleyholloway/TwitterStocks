 Not So Neutral; The Debate Over 'Net Neutrality' Is Roiling the World Wide Web; Moby vs. Welfare for Billionaires   By Dionne Searcey and Amy Schatz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  One of the video clips, which was produced by MoveOn.org, features the musician Moby trying to convince confused pedestrians outside of the U.S. Capitol to support laws that would force phone and cable companies to treat all Internet traffic equally as it flows over their networks. Over on telecom-backed NetCompetition.org, the video warning of "a socialized Internet," decries "corporate welfare for dot-com billionaires."  Then there is "Ask a Ninja." In "Net Neutrality Ninja," a man in a black Ninja outfit offers a comic rant about the dangers of giving Internet providers too much control over content. If that happens he warns that some of the more off-beat offerings could disappear. "That's what the Internet is all about, people in funny hats making things that people like," says the Ninja.  "I'm trying to figure out a way to shorten 'proscriptive government controls over products and services delivered over the Internet' into one or two words. It ain't easy!" a Hill aide groused recently. Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska told a group of cable executives last week, "The more I seek to find what the problem is, the harder job I have of trying to define it."
