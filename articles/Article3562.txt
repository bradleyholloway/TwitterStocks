 Personal Business: Before Switching States, Check the Tax Climate   By Tara Siegel Bernard, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  "The tax savings [from relocating] can be substantial when you factor in both income and estate taxes," says Sam Petrucci, vice president in the client advisory group at Credit Suisse Private Banking USA in New York.  Retirees also need to consider whether they're eligible for tax breaks on retirement income or property, which vary by state. For instance, pension income isn't taxed in Pennsylvania. And in Illinois, income from qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts is excluded for state income-tax purposes, according to CCH.  Some taxpayers will find that they have to take measures to extricate themselves from their old states or risk having to pay taxes there as well. To change the state of residency, "sometimes it's simply a matter of rebalancing where is the center of their activities and how much time they spend in each home," says Len Adler, a J.P. Morgan Private Bank wealth adviser based in Palm Beach, Fla. "It's often not that difficult to do if they are properly advised and careful about the details."
