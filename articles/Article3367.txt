 Merry -- but Not for All; With 2004 Holiday Sales The Strongest Since 1999, Why Are Big Retailers Sad?   By Kemba J. Dunham, Amy Merrick and Ann Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2005  The adjustment highlights the shift under way in the kinds of gifts consumers are giving. "People, instead of giving the sweater or the scarf, are looking for something different," says Tracy Mullin, president of the NRF. "In some cases, they're giving . . . sporting tickets, trips or theater tickets." Traditional retailers, she says, "probably need to figure out a way to either sell unusual traditional goods -- things that are one-of-a-kind -- or to make the shopping experience so enjoyable that there's a reason for the consumer to go into the store."  A drawback of the Commerce Department's survey is that it is subject to revisions, which can be sharp. Two weeks after the end of each month, it releases an "advance" report for the month based on 5,000 retailers. A month later, it releases a "preliminary" estimate based on the full 12,000-retailer survey. A third report, the "final estimates," is released 60 days after the first report's release.  "Consumers are shopping at furniture stores, home improvement stores and buying gifts at these places which is why it is important to look at overall retail sales," says Gina Martin, an economist at Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, N.C. "These are things that the general merchandise category misses."
