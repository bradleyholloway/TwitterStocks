 Ballmer Says Windows Rests on Ruling   By By Nicholas Kulish, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2002  Under Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's orders, Microsoft released the depositions of Mr. [Steve Ballmer] and James Allchin, the longtime Windows chief and one of Microsoft's highest-ranking executives. Action in the antitrust case against the software company has heated up again in recent weeks, as the states that refused to settle alongside the Bush administration last year press for tougher remedies in a new trial round that begins Monday in U.S. District Court here.  Microsoft's CEO said Windows wouldn't function under provisions of the proposed settlement calling for versions of the operating system stripped of "middleware," programs that work with the operating system such as Internet browsers and media players. Mr. Ballmer said the states' request would mean creating between 4,000 and 8,000 "unique versions of Windows that we would need to test, design for and manage."  At the start of his videotaped deposition, Mr. Ballmer looked stone-faced and slightly uncomfortable, sitting at a conference table in a coat and tie with a microphone pinned to his lapel. But he grew more expressive as he began to talk about Microsoft's business. Both depositions took place on Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Wash.
