 Ford Mulls Sale Of New Holland Unit to Fiat --- Discussions Are Being Held With Italian Auto Maker On Farm Gear Subsidiary   By By Paul Ingrassia and Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1990  DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. is holding discussions on the possible sale of its Ford New Holland farm-equipment subsidiary to Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, people familiar with the situation said.  Such a move would mark the second major retreat from diversification by Ford in recent months. The No. 2 U.S. auto maker already has announced that it wants to sell its Ford Aerospace unit. The company wants to free capital and other resources to concentrate on the increasingly competitive auto industry worldwide, and to expand its financial-services operations.  Just three years ago Ford was aggressively expanding into the agricultural-equipment business. The auto maker bought the New Holland division of Sperry Corp. for $330 million and combined it with the Ford Tractor division to form Ford New Holland in January 1987. Later that year, Ford purchased Versatile Corp., which makes large four-wheel drive tractors.
