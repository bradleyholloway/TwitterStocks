 Cox Defends Pre-Approved SEC Fines As Speeding Cases, Lifting Penalties   By Burns, Judith, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  Addressing the Mutual Fund Directors' Forum, Mr. [Christopher Cox] said that wasn't the case. "Commission review of enforcement actions shouldn't slow down the process," he said. He said cases subject to the new process will be put on a fast track, allowing commissioners to sign off on them individually, rather than meeting as a group to approve them.
