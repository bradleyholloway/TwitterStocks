 GM's Delphi IPO Meets Expectations, Raises $1.7 Billion   By By Gregory L. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1999  With 1998 revenue of $28.5 billion, Delphi is the world's largest auto-parts maker and among the largest companies in the U.S. But Delphi's profit performance has been weak, with last year's net income down 36% to $889 million from $1.38 billion in 1997, excluding the effects of charges and work stoppages. The company argues that once it is fully independent from GM, it will be able to cut costs and expand business with other auto makers, who had been fearful of sharing future-product secrets with a unit of a competitor.
