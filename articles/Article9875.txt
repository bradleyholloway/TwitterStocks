 Paramount May Sell DreamWorks Library to Soros   By Marr, Merissa, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2006  Paramount has said it is looking to raise $850 million to $1 billion for DreamWorks's 59-title library that includes movies such as "Gladiator" and "American Beauty." However, it is unclear what price Mr. [George Soros]'s fund -- part of the financier's New York-based Soros Fund Management LLC -- is offering and whether it would end up as the sole investor.  It was an offer by Mr. Soros's team that helped spur Paramount's bid for DreamWorks in the first place. The fund stepped forward as a potential backer for Paramount around Thanksgiving, said people familiar with the situation. Paramount then rushed together an offer for DreamWorks, beating out General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal.  Paramount is using the acquisition to shake up its work force by replacing some of its staff with DreamWorks counterparts. For instance, Paramount's head of distribution, Wayne Lewellen, has been shown the door in favor of DreamWorks's head of distribution, Jim Tharp.
