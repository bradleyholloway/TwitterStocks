WASHINGTON, May 16â€” Six months ago, legislation to remove sex distinctions from insurance rates and benefits glided through a Senate committee on a voice vote. A month ago, a major insurance trade group decided it was ''politically untenable'' to advocate sex discrimination in setting rates. And just a week ago, women's and civil rights groups were negotiating a compromise with the industry to minimize the plan's cost.  Now all that is changed, and when the House Energy and Commerce Committee meets Tuesday to consider the bill, it is likely to face complex amendments and an uncertain future.  In those six months, debate about costs has clouded its future. Some local officials, including Mayor Koch of New York, questioned the practicality of the measure, and the insurance industry decided that it was, in fact, politically tenable to favor sex discrimination.  Last Wednesday the corporate members of the American Council of Life Insurance voted overwhelmingly to support rates based on sex. This vote reversed a decision in March by the council's board that ''it was politically untenable to continue pricing by sex and that it had to negotiate to avoid the worst aspects of the bill,'' Walter Bussewitz, a spokesman for the council, said in an interview. Called Change of Strategy  Richard S. Schweiker, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services and now president of the council, said the industry was simply changing its strategy, not its principles. ''It is not unusual in political life,'' he added.  The council represents 575 companies that held 96 percent of the $4.4 thousand billion of life insurance in force last year. Thirteen of the council's members have formed a coalition with what they call a ''substantial'' budget to win over public opinion. The Committee for Fair Insurance Rates has patterned its ''consumer education project'' on the banking industry's successful campaign against withholding taxes on dividend and interest income. The insurance group is writing letters to consumers in selected Congressional districts and advertising nationally.  The message was summed up in Congressional testimony by George K. Bernstein, spokesman for the American Insurance Association, who said: ''Discrimination is the very essence of insurance underwriting, rate-making, coverage and benefits. All premiums are predicated on discrimination, and without it policyholders would pay the same rate regardless of their risk characterization.'' Impact Is in Dispute  The impact of the legislation is in dispute. Women now pay more for annuities, for example, because they tend to live longer than men, but less for life insurance and often for automobile insurance.  The American Academy of Actuaries said the legislation would give women equality at a high price. It estimated that women would have to pay $32 million more for combined health and disability insurance and $700 million more for automobile insurance. The academy said it was not clear which sex would benefit from making pensions and retirement programs nondiscriminatory, since the vast majority of these are employer-sponsored and nondiscriminatory as to sex.  Congressional, consumer and women's groups calculate a different balance sheet. The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, recently released a study finding that auto insurance rates would not be changed if companies substituted mileage driven for sex differences. Since women drive less than men, men would still pay higher rates, the study found.  Judy Goldsmith, president of the National Organization for Women, recently contended that nondiscriminatory ratings could save a woman holding several types of policies $16,000 over her lifetime.
