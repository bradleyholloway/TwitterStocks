 Odd-Lotters Shown the Door At Some Firms   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 22, 1987  The companies are among the growing number that have conducted "odd-lot programs" aimed at buying out individual investors who own fewer than 100 shares. The idea is to eliminate the expense -- estimated at about $12 to $18 a shareholder for most companies -- of providing such things as quarterly reports and dividend checks to a horde of small stockholders.  Odd-lot activity constitutes a small fraction of trading nowadays. On the New York Stock Exchange last year, odd-lot sales amounted to 220.6 million shares, considerably less than 1% of total trading volume. Odd-lot purchases were even smaller, at 108.5 million shares.  Although odd-lotters together own only 2% of the average company's shares, 52% of all shareholders are odd-lotters, says Robin Disston, president of Greenwich, Conn.-based Disston Associates, which specializes in odd-lot buyouts.
