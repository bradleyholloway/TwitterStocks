 Ford of Canada Reaches Tentative Pact With Union Similar to Chrysler Contract   By By Gary Lamphier, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1987  Ford Motor Co. of Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative three-year agreement that closely resembles the pattern-setting contract the union reached last month at Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit.  Union President Robert White said the proposed pact with Ford Motor Co.'s Canadian unit contains similar economic gains won by the union in its settlement with Chrysler's unit. These include annual wage increases of 3% in the first year and 1.5% in each of the second and third years of the accord, fixed annual increases for current pensioners, and inflation-indexed payments to future retirees. The last item was the union's top demand.
