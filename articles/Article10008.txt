 Italian Pay Negotiations Gain Notice in Euro Zone   By Emsden, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  IG Metall typically settles for about half its initial request, and its sector has posted hefty productivity gains, leading economists to say that even wage increases of about 4% won't be inflationary because of the rise in German productivity. In Italy, by contrast, union requests are usually met, says Walter Galbusera, a senior official at Unione Italiana del Lavoro, one of Italy's big three unions.  He also says the public-sector contract has become the "main act," replacing the metal workers' contract as the "bellwether contract" for the rest of Italy.  Don't tell Italy's bank clerks their productivity is lagging. Their wages rose 0.2% last year while their top brass led the national compensation tables with stock-option windfalls amid surging profits and share prices.
