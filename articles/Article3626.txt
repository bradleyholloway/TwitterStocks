 Delta Sets Off Wave of Cuts In Airline Fares; Discounts -- Among the Biggest This Year -- Cover Thousands Of Flights Until Mid-December   By Rick Brooks and Melanie Trottman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2006  Analysts and airline officials say travelers shouldn't expect a Christmastime fare war that could threaten the industry's nascent financial turnaround. "It's a fare sale," says Tim Wagner, an American spokesman. "A fare cut would mean lowering fare prices for the foreseeable future." Discounted seats are in limited supply and likely will sell out quickly.  Southwest's chief executive, Gary Kelly, says the airline's fare cuts were about reasserting one of its enduring competitive advantages: operating costs that are still as much as 70% below bigger airlines and lower than most other discounters. "We love to surprise our competitors, and we know we do," Mr. Kelly said the day the lower fares were unveiled. The fares require a 14-day advance purchase by Dec. 1 for travel from Dec. 1 through March 9, 2007, and Mr. Kelly advises consumers to snap up the fares quickly because they'd likely sell out soon.  Southwest, like other airlines being hit with sky-high fuel prices, has also been raising fares over the past year, though it's trying to do so infrequently and keep the rate of its increases smaller than upticks at bigger competing airlines. Southwest, in particular, has to be careful about raising fares so it doesn't alienate customers who have come to rely on its low-fare reputation. "We have seen fares increase dramatically from the start of 2005, but we're still in a low-fare environment" relative to historical prices, says Southwest's Mr. Kelly.
