 Athletic-Footwear Makers Are Expected To Post Lackluster 4th-Quarter Results   By By Joseph Pereira, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1998  The athletic-footwear industry is expected to report lackluster fourth-quarter results, reflecting a continuing swing away from the traditional athletic look to other casual styles.  Hardest hit were companies with large U.S. basketball-shoe sales, including the three largest athletic-footwear makers, Nike Inc., Reebok International Ltd. and Fila Holdings SpA.  Sporting Goods Intelligence, which tracks industry sales, estimates athletic-footwear sales in the U.S. climbed less than 3% to $7.7 billion. "The hero shoe, by and large, is dead," said Publisher John Horan, noting that the list of unspectacular basketball-shoe introductions with names like Pippen from Nike, Iverson and Kemp from Reebok, and Rodman from Converse Inc. continues to grow.
