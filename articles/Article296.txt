WASHINGTON, Oct. 19â€” Astronomers have found a tiny, very dense star to be 20 times hotter than the sun, the National Science Foundation reported today.  With a temperature of about 180,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the star is the hottest white dwarf known, the foundation said in reporting the findings of astronomers from the University of Washington and the University of California at Los Angeles.  The star, located in the constellation Ursa Major (Great Bear) has been known to astronomers for at least 20 years. It has a mass about that of the sun packed into a volume about the size of Earth.  White dwarfs represent the final stage in the evolution of small and medium-sized stars.
