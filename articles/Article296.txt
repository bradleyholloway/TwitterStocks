The Stride Rite Corporation said yesterday that it would eliminate about 600 jobs, or 16 percent of its work force, by closing several stores and a plant in Fulton, Mo. Stride Rite, a shoe company based in Cambridge, Mass., said it would report a one-time expense in the quarter ending Dec. 1, pushing its results below those of a year ago. The company said it had faced continuing weakness in the retail sector and would focus more on marketing its brand names. Stride Rite also said it would cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share, from 9.5 cents a share. The company's shares fell 50 cents yesterday, to $10, on the New York Stock Exchange.
