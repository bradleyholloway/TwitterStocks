 Barron's Insight: Cookies, Nuts, Cost Control Go Into Hershey's Recipe   By Bennett, Johanna, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2006  More important, the maker of Hershey's Kisses, Reese's peanut butter cups and other goodies should be able to rev up sales and margins this year by introducing extensions of some of its most popular brands and cashing in on new growth drivers, including cookies, new varieties of chocolate-covered nuts, dark chocolate and single-serving items.  "I really like this company, and I am taking a good hard look at it again," says Marvin Roffman, chairman of Roffman Miller Associates, a Philadelphia investment firm, which got out of the stock last year. "There's been a significant pullback. It's an extraordinary company with great management, iconic brands and they are good at coming out with new products."  Hershey "is at a bit of a premium, but I am willing to pay it," says Ed Roesch, an analyst with Banc of America Securities, who rates the stock a "buy."
