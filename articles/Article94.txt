WASHINGTON, March 31â€” James S. Brady, the White House press secretary, who was the most gravely injured of the four men wounded in yesterday's attempt to assassinate the President, showed signs today of recovering unexpectedly well from the bullet that had pierced his brain.  His doctors said that the 40-year-old Mr. Brady was conscious, with eyes open, and that his pupils reacted well to light. He obeyed commands to move his right arm and leg and to wiggle his toes, and he squeezed his wife's hand with his right hand. The left side of his body did not respond so well, but it was not yet clear if there was full paralysis.  But while these signs were taken as encouraging, several neurosurgeons with varying familiarity with Mr. Brady's wounds expressed doubts that he would be able to resume a job as intellectually taxing as that of press secretary to the President.  If he was able to return to the job, they said, it would probably be only after a long recuperation. They all stressed that recovering from brain injuries was notoriously unpredictable and that remarkable recoveries were not unknown. Extensive Damage Reported  Mr. Brady suffered ''fairly extensive'' damage to tissue in the right side of his brain but only ''minimal'' damage to the left, said Dr. Dennis S. O'Leary, dean of clinical affairs at George Washington University Hospital, where Mr. Brady underwent about four hours of surgery last night.  In most people, one side of the brain -the left in Mr. Brady's case - is ''dominant.'' Dominance accounts for such traits as rightand left-handedness. In all people, the left side of the brain is the primary center for many key functions, such as speech. That his left side sustained only minimal damage augured well for Mr.Brady.  ''His response to surgery has been good - everybody treating him is hopeful,'' said Dr. Hugo Rizzoli, chief of neurosurgery at the hospital. Dr. Rizzoli has not attended Mr. Brady personally; surgery was performed by Dr. Arthur I. Kobrine.  ''It is amazing how much improvement many of these patients do exhibit over time,'' Dr. Rizzoli said. But he said it was too early to conjecture about Mr. Brady's prospects for resuming his duties, ''except that it will be a long time.'' Conditions of Two Officers  Two law enforcement officers who were also struck in yesterday's fusillade of bullets were reported to be in stable condition today. Timothy J. McCarthy, a 31-year-old Secret Service agent, was ''doing very well'' after surgery to repair liver damage and was expected to recover fully, a spokesman for the service said. Thomas K. Delahanty, a 45-year-old District of Columbia police officer, was still in ''serious'' condition but was coherent and ''doing quite well,'' with a bullet still lodged in his neck, according to a spokesman for the police.  James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, told reporters today that Mr. Brady ''is going to live.'' He made the remark after doctors informed the White House that having survived the first 24 hours, Mr. Brady was generally considered unlikely to die of his wound, although last night he appeared to be near death.  George Washington Hospital listed Mr. Brady's condition this evening as ''critical but improving.'' He was resting in a private room of the intensive care unit on the fourth floor near Agent McCarthy and President Reagan. Nine other patients were in the unit.  The White House issued a statement that Mr. Brady was ''in critical but stable'' condition. ''He is being observed closely for possible complications for which he is at significant risk,'' the statement said.  Since his doctors have issued no detailed medical statement, the exact path of the bullet or the extent of brain tissue damage is uncertain. However, doctors close to the treatment team said that the bullet had entered at an angle just above and slightly to the left of the left eye, passed through the frontal sinus and hurtled into the right side of the brain.  Earlier reports said that the bullet had completely pierced the skull and exited from the right side. However, it now appears that the slug, or at least the largest fragment, settled in the right rear part of the brain, probably the parieto-occipital area. Whether Mr. Brady's mental capacities would suffer permanent change could only be a matter of speculation at this point.  ''Time and observation are the best judges of the nature of the injuries,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Milhorat, chief of neurosurgery at Children's Hospital National Medical Center in Washington. ''Often there is a remarkable degree of readjustment of abilities and dramatic recoveries.'' But he added, ''Some limitation is the rule rather than the exception.''
