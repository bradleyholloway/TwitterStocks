 Stocks Manage To Shrug Off Rate Increase; Dow Industrials Gain 78.74 Despite the Fed's Indication Of Continued Tightening Policy   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  Stocks had been down for three days in anticipation of the Fed's move, and investors unwound some of that decline once the Fed did what was expected. Some of that was simply a mechanical reversing of earlier bets with a buying splurge. But some of the rebound seemed to reflect continuing hope that, despite the Fed increases and the high price of oil, the economy will remain strong enough to push stocks higher in the autumn.  "The market may end up getting spooked by this, but this week, it hasn't been," said Stephen Sachs, director of trading at mutual-fund group Rydex Investments in Rockville, Md. He said that it sometimes takes a few days for investors to react fully to Fed announcements.  Last month, many investors hoped that this month's Fed rate increase would be the last, but now the expectation is that the Fed could raise rates several more times, perhaps into next year, a prospect that could weigh on stocks.
