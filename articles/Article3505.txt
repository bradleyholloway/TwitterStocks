 Books: Weird, Unavoidably So   By Smith, Kyle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2006  Now, in real life, comes "On [Michael Jackson]," in which [Margo Jefferson], a Pulitzer-decorated critic for the New York Times, considers the enigma of Mr. Jackson for whatever audience is comfortable with allusions to "Till Eulenspiegel," Montaigne, Ralph Ellison and E!

The Oedipal moment has arrived."
