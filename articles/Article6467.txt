 Macquarie Bank Is to Expand In Asia   By Thurlow, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  Macquarie Funds Management's international division head, David Craig, said in an interview yesterday that Macquarie plans about 10 small funds-management acquisitions with the aim of offering an Asia- wide equities product in a few years.  Mr. Craig said the bank had a "very good experience" with AmInvest, although Macquarie "probably would have pushed much harder on international products than they have," and decided to exit the joint venture because of the bank's strong preference for controlling stakes.  "The more we have got a portfolio of businesses in Asia with the Macquarie brand and Macquarie control," the better placed the company is to develop a regional product, Mr. Craig said.
