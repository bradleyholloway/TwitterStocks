 Taiwan Is Struggling to Revive Exports --- Firms Are Weighed Down With Hefty Debts   By By Jeremy Marx, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1990  However, despite government efforts to bolster small manufacturers with easier credit, export growth remains sluggish. The problem is that thousands of companies whose exports helped create Taiwan's "economic miracle" of the past decade are weighted with too much debt -- much of it a result of this year's stock-market crash.  With many companies unable or unwilling to take advantage of the money the government wants them to have, the retooling of industry needed to help the country compete on world markets with higher-value-added goods is likely to slow. Some manufacturers say they can't obtain new funds because bankers balk at the level of debt they see on balance sheets. Since August, when the government began to ease credit, lending growth by major Taiwan banks has stagnated.  "The banks have lots of money these days," a Taiwan banker says. "It's just that small companies can't afford to borrow it." Adds Wang Kwang-seng, executive vice president of government-owned Bank of Taiwan: "We {bankers} have a right and responsibility of refusing people who don't deserve bank credit."
