 Investors Withdraw $409 Million Offer To Buy Some Assets of L.J. Hooker Corp.   By By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1990  A consortium of private investors has withdrawn an offer to pay $409 million for various L.J. Hooker Corp. assets.  The consortium, operating as LJH Funding Co., is led by Jay Shidler, chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu, and A. Boyd Simpson, chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization.  According to those familiar with the situation, the Shidler group formally withdrew its bid last week because it felt the talks were moving too slowly. Hooker executives have subsequently attempted to resume negotiations, but no further talks are scheduled.
