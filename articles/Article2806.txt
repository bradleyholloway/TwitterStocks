 Regal Cinemas May Have Trouble Following Up on Blockbuster '95   By Brooks, Rick, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1996  If that's true, Regal may hit some bumps. After falling to about $11 in March, adjusted for a stock split, the stock has soared to about $35 and trades at a lofty 36 times last year's earnings. That's nearly twice the price/earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index.  For that reason, the bulls say, Regal deserves to be treated like a growth stock, not a movie-theater stock. "Regal has proved they can hit their numbers, even in a sloppy film quarter," says Gary Dennis, an analyst at J.C. Bradford & Co. in Nashville, which is urging investors to buy the stock. Elizabeth Bramwell, a New York mutual-fund manager who has bought over 80,000 shares of Regal stock since mid-1995, adds, "They're carrying the theater industry to a new generation."  With an average of 7.8 screens per location (much higher than its rivals), Regal can keep overhead low and show a wide variety of hit movies at each theater. Regal executives also are famously frugal, buying popcorn directly from farmers to keep costs low and profit margins high. "There's no Hollywood flamboyance in this organization," says Lewis Frazer III, Regal's chief financial officer.
