 McKinsey Taps Low-Key Leader For Tough Times   By By Kemba J. Dunham, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2003  McKinsey also is contending with several challenges unique to the venerable firm. Rajat Gupta, 54 years old, the firm's current managing director, whose third three-year term ends June 30, has come in for criticism from some McKinsey insiders for expanding too quickly and taking on too many clients in recent years. And McKinsey's reputation has been stained in recent months thanks to its high-profile role as adviser to several companies involved in recent accounting scandals, including Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd., as well as adviser to Swissair Group AG, whose Swissair collapsed in 2001, and to Kmart Corp., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002.  The managing director's ability to bring about change at the collegial, but sometimes insular McKinsey partnership is limited. Only the 10th person to fill that role at McKinsey, Mr. [Ian Davis] will have less power than the chief executive of a public company: He names office heads and sets agendas, but many internal-governance tasks are handled by committee. There are 900 McKinsey partners.  It has been a long time since McKinsey has elected a charismatic leader. Long gone are the days of Marvin Bower, credited as one of the founders of modern management consulting and McKinsey's "guiding influence." He led McKinsey from 1950 to 1967 and spent a total of nearly 60 years there. He died two months ago at the age of 99.
