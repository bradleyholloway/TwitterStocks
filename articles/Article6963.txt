 After Katrina, Bonds Wait on the Fed   By Stoyko, Shayna, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  Fed-funds futures are currently signaling about an 80% chance of another rate increase this month. That's up from 50% in the immediate aftermath of the storm, but well below the full certainly that was priced in before [Katrina] became a household name. After the Sept. 20 meeting, the Fed will hold two more meetings this year, one on Nov. 1, the other on Dec. 13.  Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow said he was "concerned about core inflation running at the upper end of the range that I feel is consistent with price stability." San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen cautioned that higher oil prices might be passed on to core inflation.  Investors who think the Fed is going to keep raising rates in the wake of Katrina seized upon those comments as furthering their case, and they will keep a keen eye on whether the Fed officials' concerns are confirmed in the inflation reports due this week.
