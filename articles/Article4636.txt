 For Her Centennial, Miss Liberty Invites All the Ships at Sea --- And Coast Guard Fears Statue Will Be Gridlock Center; 'Like Normandy Invasion'   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 1986  When Petty Officer Second Class Paul Dahl of the U.S. Coast Guard helps plan the Statue of Liberty's centennial, he thinks of vessels like the Useless. Then he worries a lot.  The four-day event honoring Miss Liberty's 100th birthday will take place over the Fourth of July weekend and already is shaping up as the world's greatest maritime gathering. An invasion of some 40,000 vessels is expected in New York Harbor. And one of those vessels is a 1937 cabin cruiser called the Useless.  A few years ago the Useless lay on the bottom of the Hudson River, but John Krevey, a New York electrical contractor, winched her ashore, pumped her dry and sealed her leaky hull with a cementlike coating. "I have the biggest piece of junk," says Mr. Krevey, pointing below deck to a mattress chewed by rats. Nevertheless, he plans to sail his friends to the festivities aboard the Useless.
