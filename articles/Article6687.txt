 Love & Money: A Dollar for All Chores? It's Time to Stop   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  School's out, and my 10-year-old is learning all about the joys of family chores. And he isn't happy about it. He has griped about matching socks, making his bed, cleaning the bathroom mirrors and picking up stray toys. He'll often spend more time complaining about a chore than he'll spend actually completing it. And his version of "finished" often leaves much to be desired.  [Amy] and I know we're at fault here for not being more, well, parental. We went all soft in the middle about our time with our son -- recognizing too late that there is never enough time with your kids, and our guilt shouldn't mean that we abandon our other responsibilities to teach our children important values. And while I'm sure lots of moms and dads have a much stronger backbone than Amy and I do in this area, I also know, based on chats with my friends, that our struggle is a common one.  "Spending the emotional energy that is too often necessary to force that a chore be done is just too exhausting," my friend says. "It's not right, and I'm not happy about it, but when kids have been cooped up in school all week and all they want to do is play, it's just easier sometimes to do the chore yourself, do it right the first time, and not have to argue back and forth, negotiate and explain to your child just why it is you have to do chores to help the family."
