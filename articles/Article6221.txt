 Another African `Peace'   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1999  When the warring sides in Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war signed a peace agreement on Wednesday, thousands of Freetown's residents took to the streets to celebrate. They are a forgiving people. The deal grants a full amnesty and four cabinet posts to the hated Revolutionary United Front (RUF), one of the most ruthless and criminal rebel forces ever to take up arms.  In its battle against Sierra Leone's democratically elected government, the RUF has slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians and left countless others without arms or legs. Even more appalling, many of these atrocities have been committed by teen-agers recruited by the rebels with the use of drugs and coercion.  It is difficult to blame Sierra Leoneans for welcoming peace, however temporary and whatever the costs. It is also hard to blame the government for granting concessions to the rebels. Lacking an effective army, President Ahmed Kabbah's civilian government had come to depend on a Nigerian-led peacekeeping force for protection. With Nigeria's new leader threatening to bring his troops home, cutting a deal seemed the only way to prevent the rebels from taking immediate and full control.
