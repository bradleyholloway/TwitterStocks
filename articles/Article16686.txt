 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2006  A senior House aide quit and said he warned [HASTERT]'s office more than three years ago about ex-Rep. Foley's worrisome conduct toward young congressional pages, urging the leadership to intervene. Republicans' support for Hastert grew more tenuous, with the No. 3 House leader saying he would have handled the Foley situation differently. Democratic candidates are using the scandal to bash even rivals with no direct connection to it, painting it as a symptom of a thoroughly corrupt Republican leadership. Even the future of the page program itself is in doubt.  The U.S. isn't "going to live with a nuclear North Korea," a State Department official said as allies scrambled to avert a bomb test.  Brazil said a U.S. executive jet was at a wrong altitude when it collided with a 737 last week, killing 155. Pilots' passports have been confiscated.
