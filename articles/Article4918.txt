 Insurers Can Pay for Andrew, Not Social Ills   By Araskog, Rand V, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1992  Rand V. Araskog contends that the insurance industry is being asked by government to do too much. He says that the industry cannot be held responsible for social problems such as day-to-day stress and environmental difficulties that society refuses to pay for or solve. Araskog says that insurance is good only for sharing specific risks, like those posed by Hurricane Andrew.
