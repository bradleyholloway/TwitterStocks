 Kodak Is Likely to Keep Household Line, Names Thomas as Chairman of Sterling   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1988  Eastman Kodak Co. is expected to keep -- for now -- its household products group, which had been rumored for sale for $1.5 billion to $2 billion.  Sources said Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., had re-evaluated the Lehn & Fink group, which makes Lysol, d-Con and Thompson & Formby products, and found it well-managed, profitable and worth keeping. The group is a part of Kodak's Sterling Drug Inc. unit.  Separately, Leo J. Thomas was named chairman of Sterling, effective Sept. 1. Mr. Thomas, former Sterling vice chairman, succeeds John M. Pietruski, who announced his resignation Wednesday. Mr. Pietruski is the fifth Sterling executive to leave since Kodak's $5.1 billion acquisition of the pharmaceutical and household products concern in February.
