 Industrials Fall 113.15 On New Asian Worries   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1997  Rumblings of more financial turmoil from Asia sent stocks lower yesterday, with technology stocks leading the way down. Bonds fell, and the dollar rose.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.15 points, or 1.44%, to 7767.92, erasing about half the average's gain over the previous three sessions. It was the industrials' 46th move of 100 points or more this year. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 16.42 points, or 1.7%, to 946.67.  The Dow industrials opened sharply lower on news that big Japanese broker Yamaichi Securities Co. had failed and that South Korea had asked the International Monetary Fund to help bail it out of its financial crisis. Korean stocks tumbled, but Japan's markets were closed for a holiday.
