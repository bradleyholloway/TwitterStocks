 Zarkin Resigns Post With Ames Division ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1988  Herbert J. Zarkin, chairman of Ames Department Stores Inc.'s recently acquired Zayre discount-stores division, said he is resigning and will rejoin Zayre Corp.  The reasons behind Mr. Zarkin's decision weren't immediately clear, but the Boston Globe reported over the weekend that Ames is planning to close 74 Zayre stores early next year, mostly in the South. That would be more than the 10% to 15% that one senior Ames executive had estimated Ames would probably close when it agreed in September to buy the 388-store Zayre chain.
