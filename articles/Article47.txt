Dr. John Chipman, an internationally recognized metals expert and former head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's department of metallurgy, died Saturday at his home in Winchester, Mass. He was 86 years old.  Dr. Chipman won many honors in the United States and overseas for advancing the techniques of steel production by applying the theories of physical chemistry. He also had an important role in the Manhattan Project, in which many of the nation's most prominent scientists built the first atomic bomb in World War II.  After joining M.I.T. in 1937 as a professor of process metallurgy, he served as department head from 1946 until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1962. He was active as a lecturer for years after that, and continued to contribute articles and papers to periodicals in his field.  Dr. Chipman established his reputation in the early 1930's when he worked as a research engineer at the University of Michigan. His studies of the chemical reactions of steel production were presented to the American Society for Metals in 1933 and earned him its Henry Marvin Howe Medal for the best paper of the year. His Role in Manhattan Project  On leave of absence from M.I.T. in 1943, he joined the wartime atomic weapons project at the University of Chicago as chief of the metallurgy section. His main contribution to that effort was a method for converting powdered uranium into solid castings, assuring researchers of a reliable supply of castings when solid uranium was scarce.  John Chipman was born April 25, 1897, in Tallahassee, Fla. After studying at the University of the South and the State University of Iowa, he earned a doctorate at the University of California in 1926.  He became assistant professor of chemistry at the Georgia School of Technology that year, and joined the University of Chicago in 1929. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and past president of the American Society for Metals and the Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers.  Dr. Chipman is survived by his wife, the former Ruth H. Hayes; a son, Dr. David R. Chipman of South Dartmouth, Mass.; a daughter, Ruth E. Busch of Oak Bowery, Ala., and five grandchildren.
