 Bulk Price: Philips, an Innovator In Electronics, Proves Resistant to Change --- Dutch Giant Is Insulated From Investor Pressure To Slim Down, Refocus --- Mr. Lyon's Spinoff Proposal   By By Julia Flynn and G. Pascal Zachary, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1999  "If Philips were an American company, it would have been acquired or busted up long ago," says Robert Lyon, president of Institutional Capital Corp., a Chicago fund-management company that owns about five million Philips shares, or 1.4% of the total outstanding. Mr. Lyon, who manages about $12 billion for institutions, is urging Philips to spin off its profitable semiconductor division, which he figures is worth $20 billion on its own, or nearly three times the unit's present value.  Philips says it has "no plans" to take Mr. Lyon's suggestion. That may be partly because Philips plays by different rules than many of its non-Dutch peers. Indeed, while financial and corporate-governance practices are converging around the Anglo-American model, many companies in Europe and Asia still are exempt from the new order, clinging to their old ways despite subpar returns. Big is beautiful, so their thinking goes, even if the financial results aren't all that attractive.  Still, the concerns of shareholders have barely registered in Philips's boardroom, says Andre Leysen, who spent 16 years as an outside director at the company before retiring as vice chairman of its supervisory board this past March. "There should be a monument to the unknown Philips shareholder, because during my entire time at the company, I never met or even heard of one," says Mr. Leysen, now chairman of Belgian conglomerate Gevaert. "There were no shareholders with big enough investments to influence anyone," Mr. Leysen adds.
