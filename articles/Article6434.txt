 From Small Computers a Mighty Power Grows   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2001  Today Napster's permitted listings are waning and the legal system's tolerance of its conduct may be nearing an end. But devotees believe the broader implications of peer-based computing are vast and unstoppable. In "Peer-to-Peer," 24 specialists in the field have teamed up to produce a fascinating book that is part primer, part road map and part exhortation for a new era of computing.  Besides, as we are reminded by Clay Shirky, a New York investment adviser, two trends in technology -- faster microchips and bigger disc drives -- make peer-based computing ever more alluring. Each puts more unused computing power on the fringes of computer networks, available for users to exploit. In Mr. Shirky's view, the leading makers of chips and storage devices, Intel and Seagate, "matter more to the peer-to-peer companies than do Microsoft or Apple."  Does anyone know yet which p-to-p computing initiatives will lead the way beyond Napster's spectacular -- but perhaps short-lived -- prominence? The authors of "Peer-to-Peer" list more than 70 contenders, focusing on file-sharing companies such as Freenet and Gnutella; messaging frameworks such as Aimster and Jabber; a dozen shared-computing companies, including Centrata and Entropia; and Groove Networks, which makes group-oriented software. As the book's editor, computer-publishing specialist [Andy Oram], concedes, different approaches "are likely to struggle for some time."
