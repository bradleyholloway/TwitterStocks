 Workspaces   By By Nancy D. Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2002  What you see: A set of wheels. The centerpiece of this second-floor executive office is a 1950 Chevrolet BelAir with flames painted on the front and sides. Mr. [Vaughn A. Veit] paid $300 for the sport coupe in high school and has spent more than $150,000 restoring and customizing it. But the classic-auto buff is only parking it here temporarily: Each year, with the aid of a crane, he drives a new model in through a bay of windows that open accordion-style. Brass spotlights shine on the chosen car, but there's plenty more to look at. Throughout the room, the third-generation owner of this family business displays an array of vintage gas pumps, along with an air machine and a parking meter. A Chevrolet emblem is woven into the carpet. The front end of a '57 Chevy is mounted on the wall.
