 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 1999 --- Stocks Approach the Stratosphere --- Driven by Tech Stocks, Nasdaq Has Best Gain Of Any U.S. Market Ever   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  Stocks, or at least the white-hot technology sector, didn't merely knock the top out of 1999, they demolished it, finishing on a note of utter invincibility. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which is meant to reflect the entire Nasdaq Stock Market but in fact is driven by a few-hundred-strong technology stocks listed on that market, finished the year up an unheard-of 85.6%, at a record close. More than half of that gain came after the index crossed 3000 on Nov. 3. Never before has a U.S. stock index posted such gains in a single year.  The more-established Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also finished at record levels. Their five-year string of gains was unprecedented, yet compared with the Nasdaq their advances look almost miserly. The Dow industrials surged 25.2% in 1999, while the S&P 500 rose 19.5%, the fifth consecutive year the two big-stock indexes both posted double-digit growth. The two indexes simply reversed their positions from 1998, when the S&P 500 led with a gain of 26.7%, and the industrials advanced 16.1%.  To fans, the tech-stock gains were yet more evidence of a new era of technological innovation that is rewriting the rules of both the economy and the stock market. To the biggest tech bulls, the new era is symbolized by the Internet and is still in its infancy. To skeptics, the remarkable gains are another frightening indication the great bull market of the 1990s has turned into a mania and could end badly.
