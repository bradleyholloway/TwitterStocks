 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Judicious Precedent   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1994  More to the point, we understand that in Mr. Lewis's column we're only a proxy. His real but unmentioned subject is Paula Jones, who has gone public with charges of sexual harassment against Mr. Clinton and hired a lawyer in Little Rock. The statute of limitations on the incident runs out this Sunday, so this is sex week on the press rumor circuit. The White House has let her lawyer know he'll be going up against Bob Bennett, one of Clark Clifford's defense team, and Mr. Lewis is chipping in to tell the rest of the press not to cover her charges.
