 Mylan Is Now Big Generics Player After Deal for Unit of Merck KGaA; U.S. Drug Maker to Pay $6.6 Billion for Division; Like 'Beachfront Property'   By Andrew Dowell, Gangolf Schrimpf and Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2007  Competition among generic-drug makers requires constant price- cutting and attempts to overturn drug patents to sell generic versions of branded drugs. Inventing new, branded medications requires more investment in research and development, longer timelines and defense of patents. Merck Generics was the world's No. 3 generics business by revenue in 2006, said Mylan and Merck KGaA, which isn't affiliated with Merck & Co. of the U.S. The generics division in 2006 had an operating profit of 307 million euros, up 29% from a year earlier, on sales of 1.8 billion euros.  Mylan has been trying to find its way since the company's bid to acquire specialty drug maker King Pharmaceuticals Inc. failed in 2005. The company's stock swung wildly when financier Carl Icahn snapped up Mylan shares and moved to block the King deal. Afterward, Mylan focused on its basic business of legal challenges to win exclusive rights to sell generic blockbusters and worked to improve its drug- manufacturing capacity. In April, it boosted its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ended March 31 because of stronger-than-expected sales.
