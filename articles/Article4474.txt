 Contract Talks Of Eastern Air, Union Halted --- Hopes for Quick Resolution Are Dashed as Mediator Abruptly Ends Session   By By Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1989  A special mediation session between Eastern Airlines and its machinists union was halted after three days of contract talks, dashing hopes for any immediate resolution of the bitter dispute between the carrier and its most powerful union.  Walter Wallace, chairman of the National Mediation Board, abruptly called off the talks without explanation. The board governs labor relations in the airline industry. Board members often become involved in labor-management confrontations as they come to a head.  The talks between the loss-plagued carrier, a unit of Texas Air Corp., and its largest union have dragged on for more than 15 months. But under airline labor law, there isn't any deadline on the discussions until the board declares the two sides have reached an impasse, after which there is a 30-day countdown. After the countdown, the airline is free to impose its own contract and the union free to strike.
