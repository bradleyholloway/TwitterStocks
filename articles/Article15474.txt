 Letters to the Editor: Asbestos Litigation: Fight to the Finish   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1996  Max Boot ("The Toxic Tort That Won't Die," Rule of Law, July 10) puts it well when he declares that it is time say "enough is enough" with regard to the 25-year morass of asbestos litigation. We continue to believe, however, that a judicial solution to the problem is both reasonable and more achievable than the legislative solution suggested by Mr. Boot, which has heretofore been completely illusory. A judicial solution makes sense because asbestos litigation is unique in the history of mass tort litigation in that more than two decades of exhaustive discovery have established clear guidelines for the relevant medical science, the applicable law, the extent of damages and equitable levels of compensation that may exist in other mass torts.
