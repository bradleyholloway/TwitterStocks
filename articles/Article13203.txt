 Economy Shows Resilience in Face Of Massive Jolt; Fuel Stockpiles, Temp Firms, Fed's Credibility All Serve As Vital Shock Absorbers   By Jon E. Hilsenrath and Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  The U.S. economy's shock absorbers kicked in within days of one of the worst natural disasters in its history, offering hope that the massive jolt to the country's energy and transportation systems won't produce a long-lived, serious economic contraction.  Hurricane Katrina is the biggest test in years of the economy's resilience. But recent history offers encouraging, though by no means definitive evidence of the U.S. economy's ability to bounce back from shocks. Economic growth has become significantly less volatile during the past two decades, a trend some economists dub "the Great Moderation."  Oil shocks in the 1970s became embedded in wages and prices, eventually requiring the Fed to raise interest rates dramatically, triggering deep recessions. But those drastic actions eventually cemented its credibility, and in recent years workers and companies haven't responded to higher oil prices or easy money by immediately pressing for higher prices and wages. "One of the benefits of having that credibility is it increases [the Fed's] ability to . . . stabilize the economy and insulate it from major shocks like this," said J. Alfred Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.
