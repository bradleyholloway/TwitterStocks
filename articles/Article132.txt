STOCKHOLM, May 8â€” A dispute over how and when to begin lowering Sweden's high income tax rates led today to the fall of the coalition Government of Prime Minister Thorbjorn Falldin.  The Government, which had governed for 20 months with only a onevote majority in Parliament, began to disintegrate Monday when the conservative Moderate Party withdrew from the Cabinet, charging that its two coalition partners had gone back on their pledge of a ''sweeping tax reform to aid economic recovery.''  Faced with a vote of no confidence, which would compel the calling of elections, Prime Minister Falldin, leader of the Center Party, resigned along with Foreign Minister Ola Ullsten, head of the Liberal Party.  Public opinion polls show that if elections, due in September 1982, were held now, the opposition Social Democrats would be swept back into power.  All major political parties have agreed that the income tax system, widely regarded as one of the most severe in the world, must be revamped. The political maneuvering has developed because of the traditional practice of seeking a consensus on major legislation and because of the reluctance of the Centrists and Liberals to become closely identified with the conservative Moderates while in coalition with them. Changes in System Urged  In February, the Falldin coalition, although not united on all aspects of its tax plans, recommended a revamping of the system as part of a program aimed at saving the equivalent of $1.1 billion. The tax proposals called for a progressive reduction of high income taxes in three stages between 1982 and 1984 and a lowering of the ceiling from 85 percent to 75 percent.
