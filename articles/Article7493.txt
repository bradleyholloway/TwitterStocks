 Computers Take On New Role As Experts in Financial Affairs   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1986  ONCE, COMPUTERS WERE just big calculators. Over the years they have become storehouses of information as well. Now they are making the big leap to giving advice; financial expert systems are starting to do such tasks as guide an individual's investments, warn manufacturers about foreign competition and reject bad insurance risks.  Expert systems, also known as knowledge-based systems, differ from common data-processing systems. They can store and manipulate knowledge and rules-of-thumb as well as data. They can "reason" by drawing inferences from the knowledge. They can help a human formulate problems -- for example, by making sure that novices ask the same questions experts do. And they can train users by explaining how they reach a conclusion.  MR. WIIG EXPECTS that a year from now 35% of the nation's biggest financial institutions will have prototype expert systems, up from 5% today. "Most of the (expert) manufacturing systems don't touch the heart of a company's livelihood. But in the financial area, the expert systems . . . could make or break the institution," he says.
