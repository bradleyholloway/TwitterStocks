 Brazen Trade Marks New Path of Enron Probe --- Alleged Fraud Is Tied To Windfall Profits In 3 Western States   By By John R. Wilke and Robert Gavin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2002  Mr. Belden's plea signals a new direction in the Enron investigation, which has so far focused on the failed energy firm's alleged use of phony bookkeeping to hide debt and inflate reported profit. Prosecutors are building the new case against Enron in secret grand-jury proceedings in San Francisco, investigating alleged fraud by Enron and other power traders that let them reap windfall profits while costing customers in California, Washington and Oregon billions of dollars in higher rates. Mr. Belden's testimony is expected to lead to criminal charges against other former executives at Enron, and some of its trading partners.  Investigators are closely examining the roles of at least three senior Enron executives, including John Lavorato, Mr. Belden's supervisor; former trading chief Greg Whalley, who was also Enron's president and chief operating officer before the firm sought bankruptcy protection in late 2001; and Enron's former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, who denied in congressional testimony that Enron had manipulated California's energy market.  Mr. Belden was richly rewarded for his work, and Enron management gave him a total of $5.1 million in bonus payments in 2001, company records show. Part of the payment was made even after his trading schemes were identified by Enron lawyers, who said they ordered them stopped. In his plea agreement, Mr. Belden agreed to forfeit at least $2.1 million that was traceable to the fraudulent trading he admitted.
