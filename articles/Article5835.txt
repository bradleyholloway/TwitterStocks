 Cyber-Care Founders Leave the Company As Its Stock Soars   By By Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2000  Stephen Ratzel, a vice president and chief technology officer, and David Richey, vice president of sales and marketing, issued their resignations last month, says Dan Bivins, Cyber-Care's general counsel. However, Mr. Bivins says the company has been negotiating to keep Mr. Ratzel.  "We would very much like [Mr. Ratzel] to stay," says Mr. Bivins. "He is especially important."  Mr. Ratzel says he couldn't comment on his resignation or whether he would stay. He discounted any effect his departure may have on Cyber-Care. "It's not any one individual who is responsible for the technology," Mr. Ratzel says. "It is very much a team effort, and we have put together a real solid team."
