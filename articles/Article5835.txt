 Kodak Focuses on Young Buyers, With View to Sharpening Its Image   By Bounds, Wendy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1996  Moreover, if Generation Xers don't find Kodak's approach cool, the company may be out of the picture. And Kodak -- which uses phrases like "Dig it" in the ads and will show them on MTV and major stations -- hasn't test-screened the segments. Still, says Burt Flickinger III, a New York retail marketing consultant, "It makes a lot of sense to capture the consumer starting in junior high school when . . . [they] will be the future buyers of all Kodak products." Right now, Generation Xers pocket about $951 billion in disposable income annually and, by the year 2010, will surpass baby boomers as the primary market for most product categories, according to Package Facts, a New York research company.  With its U.S. film sales already sluggish and loyal older customers using less film, Kodak needs the Generation X market, which has mixed brand loyalties. "My worst fear today is the 12-to-30-year old who pays a premium for Nike and Reebok, but then buys the cheapest film because he doesn't care about the brand," Mr. [Carl Gustin] says. Moreover, Kodak's brand loses its allure when it comes to technology.  Then late last year, Kodak hired Ogilvy & Mather, who conceived Kodak's new global message: "Take Pictures. Further," designed to stretch Kodak's image beyond photography.
