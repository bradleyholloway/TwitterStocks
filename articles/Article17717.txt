 Japanese Investors Play Tokyo Stocks On Home Computer --- Customer Terminal Is Linked To the Securities Concern; 'Lonely Without a Toy'   By By Elisabeth Rubinfien, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1987  Tadashi Ishimura is in an enviable position. He has time and money on his hands, and Japan's major stockbrokers have created a new way for him to spend both.  Every day after his family leaves home, Mr. Ishimura steps out of his living room and into the Tokyo stock market, without ever having to take off his slippers. Mr. Ishimura, who retired last year as a lumber company executive, charts the hourly movement of his favorite stocks by using his personal computer.  He is one of a small but growing number of Japanese who are taking advantage of home-trading services. Over the past year, three of Japan's big securities companies have introduced services that link a customer's computer to the broker's large processing computer. The client gets access to immediate trading, current price and market information and analysis of share movements.
