 Forstmann Group Ends Buyout Bid For Ralston Unit   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1985  ST. LOUIS -- Ralston Purina Co. said a $500 million leveraged buyout of its Foodmaker Inc. division was abandoned because of restaurant industry weakness and an earnings decline at the unit.  As previously reported, an investment group led by Forstmann Little & Co. definitively agreed May 1 to buy the division, which owns or franchises about 800 Jack in the Box and Monterey Jack's fast-food restaurants. The agreement was reached about two weeks after Ralston, in a report on fiscal second-quarter earnings, said Jack in the Box profit fell during the period because of weakness in the restaurant industry, reorganization expenses and "weather-related problems."
