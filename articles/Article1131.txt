 Bernanke's Congressional Testimony Could Set Tone for Treasurys   By Reed, Danielle, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2007  Mr. [Ben Bernanke]'s report to Congress "certainly has the potential" to set the tone for the market, said Michael Pond, Treasury and inflation-linked strategist for Barclays Capital in New York.  Given how far the market has scaled back its interest-rate-cut expectations -- it now sees just one cut by year's end -- it is equally possible, unless the chairman strikes a much more upbeat tone on the economy or a far harsher tone on inflation, that "the market doesn't react a whole lot," Mr. Pond said.  Mr. Bernanke, who testifies Wednesday and Thursday, is widely expected to "reinforce the notion that the economy is regaining some traction after a midyear soft patch," while policy makers will remain "on guard against the possibility of an unwanted cyclical rise in inflation," Deutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna wrote in a research note.
