 Mills's Troubles Deepen as Developer Plans to Write Down Shareholder Equity   By Chittum, Ryan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  Mills has many assets that would appeal to investors, including its Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, Fla. Analysts say a sale or recapitalization of Mills would be more likely than a bankruptcy proceeding, though the company is already heavily indebted and any sale would come at a steep discount to the value of Mills's shares even three months ago.  Mills has been exploring a sale of all or part of itself for several months. It requested initial expressions of interest from prospective bidders by June 13 but hasn't commented on the results. People who have seen Mills's presentation say it isn't possible to get a reasonable estimate of the company's value of the company because its books are in disarray.  MILLS Corp.'s Mills L.P. is obliged to pay for construction of its Meadowlands Xanadu project in New Jersey if financing for completion can't be obtained. An article in Saturday's edition incorrectly said its partners, KanAm Group and Mack-Cali Realty Corp., are also required to pay.
