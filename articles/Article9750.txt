 Aon Internal Probe Finds Violations Of Conduct Code   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  Aon's statement came in the wake of a Chicago Tribune article Sunday that quoted Mr. [Patrick G. Ryan] as saying he was "very comfortable" with the company's past behavior. The article also quoted Mr. Ryan as saying Aon didn't steer customers.  Aon said the statement "clarified" the chief executive's comments in the article, quoting Mr. Ryan as saying he believes "the vast majority of our employees adhere to the longstanding principles" in the company's code of conduct. The statement also took issue with the Tribune's headline, which called Mr. Ryan "not fazed" by the investigations. "In fact, Mr. Ryan and Aon Corp. take these matters very seriously," Aon said in its statement.
