 Tew's Multiple Roles in ESM Affair Create Controversy Among Lawyers   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1985  Mr. Tew is the 44-year-old securities-law specialist who recently was named interim trustee of E.S.M., the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., government-securities company that collapsed last month, leaving some $315 million in unpaid claims to customers. In that role, he has been at the center of the E.S.M. limelight. Richard Critchlow, a longtime friend and partner, jokingly refers to him as "the walking media event."  E.S.M. has brought Mr. Tew the kind of publicity that many law firms relish -- particularly firms like Mr. Tew's New York-based Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley & Casey, which in 1982 absorbed the small Miami firm of which Mr. Tew was a partner. Thanks to a spate of such mergers, Finley Kumble has become one of the fastest-growing, aggressive firms in the country and one of the first of the so-called national law firms.  But Mr. Tew's visibility also makes him a target for professional sniping. Several law partners of Stephen Arky, a prominent Miami lawyer who represented E.S.M. and also had an account there that he closed shortly before the firm collapsed, claim Mr. Tew is exaggerating Mr. Arky's role because of past professional disputes between the two men. "It's my belief Tom Tew is carrying out a vendetta against Steve Arky," says Eugene Stearns, a law partner of Mr. Arky who has acted as his spokesman since the E.S.M. collapse.
