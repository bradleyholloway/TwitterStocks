 U.S. Treasury Prices End Higher on More Signs Of Slowing Economic Growth, Purchases by Fed   By By John Parry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2000  Treasurys surged on additional signs that the pace of economic growth is slowing. The market also was boosted by purchases of Treasurys by the Federal Reserve and optimism that economic data today will show inflation under control and consumer demand moderating.  The company sold $450 million of five-year notes at a yield margin of 2.15 percentage points above Treasurys, $500 million of 10-year notes at 2.55 percentage points above Treasurys and $450 million of 30-year bonds at 2.87 percentage points above Treasurys.  Treasurys got a further lift early in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did two "coupon passes," or outright purchases of Treasurys. Such operations don't have policy implications and are designed to permanently add reserves to the banking system.
