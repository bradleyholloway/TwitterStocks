 No Going Back: Tighter Border Yields Odd Result: More Illegals Stay; Once-Migrant Mexican Workers Settle in Stockton, Calif.; A Burden for Schools, ER; Mr. Silverio's Growing Family   By Porter, Eduardo, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2003  "We haven't done workplace enforcement for years," says Robert Logazino, head of the Border Patrol's Northern California sector office in Livermore. "We're in the process of being closed down here." Priorities have shifted in law enforcement. Instead of raiding fields and factories, agents for the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- now folded into the Department of Homeland Security along with the Border Patrol -- are mostly assigned to investigate smuggling rings and patrol high-profile sites such as airports.  About a third of Stockton's population is Hispanic, up from 25% a decade ago. Roughly 6% of the city's residents speak little or no English. Playgrounds and schools offer one clear sign that Mexican families are not only arriving but staying: Almost 45% of children under 6 are Latino, up from 30% 10 years earlier. Hispanic children account for about 70% of the 2,300 annual births in San Joaquin General Hospital's maternity ward.  The Oxtotecans don't plan to return to Mexico any time soon. Ignacio Barro, Mr. Silverio's son-in-law, used to return to Mexico every Christmas. But Mr. Barro hasn't made the trip at all since he and [Lourdes Gomez] settled in Stockton three years ago. "I used to come and go all the time but not anymore," he says. "These days crossing is too expensive. You end up working just to pay the smuggler to come and go."
