 Reagan's SBA Budget to Seek Higher Fees, Some Cutbacks   By By Steven P. Galante, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1987  THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION is to propose a new federal budget today that contains significant changes in the operation of the Small Business Administration. Sources say that among other things, the budget calls for new or increased fees for many SBA services, the elimination of some SBA programs and the sale of $6 billion of SBA-related loans in the government's portfolio.  Nevertheless, parts of the SBA budget plan, for the year starting next Oct. 1, are sure to generate debate. For example, according to the government sources, the proposal calls for the SBA to double the fee it charges for guaranteeing loans to small businesses, the agency's single biggest activity. Currently, the SBA charges borrowers 2% of a loan's face value. The spending plan would increase the borrower's fee to 3% and, for the first time, charge lending banks a 1% fee. Moreover, the budget would limit SBA guarantees on loans greater than $140,000 to 75% of the loan; currently, the agency guarantees 90% of a loan, regardless of size.  FEES WOULD BE IMPOSED for use of various SBA business counseling programs, including the Service Corps of Retired Executives, Small Business Institutes, and Small Business Development Centers. The development centers would also be among the programs to lose federal funding. The spending plan calls for a five-year phase-out of SBA assistance to the centers, which this year will total $35 million. Also targeted for immediate elimination are SBA programs, totaling $30 million this year, that provide loans for small businesses owned by military veterans and handicapped individuals.
