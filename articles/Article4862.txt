 Dollar Declines As Mark Moves Sharply Higher --- Sterling's Rally Continues Despite Some Confusion Over U.K. Statements   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1988  Nearly all day, it looked as though the British pound's five trading-day gallop against the dollar had ended. But late in New York Thursday, sterling was bid up to $1.8460, slightly higher than the $1.8445 quoted late Wednesday.  After hitting an intraday high of $1.8477 in early Far Eastern trading, Britain's currency began falling on unfounded rumors that the Bank of England had placed orders to sell sterling. "It had the effect of inducing people to take profits or square positions," said Kenneth De La Salle, foreign exchange manager for National Westminster Bank in London.  Currency dealers were whipsawed by contradictory statements to Britain's Parliament by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Mr. Lawson said sterling's recent rise against the mark was "unsustainable." Yet at the same time, the chancellor conceded that fighting inflation would remain at the "heart" of London's economic policy and that interest rates would be used to damp inflationary expectations.
