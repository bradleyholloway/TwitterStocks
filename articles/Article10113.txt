 Toll Gains; Nordstrom Moves Up   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2007  VeriFone Holdings lost 2.85, or 12.4%, to 20.20. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook for the provider of electronic- payment systems to negative from positive, and Moody's placed the company's ratings under review for a cut. The stock has fallen 58% this week, after VeriFone said it will restate certain results because of accounting errors.  Toll's shares rose $2.70, or 13%, to $23.42, its biggest percentage gain in more than 7 1/2 years. The advance came despite the suburban Philadelphia home builder posting its first quarterly loss as a public company. Toll was caught up in optimism over the government's mortgage plan. KB Home gained 3.37, or 16%, to 24.25; Lennar rose 2.48, or 15%, to 18.73; and D.R. Horton advanced 1.49, or 12%, to 14.12.
