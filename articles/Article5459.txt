 Advertising: Classifiers work as Madison Avenue's eyes   By Brownlee, Lisa, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1997  An intricate commercial-tracking system created by Competitive Media Reporting supplies the ad industry with one of its life-blood data services.

To gather the data, CMR runs a complex network of computers that literally watch TV. Then classifiers pore over digital video clips and classify the commercials.
