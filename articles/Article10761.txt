 The Outlook: Gloom-and-Doom Fans Find Surviving Riskier   By By Alfred L. Malabre Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1985  Out on the gloom-and-doom lecture circuit where the forecasts tend to be cataclysmic, the crowds big and the honorariums fat, disagreement has split the speaker ranks. It's not that some of the Cassandras have turned cheerful. The script, as it has for many years, still sees the economic apocalypse just ahead. But now there's a deep division on the precise route from here to there. Once, there was wide accord that it lay through swiftly escalating inflation. Perhaps half the dire forecasts still hold this view. But as many nowadays foresee a very different course, with prices falling steeply.  The question of how it will arrive, of course, is central to the strategy that audiences on the gloom-and-doom circuit pursue. If severe inflation lies ahead, investment survival necessitates acquiring tangible assets -- gold, silver and so on. But if deflation is in prospect, the investment vehicles to be eschewed under scenario one become exceedingly desirable -- for instance, fixed-income securities and even cash. If spiraling inflation is in store, moreover, indebtedness makes sense. But if deflation sets in, the less debt one carries, the better.  At stake in the strategies now being debated on the gloom-and-doom circuit are matters less momentous than life and death. But the debate is arresting nonetheless. An example is a recent squaring off between two stalwart pessimists, Howard Ruff and James Dines, at a gloom-laden road show in Anaheim, Calif. The pair agree, as they have for years, that bad times lie ahead for the economy. But they no longer are as one that accelerating inflation will accompany the economic breakdown. Mr. Ruff still sees severe inflation, but Mr. Dines anticipates deflation.
