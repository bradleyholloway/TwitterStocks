 Alien Weed Eludes Authorities, Then Turns Up at Home Depot   By By Erik Siemers, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1999  Consider "Sparganium erectum," an aquatic plant prevalent along European lakes, streams, ditches and swamps. In 1976, the U.S. Department of Agriculture put it on the federal Noxious Weed list of banned plants, based on evidence in Europe that it chokes waterways and hinders recreation in shallow water.  Garden State Bulb Co., a Hammonton, N.J., flower-bulb wholesaler and importer, brought the exotic burs in from the Netherlands and shipped them to Home Depot, in what both it and the USDA say was an accident. Garden State says it didn't know the exotic bur had been banned.
