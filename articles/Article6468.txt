 Polaroid's Loan Waivers Are Extended; Firm Will Explore a Total or Partial Sale   By By Jerry Guidera and Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2001  The company said this possibility was unlikely since the bondholders are unsecured and would have secondary standing behind banks in bankruptcy court. Polaroid also said it aims to open negotiations with the bondholders as part of an overall debt-restructuring effort. It has hired Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Zolfo Cooper LLC to handle those negotiations.  The waivers come in exchange for a firm verbal commitment to restructure the outstanding debt, according to people involved in the discussion. Polaroid also is pursuing options that include a "pre-packaged" bankruptcy filing in which debtors would agree to recapitalization terms, these people said. Another option might be a capital injection that might come as part of a joint venture with another manufacturer.  In a news release, Polaroid didn't mention any move toward a bankruptcy filing. But officials familiar with the matter say a filing is seen by some advisers as the most feasible way for Polaroid to make good on its promise to restructure its debt.
