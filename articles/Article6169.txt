 SBC Entry Into Hughes Auction Could Be Bad News for Murdoch   By By Andy Pasztor and Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2003  Until last week's reports of preliminary but high-level merger talks between SBC and Hughes, Mr. [Rupert Murdoch]'s News Corp. was viewed as the only serious contender to take over Hughes. News Corp. expected to kick off negotiations later this month with GM about acquiring the auto maker's 30% controlling stake in Hughes, El Segundo, Calif., with price expected to be the major sticking point, according to people familiar with the matter.  Suddenly, those dynamics have been changed by SBC's emergence as a potential suitor. For starters, SBC, San Antonio, is expected to try to convince GM that a potential SBC-Hughes linkup would pose fewer regulatory and political risks than a takeover bid by Mr. Murdoch, a controversial figure whose global holdings range from satellites to network television to newspapers. In addition, SBC may try to raise the ante by proposing to acquire all of Hughes's DirecTV satellite-broadcast unit, and possibly other parts of the company as well.  The last time GM put Hughes on the auction block, in late 2000, SBC expressed some initial interest but never followed up with a formal bid. Instead, News Corp. came in with a complex asset-swap deal for Hughes only to be trumped at the last minute by a cash offer from EchoStar Communications Corp. That $18 billion deal fell apart late last year after regulators blocked it. GM since then has been contemplating various options, and last week its board authorized Hughes management to talk with both News Corp. and SBC, according to people familiar with the matter.
