 FCC Spurs Rethinking of Digital-TV Strategy   By By Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  Broadcasters and TV makers are in a chicken-and-egg situation with digital TV, just as they were in years past with advances such as the introduction of color programs and UHF channels. TV stations say they need viewers to have digital TV sets before they will fully embrace the technology and give up existing analog channels. TV makers say viewers need something to watch on digital channels before they will buy DTVs.  There was no similar requirement that digital reception be built into TVs. That left TV manufacturers free to incorporate digital reception as they would any other new feature -- in expensive, high-margin products like big-screen TVs first, putting off doing so in low-priced, low-margin TVs until later. Today, no TV with less than a 34-inch screen size has built-in digital reception. And the lowest-priced external digital receiver, which can connect to a TV of any size and allow consumers to receive digital signals, carries a retail price of $550.  When he announced his latest proposal, Mr. [William Kennard] said the country needs to get on with the digital-TV transition so the government can recover spectrum that TV stations don't need and sell it to companies that will implement new wireless services. In the past, government officials touted the spectrum sale as a way to help reduce the government deficit. But now, the deficit isn't an issue and, with Japan and European countries already using better wireless services, Mr. Kennard says the U.S. is in danger of falling behind high-tech's next important wave.
