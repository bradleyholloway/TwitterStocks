 Mysterious Strain of Hepatitis Is Identified   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  Chiron Corp. scientists have identified a mysterious viral strain of hepatitis and developed a test to detect this cause of an insidious form of the liver disease.  The Chiron scientists said the newly identified virus causes 80% to 85% of the hepatitis not caused by the older strains -- Hepatitis A and B. Doctors have previously lumped such cases together under the label Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis. Their findings are scheduled to be published in two papers in today's issue of the journal Science.  About 10% of blood transfusion recipients contract hepatitis, and roughly half of such cases fall into the non-A, non-B category. Donated blood now is routinely screened for Hepatitis A and B, among other infectious agents. By one currently accepted estimate, the odds of contracting non-A, non-B Hepatitis from a transfusion are one in 100 for each unit of blood. For the average two-to-four-unit blood transfusion, that translates as a 2% to 4% risk every time a patient receives blood.
