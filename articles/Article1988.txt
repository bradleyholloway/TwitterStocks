 Client Payment Disclosure   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1995  The case arose when two criminal-defense lawyers in Boston refused to comply with a 1984 law requiring attorneys, banks and others to report payments of more than $10,000 in cash to the Internal Revenue Service. Revealing the client's name would violate attorney-client privilege, said the lawyers. One of the lawyers, Nancy Gertner, was named a federal judge in Boston last year.
