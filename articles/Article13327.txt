 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Tastings: For the 2006 Vintage, the Time Is Now; Fresh, Young Wines Arrive From Below the Equator; Newer Than 'Nouveau'   By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2006  Just a few years ago, we couldn't have suggested in October that you open a wine from the current year. After all, the reason Beaujolais Nouveau became such a big deal every November was that it was a celebratory wine, the first wine of the new vintage (and, yes, Georges Duboeuf is a marvel of a marketer). But the wine world has changed dramatically in the past decade. Now, a sizable percentage of the wines Americans drink are from Australia, Argentina, Chile, South Africa and New Zealand -- all in the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are reversed and harvest takes place early in the year. On that schedule, by the time Nouveau appears, it seems, well, Vieux. The shelves of wine stores are already dotted with wines from the 2006 vintage -- Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, Chardonnay from Chile, rose from Argentina.  So we think it's time, right now, for a new celebration of this harvest. Let's call it Newine Day -- and let's get the party started right away. This doesn't mean we won't celebrate Beaujolais Nouveau, too, of course, but, hey, can there be too many reasons for a celebration?  One of our models for young wine was called Chardonette. It was a Chardonnay made by Hargrave Vineyard on the North Fork of Long Island. It was very young Chardonnay made quickly and rushed out the door, thus providing some cash flow for the winery. We'd buy it at the winery, then pick up some local lobsters and make dinner while the sun set over Long Island Sound and, really, could any wine taste better? Truth is, we liked Hargrave's Chardonette better than its far more serious, heavier Chardonnay. The young wine had a noble simplicity about it that you just can't fake.
