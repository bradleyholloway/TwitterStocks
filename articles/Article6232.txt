 Help Poor People, Not Poor Places   By By Edward L. Glaeser, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1999  President Clinton's six-city "New Markets" tour earlier this summer signaled a renewed focus on the problems of the poor. But while the president's concern is appreciated by all of us who care about the islands of poverty in America's sea of affluence, his proposals are fundamentally flawed. They may still help some of the poor, but also risk repeating some of the worst mistakes of the Johnson era.  Place-based policies, on the other hand, give transfers or other government support on the basis of location. Examples of such policies are housing projects and enterprise zones. President Clinton's recent Rural Housing and Economic Development Assistance for Kentucky or the new Empowerment Zone Grant for East St. Louis, Ill., are quintessential place-based policies.  The problem with place-based programs is that they create incentives to keep the poor in the ghetto. By subsidizing the place, not the person living there, these policies make it more attractive for the poor to stay in high-poverty areas. Indeed, current research shows that supposedly benevolent pro-poor housing and transfer policies play a major role in herding the poor into inner cities.
