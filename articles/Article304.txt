 Campaign 2000: Primary Turnout, Defying Expectations, Is Soaring   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2000  In Michigan's GOP primary this week, over 1.2 million voters cast ballots, more than double the number from four years ago. In South Carolina, 570,000 voters turned out, more than double the 1996 total. In New Hampshire, almost 400,000 voters participated in the Democratic and Republican contests, up from 300,000 in 1996.  In California, which holds its critical primary on March 7, election officials expect voter turnout well above 1996 levels. "It's a candidate-driven state," Secretary of State Bill Jones explains. The Republican office-holder's own maneuverings in recent days underscore the way Mr. [John] McCain is piquing voter interest. After earlier backing front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. Jones has thrown his support to the Arizona senator.  So far, the turnout boom has benefited different candidates in different places. In New Hampshire, the surge in voting by independents fueled Mr. McCain's 19 percentage-point landslide. In South Carolina, Mr. Bush managed to pull out vast numbers of conservative GOP loyalists as he appealed for help in holding Mr. McCain's insurgency. Three days later in Michigan, Democrats and independents flocked to the polls on Mr. McCain's behalf, at once resuscitating his candidacy and fueling the surge in turnout.
