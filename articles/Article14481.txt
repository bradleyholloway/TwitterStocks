 U.S. Urges Japan to Return to Talks On Quotas for Beef and Citrus Imports   By By Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1988  The Reagan administration urged Japan to return to the negotiating table rather than wait at least six months for an international panel to resolve the dispute over Japanese curbs on beef and citrus imports.  The GATT, a Geneva-based body regulating global trade, formally took jurisdiction over the dispute yesterday when Japan decided not to block a U.S. request for creating an independent panel to hear U.S. charges that Japanese beef and citrus import quotas violate GATT rules. But Mr. Yeutter's remarks at a news conference signaled the U.S. desire to arrive at a speedier and more mutually satisfactory solution through further negotiations.  By Mr. Yeutter's account, Japan offered to phase out the beef quotas but insisted on limiting imports through surcharges and other price adjustments even after the quotas end. Mr. Yeutter said the U.S. would have accepted a three-year phase-out, but not if it were accompanied by the proposed "border measures" that he called "GATT-illegal."
