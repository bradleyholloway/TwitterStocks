 Landscape Design: To Preserve Forests, Supporters Suggest Cutting Some Trees; Using Local Wood, Harvested By 'Sustainable' Methods, Will Help Planet, They Say; Biggest Rebound in 1,000 Years   By Sterba, James P, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2005  No, this isn't the threat. Just the opposite. Weston's token logging effort was designed to teach children and their parents that it's OK, even wise, to cut down local trees and use them.  In many places, it's more lucrative to sell forest land to developers. But there is some economic upside to not paving over forest, the proposal's authors say, including increased real-estate values and limited lumber sales. The "woodlands" would be managed for recreation, preserving views, environmental protection and "sustainable forestry" -- that is, harvesting trees for economic use without damaging the forest's ability to regenerate.  In 1981, "firewood thinning" -- cutting, at first, only dead or dying trees, began. Then, gradually, live trees were cut, too, in part to make space for young ones to grow. Calls and letters from outraged residents poured in. That's when Mr. [Brian Donahue] began taking people for walks in the woods, explaining how forests work and how cutting firewood can actually help them. Soon, the town's community farm, called Land's Sake, was cutting and selling 50 cords of firewood annually.
