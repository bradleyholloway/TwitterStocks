 The Price Is Right, Isn't It?   By By Jim Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1999  This gist of it is this: Financial markets like Wall Street are made up of an army of investors actively seeking profits. If there is the slightest bit of breaking news that bears on the value of stocks, these investors will pounce on it, swiftly driving shares up or down. In this way the market efficiently incorporates new information into stock prices. Obvious profit opportunities tend to vanish before they can be seized, and investors who chase them hoping to "beat the market" will see their minimal gains more than offset by transaction costs.  There is more. If today's stock prices reflect all available information, then tomorrow's price movements must be unforeseeable, since any information that might be used to forecast them will have already been incorporated by traders into today's prices. Thus -- paradoxically -- the more efficient the stock market is, the more it will lurch unpredictably from day to day, like a drunkard meandering down the street. In other words, stock prices in an efficient market appear to take what economists call a "random walk."  I, for one, have always been rather fond of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. For one thing, it is elegant. For another, it justifies laziness. With all of the Wall Street players exerting themselves in a zero-sum game to ensure that no stock is overpriced or underpriced, I might as well just toss darts at the stock listings -- or, even easier, put my money into an unmanaged index fund. And in fact if you look at a list of the 10 most popular mutual funds in the U.S., you will see that the Vanguard Index 500 fund, whose creation was inspired by the hypothesis, has handily beaten the other nine in cumulative returns over the past five years.
