 Florida Legislature Is Two Steps Away From Appointing a Slate of Bush Electors   By By Joni James and Sarah Lueck, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2000  Senate leaders have said they will wait until the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the Florida election-contest case before deciding whether the Republican-controlled legislature will become the first in modern history to directly name a slate to the Electoral College. Winning Florida's 25 electors outright would give the presidency to either Al Gore or his Republican opponent, Texas Gov. [George W. Bush].  That stance came under sharp criticism yesterday from Yale University's Bruce Ackerman, a constitutional scholar who had been invited to testify by Democratic legislators. The Legislature, he argued, would violate both federal and state law if it decides to select the state's electors. Moreover, he said it was "completely unrealistic to suppose that Bush electors won't have their ballots counted."
