 The Middle Seat: Airports Crack Down on Gamesmanship Over Gates; United Maintains Presence Despite Drop-Off in Traffic, Riling Budget Competitors   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2005  LAWA doesn't allow commuter operations at main terminal gates unless it gives the airline a waiver, and Executive Director Kim Day sent United a letter Friday saying it doesn't consider turboprops and jets with fewer than 100 seats "reasonable gate utilization." At a meeting yesterday with United, airport officials agreed to let the airline temporarily use Terminal 8 for commuter flights, but United will lose some of its scheduling preference for gates in Terminal 6 and could be forced to stop using those gates for domestic flights, an airport official said.  In Denver, United is paying for more gates now than in 2000, even though it is making at least 75 fewer flights a day and flying three million fewer passengers a year. When United launched its "Ted" service in Denver, it didn't put it in its underutilized Concourse B, which has 44 gates. It snagged six gates on Concourse A, home to competitor Frontier Airlines.  It also blocked further expansion by Frontier, which now wants more gates in Concourse A. "When you see a decrease in service to the extent we've seen, we would have thought they'd put it all on B," says Frontier Chief Executive Jeff Potter. The cost of six gates on Concourse A: about $2 million a year.
