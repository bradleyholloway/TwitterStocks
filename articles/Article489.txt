CALCUTTA, India, April 30â€” A crowd wielding spears and knives killed at least 13 members of the Ananda Marga religious sect today after rumors that they had kidnapped children in the southern outskirts of Calcutta, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.  The Ananda Marga sect, founded in India 24 years ago, says it has a following of some five million in about 100 countries.  Its leader, Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1976 for conspiracy in the murder of six defectors from the organization, but was released in 1978 when the sentence was overturned on appeal.  While he was in jail, a series of violent attacks on Indian diplomats in Australia, Britain and other countries was linked to the sect, but Marga officials denied any connection.
