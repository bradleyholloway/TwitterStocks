 Dollar Rebounds From Its Lows vs. Yen, Sags Against Mark for 2nd Straight Day   By By Masood Farivar, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1998  The dollar rebounded from its intraday lows against the yen but fell for a second straight day against the mark amid signs of calming in Russia's financial markets.  Traders said that while the dollar's late-day pullback underscored a generally bullish dollar market sentiment, a stabilization in Russian financial markets dragged it lower against the mark as traders abandoned dollar positions and bought back the German currency.  Though the mark's surge against the dollar weighed on dollar/yen early in Asian and European trading, the U.S. currency rallied against the yen later in New York, with the dollar recovering some of its recent losses caused by technical factors.
