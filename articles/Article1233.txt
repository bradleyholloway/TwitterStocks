 Euro Zone to Test Debt Issuance   By Haywood, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2007  "How those first few [government, supranational institution and agency] deals go will signal to other investment-grade issuers from other sectors just how strong investor demand is and how safe it is for the lower-rated credits to come to market with further supply," said Edward Mizuhara, director of debt syndication at Credit Suisse in London. "They are the first signal of the market's health."  "Investors who don't want a risk to their portfolio will buy shorter-dated paper for highly rated names." Mr. Mizuhara added. "They are certainly not looking at high-beta financials or issuers further along the maturity curve."  "The lack of liquidity in the market puts pressure on investment banks in terms of trying to find the right price, which means some borrowers may find themselves having to pay one or two basis points more in new issue premium to get deals away," Credit Suisse's Mr. Mizuhara said. "Even if there is not much liquidity out there [in the secondary market] there are prices for the bonds in this sector [governments, supranational institutions and agency issuers] which other borrowers benchmark their issuance against," he added. "There are always levels, whereas this isn't always the case with other sectors where you just can't get levels."
