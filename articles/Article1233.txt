 Profits of Big Steelmakers to Plummet Due to Soft Demand, Eroding Prices   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 1989  Major steel companies, stung by soft demand from car makers and eroding prices, are expected to report that third-quarter operating profits plummeted to possibly the lowest levels in two years.  "This will be the worst quarter since the third quarter of 1987, when steel companies were just on their way up," predicted John Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. The fourth quarter could be even more dismal.  The consensus is that major steelmakers earned between $30 and $35 for each ton of steel shipped, compared with $49 in last year's third quarter. The latest quarter is also down from the $51 a ton earned in the second quarter, when the industry benefited from modest price increases and lower raw material costs. Mr. Marcus expects fourth-quarter profits to drop to about $25 a ton.
