 SEC Members Voting Privately On Pay-to-Play --- Plan Would Restrict Giving To Political Campaigns By Pension Fund Heads   By By Judith Burns, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  Avoiding a public vote to seek comment on the plan protects SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt from a potentially divisive debate about his push to limit political funding by public money managers, people close to the agency say.  SEC spokesman Chris Ullman attributed the private vote to scheduling conflicts that prevented an open commission meeting. Rather than wait, he said, the SEC "wanted to act on it quickly."  "It's not secret government," even if the SEC votes behind closed doors, Mr. [James] Doty added, since records of how each commissioner voted are available upon request. Actions that fail to get a majority vote aren't as transparent, but Mr. Doty said it would be rare for the SEC to reject a proposal in a private vote.
