 Partying with the Jaegerettes   By Hwang, Suein L, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 1994  The Jaegerettes, a squad of 783 scantily clad young women who shower young men with trinkets when they buy shots of Jaegermeister in college and other bars around the country, are largely credited with turning the cordial into a cult hit. The Jaegermeister company has also assembled a group of about 100 Jaegerdudes, who wear tightfitting biking shorts and cater to the brand's gay following.
