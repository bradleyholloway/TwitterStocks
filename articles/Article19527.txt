 Midway to Victory   By By James Schlesinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2002  This week, from June 4 to June 6, the nation should be honoring the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Midway. Midway was one of the crucial battles, not only in World War II's and the nation's history but in world history. In terms of public recognition, however, it lies in the shadow of D-Day -- with which its anniversary happens to overlap.  Celebration of D-Day, whose site in Normandy with its beaches and military cemeteries can so readily be visited, is entirely justified given the stakes and immense risks involved in the invasion. Yet, by that point in 1944, Hitler was already doomed. In June 1942, the war's outcome was vastly more uncertain. Our focus on the later victory diverts attention from some of the war's finest and most crucial hours. Indeed it was Midway that in a sense made D-Day possible. Without Midway, the Allies could not have executed the overall strategy for victory in World War II.  Because of this accident of timing, the Japanese carriers were without air cover when dive bombers from the Enterprise, whose commander had courageously pressed the search beyond the limiting range of his aircraft, arrived just as the Japanese were preparing to launch. Within minutes, three Japanese carriers -- Akagi, Kaga, Soryu -- had been badly damaged. The first two sank shortly. Soryu limped off to the west, finally to sink that evening. The last Japanese carrier, Hiryu, was attacked that afternoon by planes from Enterprise, which inflicted fatal damage, ultimately sinking Hiryu early on June 5. Its planes, previously launched, had badly damaged Yorktown, which, after limping back towards Pearl Harbor, ultimately sank on June 7 after an attack by a Japanese submarine. On June 6, as a kind of coda to the battle, two Japanese cruisers were struck, and one had to be abandoned.
