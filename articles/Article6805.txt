 Mutual Funds Pitch Alternative to Annuities   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2008  "If you need income, the most efficient product is the immediate annuity," says Michael Gallo, senior vice president of retirement income for New York Life Insurance Co. The insurer contends that, by using an immediate annuity, you can secure the same lifetime income with 25% to 40% less money than you could by investing in mutual funds, certificates of deposit or other investments.
