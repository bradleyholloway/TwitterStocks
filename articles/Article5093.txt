 Utility Got Quayle To Visit but Asked Public to Foot Bill --- Columbia Gas, Under Fire, Will Pay $702,898 Itself Vice President Outraged   By By James S. Hirsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1990  When Columbia Gas System Inc. wanted to promote a new product last year, it got Dan Quayle. But what started as a publicity coup has turned into a public relations disaster.  Columbia Gas has managed to antagonize, among others, its guest of honor, Dan Quayle. On Thursday, Vice President Quayle blasted the company for a proposed rate increase stemming from his visit. "Outrageous," said David Beckwith, Mr. Quayle's spokesman.  Why outrage? Because Mr. Quayle made a speech in Columbus, Ohio, last September, and his sponsor, Columbia Gas, ran up a tidy bill -- $702,898.14 -- trumpeting the vice president's arrival and providing a festive background. It splurged by spending $20,760.15 on key chains, $17,804 for hors d'oeuvres and $884 for golf caps.
