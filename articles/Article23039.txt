 The Property Report -- Building Value: Task of Researching Property Falls to the Buyer   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2003  More Is Less The red-hot demand for commercial real estate has pushed average asset prices up: 2001 2002 Garden Apartments (per unit) $58,755 $63,735Mid, High-Rise Apartments (per unit) 105,466 133,976Flex Industrial Space (per sq. foot) 81 82Office-Central Business District 193 201(per sq. foot)Office-Suburban (per sq. foot) 132 139Malls (per sq. foot) 103 117Shopping Centers (per sq. foot) 97 99 The price run-ups have resulted in sellers calling all the shots in today's real-estate transactions. The upshot: As prices have risen, owners are providing less and less information about the propertiesthey are selling to prospective buyers, putting the onus of information-gathering on purchasers. Among the things prospective buyers should do: -- Be prepared to hire their own due-diligence expert to inspect the property and to conduct the environmental inspection. There are a number of firms that specialize in that kind of business. You can call virtually any escrow company or title-insurance company and ask them to recommend due-diligence experts. -- To the extent it won't blow the deal, the buyer should dig in during negotiations for at least minimal representation. -- Be prepared to walk away from the deal if you don't like the condition of the property.
