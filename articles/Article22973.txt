 The Granny Patrol: Florida Cops Recruit Elderly Volunteers --- Seniors Wear Uniforms, Issue Tickets, Aim Radar Guns; Mr. Slavin, 95, on the Beat   By By Jeffrey Zaslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2003  Meanwhile, 16 World War II veterans, decked out in berets and ascots, serve as Delray's Homefront Security force, checking public buildings for suspicious activities. The elite force was established after this community learned that seven Sept. 11th hijackers lived in Delray. Police forces nationwide have been contacting Delray asking how to involve their own seniors in home-front security.  Delray seniors are already potent weapons against local criminals. Once, when condominium parking lots were hit by a rash of car break-ins, police flooded the city's condo complexes with seniors in slow-moving patrol cars, their yellow lights flashing. One lot, though, was purposely left dark and seemingly unguarded. That's where the real police waited in a hidden stake-out.  Of course, usually, the seniors see little action. On one recent night at the 900-home Boynton Leisureville adult community, George Whitbeck, 82, and Thomas Klingerman, 73, cruised the streets. They didn't see a human being until they came upon a 96-year-old woman pushing a walker very slowly as she carried a bag of garbage out of her garage. They couldn't help her; police rules forbid volunteers to get out of their patrol cars. But they shouted small-talk to her out the car window as she inched her way to the curb.
