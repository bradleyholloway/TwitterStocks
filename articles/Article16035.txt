 California Tentatively Gets Energy Funds As It Prepares for Mammoth Bond Issue   By By Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2001  So far, the state has been authorized by the legislature to spend more than $4 billion on power purchases. In a letter to Gov. Gray Davis, Mr. [Phil Angelides] said it is of "paramount importance to the fiscal integrity of the state" that $10 billion -- or more -- in bonds for further energy purchases be issued prior to the Aug. 29 due date of the bridge loan.  In order for the state to meet that deadline, and especially if it plans to boost the issue above $10 billion, Mr. Angelides said it is "critical" for the government to make public data detailing the revenue requirements of the state's energy purchasing program. So far, Mr. Davis has refused to make public such data, including the state's actual and projected energy purchases, actual and projected prices and the costs related to program administration and financing.
