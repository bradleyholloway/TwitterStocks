 Alcan Aluminium Ltd. Sets Write-Down Of $215 Million for '85 Fourth Quarter   By By Alan Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1986  Alcan Aluminium Ltd., following similar moves by other big North American aluminum producers, said it will report an after-tax write-down of $215 million (U.S.), or $2.15 a share, for its 1985 fourth quarter.  Alcan said that two-thirds of the write-down is to reduce the value of its investment in bauxite and alumina operations owned by its Aluminum Co. of Canada unit.  The company cited the world-wide glut in raw materials used to make aluminum for the write-down. The write-down totals $350 million before taxes.
