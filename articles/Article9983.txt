 Health Mailbox   By Parker-Pope, Tara, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2006  In a two-year study, researchers funded by the drug company that makes the patch found that this tiny dose of estrogen still increased bone density by about 3% in women's spines and by nearly 1% in their hips. We don't know if the improvement in bone density is enough to actually prevent fractures. But we can compare the bone density benefits of the low-dose patch with the benefits seen in the Women's Health Initiative, which did show that menopause hormones lowered a woman's fracture risk.  In the WHI, menopause hormones improved spine bone density by 3.3% and hip bone density by 2.1% after one year of treatment. After three years, bone density jumped by 4.5% in the spine and by 3.6% in the hip. In terms of spine density, the results of the low-dose patch come pretty close to matching the results of the hormones in the WHI. As for hip density, the patch produced only about half the improvement seen with the higher-dose drugs in the WHI.
