 Commodity Traders May Go for Broke With Novel Contract --- CME Files Proposal to Trade Futures Based on Number Of Filings for Bankruptcy   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  The large commodity and financial-futures exchange filed a proposal yesterday to trade futures on the number of U.S. bankruptcy filings. The futures contract, based on the CME Quarterly Bankruptcy Index, would fluctuate according to the expected number of new filings each quarter, allowing traders a chance to speculate on how many consumers and businesses will be going broke in the near future. It also will enable lenders, such as credit-card issuers, to hedge their risks of consumer defaults.  The bankruptcy futures contract would provide risk management to all sorts of lenders, ranging from automobile makers' credit arms to big banks, a CME official said. The number of entities filing for bankruptcy will be tallied each day and will be heavily weighted to consumers; only 4% of the bankruptcy index will come from business filings, an exchange spokeswoman added. No date has been set for the launch of the contract, which is pending regulatory approval and further details about contract specifications.
