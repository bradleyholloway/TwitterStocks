 WaMu Is Ordered to Rehire Staffer   By Hallinan, Joseph T, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  Theresa Hagman, 44 years old, worked at WaMu's office in Chatsworth, Calif., as vice president and national manager of the custom-home construction-loan disbursement center. Seattle-based WaMu is one of the nation's largest home lenders, and the center where Ms. Hagman worked was responsible for sending out checks for high-end custom homes as they were being built.  "We strongly dispute the allegations by our former employee," said Alan Gulick, a Washington Mutual spokesman. "At the time the allegations were raised, we took them very seriously and began an immediate investigation." After reviews, he added, WaMu found no merit to them. The company may appeal the Labor Department's order, he said.
