WASHINGTON, Oct. 6â€” The McCulloch Corporation of Los Angeles began yesterday to recall 8,000 electric chain saws that might be capable of restarting when set down after use.  The recall, undertaken in cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, applies to Elektramac electric chain saw models EM-10, EM-12A and EM-14A, which have an electric cord connected to the back of the unit.  The units were imported from Canada since April 1981.  The safety commission said that the saw's on-off switch might fail, causing a saw to continue to run after release of the trigger or to start spontaneously.  The company initiated the voluntary recall after learning of four incidents of spontaneous restarting in units manufactured by Black & Decker of Canada.  That company and McCulloch are subsidiaries of Black & Decker of Towson, Md. McCulloch said saws brought to service centers would be given new switches at no charge.
