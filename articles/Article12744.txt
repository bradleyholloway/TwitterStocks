 Pixar Takes Investor Audience on Rocky Ride   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2001  Historically, Pixar's stock has rocketed during the months preceding the debut of one of its films. But once the movies were released, the stock dropped, despite the movie's blockbuster business. An analysis by Robertson Stephens analyst Lowell Singer found that Pixar's stock ran up 23.8% during the six months before the release of "A Bug's Life" in 1998 and declined 18.7% during the six months following release. The pattern was repeated when Pixar's shares rose 17.1% during the six months before "Toy Story 2" came out in 1999, then fell 28.2% in the ensuing six months.  What's behind Pixar's odd trading cycle? The pattern is rooted in the company's bumpy earnings stream. Pixar, a 15-year-old studio headed by Steve Jobs, also Apple Computer's chief executive, has just four feature films under its belt. While all of the movies have been highly profitable and critically acclaimed, they have been released at irregular intervals. "Toy Story" appeared in 1995, "A Bug's Life" in 1998, "Toy Story 2" in 1999, and now "Monsters, Inc." The upshot: Pixar has suffered from sporadic revenue flow and some lean quarters between movie releases.  Steven Tuen, co-manager of the $300 million Kinetics Internet Fund, which has a small position in Pixar, notes the studio has "gotten better and more efficient" at making movies. During the filming of "Monsters, Inc.," Pixar restructured some of its animation procedures to speed up production. Separate development teams also have been created so the company can focus on producing more than one movie at once. Pixar currently has three new films in development, including "Finding Nemo."
