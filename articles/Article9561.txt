 Weak Economy Undermines the Stability of REIT Dividends   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2003  REITs by law must pay out 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividend payments to shareholders. Though dividends aren't the only reason to invest in REITs, they are an attractive incentive. REITs' average yield as of last week was about 7%, compared with 2% for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morgan Stanley. That high dividend means a lot, particularly to small investors, in a weak economy. But the economy has taken its toll on commercial real estate, putting pressure on REIT earnings -- and placing some dividends at risk.  Divide the estimate by the annual dividend payment. If the result is 1 or more, that would indicate 100% coverage of the dividend, or that the REIT is expected to have adequate funds to cover the payment. If the result is slightly below 1, investors shouldn't be too concerned. However, "once you're below 90% [dividend coverage], you need to start worrying" about the REIT's likelihood of cutting the dividend, says Mike Kirby, a principal at Green Street.
