 Mark Twain Reconsiders Move Over Kansas Line   By By John Curley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1985  ST. LOUIS -- Mark Twain Bancshares Inc. is reconsidering its brief but tempestuous move into interstate banking.  The Missouri bank holding concern has run into heavy fire from Kansas banks for using a legal loophole to open a bank in Overland Park, Kan. Now Mark Twain is trying to find ways to end the dispute, including selling the Overland Park bank's charter or moving the bank back to Missouri, where it originally was located.  Last February, Mark Twain received approval from the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency to move a bank it owned in Independence, Mo., 15 miles to Overland Park, a fast-growing Kansas City suburb. It cited a federal law that allows banks to move as much as 30 miles from their current locations.
