 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Judicial Restraint   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1986  Absolutely nothing. Or so at least to judge by the case of everyone's favorite liberal judge and former congressman, Abner Mikva of the D.C. Circuit Court. On July 2, Judge Mikva lost a judicial misconduct hearing before the chief judge of his circuit, Spottswood Robinson III. So far as we can see, this finding has raised not a peep of protest, or for that matter a peep of coverage in the press that we remember or can find in the computer databases. Perhaps the next time Senate Democrats are lining up out to Constitution Avenue to denounce Mr. Manion's nomination in front of the klieg lights, someone could ask for a few words on the Mikva affair.
