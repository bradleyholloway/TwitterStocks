 Investor's Calendar   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2004  Government Back to Borrowing: The Treasury Department is set to resume auctions of Treasury bills and notes after Congress approved an $800 billion increase in the federal debt limit last week, taking it to $8.184 trillion. The $2.23 trillion in borrowing increases during the Bush administration are more than all the debt the U.S. accumulated from its founding through 1986.  Oil Prices Zigzag: Crude-oil futures shot up to nearly $48 a barrel Friday, roiling a stock market previously buoyed by an 18% oil-price drop from recent highs. Heating-oil futures also rose last week after data showed a surprising drop in U.S. inventories. U.S. authorities have warned that homeowners will have to pay 37% more than last winter for home-heating fuel.  Changes at Nike: Philip H. Knight is resigning as president and CEO of Nike and will be succeeded by William D. Perez. Mr. Knight will stay as chairman of Nike, which he co-founded about 30 years ago.
