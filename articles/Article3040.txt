 Home Builders See Growth In 1998, With Some Hitches   By By Alina Matas, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1998  The industry has kept up a strong pace since climbing back from the recession of the early 1990s. The 1997 new-home starts amounted to the state's highest level of construction since 1989, when it reached a peak of 161,700, according to the National Home Builders Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group.  Consider: Six years ago, half of all home loans transacted in Florida were for homes costing less than $100,000, according to data from Experian, a real-estate-research firm in Anaheim Hills, Calif. But in 1997, that segment accounted for only 30% of all home loans, while loans for homes priced above $165,000 increased to 25.7% from 15.1%.  However, some builders here point out that the party can't last forever. "I don't think we're in a predictable groove," says Richard Durling, president of the Florida Home Builders Association in Fort Myers. "We're subject to many factors, as is the rest of the nation, even if we may suffer a little bit less."
