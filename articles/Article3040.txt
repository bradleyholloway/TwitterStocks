 Commodities Report: Oil Prices Fall as Bush Tempers Tone on Action Against Iraq   By By Marie C. Sanchez, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  CORN: Corn futures at the Chicago Board of Trade fell as traders liquidated long positions -- selling by those who had previously bought futures -- in the face of disappointing numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA projected a corn crop of 8.849 billion bushels, down from its August estimate of 8.886 billion and at the high end of trade guesses. The USDA cut its U.S. grain carryout to 0.729 billion bushels, down from its August projection of 0.467 billion. December corn futures fell 9.25 cents to $2.83 a 1/4 bushel.  Mr. [George W. Bush]'s lack of ultimatums or smoking guns on the Iraqi threat triggered a partial breakdown of the "war premium" that had been built into oil prices. Analysts estimate the premium may have reached $5 a barrel on fears that supply disruptions could spread into other parts of the oil-rich region if the U.S. attacked Iraq.
