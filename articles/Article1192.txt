 Third Prize -- Chechen Refugees: From Friendship to Freedom Online edition  By Leroyer, Madeleine, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2007  Before they fled the country, they were living with one of Aslanbek's four brothers, after bombs had destroyed their building. "The Russians asked [Aslanbek] why we were no longer living at the same address. He replied 'OK. I'll show you where I live.' He took them to see the ruins. The soldiers beat him up," says [Raissa].  Time passed and still there was no reply. But Mr. Hell did not give up. "It's all on track. They're being really careful. They aren't working undeclared, they're learning French. They have just as many French contacts at they do Chechen ones, if not more, and that's a really positive sign," he says.  Raissa still dreams of him. The memories bring back the fears. "In Chechnya I was so afraid," she says. "I used to say to myself: the Russians didn't come today. Maybe they'll come tomorrow. Here in France if I go outside and see a police car I still think they've come to arrest me."
