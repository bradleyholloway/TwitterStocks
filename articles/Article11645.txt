 Letters to the Editor: Was Vietnam Worth the Terrible Cost?   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1992  Peter R. Kann missed the point in his analysis of our Vietnam policy ("Clinton Ignores History's Lessons in Vietnam," editorial page, Sept. 9). While I would agree that strong U.S. support during the 1960s and '70s was vital to the cause of the emerging "economic tigers" of Southeast Asia, I believe the idea that we had to enlarge and prolong the Vietnam War massively to achieve this result is folly.  It was obvious to me during 1970-71 that the Communist cadres were ruthless and capable of extraordinary atrocities against their own countrymen and the mountain tribes of Vietnam and Laos. It also became clear that South Vietnam's government was dominated by a corrupt, incompetent clique seeking self-aggrandizement and the perpetuation of personal power. Those Vietnamese who most deserved our support (the "good guys," to use Mr. Kann's phrase) were the soldiers and village leaders who were in the end most cruelly betrayed by their own leaders and abandoned by the U.S. Unfortunately, our policy was inextricably bound to the corrupt regime in Saigon, and its autocratic nature was a key factor in its failure to maintain popular support and its ultimate collapse in 1975.
