Peter F. McSpadden, the top Saatchi & Saatchi DFS executive on both the RJR Nabisco and Northwest Airlines accounts, will be leaving the company around September, a highly placed agency executive confirmed yesterday.  The executive, who asked not to be identified, said he couldn't make an official statement since the agency did not expect to announce Mr. McSpadden's plans until June. But the executive did say: ''The last thing we want is for anyone to believe that Pete's move has anything to do with the Northwest-Nabisco thing. He was planning this retirement since before our companies merged.''  Mr. McSpadden, 57 years old, is president and chief operating officer of Saatchi & Saatchi DFS, of which Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton is the New York office. Advertising Age reported on Mr. McSpadden's departure yesterday.  On March 6 RJR Nabisco, one of the country's largest advertisers, stripped Saatchi & Saatchi of about $70 million in billings after Northwest Airlines began a television ad campaign promoting its no-smoking regulation. RJR Nabisco is the parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, but Saatchi & Saatchi had none of that business, only the cookies and confections from Nabisco. Reportedly the cigarette people were put off because the agency didn't warn them of the coming advertising. The agency, on the other hand, was sworn to secrecy by Northwest.  Mr. McSpadden, who could not be reached for comment, is a highly respected advertising executive who started in the business in the mail room of McCann-Erickson after Dartmouth in 1955. He joined Dancer Fitzgerald Sample in 1959. It was acquired by Britain's Saatchi & Saatchi and last year was merged with Saatchi & Saatchi Compton.
