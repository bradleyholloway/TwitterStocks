 Small-Stock Focus: Mothers Work Slides as Indexes Hit Year's Low   By By Shaheen Pasha, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2003  Men's Wearhouse (NYSE) rose 81 cents, or 5.8%, to 14.70. The company reported a same-store sales increase of 0.5% in the U.S. and said sales were hurt by the Presidents' Day blizzard that closed 9% and 18% of its U.S. outlets Feb. 16 and Feb. 17, respectively. Excluding the closed stores from its same-store figures, the company would have had same-store sales gains of 1.2% to 1.7%.  The investment-services sector saw some selling. Amsterdam-based Van Der Moolen Holdings (NYSE) tumbled 2.87, or 22.1%, to 10.14 after the stock-trading firm reported a "substantial decline" in net income in the first two months of 2003 from 2002.  LaBranche (NYSE), another of the major NYSE specialist firms, fell 2.94, or 15%, to 16.11 following Van Der Moolen's news. The company had warned in February that weak market conditions would result in lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings.
