HARRISBURG, Pa., Feb. 21â€” The operators of the damaged Three Mile Island nuclear plant said today they were almost certain that there was no buildup of potentially combustible gases in the plant last week.  Rather, they said, radio interference apparently caused a malfunction in monitors, which indicated a hydrogen gas buildup and a low oxygen level inside the plant Friday.  Doug Bedell, spokesman for the plant's owner, said laboratory test results made public today appeared to confirm the theory that radio interference affected readings in Unit 2.
