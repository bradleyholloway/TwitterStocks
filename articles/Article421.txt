 Style -- Menswear: The Ice-Cream Man Cometh; This spring's pastel ties are on a collision course with your shirts; How to make a match   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2006  Stylist Lloyd Boston, who serves as a fashion expert on NBC's "Today" show, suggests pairing either warm hues like red, orange and yellow or cool ones like pale green, blue and lavender. Beginners shouldn't mix the two, especially in conservative workplaces, he says, adding: "As you become more confident, you can start mixing those hues together."  At Bloomingdale's, meanwhile, expect to see lots of lavender ties -- with brown accents. "Brown and lavender mixes are a great way to keep the tie more masculine" and "more classic," says Kevin Harter, the chain's men's fashion director. "While color is very important for spring, I think a lot of guys are sometimes scared to embrace the bright colors under their suits."
