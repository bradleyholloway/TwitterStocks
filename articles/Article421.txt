TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 16â€” Steve Karsay was ready for his final start of 1993. At 21 years old, he had skipped Class AAA and made it to the majors, pitching effectively over 49 innings. The problem was that one more inning would disqualify him for rookie of the year consideration the next season. Tony La Russa, his manager with the Oakland Athletics, told Karsay to shut it down.  La Russa's gesture would become a reminder of the truth in an old saying: if you want to make God laugh, make plans. The next April, after a complete-game loss to the Boston Red Sox and Roger Clemens, Karsay felt pain in his right elbow. He left early in his next start -- against the Baltimore Orioles' Mike Mussina -- and did not pitch in the majors again until 1997.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
