The F.W. Woolworth Company, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, reported yesterday that it lost $9 million in the second quarter, bringing its losses for the first half of 1982 to $25 million.  Woolworth, which has been closing some of its unprofitable variety and discount stores, said the loss for the three months ended July 31 compared with an operating loss of $11 million in the year-ago quarter. Two nonrecurring credits totaling $31 million in the 1981 quarter brought net income to $20 million, or 66 cents a share.  The first-half loss compared with an operating loss of $13 million in the 1981 first half. After the nonrecurring credits were added, Woolworth earned $18 million, or 56 cents a share, in the 1981 first half.  Second-quarter sales, excluding those in Great Britain and Mexico, rose 1.5 percent, to $1.75 billion, from $1.72 billion. First-half sales inched up to $3.29 billion, from $3.27 billion.  ''While losses are certainly unacceptable, we are somewhat encouraged by the reduction in the most recent quarter of the loss, before non-recurring credits, reported in the corresponding quarter of 1981,'' said Edward F. Gibbons, Woolworth chairman and chief executive officer.  ''The improvement was achieved in a period of generally poor retail sales in all major countries in which we operated,'' Mr. Gibbons said. ''Any recent improvements in the consumer's ability to spend as a result of the federal income tax cut and increased Social Security benefits hasn't yet been translated into a recovery in general merchandise sales.''  ---- New York Telephone  The New York Telephone Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, reported yesterday that net income in the second quarter of 1982 increased 7.5 percent, to $161.3 million, from $150.1 million, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues edged up 1.4 percent, to $1.67 billion, from $1.47 billion.  For the first six months of this year, the company reported that net income rose 5 percent, to $298.1 million, from $283.9 million in the first six months of 1981. Revenues advanced 12.2 percent, to $3.23 billion, from $2.88 billion.
