 Tenet Posts Loss; Outlier Payments From U.S. Plunge   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 2003  It was Tenet's first financial report reflecting its adoption in January of a new policy for so-called outlier payments, which Medicare pays to hospitals to defray costs for the sickest patients.

Tenet said it preliminarily expects per-share earnings of between $1.34 and $1.65 for calendar year 2003. Analysts said there are so many confusing and changing parts at Tenet that it was hard to assess the new projection -- the first since Tenet announced a financial-accounting change to a calendar year.
