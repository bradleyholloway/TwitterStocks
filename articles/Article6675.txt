 Dollar Gains on Fed Optimism   By Molinski, Dan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  This suggests the Fed saw those weak growth rates as the "bottoming out" of the economy, and expects stronger growth going forward, said David Powell, currency strategist at IDEAGlobal.  "The big message [for currency markets] is that the Fed didn't have greater acknowledgment of slow first-quarter growth," he said. "As a result, the dollar has rallied."  Late afternoon, the euro was trading at $1.3526 from $1.3543 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 120.05 yen from 119.93 yen. The euro was at 162.38 yen from 162.45 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was at 1.2185 Swiss francs from 1.2180 Swiss francs, while the pound gained against the dollar at $1.9938 from $1.9894 late Tuesday.
