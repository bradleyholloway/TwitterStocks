 Air Security Lies in Deterrence, Not Nuggets   By Jenkins, Holman W, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2004  This was the gist of the well-documented Bojinka plot, planned out of the Philippines, which aimed to blow up a dozen U.S. airliners simultaneously. A test bomb aboard a Philippine Airlines flight killed a Japanese businessman in 1994, and only lucky (and diligent) police work in Manila prevented the plot from going further. You don't need chatter to recognize the significance of Richard Reid: The shoe-bomber with his matchbook was meant to test a solution to getting an explosive on a plane without the necessary timing and ignition mechanism that would likely show up on an x-ray. The Brits just arrested another potential shoe-bomber in November, finding also a pair of socks impregnated with three kinds of plastic explosive, evidently for a suicide bomber to wear around his/her neck.  Passenger profiling is a useful layer of security, but we'd be nuts not to maintain a high level of random screening too. Keep this in mind next time you're tempted to throw a fit when grandma or some four-year-old is pulled out of line. What stops "Bojinka"-style plots from happening is the fact that suicide terrorists are presented with an unacceptable chance of being stopped at the turnstile.  America's vulnerabilities, on paper, are unlimited. But the lack of attacks should remind us there's a sizeable gap between the desire to do us harm and the means to pull it off. Let it also be said the [Bush] administration has contributed to the misallocation of energies with creation of a Homeland Security Department. Out another side of its head, however, it's pursued a remarkably patient and proactive strategy to eliminate al Qaeda and address the deeper quandary of a Middle East that has been hurtling down history's dead end for too long.
