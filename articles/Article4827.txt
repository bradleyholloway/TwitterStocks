 Firms' Stock Buy-Back Plans Abound, But Seriousness of Intentions Is Unclear   By By Sanford L. Jacobs, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1987  Since the Oct. 19 market crash, about 600 companies have announced buy-backs involving more than one billion shares with a market value of roughly $34 billion, according to a tally by Merrill Lynch & Co. "The last couple of weeks has been unbelievable," says Charles Plohn, managing director of special equity transactions at Merrill Lynch.  Grolier Inc., which authorized a two million share buy-back on Oct. 21, so far has purchased 200,000 shares. Westvaco Corp., which authorized a three million share buy-back on Oct. 28, has purchased "some shares," a spokesman says, indicating the figure is small.  "A lot of companies have told us they have no intention to implement the (buy-back) plans," says Solomon Samson, an analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp., a debt-securities rating agency. Company executives have told him privately that their buy-back plans are intended to reassure stockholders after the market crash. "The buy-backs are out there as a keep-the-faith message for their shareholders," he says.
