 Microsoft Backs Rival Bidders For AT&T Unit   By By Deborah Solomon and Robert Frank, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2001  In order for the transaction to be tax-free, AT&T shareholders would need to own at least 50% of the combined company and AOL would own 40% to 45%. AT&T, however, would likely work hard to protect the rights of its shareholders by setting up a corporate governance structure to ensure that AOL doesn't get too much operational control, according to people familiar with the situation.  Realizing the potential regulatory hurdle that such a merger could encounter, however, AOL also submitted a backup plan in case the original proposal falls through, these people said. Under that scenario, AOL is offering to buy back AT&T's 25.5% stake in Time Warner Entertainment, a joint venture owned by AOL and AT&T.  Comcast also offered to have the board of directors almost equally split between AT&T and Comcast, and it also offered to give a significant role to C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's current chairman and chief executive.
