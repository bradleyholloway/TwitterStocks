 Union Asks for Trustee to Run UAL   By Carey, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2004  Other unions also are upset at the missed payments, which have led to widespread speculation that UAL intends to ask the judge to let it terminate the plans and dump the assets and liabilities onto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a quasi-governmental pension insurer. UAL says it has made no such decision, but calls the pension plans a "huge burden" that could hinder its chances of attracting financing it needs to step out of Chapter 11.  Bankruptcy lawyers say it is rare for a trustee to be appointed to take over from management in a Chapter 11 case. "I'm more likely to sprout wings and fly than the judge is to appoint a trustee" in this case, said William Rochelle, a bankruptcy attorney and partner in the law firm Fulbright & Jaworski LLP. Appointment of a trustee is "extraordinary relief" for a judge to grant, added Ted Zink, a bankruptcy partner at Chadbourne & Parke LLP. A hearing on the trustee motion is set for Sept. 17.
