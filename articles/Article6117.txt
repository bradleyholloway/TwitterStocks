 You Don't Have to Be Chained to Your Desk To Be a Star Performer   By By Sue Shellenbarger, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1998  BRIAN GRAHAM, Stanford M.B.A., former Wall Street analyst, Harvard magna cum laude and rising star at Fannie Mae, has a little secret. "I'm going to get in trouble on this," mutters Mr. (Brian) Graham, a vice president at the loan concern, in a telephone interview. But he admits he often works only about 50 hours a week -- short hours by the standards of Washington, D.C., workaholism, and of most executive jobs.  It isn't that Mr. Graham is shirking his duties, which include expanding single-family-home markets. It's just that he gets work done fast. He says he tries to figure out where time-wasting obstacles loom, "Then I take that side street that gets me there three seconds earlier."  Mr. Graham's story sheds light on a modern workplace conundrum: measuring productivity. While output in the Industrial Age was directly tied to hours worked, gauging productivity in the knowledge economy isn't as easy. Amid the fog, many bosses cling to the antique equation, time worked equals output. Many workers, too, just assume you have to work longer hours than everybody else to get ahead.
