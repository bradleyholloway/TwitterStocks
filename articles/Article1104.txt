 Holly Farms, in a Sudden About-Face, Invites Tyson to Raise $941 Million Bid   By By Rick Christie, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1988  Holly Farms Corp., in an abrupt about-face, invited Tyson Foods Inc. to sweeten its $941 million hostile tender offer for the poultry company.  After weeks of exploring alternatives to Tyson's bid, R. Lee Taylor III, president and chief executive officer of Holly Farms, said the Memphis, Tenn., concern is ready to explore "a negotiated acquisition" of Holly Farms by Tyson Foods at a price that "more adequately reflects the value of our stockholders' investment in the company." He issued the invitation in a letter to Don Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods, Springdale, Ark., Friday. Tyson has begun a $52-a-share tender offer for Holly that is set to expire this Friday.
