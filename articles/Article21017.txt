 Farley Apparel Delays Issue and Plans To Cut $510 Million Price, Sources Say   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1986  Farley Apparel Inc., facing a cool reception to its planned $510 million public offering, has delayed it and plans to reduce the price, industry sources said.  The main problem, according to analysts who specialize in new issues, is that the offering appears to be an overpriced attempt to pay the debt from Chicago industrialist William F. Farley's $1 billion acquisition of Northwest Industries Inc. in May 1985. At a lower price, they said, the offering would be attractive. A company executive acknowledged that the offering, scheduled to begin early this month, was delayed but wouldn't elaborate.  The problems are an embarrassment for Mr. Farley, whose closely held conglomerate has been built on leveraged buyouts; his businesses include Farley and others that make metal castings, batteries and screws. A lower price will make it tougher for Farley to complete its planned recapitalization, which includes repaying a $123.9 million bank loan and rebuying $439.6 million of bonds. The overall plan would save the company roughly $70 million a year.
