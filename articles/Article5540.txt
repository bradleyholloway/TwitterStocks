 Going Platinum: The U.S. Mint Strikes a Vein With New Coins   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1997  Through last week, the Mint confirmed sales of 83,030 ounces of the U.S. Platinum Eagle coins since September, when the bullion coins were first offered. In 10 months alone, the Eagle has pushed North American platinum investment demand to a 12-year high as coin dealers increase marketing to bolster sagging enthusiasm for precious metals in general.  Like gold bullion coins, a one-ounce Platinum Eagle sells near the "spot" commodity price, a much higher figure than the $100 face value of the coin. After trading on Friday, a one-ounce Platinum Eagle could be bought for about $390 apiece, while one-ounce gold bullion coins could be purchased for about $310.  The Mint acknowledges that it will face new challenges marketing a metal for investment that can slip into supply shortages. "The forces that drive platinum prices and platinum demand are very different from those that drive gold," says Philip N. Diehl, director of the Mint. "Platinum is much more of an industrial metal. There are not stockpiles above ground like there is for gold, and there is uncertainty about Russian supplies."
