 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Futures & Options: A Coda to Opera Season   By Kaiser, Charlotte, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2005  CHICAGO'S other opera company (besides the better-known Lyric Opera of Chicago), closes out its season with Benjamin Britten's opera based on the magical Shakespeare comedy. This new production by director Andrei Serban (who also directed a new production of "Faust" at the Met in New York) will be conducted by Alexander Platt. One of Britten's sunniest works, it stars 26-year-old rising-star soprano Danielle de Niese as Tytania (Britten's spelling) and Australian counter-tenor Tobias Cole as Oberon. Performances begin at 7:30 p.m., May 18, 20, 26 and 28; and 3 p.m., May 22. Tickets are $30 to $105. 312-334-7777; www.chicagooperatheater.org  WHEN "Cyrano De Bergerac" has its North American premiere May 13, Placido Domingo will sing the title role -- his 43rd for the company. Edmond Rostand's play of a lover, his bulbous-nosed poet-friend and the woman they both love was set to music by composer Franco Alfano, perhaps best known for writing the end to "Turandot" after Puccini's death. The production also features Met starlet Sondra Radvanovsky in the role of Roxane; she dazzled in "Don Carlo" earlier this spring. Performances at 8 p.m. Tickets are $26 to $250. 212-362-6000; www.metopera.org  AS A FOLLOW-UP to last year's "Barber of Seville," Opera Colorado is mounting this production of "The Marriage of Figaro," which is a companion piece of sorts (Rossini's opera is set before the action of Mozart's "Figaro"). Like Mozart's masterful exploration of wayward hearts, this Rossini opera is a comic romp involving Figaro's adventures on behalf of the amorously predatory Count Almaviva. Performances begin at 7:30 p.m. tonight and 2 p.m., Sunday. Tickets are $31 to $102. 303-893-4100 / 800-641-1222; www.operacolorado.org
