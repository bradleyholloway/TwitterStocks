 Entrepreneurs Vying for Graduates the Giants Recruit --- Job Seekers, College Placement Officers See Big Benefits in Thinking Small   By By Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1994  More small-company owners are turning to colleges and universities to fill jobs. Entrepreneurs, who once had to hunt for the campus welcome mat, now find placement officers eager to court them. At the same time, small employers also receive more attention from job seekers discouraged by weak prospects at many larger companies.  Hiring by small businesses also has soared recently at St. Lawrence University. "We're looking at about 30% of our 1993 graduates going to work for small companies," says Lee Svete, director of career planning for the Canton, N.Y., school. That percentage was just 8% to 10% three years ago. "Some of these companies, I never even heard of," he adds.  Last spring, St. Lawrence assisted Keith Besse in finding a technical sales representative for Sapphire Engineering Inc., his small specialty manufacturing firm in North Falmouth, Mass. Mr. Besse says that St. Lawrence, his alma mater, lined up a pool of qualified applicants within two days. He selected Scott Bishop after interviewing nine students. The 1993 graduate "is doing a great job," Mr. Besse says.
