 GOP Loses Round On Letters Seeking St Germain Probe   By By Brooks Jackson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1986  A federal judge ruled that the Republican Party made a $10,000 campaign expenditure last year when it financed a mailing calling for the House Ethics Committee to investigate Rep. Fernand St Germain's personal finances.  Democrats said the ruling closes a loophole through which Republicans could have poured millions of dollars to attack Democratic Senate and House members. But Republicans said they would fight the matter further. "This case is going to take many more twists and turns," predicted Jan Baran, attorney for the National Republican Congressional Committee.  The official loser in Friday's decision was the Federal Election Commission. Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled that the FEC acted "contrary to law" and "abdicated its statutory responsibility" when it dismissed a complaint filed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee against the $10,000 mailing.
