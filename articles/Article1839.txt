 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1988  The request, much of it for "nonlethal" assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels through July, will be submitted to Congress next week, administration officials said. The administration appears to have been forced to scale back previous plans for a $270 million request for all of 1988 because of steps Nicaraguan President Ortega has taken to try to show he is interested in seeking peace with the Contras.  Israeli troops killed three Palestinian guerrillas who had cut through a fence along the Lebanese border, foiling what Defense Minister Rabin said would have been a "murderous attack." In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, troops apparently acting under a new policy announced by Rabin began administering beatings to protesters.  Lebanese militiamen lifted a three-year siege of Palestinian refugee camps outside Beirut, turning over control to Syrian troops. Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri said he lifted the blockade as a sympathy gesture to Palestinian protesters in Israel.
