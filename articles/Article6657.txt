 China to Alter Handling Of Its Foreign Reserves   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2007  Minister of Finance Jin Renqing on Friday said the reserves will be split into two and managed differently. "'Normal' foreign-exchange reserves will continue to be managed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange," Mr. Jin said. "Separately, a foreign-exchange investment company will be set up under the leadership of the State Council," he said, referring to China's executive branch.  China has already injected about $70 billion from its foreign- exchange reserves to shore up the balance sheets of state-controlled banks and other financial institutions. The holding company set up to handle those investments, called Central Huijin Investment Co., was modeled in part on Temasek Holdings of Singapore, which manages that government's interests in its state-controlled companies. Mr. Jin said China is also drawing on international experience with its plan to pursue higher investment returns on a portion of the reserves.
