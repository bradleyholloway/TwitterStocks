 Cyprus, Bahrain, Dubai Still Compete For Beirut's Old Role as a Business Site   By By Geraldine Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1989  NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Five years ago, when Colin Gordon was looking for a base for his company's Middle East operations, he narrowed the field to three locations: Bahrain, Dubai and Cyprus.  A decade earlier, Mr. Gordon, Middle East general manager with Cussons Ltd., wouldn't even have had to ponder such a choice. Companies like Cussons, a British soap concern, naturally went to Beirut, a city that combined a central location in the Arab world with a convivial European ambience.  The Mediterranean island of Cyprus, though not an Arab country, has tried to position itself as the new Middle East hub for international businesses. "But I'm not sure we will ever again see a true business/banking center as Beirut was to the Middle East or Hong Kong is to Asia," says Peter Watkins, Middle East manager of Allied-Signal Inc's Linotype Ltd. subsidiary, which moved to Cyprus from Beirut.
