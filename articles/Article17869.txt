 Senate Approves Major Trade Measure By Vote of 85-11 and Sends It to Reagan --- Reagan Likely to Sign Bill, Aimed to Aid U.S. Firms And to Expand Markets   By By Monica Langley and Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1988  Driven by election-year politics, both Democrats and Republicans finally embraced the 1,000-page bill, which was largely stripped of the protectionism it first contained. While congressional Democrats have pushed the trade legislation, Republicans and business now are eager to see it enacted, because it would provide trade benefits to domestic industries and toughen the U.S. stance on unfair imports.  Big winners in the trade bill include high-technology companies, the oil industry, agriculture and export business in general. With the strong special-interest support from big-business groups and labor unions, the trade bill hurts very few segments of domestic industry. The bill will leave out in the cold the issue of import relief to dying industries that can't show they can regain competitiveness. And it will limit sales to the U.S. by Japan's Toshiba Corp.  The legislation tightens the process of trade regulation in the U.S. in many ways, so that a future president who is inclined to adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward alleged foreign unfair trade practices will find it harder to do so. And a president inclined to wield a big stick on trade will find new power to do so in the bill.
