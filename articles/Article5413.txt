 World-Wide [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1992  The 90-minute debate featured a few barbs on personal matters, but the three candidates broke no new substantive ground. President Bush attempted to use the forum to diminish Clinton's commanding lead in opinion polls and to offset independent candidate Perot's critiques, as both challengers assailed the incumbent's record. The debate was the first of three such sessions in a nine-day period. A vice presidential debate is set for tomorrow in Atlanta.  Perot's performance is likely to temporarily boost his standing in the polls -- though it isn't clear whether it will be at Clinton's or Bush's expense. However, Perot is likely to remain a distant third.  The inquiry by the FBI is focusing on whether the Justice Department and CIA acted improperly in passing on an incomplete, and therefore misleading, report on the Iraqi loan scandal to a federal district judge hearing the case in Atlanta. The FBI move came after an unusual CIA admission last week that it had failed to report all it knew and that it had ordered its own inspector general to look into the incomplete report.
