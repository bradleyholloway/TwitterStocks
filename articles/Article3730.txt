 Personal Health (A Special Report): Treatments; Going Under the Light: A new treatment for skin cancer calls for removing the tumor without knives or needles   By Lin, Xueling, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2003  Supporters say the cosmetic benefit of avoiding surgery probably is worth a slightly higher chance of recurrence, particularly with the milder forms of skin cancer. "If a patient comes in with a single, small precancerous spot, it's tempting to go for traditional curettage [cutting or scraping with a surgical tool known as a curette], since this is a fast and effective form of treatment," says Ida Stender, a dermatologist in Copenhagen who wrote a Ph.D. thesis on photodynamic therapy, or PDT. "But if the spot is located on the person's nose," Dr. Stender continues, "a place everyone can see and that the patient herself will see everyday in the mirror, you have to consider if PDT is a better alternative."  Still, even in some cases where surgery is required, PDT can significantly reduce the amount of cutting needed, doctors say, which ultimately will reduce the size of the scar that is left. "You use PDT to remove shallower skin cancers, and then you look to see what's left," says Dr. Stender. "These smaller areas where the deeper cancers are can then be removed by surgery."  Some doctors say that despite the apparent cosmetic benefits of PDT, the treatment may actually be more painful for patients. "In cryosurgery, there is a short burst of cold, while in PDT the period of pain can be more prolonged," says Don Miech, clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Wisconsin. "I'll probably wait until there is compelling evidence to show that PDT is superior to present modalities."
