 Another Big Recall May Hit Mattel; Latest Incident From China Involves Cars, Magnet Toys; More Pressure on Factories   By Nicholas Zamiska and Nicholas Casey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  While it is unclear whether Cheung Shu-hung's suicide is linked to the recall, the incident is likely to be seen as a tragic symbol of the mounting pressure Chinese manufacturers face to improve their operations in the wake of recent high-profile product recalls. Mr. Cheung, an owner of Hong Kong-based Lee Der Industrial Co., killed himself Saturday at his factory's warehouse in China's southern Guangdong province, according to an official at the public security bureau in Guangzhou.  The sudden reaction catches some Chinese partners unused to the international spotlight by surprise, said M. Eric Johnson, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business who conducts research on Chinese factories. Factory owners "suddenly realize they've stepped on a third rail," he said. "Next they're losing face badly in the government-business structure. They're shamed to everybody and then suddenly it's like 'game over' for these guys."  While in China, senior Mattel executives also met with Chinese government officials to discuss the recall, according to a person in the industry who has been in contact with Mattel employees. Mattel employees said Chinese officials were upset that the American company's toy recall had disgraced the name of China, according to the person.
