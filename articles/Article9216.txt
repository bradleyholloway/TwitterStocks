 Camp Clinton   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2000  Want an example? Just this weekend a car was stolen in the Palestinian town of Ramallah. The theft somehow provoked a feud between two men over possession of the car. Not long after, a 25-year-old woman, the sister of one of the men, was shot dead in her family's butcher shop. That provoked a general outburst of looting and shooting. Two restaurants burned to the ground. Palestinian police arrested the alleged murderer in a nearby refugee camp. He's summarily sentenced to death in a "security court" run by [Yasser Arafat]'s Palestinian Authority. That, in turn, provoked an outraged response from the refugees, many of whom march on Ramallah, setting off a confrontation with Palestinian police that left 15 wounded. Just another "incident" in Arafatland, barely reported in the West.
