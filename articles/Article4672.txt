 Across America, Local Economies Brace for Costlier Oil --- In Racine, Wis., Fears Grow Of Return to the Old Days Of Surging Jobless Rates   By By Brett Pulley, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1990  RACINE, Wis. -- In this city of 82,000 on Lake Michigan's shore, memories still linger of the 22% unemployment that struck here less than a decade ago.  That's why residents voice growing concern over effects of sharply higher oil prices, rising interest rates and a softening economy. "Here we go again," says Joe Mrazek, a local developer who has been instrumental in rejuvenating this city's downtown, where big blue "Re-discover Downtown" banners wave.  In cities across the U.S., residents are beginning to wonder just how much their economic lives will be affected by the events in the Mideast and an already fragile economy. Here and elsewhere, residents, business owners and city officials haven't taken any bold steps yet to counter what could be difficult times ahead.
