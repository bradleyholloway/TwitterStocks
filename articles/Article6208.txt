 Water-Heater Maker Sued in Ala. Over Plastic Part in Its Machines   By By Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  In a lawsuit filed April 15 in Mobile County Circuit Court, George Conway, a Baldwin County teacher, alleges that Rheem Manufacturing Co., New York, has been selling water heaters that it "knew or should have known" contained a defective part, and that the company has breached its customers' warranties.  The alleged culprit: The water heater's plastic "dip tube," which is supposed to channel cold water into the bottom of the water tank as the hot water rises to the top. Instead, according to Mr. Conway's claim, the tube slowly disintegrates, clogging water filters in a house's plumbing and other appliances. Plus, the water heaters eventually fail, the claim says.  Mr. Conway's lawyer, Richard Dorman, a partner with Cunningham, Bounds, Yance, Crowder & Brown in Mobile, is seeking class-action status for the claim to include homeowners and businesses in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Texas that bought Rheem water heaters starting in 1993.
