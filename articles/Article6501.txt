 The Rising Risks Of Falling Inflation   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2001  Even without deflation, inflation close to zero can cause problems. For example, economists expect nominal gross domestic product -- the dollar value for the country's economic output, unadjusted for inflation -- to shrink in the current quarter. That has happened only once in the last 40 years, in the first quarter of 1982, the middle of the worst recession since World War II. During most recessions, GDP actually rose when measured at then-prevailing prices. It was only after stripping out inflation that output fell.  Falling inflation, meanwhile, makes it harder for the Fed to soften those blows. Here's why: The Fed's main weapon for fighting recession is to lower the federal funds rate, which is the benchmark off which most other short-term rates are set. Cheaper money is supposed to encourage more borrowing, more spending and more investment. But the real cost of borrowing for households and companies is the real interest rate -- the rate they pay minus the rate of inflation. If inflation falls along with interest rates, all the Fed is doing is running in place.  That is a big reason Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has moved so aggressively this year, waging a furious race to get interest rates below a falling inflation rate. Until the economy shows signs of turning around -- and inflation stops falling -- Mr. Greenspan is likely to keep moving ever closer to zero.
