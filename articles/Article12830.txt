 Those Amber Waves of Grain Are Again a Trade Issue   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2002  The [Bush] administration's farm proposal targets trade-distorting industrial nation farm subsidies. It hints at a willingness to put the much-criticized new 10-year, $190 billion U.S. farm program on the table. The EU would of course have to throw its program, which is about three times as expensive, into the pot. The U.S. goal is to knock total global subsidies down by $100 billion, capping individual programs at no more than 5% of total production. It also wants the elimination of export subsidies, claiming that EU farm export aid, at $2 billion, dwarfs the $20 million the U.S. spends. Tariffs on farm products are another target, with the U.S. proposing a 15% global average, compared to 62% now.  The farm products initiative is an interesting exercise in global politics. The administration took a lot of heat from Europe, not to mention threats of retaliation, when it imposed import barriers on certain steel products to protect the big U.S. integrated steel mills. Now, Mr. Bush is positioned to take the lead again in trying to reduce trade barriers globally. His trade representative, Robert Zoellick, was instrumental in launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization meeting in Doha, Qatar, a few months ago, gambling that Congress would grant the fast-track (TPA) authority necessary to bring the new round to fruition. TPA already has revived bilateral discussions with Chile and Singapore, part of the Zoellick strategy of carrying on bilateral and multilateral trade talks simultaneously.
