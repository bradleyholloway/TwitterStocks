An Israeli inventor was granted a patent this week for a nuclear reactor that draws a substantial portion of its power from burning natural thorium, rather than uranium.  Alvin Radkowsky assigned patent 4,273,613 to the Ramat University authority for applied research, Tel Aviv.  The invention is intended for reactors of the heavy-water moderated type such as those developed in Canada. It is expected to bring substantial savings by reducing the need for uranium.
