 Los Angeles City Attorney Sues Bradley, Alleges Improperly Reported Holdings   By By David J. Jefferson, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1989  Mr. Bradley also faces problems as federal investigators continue to probe his financial relationship with former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief Michael Milken. In addition, Mr. Hahn referred his findings to the Los Angeles County district attorney, the state attorney general, the state Fair Political Practices Commission and the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.  No criminal charges were filed as a result of Mr. Hahn's investigation. Nevertheless, Mr. Hahn attacked the mayor's conduct. "Just because we found no violation of law does not mean that what the mayor did was right," he said.  In a 45-minute televised address, Mr. Bradley responded point by point to the report. "When all is said and done, the inquiry confirms what I have said all along. I did not engage in conflicts of interest. I did not violate the public's trust." As for the alleged violations in reporting his investments, Mr. Bradley said, "The errors I made were not deliberate. They show only that I'm not an accountant, and I shouldn't have tried to be one. These were technical violations of a civil nature -- nothing more."
