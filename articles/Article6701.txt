 Travel Watch   By Holmes, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2007  With the Web flooded with airfare sales to different destinations from different airlines, SmarterTravel.com has launched a tool to help travelers search through deals. The "Deals at a Glance" tool compiles fare sales from a variety of airlines; the results can be sorted by departure or destination city, airline and price. A clock feature reminds users when the deals expire. Visit www.smartertravel.com/air fare/deals-at-a-glance.php.  STA Travel was one of the first in the industry to join Second Life, a virtual Web world in which users create animated versions of themselves known as avatars who work, play and interact together. Second Life "residents," as users are known, have been able to get travel advice for the real world by chatting online with "Globetrekker Bob," STA Travel's virtual representative. Now Globetrekker Bob can actually book trips, as well. He's available weekdays at virtualstatravel.com.
