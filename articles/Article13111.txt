 Investors Watch for 'Santa' Rally; Performance Push Often Makes December Market's Best Month; But Fears of a Grinch Come 2005   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2004  He doesn't think Santa will desert Wall Street and expects stocks to keep rising into the new year. "But I think that what we are seeing now are gains that we are borrowing from the first quarter of 2005. The fundamental picture hasn't changed enough to merit this kind of change in the marketplace," Mr. [Stephen Sachs] says. He is forecasting a double-digit stock pullback beginning in the first quarter -- an even nastier pullback than stocks experienced in the first part of the past year.  "Once something makes a record high it tends to perpetuate a trend and bring money in," he says. Yet even Mr. [Tim Hayes], who has been bullish this year, is beginning to worry about next year. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, despite a 7% gain so far this year, remains more than 28% short of its record, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, also up strongly this year, would have to more than double to get back to its high. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.2% for the week, including a rise of 4.39 points Friday to close at 2147.96.  Historically December has been the year's most consistent gainer, not just for the Dow industrials but also for broad indexes of small stocks, large stocks and foreign stocks, according to Ned Davis Research. Since 1900 the Dow industrials have risen in Decembers almost three times out of four. The gains tend to dry up a bit at first, and then kick back in toward the end of the month. Last year, however, the Dow rose pretty much without a break for the entire month, for a monthly gain of 7%, and then sagged after mid-February.
