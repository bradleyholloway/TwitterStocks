 Industrials Rise 23.45 to 12131.88 Amid Optimism   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2006  Hopes are high. Investors expect the inflation data to indicate that the pace of price increases is slowly falling back into the 2%-or-less annual range that the Fed considers acceptable. People think retail sales will show steady, although not eye-popping, gains ahead of what they hope will be a good holiday season. And they think the Fed minutes will contain no surprises, with most policy makers continuing to believe that, as long as inflation and growth remain moderate, interest rates can stay unchanged.  Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, said the U.S. economy is "growing forcefully," which further allayed worries that the economy could slump.
