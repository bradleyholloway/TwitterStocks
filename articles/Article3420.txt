 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: Reading Some New Tea Leaves   By Kalis, Lisa, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  More studies are needed to prove any real advantage to humans, but that hasn't stopped sales from reaching a boiling point. At Upton Tea Imports in Hopkinton, Mass., white-tea sales tripled from 2001 to 2004. Beverage maker Republic of Tea in Novato, Calif., introduced a line of bottled iced teas last summer. Compared with the green and black teas, the two white teas "blew the others away in sales," said spokeswoman Marideth Post, and the company introduced three more whites in January.  It's a good thing white tea is low in caffeine, because we still had one last cup to drink. The White Peony tea from Adagio Teas was a midrange mixture of buds and leaves. It didn't have the depth of the winner, but Ms. [Cynthia Gold] called it "a lovely, everyday white tea," with a smooth taste and some peppery notes. At $6 for one ounce, it's our Best Value.
