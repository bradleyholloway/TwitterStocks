 World Wire   By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1992  The rebound "will be slow, at best," despite the $87 billion economic stimulus package the government announced on Aug. 28, Takeshi Noda, minister for economic planning, said, citing in part the drop in consumer demand.  Mr. Noda also said that if the government aids Japan's financially troubled banks by helping buy real estate used as collateral for bad loans, it should try to recover its money through resale of the land to the private sector, thus avoiding a bailout. Japanese banks may form a corporation to buy and hold some of that land.  The Russian government will partially free oil and coal prices and allow them to reach world levels gradually by the end of next year. The new policy by the world's second-biggest oil producer would double energy prices to halt sliding production levels and boost sagging export revenues, said Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who also is fuel and energy minister. Oil exports account for most of Russia's hard-currency earnings. Natural gas prices would remain controlled. The energy price increases would be linked to efforts to make the ruble convertible.
