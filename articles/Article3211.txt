 Sticking With a Plain-Vanilla Strategy   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2003  As Mr. Ellis sees it, most individuals are clearly outgunned, so they should give up on individual stocks and instead buy mutual funds. Indeed, in "Winning the Loser's Game," Mr. Ellis forcefully argues that investors should abandon efforts to beat the stock-market averages and instead buy market-tracking index funds. "You don't have to beat the market to be a winner," he says.  "People changing their minds is what really ruins returns," Mr. Ellis says. "If you're not willing to hold on for 10 years, you shouldn't start."  Mr. Ellis is in awe of Mr. [David Swensen]'s investment acumen. "But if you look at my own portfolio, you would think I haven't learned anything," he says. "David can do it. It doesn't mean I can. I do very plain- vanilla, simple things. I invest in mutual funds, and am enormously happy to be doing it that way."
