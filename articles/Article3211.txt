 From Break-In to Breaking Point   By By Frank Gannon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1999  I have vivid memories of the flight aboard Air Force One carrying Richard Nixon back to California on Aug. 9, 1974. In a typically Nixonian effort ("it will cheer them up a little"), the just-former president made a painful progress through the cabin shaking hands and attempting small talk. Staring out the window in the numbed silence that followed, I noticed the silhouette of the plane chasing us across the landscape far below. This was, I suppose, both literally and figuratively, a shadow of Watergate.  That image was on my mind when I opened "Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate" (Simon & Schuster, 592 pages, $27.50). Bob Woodward began writing the book in 1996, no doubt with an eye on the coming 25th anniversary of Nixon's resignation. By 1998, however, he was surfing a tsunami of Clinton leaks and gossip. Like the canny reporter he is, he decided to hang ten and take the ride.  The result is a highly readable book about the Clinton scandals. As usual with Mr. Woodward's oeuvre, there are some problems involving sources and sourcing. "Shadow" is filled with authoritative accounts of conversations -- words spoken between quotation marks, intimate gestures definitively described -- that are at best re-creations based on biased participants' memories, at worst near-fabrications. This reportorial technique was entertaining but also egregious when Mr. Woodward first employed it years ago, and it still is, especially since (now as then) he will not name his sources.
