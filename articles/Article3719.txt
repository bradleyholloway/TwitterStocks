 Politics & Economics: Pentagon Chief Says Iran Is Arming Afghan Fighters   By Greg Jaffe and Jay Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2007  RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany -- As the U.S. tries to build support for sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program, U.S. officials say the conflict between U.S. forces and Iranian proxy fighters in Afghanistan is heating up.  More recently, Tehran has tried to build good relations with Mr. [Hamid Karzai]'s government. Even as he accused Iran of arming the Taliban, Mr. [Robert Gates] conceded that Tehran has a pretty good relationship with the Afghan government in Kabul. He suggested Iran might be trying to "play both sides of the streets" in Afghanistan or might simply be interested in causing trouble for U.S. forces.  Senior U.S. commanders have complained for months that Iranian forces are operating in Iraq, arming radical Shiite groups that have targeted both U.S. forces and the country's Sunni minority with increasingly sophisticated weaponry. The U.S. and Iran recently held their first official, high-level, face-to-face talks in almost 30 years, which were aimed at curbing Iranian meddling in the region and coming up with new strategies to reverse Iraq's deteriorating security situation.
