By IRA HENRY FREEMAN  The village miller stonegrinds flour in the water-powered gristmill. In his 1790 forge the blacksmith hammers out iron trivets, candlesticks and cupboard latches. The potter shapes clay into jugs on his treadle-wheel. The housekeeper in bonnet and kerchief conducts guests through the stagecoach inn. In barns and workshops, young women dip candles, hook rugs and weave cloth on hand looms.  Amid all this hubbub, rural New Jersey of a century and more ago is being resurrected as Waterloo Village, the restored ironworking settlement on the old Morris Canal in Stanhope. The village, a complex of more than a score of restored buildings, is now in its 17th year as a historical museum.  In its bucolic setting amid the forested hills of northwest New Jersey, the village, which was known as Andover Forge during the Revolutionary War, is only about an hour's drive from New York and with its varied attractions makes a pleasant weekend outing for families.  The staff of 20 craftsmen, housekeepers and guides roam about the village in period costumes to interpret and explain the background and history of the village to visitors.  Waterloo stands on its original Colonial site on the Musconetcong River and is now part of Allamuchy Mountain State Park, an 11,000-acre nature preserve. The site is operated by the nonprofit Waterloo Foundation for the Arts, which raises $1 million a year through donations, admission fees and sales of handcrafted products.  Under the leadership of Percival Leach and Louis Gualandi, partners in a New York firm of interior designers, the foundation has created a small version of the Williamsburg restoration in New Jersey. Though only 50 miles from New York City by expressway, Waterloo is one to two centuries removed.  The village consists of two dozen buildings of native stone and wood in Colonial to late Victorian styles scattered over approximately 50 acres on the west bank of the Musconetcong. In the spring, the river here tumbles through the woods and is dammed in several spots to form ponds and miniature falls.  The one street, actually a remnant of the old dirt public road, meanders along the riverbank for about 600 yards from end to end of the village, with the principal buildings aligned on one side. Back from the river, the rest of the buildings are reached by side lanes. The entire restoration area is screened from the surrounding 20th century by thick woods. No traffic or modern intrusions impinge upon the rural scene, and geese, ducks, sheep and goats wander freely about the grounds.  Visitors can stroll about at leisure, following a self-guiding pamphlet from one exhibit to the next. Costumed guide-lecturers are in each building to show them around.  Twenty original buildings dating from 1760 to the 1860's - homes, barns, workshops, a mill, a church, a country store, an inn - have been preserved. Fourteen of these have been meticulously restored, furnished with antiques and opened to the public. Three more are presently under restoration.  Just inside the entrance to the village, the visitor comes first to the white-steepled Methodist church, still used for services every Sunday.  Next to it stands the Canal House, an early example of a multiplefamily dwelling, a plain stone two-story building with windows in the attic. Originally divided into two four-room apartments with separate front entrances, the building was at various times occupied by families of the canal lock tender, store clerk and other employees. The furnishings, such as a high-backed settle, or bench, before the fire and a tiger-striped, maple dining set, illustrate the living style of working people who resided here in the 1830's.  In contrast, the next exhibit is Wellington House, a Victorian villa that was the residence of Seymour Smith, banker and grandson of a village patriarch. A large white clapboard house of two stories and attic, with a tall, square tower over the central hall and a double set of semi-circular bay windows on the front, it flaunts the elegance of the period. The walls of the drawing room are covered with red velvet. In the dining room is a gleaming pedestal table set with delicate china under the crystal chandeliers.  The ties with history run deep in Waterloo Village. The Wellington House was named in honor of the victor in the 1815 battle, and the village itself, originally known as Andover Forge, was renamed for the Belgian battlefield itself soon after Napoleon's defeat.  The father of the Wellington House owner lived next door in the Homestead, an old, stone barn converted to an opulent country residence in the early 19th century. Extended in width and with a second story and a front porch added, the house is now furnished with Chippendale, Hepplewhite, Federal and Queen Anne furniture. The wallpaper in the drawing room depicts panoramas of Boston Harbor, Niagara Falls and West Point as imagined by a French artist of the day, and the music room has, among other vintage instruments, a gilded Steinway piano once played by Van Cliburn at a concert here. 1 2 NEXT PAGE >
