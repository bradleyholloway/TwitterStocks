 Aerospace Firms Seek to Cooperate On a New Rocket   By By Barbara Rosewicz, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1993  Stymied by Congress's refusal to pay for developing an advanced new rocket for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the Star Wars missile-defense program, the companies have asked NASA to join in a planning and research project that could help the U.S. gain a greater share of the commercial launch business now dominated by Arianspace, a European joint venture.  The approach by Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., Lockheed Corp., Martin Marietta Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. is aimed first at surveying current and new customers and sampling how much they are willing to spend for access to space. Those market survey results would be used to define what kind of rocket would be in greatest demand, and then to define technology breakthroughs that would enable U.S. companies to build it.
