 As the Price of Gasoline Takes Off, Oil and Auto Firms Trade Barbs   By Ball, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2006  Oil companies have faced accusations in Congress and elsewhere that they are engaging in price gouging, a charge the companies have denied but that Mr. [Jason Vines] took up in his blog posting. He wrote that gas- station operators have "accused Exxon Mobil in particular for price gouging in the wake of Katrina." He also mentioned Chevron Corp., whose facilities, Mr. Vines wrote, leaked "oil into pristine Gulf wetlands in Katrina's aftermath -- one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history."  Don Campbell, a Chevron spokesman, declined to address the details of Mr. Vines's allegations. "This is one man's blog," he said. "It's riddled with errors. We don't feel it's constructive to comment on it."  Nor did Mr. Vines back down. While it's true that federal figures show the fuel economy of the U.S. new-vehicle fleet hasn't changed in the past two decades, he said, today's vehicles have more safety and pollution-control features than their predecessors, all of which add weight. "They can parse words," he said of Exxon officials in an interview, but "it's not comparing apples to apples."
