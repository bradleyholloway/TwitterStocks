 Details: Greenhouse Effect For the Home   By By Rebecca Lowell, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1999  Iwona Howley isn't a character from the whodunit board game Clue. But she's one of the growing number of American homeowners who are adding ornate, Victorian-style conservatories to their houses, often in place of more-traditional sunrooms.  When her deck needed to be replaced, Mrs. Howley of Holmdel, N.J., initially was going to simply add a room, just off the kitchen, with skylights. But she says the proposals she had for the additional room looked too plain for the back of her colonial house. Instead, she opted for a 15-foot-by-20-foot, glassed-in conservatory with decorative spires.  "We have a lot of nice landscaping, and you feel like you are outside -- it brings it much closer by having all the windows around," says Mrs. Howley, a mother of three, who uses the conservatory as a reading room while her family watches television in another part of the house.
