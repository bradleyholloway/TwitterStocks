Organizers of the Connoisseur's Antiques Fair, running today through Sunday at the Gramercy Park Armory (Lexington Avenue at 26th Street), are donating space there for a sale of rugs woven by women in rural Afghanistan. The weavers are represented by Arzu, a nonprofit organization in Chicago; in addition to their wages, they and their families benefit from the profits, which Arzu says help with education and health care. The rugs are made in traditional patterns and in many colors and sizes, from 3 feet by 5 to 10 by 14 ($900 to $20,000). They can also be ordered from arzurugs.org or (312) 280-0354.
