 Stock Rally Continues; Gold Slides --- Long-Term Treasury Bond Is Unchanged As Dollar Is Mixed   By By Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1989  Investors kept the stock rally going, barely, but year-end stagnation began settling over the bond and currency markets. Gold prices fell sharply.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 5.98 to 2753.63. Among the gainers were many of the Dow stocks whose fortunes are tied to the economic cycle -- stocks that included some of the much-maligned technology issues. But long-term Treasury bonds ended unchanged, and the dollar was narrowly mixed.  In contrast to Friday's flamboyant surge, stocks yesterday benefited from bargain-hunting investors who bought up shares that had been sold heavily in recent weeks. "Technology stocks were the stars of the day," said Edward Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody. International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Compaq Computer all rose sharply.
