 Bombardier's CEO, Two Directors Step Down   By Chipello, Christopher J, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2004  Investors reacted to Mr. [Paul M. Tellier]'s departure by sending Bombardier's widely traded Class B shares down 17%, or 44 Canadian cents (36 U.S. cents), to C$2.11 in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services placed Bombardier's credit ratings under review with negative implications. S&P's move "reflects new uncertainty about Bombardier's financial policies and strategic direction" following Mr. Tellier's resignation," said S&P analyst Kenton Freitag.  Chairman Laurent Beaudoin, head of the company's controlling family, will become CEO. The moves come as Bombardier struggles with the airline industry's financial woes, a slowdown in the European rail- equipment market, and the rising value of the Canadian dollar. Those challenges have sapped Bombardier's efforts to rebuild profitability, despite aggressive restructuring moves by Mr. Tellier since he became CEO two years ago.
