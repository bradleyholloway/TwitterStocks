 Hercules, Jilted Three Times, Pines for an Acquisition --- Specialty-Chemicals Firms Are Targeted, but Hunter Could Become Prey   By By Susan Warren, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1998  R. Keith Elliott, Hercules' chief executive, says he continues to seek a major purchase of a specialty-chemicals company, in a market where they are getting snapped up at ever higher prices. But Hercules's frustrations have some industry consultants suggesting that it could become the pursued rather than the pursuer. While playing down that possibility, Mr. Elliott says, "If that creates value, I'd look at it."  Meantime, the company is moving to reassure shareholders that it can find ways to make itself -- and its share price -- grow. It hopes to trim $60 million a year from its costs and increase revenue by 5% to 7% annually, mostly through higher sales. Internal growth is a priority: by the year 2000, the company hopes to derive 30% of its revenue from new products. Last month, Hercules also restarted a share-repurchase program shelved during its run at Allied Colloids. Hercules bought about 64 million of its own shares, at a cost of $2.4 billion, during the past seven years.  Hercules' acquisition troubles have been a surprise for a company that practically led the industry's restructuring trend. Spun off from DuPont Co. in 1912 as an explosives maker, Hercules eventually expanded into a hodgepodge of chemicals and aerospace businesses, with 1991 revenue of $3.2 billion. To boost sagging profits, it began that year to streamline, selling off aerospace, electronics and packaging-materials businesses, a printing division and its 50% stake in Tastemaker, a flavors and fragrance business.
