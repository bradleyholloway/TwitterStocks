 WellPoint Settles Doctors' Lawsuit; Payments of $198 Million By Health Insurer To Resolve Reimbursements Dispute   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2005  WellPoint said it viewed the settlement as a means to end the litigation, not an acknowledgment of any unfair payment practices. But WellPoint's relationships with doctors and medical associations could improve after nearly six years of costly litigation.  WellPoint's agreement with the doctors is similar to the others. The company will contribute $135 million to a fund to which doctors can submit previously disputed claims, and another $5 million to a foundation set up under the previous settlements to promote better health care and access for the disadvantaged. In addition, WellPoint will pay as much as $58 million in legal fees, the full amount to be determined by Judge [Federico Moreno].  In addition, WellPoint has agreed to set up: a physician-advisory committee aimed at improving communications with doctors; an independent review board to hear physicians' billing disputes with the health insurer; and standardized definitions of what makes certain procedures or services medically necessary. "That's the real objective of this," said Archie Lamb, co-lead counsel for the doctors.
