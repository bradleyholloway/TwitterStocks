 A Closer Look: Making Memories Last   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  The site -- at http://www.123456789.net -- enables users to record the birth of newborns, memories of deceased loved ones, or your own "storyography," a mini-autobiography that can extend up to 100 page views of text. Although you may not want to send your own story into the ether, it is still fun to peruse what other people have written. You can search for others your age, by gender, birthplace or interests. You can also search for that long lost aunt by typing in your surname.
