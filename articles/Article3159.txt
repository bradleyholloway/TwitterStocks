 Health & Technology: Health Body Says Chinese Data On SARS `Reflect Huge Efforts'   By By Leslie Chang in Beijing and Matt Pottinger in Guangzhou, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 2003  In contrast to past news conferences held by WHO in China, this one was held jointly with the country's Ministry of Health and sounded fewer caveats on main points. Dr. [David Heymann] said it is now possible to conduct blood tests and analysis among recovered patients who hadn't reported contact with a known SARS patient. The high number of such cases -- more than half of SARS patients in Beijing -- has been cited by WHO experts as a concern because it raised questions about how the disease was spreading in China.  Separately, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in the southern city of Guangzhou that researchers had collected more than 2,000 specimens from about 30 wild-animal species sold in Guangdong markets and found viruses virtually identical to the SARS coronavirus in masked palm civets, bats, mountain pigs and even snakes -- a surprise to some scientists because relatively few viruses are known to infect both cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.
