 The New Sony Reader For Books Performs Like a Good First Draft   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  The Reader's screen can't display color and is only fair at graphics because it has just four levels of gray. So photos appear in gray, and titles that make heavy use of charts and graphics don't display well. Also, it's too easy to accidentally press buttons and land far from the page you were reading.  IN MY TESTS, Word documents looked OK, if not perfectly faithful to their layouts. But the Reader's claim to display PDF documents proved hollow. In every PDF document I tried, the text was nearly unreadable and the text resizing feature of the Reader didn't help. Sony concedes that PDF documents work well on the Reader only if they are created for the Reader's screen size and resolution. But it includes no conversion software to make them fit.  Another big disappointment: The Reader lacks a bunch of features that would enhance the reading experience. You can't enter notes, search inside books or documents, or look up words in a built-in dictionary. And while you can bookmark pages for later retrieval, you can't highlight passages. Sony says it's working on a future version of the Reader that can perform these tasks.
