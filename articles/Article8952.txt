 Really Big Deal   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1998  That's the word splashed all over the merger announced Monday between Citicorp and Travelers Group -- the biggest merger in corporate history, maybe any kind of history. Citigroup, as the new combo is to be known, will be worth some $140 billion, providing banking, insurance and brokerage services to more than 100 million customers in some 100 countries.  Conjoined, Citicorp and Travelers hope to reach customers just about anywhere money is passing between hands on the planet, and offer them easier access to the vast net of financial instruments that criss-cross the globe. This lets people tailor the management of their money in ways best suited to individual needs. And that is a sales formula not just for enhancing shareholder wealth at Citicorp and Travelers (both stocks soared Monday morning on the news of the merger). It is by trundling down avenues such as this that the whole world now creates wealth, and on a scale that in fact makes even this mammoth merger look like small change.
