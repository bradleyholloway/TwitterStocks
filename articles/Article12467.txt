 Sara Lee's Profit Falls 5.9% as Toll Of Recall Continues   By By James P. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1999  Sara Lee Corp.'s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings declined 5.9%, as an earlier product recall spurred by a rash of fatal food poisonings continued to exact a heavy toll on profit.  For the 14-week quarter ended July 3, the producer of food and consumer products reported net income of $286 million, or 31 cents a diluted share, off from the 13-week period's $303 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share results reflect a decrease in Sara Lee shares outstanding to 890 million shares, from 922 million.
