 Number of Qualified Opinions Is Increasing --- Tightening of Audit Standards Rankles Some Executives   By By Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1985  So far this year dozens of companies, including Armco Inc., Kentucky Utilities Co., Astrotech International Corp. and United Oklahoma Bankshares Inc., have had their 1984 annual reports qualified. And while comparative statistics on qualified reports aren't available, research by financial data-base firms suggests that qualified reports have been rising sharply during this decade.  A qualified auditor's opinion means that the auditor can't say without certain reservations that the company's financial statements represent fairly the company's results. Those reservations can, among other things, involve omitted information, questions on whether the company can continue in business or questions on whether some potential losses, such as lawsuit settlements, can currently be determined.  John C. Burton, former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission and now dean of Columbia University's graduate school of business, says an increasing number of court suits filed against auditors after companies they audit go bankrupt or have problems "has caused accounting firms to be tougher with annual reports.
