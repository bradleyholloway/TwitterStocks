 Funds' Lending Sparks 'Short' Debate   By Plitch, Phyllis, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2005  As the trillion-dollar business of securities lending grows, so does the risk for investors that shares might end up in the hands of traders whose short-term motives clash with the interests of long-term investors, corporate-governance experts say. "We have now seen that lending is linked to the hedge-fund community, which may have interests which are not aligned with the beneficial owners," said Paul Myners, a former fund manager, now chairman of Marks & Spencer Group PLC, who published a report that addressed securities lending. "If you lend your shares to someone who then uses the vote that attaches to it, it may well be that their short-term economic interests don't sit comfortably with your long-term economic interest. The simple answer is that lenders must get wise."  Investors' legal obligations in share lending aren't explicitly addressed in federal securities rules or state law, lawyers say. Securities and Exchange Commission staff guidance does call for mutual funds to recall shares in the event of a "material" vote, such as a merger. Pension funds governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act generally have a fiduciary obligation in connection with their votes.  "Securities-lending income is nice, but it really doesn't contribute a whole lot to the bottom line," said Victoria Willard, a managing director in the Maryland system's investment division. "One of our fiduciary responsibilities is voting proxies in the best interests of shareholders. I think [the vote] is more of an intangible. We're exercising our rights of ownership."
