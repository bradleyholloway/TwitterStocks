 Lyrical, Rebellious and Almost Forgotten   By By Merle Rubin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2001  [Daniel Mark Epstein] poses these questions at the outset of "What Lips My Lips Have Kissed," his book about Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950). He extols Millay, persuasively, as "America's foremost love poet" and "one of the last important American poets to hold the devoted interest of the serious general reader." And yet it is certainly true that her name is no longer iconic, nor her verse much read. By 1976, as Mr. Epstein notes, she was even left out of The New Oxford Book of American Verse.  It is long past time, then, to reconsider Millay, even to revive her. Luckily, this season brings us two interesting and important biographies. Mr. Epstein's begins in 1911, with a beautiful, intense, 19-year-old girl alone in her bedroom conducting a strange ceremony, "consecrating" herself to love and poetry. [Nancy Milford]'s "Savage Beauty" begins before Millay was born, focusing on the strange family of which Edna was the quintessence.  For the Modern Library, Ms. Milford has recently edited "The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay," which boasts a beautiful picture of Millay on the dustjacket but, oddly, none of her later poems, not even some that Ms. Milford discusses at length in her biography. Fortunately, more complete editions are still in print. Biographies aside, Millay's poetry speaks for itself.
