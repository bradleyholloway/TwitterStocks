 Kmart Plans to Restate Results   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2002  The company also expects to record an adjustment to its 1999 fiscal year opening retained-earnings balance to reflect adjustments attributable to fiscal years 1998 and before. Kmart said the adjustments relate to an understatement of historical accruals for certain leases with varying rent payments and a software programming error in its accounts-payable system that resulted in some paid invoices not being appropriately treated in the company's financial statements.
