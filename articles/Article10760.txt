 E.F. Hutton Scheme involved more cash than disclosed, U.S. prosecutor says   By Pasztor, Andy; McMurray, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1985  Justice Department prosecutor Robert Ogren claims that Hutton's use of bank funds without paying interest involved checks totalling about $10 billion rather than the $4 billion originally cited. Hutton may have to pay "between $40 and $50 million" to defrauded banks. Hutton's first-quarter earnings were only about $24 million, and its 1984 earnings plunged to $52.7 million from $110.6 million the year before. Other brokerage firms are suspected of using Hutton's scheme. Hutton inserted small, inefficient banks in the chain of check transfers, counting on harsh winters and mail foul-ups for delays.
