Correction Appended THIS summer, Frank DeGraff, a 19-year-old college student, decided that he wanted to invest money through the Web, so he started working three jobs. When he had saved $200, he went to RTMark.com and placed the money in one of the site's funds, the Education Fund.  But instead of money, the only returns he was promised were acts of cultural sabotage. Mr. DeGraff is hoping that his investment will be used for projects like making ''anti-souvenirs,'' aimed at various social injustices and offered to tourists, or purchasing recorded books by conservative pundits so leftist speeches can be recorded over the original material and the tapes can be put back onto sales racks in book stores.
