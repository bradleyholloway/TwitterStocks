The Montreal Canadiens will finish the regular-season schedule without Guy Lafleur, their high-scoring right wing, whose injured left foot has been placed in a cast. Lafleur's foot was struck by a slap shot from a teammate, Gaston Gingras, on March 11, and he has been unable to skate since then, missing five games. A series of Xrays failed to reveal any fracture, though, and the Canadiens, who have clinched first place in the National Hockey League's Adams Division, expect Lafleur to be available for the playoffs, which begin in mid-April.
