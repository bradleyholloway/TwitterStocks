 Cadbury's New Bubble-Gum Battle; India Launch Sets Up Fight With Wrigley, Perfetti for Booming Market   By Ball, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2007  Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the world's biggest candy maker by sales, is intensifying the race to capture India's growing bubble-gum market. Cadbury's Bubbaloo, launched there in July, joins rivals Boomer gum, made by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. of the U.S., and Big Babol, made by Italian company Perfetti Van Melle SpA, to try to entice children, the main chewers of bubble gum.  India is the latest battleground in a series of clashes between Cadbury and Wrigley, the world's two biggest makers of chewing gum in terms of sales. Until now, Wrigley and Perfetti, which makes the candy Mentos, have dominated the $70 million Indian bubble-gum market, with market shares of 46% and 41%, respectively, according to market- research group Euromonitor. Cadbury says its goal is a double-digit market share in gum within a year.  India is part of a bigger push by Cadbury to expand in emerging markets, particularly at a time when Chief Executive Todd Stitzer is under pressure to bolster Cadbury's candy business, after announcing this spring his plans to spin off the company's soft-drink brands, Dr Pepper and 7UP, in order to focus on gum and candy. About 32% of its GBP 4.8 billion ($9.8 billion) in total confectionery sales comes from emerging markets. (Cadbury yesterday said it will close a factory and cut 700 jobs in the United Kingdom as part of cost-cutting moves.)
