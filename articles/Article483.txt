 To the Editor:  Re ''Massachusetts Governor Opposes Stem Cell Work'' (news article, Feb. 10):  It is very troubling to see a major public policy decision about medical research made from an unscientific point of view.  Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts aims to criminalize leading-edge medical research by banning a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer, also known as therapeutic cloning.  The word ''cloning'' has clouded this issue.  At the microscopic cellular level, the process allows scientists to develop embryonic stem cells with genetic information about specific diseases. This process does not entail developing embryos through the combination of sperm and ovum.  With stem cells derived from the process, scientists might be able to learn how illnesses like diabetes, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida and other diseases develop in the body.  Harvard University has the scientists and the facilities to lead this research, but it can't happen if Governor Romney's proposed policy becomes law.
