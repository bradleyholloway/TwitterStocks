An innovative issue of student loan revenue bonds of the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority was offered yesterday through underwriters led by Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., a New Orleans-based firm. The $69.8 million of 7 percent bonds due in 1986 were offered at a price of 100.  The bonds, which were rated AAA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, are backed by a pool of United States Government-guaranteed student loans as well as additional guarantees from a commercial bank and an insurance company. The bank, the Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, North Carolina, agreed to buy student loans if the authority did not have the funds to make principal or interest payments on the bonds.  Another layer of protection is provided by a surety bond issued by the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company and the American Insurance Company. According to Serafino Tobvia, a municipal bond analyst at Shearson/ American Express, the surety policy means that ''if the bank does not honor its agreement, Fireman's Fund will purchase the loans on behalf of the bank.''
