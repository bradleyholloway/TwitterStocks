 Hyundai Motor Dumping Cars, Canada Rules   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1987  Canada's revenue department ruled that Hyundai cars have been dumped on the Canadian market and imposed stiff provisional import duties on the South Korean vehicles.  The department's investigation was prompted by a complaint from two Canadian auto makers, General Motors of Canada Ltd., a unit of General Motors Corp., Detroit, and Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co.  A spokesman for Hyundai Auto Canada Inc., a unit of Seoul-based Hyundai Motor Co., said both the unit and the South Korean parent will be providing further cost and price information to the revenue department. That information, he said, may result in the dumping margins being reduced.
