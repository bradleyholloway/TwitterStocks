Teledyne Water Pik of Fort Collins, Colo., which installed David K. Mutchler as its new president last August, has been doing a bit of reorganizing of late. While management was at it, they decided to look at the advertising, which has been with the J. Walter Thompson Company in New York for about 10 years.  Terry Valeski, vice president-marketing, said he sent questionnaires to 12 agencies in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  He expects to select five of them by March 5. Then, after interviewing the managements, the group will be cut by March 15 to three, who will then be given a specific assignment.  Mr. Valeski, who worked for Thompson in New York and San Francisco, thinks the winner should be selected by April 15. Water Pik makes a line of oral hygiene products and spends around $5 million a year to advertise them.
