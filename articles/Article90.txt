WASHINGTON, Aug. 16â€” The virus believed to cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, has been found in the teardrops of a woman suffering from the disease, scientists said today, but they were uncertain whether someone could contract the disorder by repeated contact with tears.  Scientists at the National Cancer Institute isolated the virus from the tears of a 33-year-old woman with the disorder, which destroys the body's ability to fight illness. They also found evidence of the virus in tears of three other AIDS patients who were tested, but none in tear samples of healthy volunteers.  ''It's not possible for me or anyone else to say infectious virus can be transmitted through tears, but the virus has been found in tears,'' said Dr. Robert Gallo, head of the institute's laboratory of tumor cell biology, where the discovery was made.  ''It is theoretically possible that tear contamination of an open wound could be a possible mode of transmission, but we know of no epidemiological evidence that that has ever occurred,'' Dr. Gallo said.  Virus Present in Body Fluids  The findings are to be published in The Lancet, a British medical journal. Principal authors include Dr. S. Zaki Salahuddin, who isolated the virus from the tears, and Dr. Leslie S. Fujikawa of the National Eye Institute's clinical branch.  The findings show that the HTLV-3 virus is present in more body fluids than researchers thought, Dr. Gallo said. Principal sites where the virus is known to multiply include certain white blood cells crucial to the body's immune system. The virus has also been found in lymph nodes, blood plasma, semen and saliva.  The virus is believed to be spread by sexual contact or contaminated needles; the disorder has been found in some instances in the past to have been spread by contaminated blood, but at present scientists believe AIDS screening tests have successfully purified the supply of donated blood.  Theoretically, ophthalmologists and others who may have repeated contact with tears may be at risk if the teardrops come into direct contact with a break in the skin.
