 Clinton Meets With Arafat as Palestinians And Israelis Express Doubts on an Accord   By By Neil King Jr. and Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2001  An administration official said Mr. [Yasser Arafat] and Mr. [Clinton] spent much of the first two-hour session talking about how to contain a recent wave of bloodshed in Israel and the Palestinian territories; the second round of talks ended late last night. The official said the U.S. didn't expect an immediate yes or no from Mr. Arafat on the president's proposals, "but we have to have it very soon."  Other aides to Mr. Arafat, though, said he agreed to come to Washington only under pressure from the White House. Hani al-Hassan, an Arafat adviser, told the pan-Arab television station al-Jazeera that President Clinton "got very angry" when the Palestinians outlined their discontent with the U.S. proposals last week. "Then he threatened to blame Arafat for the breakdown in talks," Mr. al-Hassan said.  In their critique released yesterday, the Palestinian negotiators said the Clinton proposal responded "to Israeli demands while neglecting the basic Palestinian need: a viable state." The plan, they said, would create a scattered Palestinian state, cut three ways by Israeli-only highways; would give Palestinians control over only a few chunks of Jerusalem; and wouldn't acknowledge the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.
