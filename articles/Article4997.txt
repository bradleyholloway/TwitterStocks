 Rice Industry Launches a Branchild As Rival to Increasingly Popular Oats   By By Alecia Swasy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1989  The rice industry is launching a marketing campaign to promote the health benefits of rice bran over its increasingly popular rival: oat bran.  Early tests suggest that, like oat bran, rice bran can lower cholesterol levels in the blood. That's welcome news for rice growers, who say they have a ready supply of the bran. In contrast, oat bran is in demand for everything from cereals and muffins to pasta and potato chips, and supplies are running short.  Already, food companies and bakeries, eager to market another line of bran goods to health-conscious consumers, are testing rice bran in products. Kellogg Co. is expected to introduce a cereal with rice bran, although the company declines comment. Kellogg has other rice cereals, such as Rice Krispies, but those are milled rice, which doesn't have the bran layer.
