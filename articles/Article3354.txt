 SmartMoney Fund Screen / Global Equity Funds   By Smith, Dawn, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2004  Don't confuse global funds with international funds, which typically invest 90% or more of their portfolios overseas. Investment-research firm Lipper Inc. identifies global funds as those that invest 25% to 90% of their assets outside the U.S., with the remaining balance invested domestically. Right now, the average global fund invests approximately 52% of its assets in U.S. stocks, according to Lipper. The average global fund sports a three-year annualized return of 6.3%, as of Dec. 7 Lipper data, while international and U.S. domestic-equity funds have gains of 9.7% and 3.6%, respectively.
