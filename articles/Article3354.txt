 ADC Telecommunications Agrees to Buy Broadband Access Systems in Stock Deal   By By Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  ADC makes a variety of big-ticket hardware items used by phone companies, particularly products for bringing a signal the "last mile" into homes or small businesses. Broadband, Westborough, Mass., makes Internet-access equipment that communications providers use to deliver high-speed Internet and voice services.  Trying to capitalize on that market, ADC has been on a protracted buying spree, making more than two dozen purchases since 1995. The company acquired Sweden's Altitun for about $960.5 million in May, and in February it purchased PairGain Technologies Inc. for stock valued at $1.51 billion.
