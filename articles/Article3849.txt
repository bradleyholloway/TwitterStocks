 These Services Search Beyond the Internet And Offer New Formats   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2004  I've been testing four of these new search products -- Google's new Desktop Search, Amazon's A9 search site, Yahoo's My Yahoo Search and a service named Clusty from a small company called Vivisimo. I like them all, though whether they work for you will depend a lot on your personal working style and the way you want your information served up.  At desktop.google.com, the industry leader provides a free desktop search program you can download and install. The program runs in the background, indexing most of the data on your hard disk. It also adds a "Desktop" category to the Google search page, and adds desktop search results to Google's Web search results page.  In my Fenway Park test search, Clusty reported 174,762 hits, but grouped the top 222 results into 33 clusters. These included "History of Fenway Park," "Green Monster" and "Travel, Boston."
