The data seemed to suggest "investors had the best of both worlds for the moment with economic growth and little inflation," he said.  Toll Brothers rose 96 cents, or 3%, to $32.87. The Horsham, Pa., home builder's fiscal fourth-quarter net income declined, but the company said it is seeing signs of an end to the slowdown in certain housing markets. Other stocks in the housing sector also climbed. Ryland Group rose 2.12, or 4%, to 54.68, and Pulte Homes added 62 cents, or 1.9%, to 33.97.  Dow industrial Walt Disney gained 76 cents, or 2.3%, to 34.20.
