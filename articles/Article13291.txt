 Cash Becomes A Hot Investment; Stock Volatility, Rising Rates Prompt Investors To Shift Into Money-Market Funds and CDs   By Kim, Jane J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2006  Banks, meanwhile, have been boosting yields on short-term CDs to their highest levels in half a decade. VirtualBank, an online bank in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., is paying 5.02% on a three-month CD with a minimum investment of $10,000. That compares with the national average of 0.78% on a money-market bank account and 2.74% on a three-month CD, says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.  Brokerage firms are beginning to tout their cash accounts. Merrill Lynch is offering a promotional six-month CD paying 5.32% and a three- month CD paying 5.09%. Within the next month, Charles Schwab Corp. plans to kick off a direct-mail marketing campaign to promote the firm's cash products. In recent months, the company has been aggressively promoting its CDs and money-market funds on its Web site and through its financial consultants, a company spokeswoman says. Customers' total cash balances in CDs were up 88% at the end of April from year-ago levels. Last year E*Trade Financial Corp. launched a "cash optimizer" tool that helps investors locate higher-yielding cash investments.  For investors, the rising yields on money-market funds give them a more-liquid product than CDs. CD investors typically pay a penalty for making withdrawals before a CD's term expires, while investors can withdraw cash from money-market funds at any time without penalties. Yields on the funds also respond more quickly to changes in interest rates. If the Fed raises short-term rates later this month, many of the retail money-market mutual funds with low expenses -- such as those offered by TIAA-CREF and Vanguard Group -- are likely to cross 5% within weeks, says Mr. [Peter Crane] of Money Fund Intelligence.
