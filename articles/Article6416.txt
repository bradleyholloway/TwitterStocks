 E-Commerce (A Special Report): Overview --- The Giants: Amazon.com and eBay have survived the shakeout relatively well; What's their secret?   By By Nick Wingfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2001  Like Amazon, eBay sought to make all of its users happier with better product selection. Although the company is still widely perceived as an exchange for Pez dispensers and other tchotchkes, eBay moved into less whimsical product categories in the past year, launching a specialty site for buying and selling automobiles. The company also started the Business Exchange, where small businesses can buy and sell everything from tractors to X-ray equipment. Many of eBay's new categories simply formalize and simplify trading that was already going on amid the general hubbub of eBay.  Sellers, meanwhile, have a host of new services that make chores like posting photographs on eBay easier. Through an arrangement with Internet Pictures Corp., eBay improved its Picture Services offering, which lets sellers jazz up their auctions with images of merchandise. [Ebay] has long provided sellers hyperlinks to a Web- hosting service that stores the images that appear on their eBay auctions. More recently, though, the company's deal with Internet Pictures let sellers set up their images without leaving the eBay site, eliminating several extra steps in the auction process.  In fact, the businesses of eBay and Amazon are, in some ways, beginning to look more and more alike. Amazon, in addition to the used products on its Marketplace feature, has added auctions to its site. Meanwhile, eBay, through Half.com, has started to resemble a super-size used-book, video and music store. A telling clue to the Half.com business lies in the tongue-in-cheek company name Half.com's founders considered using at one point: Ebazon.
