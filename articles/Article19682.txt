 Leading the News: WorldCom's Ebbers Enters Plea Of Not Guilty in Oklahoma Case   By Dennis K. Berman and Almar Latour, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2003  Federal prosecutors are worried about the Oklahoma case impeding their investigation. Yesterday, James Comey, the Manhattan U.S. attorney, said at an unrelated news conference that his office was studying the law to determine if it would seek to stay Oklahoma's case against the former WorldCom executives. "I don't know what we'll do, if anything. It's something we're watching," he said. Mr. Comey added that his office hasn't spoken with the Oklahoma attorney general and he reiterated his earlier statement that the office has had a record of cooperating with state attorneys general.  Mr. [Drew Edmondson] sounded a more cooperative note than previously, saying in an interview in his office after the hearing that he, too, would like to work with Mr. Comey and didn't want to harm his investigation. Mr. Edmondson said, for instance, he may consider waiting until after Mr. [Scott Sullivan]'s trial scheduled for early next year before interviewing witnesses. Mr. Edmondson reiterated his confidence that he can win a case against Mr. [Bernard Ebbers] and others. He said, "I have a couple of aces. Our law isn't terribly complicated and our juries are good at spotting criminals."
