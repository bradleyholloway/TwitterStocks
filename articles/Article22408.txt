 Field Trip: UNC Faculty Get a Lesson in N. Carolina   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1998  ON THE ROAD TO THE OUTER BANKS, N.C. -- For Jerry Lucido, admissions director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, it was a lighthearted remark that held a pointed lesson.  The next day -- day two of a five-day, 1,200-mile tour of the state for 38 UNC-CH faculty and staff -- Mr. Lucido chuckles as he recounts the incident, which brought home how fierce competition is for admission to the university, where five students vie for each place in the freshman class.  For the mostly new faculty, it's a sweeping, and at times superficial, seminar on wheels, looking at the geography, history, culture and economics of North Carolina. Between hurried stops, the faculty members lecture each other on a range of topics, from the importance of tobacco farming in the state's economy to local politics. Evoking images of a school field trip to the state capitol, these summer travelers fetch Cokes from a cooler and pass bags of pretzels and M&Ms.
