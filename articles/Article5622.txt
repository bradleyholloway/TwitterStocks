 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Asra Q. Nomani, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1994  In a report released yesterday, the Independent Review Board, a panel charged with overseeing the controversy-ridden Teamsters union, concluded that Mr. Carey isn't linked surreptitiously with organized-crime figures in the Lucchese or Colombo families. The Justice Department has been investigating similar charges.  The Teamster leader's shop hailed the finding, declaring a victory over what it called a "bizarre smear campaign" by his opponents within the union. The board also checked whether Mr. Carey took a car and first-class tickets from a union local. Findings: He didn't. Still, opponents discard the board conclusions as a biased show of support for the union president.  When it comes to celebrity gossip, the Tonya-Nancy, Woody-Mia and Prince Charles-Princess Di contretemps don't even compare to the O.J. Simpson murder mystery. The Cut Above, an Albany, Ore., beauty salon and gossip center, brings in a television set for hairdressers and clients. In a motor-pool dispatch office in Fort Belvoir, Va., workers swap murder theories.
