 A Bank Bailout and Its Consequences   By By Rachel V. Laffer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  France is declaring success in one of Europe's biggest corporate bailouts ever: a series of efforts to save what was once Europe's largest commercial bank, Credit Lyonnais. Last month, at a board meeting of the mostly government-owned bank, Chairman Jean Peyrelevade reportedly said Credit Lyonnais is now in a "normal competitive position" and will be ready for privatization by 2000.  Even if that rosy prognosis is accurate, CL's recovery has come at a steep cost -- more than 120 billion francs ($20 billion, or about half of what Mexico received from the International Monetary Fund in 1995). How much French taxpayers will have to shell out to keep Credit Lyonnais afloat is difficult to estimate. It's harder still to set a price on the moral hazard involved when a state subsidizes irresponsible behavior by banks. Yet as the ultimate cost is being tabulated, the CL rescue does offer one clear benefit: a case study in how bailouts, whether of companies or countries, usually fail to fix, and often exacerbate, the underlying problems they are intended to solve.  The sins of CL's past management are well known in Europe. Reckless chairmen, operating with unchecked authority, made risky loans to corrupt businessmen, leading to losses estimated as high as $31.8 billion. Credit Lyonnais should have folded like other banks have after running deep into the red. But when its gargantuan losses first became known, the French government predictably decided the bank was too important to fail. Fortunately for both the politicians and the bankers, French banking law and French politics make bankruptcy almost impossible.
