 American Airlines Offers Extra Raises For Ground Union   By By Scott McCartney, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  American, the world's largest airline, has made the same offer to both its pilots and flight attendants. All three unions have until Monday afternoon to ratify tentative agreements to cut labor costs by $1.8 billion annually. Rejection by any one of four work groups -- pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and other ground workers -- would trigger a bankruptcy filing next week, American says.  In a letter last night to the Transport Workers Union, AMR Chairman and Chief Executive Donald Carty said the company agreed to "revisit" wage rates if it returns to solid financial footing before the contract runs out. If the tentative agreements are ratified, the company agreed with the TWU to add a "variable wage adjustment program," which would be triggered if AMR returns to its investment-grade credit rating held just before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Beginning in January 2006, the program would offer as much as 4.5% a year in bonus wages each year.
