 Microsoft to Split Into Four Major Groups   By By David Bank, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1999  The restructuring plan, the brainchild of Microsoft's president, Steve Ballmer, seeks to organize the company around the needs of broad groups of Microsoft customers, rather than around particular product lines and engineering efforts.  Separately, Microsoft said yesterday that product revenue in the current quarter will be $400 million below expectations, because of the need to provide coupons so buyers of its Office software can upgrade when the new version of the program comes out next quarter. The $400 million, however, will show up in next quarter's results. And Microsoft's chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, said the shortfall this quarter, equal to about eight cents a share in net income, is likely to be offset by investment gains from Microsoft's huge cash horde.  The main driver of the changes has been the need to fill the vacancy at the top of Microsoft's underperforming Interactive Media Group, which includes Microsoft Network and may be renamed the consumer division. Mr. Ballmer has overseen the division, which occupies a separate campus west of Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, Wash., since the resignation of Senior Vice President Pete Higgins in November. The company has sought to reach outside its ranks for an executive with broad media experience, and also discussed the job with Brad Silverberg, the programming whiz who has been on leave since 1997.
