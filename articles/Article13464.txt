 Qatar Drops Bid for Sainsbury   By Singer, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  Qatar's decision to back away from the Sainsbury deal, though, wasn't dictated by political concerns. Rather, the deal began to look too expensive. After making its approach in July and holding detailed talks with the board, Delta Two was granted access to the company's books Sept. 20, after the fund agreed, among other things, to increase its equity funding -- the amount of its own money in the deal -- by GBP 900 million to GBP 4.5 billion. Then late last month, Delta Two requested the additional GBP 500 million of equity from Qatar, bringing the total for the check the state would need to write to GBP 5 billion, the largest ever from the Middle East.
