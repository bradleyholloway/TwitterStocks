 Citicorp's Folly? How a Terrific Idea For Grocery Marketing Missed the Targets --- Point-of-Sale Unit Irritated Retailers and Shoppers, But Kept Spending Cash --- An Overoptimistic Executive   By By Fred R. Bleakley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1991  Impressed with the proposal, Mr. Braddock hired Mr. Saltzgaber in 1988 to take over the 40 staffers headquartered in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Saltzgaber thought big -- and spent big. According to people familiar with POS, the unit's budget was $10 million in 1987 and $17 million in 1988, but then jumped to $40 million in 1989 and $125 million in 1990. Mr. Saltzgaber had originally asked for $200 million in 1990. (Citicorp officials decline comment.)  When Mr. Saltzgaber joined POS, it was already working with customer identification programs at supermarkets in Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Denver and Richmond. He quickly championed a new program called Reward America. By awarding cash rebates monthly to customers buying a certain number of specific products, it had the advantage of combining the concept of electronic coupons with a frequent-shopper program, presumably strong incentives for shoppers to identify themselves. In addition, the cost of running Reward America was borne by the participating manufacturers, thus encouraging the likelihood, Citicorp thought, that more stores would get behind the program.  Mr. Shereck, who was the senior operating executive of the POS unit in 1987 and much of 1988, recalls disagreements he had with Mr. Saltzgaber over the pace of growth. "Jerry thought the business could be grown faster by spending more money. He said he had approval from Rick Braddock to spend $150 million over three years," says Mr. Shereck. (Mr. Saltzgaber denies saying that or having such authority, and says he had strict performance and budget reviews with Mr. Braddock every six months.)
