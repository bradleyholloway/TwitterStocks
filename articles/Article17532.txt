 Revlon Decides To Go Private For $1.77 Billion --- Buyout by Forstmann Little Calls for Sale of Assets Valued at $1.25 Billion   By By Daniel Hertzberg and Hank Gilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1985  Revlon Inc., in a move to foil hostile suitor Pantry Pride Inc., has decided to break itself up.  The moves are being made to counter a proposed $53-a-share, or $1.5 billion, bid from Pantry Pride, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based operator of supermarkets and retail stores, which has been aggressively pursuing Revlon since August. But it leaves room for Pantry Pride or another bidder to match or top the $56-a-share offer from Forstmann Little, a New York investment banking firm.  The plan is subject to approval by Revlon shareholders at a special meeting in late November. Revlon said that the total value of the breakup, based on the payments to Revlon shareholders and Revlon debt to be assumed or refinanced, is about $3 billion.
