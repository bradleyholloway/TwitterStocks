 Industrials End Higher; Nasdaq Slips   By By Peter A. Mckay, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2001  "What we're seeing is a reversal of the reversal in January," Mr. [Jon Brorson] said. Last month, techs bounced as nontech stocks struggled, "and now it seems like everyone's buying back the [nontech] stocks that got creamed. You feel like you're on a bungee cord."  Meanwhile, Wall Street weighed in with its review of the XFL pro-football league: Despite solid ratings for the spectacle that began over the weekend, shares of parent World Wrestling Federation Entertainment were sacked 7.2%, or $1.39, to $17.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. The reason: The stock had already run up 50% since late December ahead of the XFL launch. But there was also selling in response to scathing reviews from some sports columnists.
