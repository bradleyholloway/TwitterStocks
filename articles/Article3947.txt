 SmartMoney: Money Mistakes by Spouses   By Bradford, Stacey L, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2005  Here's some advice that any newlywed should heed: Don't let your spouse control the purse strings. If you do, you're going to be in a bad spot if the marriage ends.  Suppose your spouse's name is on the credit card and you're just an authorized user. If a separating spouse deletes you from that account and you fail to get your own card quickly, you might face high rates and a small credit line. Fair Isaac, a firm that helps generate consumer credit scores, says the credit bureaus won't figure a score for a person whose credit history is inactive six months or more.  Solution: Make sure you actively participate in planning -- and saving -- for retirement, even if it means stashing away less for your kids' college. If you work, save as much as you can in your company's retirement plan, or in an IRA. If you're not employed, contribute to a spousal IRA, which has an annual contribution cap of $4,000 in 2005.
