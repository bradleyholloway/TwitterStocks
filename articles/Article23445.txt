 Blueprints / Las Vegas   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2007  Among the neighborhoods poised for new development is downtown Las Vegas, which is already seeing the addition of several new residential towers. Construction is also set to begin in 2007 on the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute, a Frank Gehry-designed building that will include research and treatment facilities for memory-disorder diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. It will serve as an anchor in a mixed-use project called Union Park planned for 61 acres of a former rail yard near the existing downtown. Nearby, a 300,000-square-foot high-end office building that includes some retail space is slated to be completed by Molasky Group of Cos. this summer. Irwin Molasky, chairman of the Las Vegas-based real-estate development company, says the office building is already 95% preleased. He doesn't agree with analysts who predict a slower Las Vegas economy could be on the horizon. "When the rest of the world gets pneumonia, we might get the sniffles," says Mr. Molasky.
