 MarketWatch: Keeping Your Credit Rating Healthy   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2007  "The time to manage your credit is not when you're trying to put it to use," Mr. [Andy Jolls] says. "When you're trying to actually buy a house and close in, let's say, three weeks, there's not a lot you can do about your credit score in that time. But if you were to look at it several months out, there are things you can do."  "When someone with a very limited credit profile opens a different type of credit . . . because they've expanded the type of credit, that change can in fact improve their FICO score," Mr. [Craig Watts] says. "We don't recommend people open new accounts in hopes that this will raise their score, because it's relatively rare."  Almost always, "that's going to lower your score because you're opening new accounts more often than the average consumer is," Mr. Watts says. "The FICO score can't see the interest rates you're paying. It has no idea why you're opening new accounts. It can only see what the report shows and that is a more frequent pursuit of new credit than is typical."
