 BP's Carborundum Unit Thinks It Has The Stuff of Future Engines: Ceramics   By By Bill Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 11, 1988  British Petroleum Co.'s Carborundum Co. unit has scored a breakthrough in the race to develop ceramic car engines with the introduction of the first mass-produced ceramic engine part -- a water-pump seal ring.  Carborundum said it expects to manufacture about 2.5 million of its silicon-carbide rings this year, most for Volkswagen AG, the West German auto maker. The company said other car makers, including Daimler-Benz AG and General Motors Corp., are currently evaluating the ring, and that next year it expects to sell as many as four million rings manufactured at a new $7 million facility in West Germany.  Japan and the U.S. currently lead a host of nations and private consortia that are pushing hard to develop advanced ceramics technology. Ceramics is seen as an eventual replacement for not only hundreds of metallic car-engine parts but also for metallic and plastic implants in humans, such as artificial hips. Other important applications are seen in the electronics, aerospace and defense industries -- ceramic armor, for instance. A $170 million market in 1987, ceramics will grow into a $433 million industry by 1990 and a $1.16 billion industry by 1995, according to a recent survey by Norwalk, Conn.-based Business Communications Co.
