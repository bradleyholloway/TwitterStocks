 Uncertainty Is Certain Next Year; Schism Opens Over Interpreting The Flattening Yield Curve; A Lesson From the Mid-1990s   By Patterson, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2005  The debate is "a big tug of war," says Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at MS Howells, a Scottsdale, Ariz., brokerage firm. Mr. Reynolds agrees that the economy may slow in 2006, but that doesn't necessarily mean bad news for stocks. Slower growth could be a boon, he says, as investors lose their fear that a sharp downturn or meddlesome inflation is on the way. "Sometimes a moderate economy can actually extend the amount of time that the expansion can continue," Mr. Reynolds says.  James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, takes the opposite view. Even though the yield curve is flatter, he notes that long-term yields are still historically low, keeping mortgage-lending rates attractive. That means the housing market, and the economy, should remain strong next year, and the multiyear run by small-cap stocks -- which tend to thrive in a healthy economy because they have more room to grow than their large-cap brethren -- will continue. "If the yield curve doesn't slow the economy, you do not want to be in blue-chip large-cap defensive stocks; you want to be in the smaller caps," he says.  Skeptics say the situation a decade ago was much different than today. "The yield curve is flattening while oil prices are very high and the Fed is tightening," says Maxim Group's Mr. [Barry Ritholtz], who thinks the economy could slide into a recession at the end of 2006. "Those three things combined rarely have boded well for equities."
