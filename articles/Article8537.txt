 GOP is counting on Oklahoma's maverick spirit that supported Perot to deliver it key wins   By Davidson, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1994  The Republican Party is hoping that energized followers of Ross Perot in Oklahoma will help the party win key GOP victories in the Nov 8, 1994 congressional elections. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters who said they went with Perot in his presidential bid clearly showed a preference for Republicans in the current election. One potential beneficiary of the GOP push is Julius Caesar Watts, who is running to become only the second black Republican in the House.
