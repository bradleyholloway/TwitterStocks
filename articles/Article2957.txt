 More Ads Target Small Firms, but How Good Is Their Aim? --- Some Marketers Find the Indirect Approach to Entrepreneurs' Purse Strings Works Best   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2002  Financial advertising targeting small and medium-size companies more than tripled from 1996 to 2000, according to Competitrack Inc., a New York ad-monitoring concern. And ads for computers and telecommunications services also boomed. In the first nine months of 2001, however, print and television financial ads aimed at small business declined about 14% to $80 million from a peak of $93 million a year earlier, reflecting the soft economy, Competitrack says.  Though smaller than print advertising, TV ad spending aimed at smaller companies grew more swiftly in recent years. But some marketers question whether that makes much sense. Entrepreneurs don't spend much time in front of the TV, according to Warrillow & Co., a Toronto marketing-research firm. Warrillow estimates that the average U.S. entrepreneur watches 11.5 hours of TV a week, compared with 28 hours for the average consumer. Thus, TV ads, says John Warrillow, the firm's chief executive, are "questionable in small business." The growth in TV ads aimed at smaller companies, he says, represents "a lot of money in a consumer medium that is not well spent."  Another company that caught onto the indirect-sales approach is MBNA Corp. The Wilmington, Del., banking concern sells its credit cards through industry and professional associations rather than directly to small businesses or consumers in many cases. MBNA estimates that 67% of U.S. physicians and dentists and 47% of U.S. lawyers carry an MBNA credit card that they signed up for in response to mail solicitations.
