 GOP Leaders Press Wavering Moderates As House Is Set to Vote Today on Tax Cut   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1999  The House girded for a showdown vote today over the GOP's huge tax cut as Democrats wooed Silicon Valley with a proposal to make permanent a coveted tax credit supporting business research.  Republican leaders scrambled to shore up their 10-year, $792 billion bill. After trimming more than $70 billion from the original Ways and Means Committee package, they were confident of picking up votes among wavering GOP moderates.  Mr. (Michael) Castle is among two dozen or so GOP moderates who have lodged objections to the bill. The number of wayward Republicans has dwindled amid arm-twisting, but perhaps 10 to 12 remained opposed last night. "We don't get surpluses very often," said Rep. Connie Morella (R., Md.), who is leaning against the bill. She suggested greater attention be paid to other budget needs, including debt relief. "We'd like the comfort of knowing we've retired the debt."
