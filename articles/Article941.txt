 Levine May Be Barred From Paying Tax Bill With Illegal Profits   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1987  Dennis B. Levine, who settled insider-trading charges for $11.5 million, may yet have to pay the government additional money to meet his massive tax bill.  Barry R. Goldsmith, a Securities and Exchange Commission staff attorney, told a federal judge Friday that the SEC never intended that Mr. Levine should be allowed to pay his $8.5 million in unpaid taxes out of the illegal stock profits he surrendered last year. (With interest, that Levine fund currently holds almost $12 million.) Mr. Goldsmith said the Internal Revenue Service must stand in line with any other potential claimants to the money, such as allegedly defrauded investors.
