 Leading the News: Oracle Sweetens Bid for PeopleSoft; Offer Rises to $9.4 Billion, But Investors Remain Wary About Antitrust Problems   By Bank, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2004  Oracle's new offer came after PeopleSoft last week announced it will hold its annual shareholder meeting March 25, about two months earlier than usual. That schedule means that investors must buy PeopleSoft shares by today to be able to vote at the meeting, where the two companies will present rival slates for PeopleSoft's board. Oracle seeks to gain a majority on PeopleSoft's board in order to lift the company's "poison pill" antitakeover provisions.  Oracle reiterated that it will continue support for PeopleSoft's customers and products. The issue has become central to the takeover battle because of PeopleSoft's unusual "customer-assurance program," under which it has offered customers money-back guarantees in the event an acquirer reduces product support. The total potential liability under the program has increased to $1.55 billion. Oracle executives have said they don't believe their plans will trigger the rebates.  PeopleSoft's board also has agreed to spend another $200 million repurchasing the company's stock, after completing a $350 million buyback program last year. Such purchases both increase PeopleSoft's per-share earnings and limit the number of shares available for purchase by supporters of Oracle's bid.
