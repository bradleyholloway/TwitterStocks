 Corruption Stunts Growth in Ex-Soviet States --- Struggle In Kazakstan Is the Apparent Spark For U.S. Investigation   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Hugh Pope in Istanbul and David Cloud in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2000  "Swiss investigators in Geneva ran into a brick wall of internal opposition. Cantonal [provincial] authorities elsewhere have discretion to deny them access to `bank secrets,'" said a lawyer familiar with the matter. So the Geneva investigators decided to outflank cantonal authorities by triggering an official request for information from the U.S. The 18-page Justice Department request confirms that it was "spontaneous transmittals" of information from the Swiss investigators in February and April that gave U.S. authorities what they needed to pursue the case.  Supporters of Mr. Kazhegeldin said the $6 million eventually ended up in an account controlled by Mr. Kazhegeldin's son-in-law, but couldn't explain how or why. "Ironically, the money was used to support the efforts Mr. Kazhegeldin has undertaken to reform the government and his political movement," said Charles Both, a Washington lawyer representing Mr. Kazhegeldin's ambitions in the U.S. for the past two years.  The U.S. document says the Swiss had already "opened a criminal investigation for money laundering against, among others, Mr. Akezhan Kazhegeldin, former Prime Minister of Kazakstan." This inquiry was triggered by an official request from the government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev and former Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev. However, investigators found that funds were diverted more often to Messrs. Nazarbayev and Balgimbayev than to Mr. Kazhegeldin, according to the document.
