 Soybean-Oil Futures Sink to Two-Month Lows   By By Daniel Rosenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1999  Tomorrow, Malaysia will release palm-oil production data for April, and expectations are for a huge rise from the previous month. Palm oil competes with soybean oil in world export markets, so what hurts palm oil tends to hurt soy oil as well.  "Expectations are for a big increase in Malaysian palm-oil stocks and production, which would confirm that the El Nino episode, with its negative effect on production, is behind us," said Anne Frick, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York.  The El Nino weather phenomenon, which hit Southeast Asia nearly two years ago with a drought that crippled palm-oil output, was one factor behind soy oil's rally in 1997 and early 1998. Just one year ago, the nearby soy-oil contract traded above 28 cents a pound.
