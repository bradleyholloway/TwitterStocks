 Lawyers for Clinton Rebut Charges in a Detailed Brief --- Inconsistent Facts Are Cited In the Obstruction Case Involving Currie, Jordan   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1999  On the eve of House arguments before the Senate today, the White House filed its most detailed rebuttal yet of impeachment charges against President Clinton and warned it wants significant time to prepare if any witnesses are called.  House Republicans confirmed last night that they have already sought -- with no success thus far -- to interview former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as a potential witness. Prominent senators, including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R., Miss.), signaled a greater interest in live testimony, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R., Ill.) went so far as to say he may ask the Senate to "invite" the president himself. But the White House remained cool to any witnesses, and no decision will be made until opening arguments are heard and the Senate has questioned both sides.  In their filings with the Senate, House prosecutors say flatly, "the facts prove that the president directed Ms. (Betty) Currie to pick up the gifts" on Dec. 28, 1997. This conclusion rests on phone records of a one-minute call that day from Ms. Currie's cell phone to Ms. Lewinsky's residence. But the White House brief gives a detailed reconstruction of the day's events that suggests the call came 90 minutes after Ms. Lewinsky has testified the gift exchange took place.
