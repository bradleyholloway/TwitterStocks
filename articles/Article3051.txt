 Commodities Report: Amid Copper's Strong Gains, Short-Sellers Face Test of Wills   By By Allen Sykora OsterDowJones Commodity News, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  COCOA: Prices tumbled at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange as traders took profits after prices had made gains for seven consecutive days. "Prices are so high, and they've gone so far this week that once somebody walked in and tried to take profits . . . it was just a snowball effect," said Jack Scoville, analyst and vice president of Price Futures Group in Chicago. The December price dropped $49 to $2325 a metric ton, having earlier set a 17-year high of $2,405. There were no major developments in Ivory Coast, where an attempted coup that resulted in rebels taking control of a part of the country has stirred fears about disrupted supplies.  This week other short sellers will try to decide whether to stick to their guns or bail out as well, either capturing profits or avoiding potential losses if they had gone short only recently. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average was on its way to a 316.34-point gain Friday, December copper prices added 1.25 cents to close at 68.35 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The high for the session of 68.60 cents was the contract's highest since it was last at that level Sept. 23. December copper put together a two-day gain of 1.95 cents, also rising Thursday when the Dow gained 247.68 points.
