 What's News: Northwest   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2000  The numbers of Alaska's Copper River salmon are coming in low, even a bit worse than the state had predicted. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game projected a salmon harvest of 1.35 million sockeye and 61,000 chinook for the seasonal run. The actual harvest as of last week stood at 342,000 sockeye and 27,700 chinook. The season isn't over, but given the low runs, the commission has cut weekly commercial fishing periods in half, to two 12-hour openings.  Nike Inc. and Intel Corp. answered the call from Gov. John Kitzhaber for money to fight initiatives to cut taxes and limit spending. Each firm last week pledged to chip in $25,000 to the Committee for Our Oregon, a political action committee Mr. Kitzhaber formed to raise $2 million to defeat the fall ballot measures. Beaverton-based Nike lobbyist Brad Figel said the firm is willing to give "whatever it takes" to defeat the measures. Mike Salzgiver, the Hillsboro spokesman for Santa Clara-based Intel, said cuts in spending would "just add to the general downward spiral of the financial structure of the state."
