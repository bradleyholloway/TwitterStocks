 Arab Consensus Seems to Elude Jordan Summit --- But Moderates Hope to Set Stage for Isolating Iran, Building Links to Egypt   By By Geraldine Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1987  AMMAN, Jordan -- Even before leaders gather for the three-day Arab summit beginning here Sunday, there are signs the slender threads of Arab consensus may be fraying.  The conference was convened at the urging of moderate Arab states who hoped to forge a united front to isolate Iran and end its escalating seven-year war with Iraq. Syria's long-standing enmity with Iraq and its dependence on Iranian cooperation in Lebanon always threatened a joint position. Earlier this week, Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi said he would boycott the gathering, which he said was serving America by ganging up on Iran.  Most of the business of the Amman summit will be hidden well beneath the surface. But the gulf states and other Arab moderates hope a show of support for Iraq will prod Iran toward a cease-fire. A major part of that strategy is to use the summit to demonstrate that many nations are ready to re-embrace Egypt, the one credible military force in the region. Egypt has been shunned by most Arab states since it made peace with Israel eight years ago.
