 Entertainment: XM Set to Acquire WCS Wireless In Deal Valued at $200 Million   By McBride, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2005  In a move to expand and localize programming, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. said it agreed to acquire WCS Wireless LLC, which controls wireless spectrum adjacent to XM's in top markets.  The acquisition represents roughly 10 megahertz per market, which almost doubles XM's spectrum in markets including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. "There are very few pockets of adjacent, available spectrum that reach a large portion of the population," said XM Chairman Gary Parsons.
