 Fleet Financial Is Close to Agreement To Buy Sanwa Unit for $750 Million   By By Joseph B. Cahill and Jon G. Auerbach, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1998  The acquisition would significantly bolster Fleet's own commercial-finance unit, Fleet Capital Corp., adding about $6.4 billion to the $9 billion in assets the unit has under management. Chicago-based Sanwa Business Credit, which provides equipment leasing and secured lending to companies, also would allow Fleet Capital to expand beyond the Northeast and better insulate the business against regional economic downturns.  Equipment leasing has been growing in recent years as more companies choose to lease, rather than buy outright, everything form heavy equipment to computer software. Sanwa would bring to Fleet a strong high-tech business: The company leases computer networks, telecommunications equipment and high-tech manufacturing equipment. Fleet has strong leasing programs in rail-freight, trucking, airlines and manufacturing equipment.
