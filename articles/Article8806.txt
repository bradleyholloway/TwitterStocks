 Fiscal plan takes aim at big business, investors   By Schlesinger, Jacob M, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1997  To help the middle class and balance the government's books, the Clinton administration wants to put the squeeze on big business and investors. The five-year budget plan would raise $123.26 billion through 2002 by toughening numerous provisions of the tax code, and adding, increasing, extending or repackaging fees on government services. The targets range from limiting certain deductions for dividends to cutting tax breaks for mergers and acquisitions to establishing royalty charges for mining on public lands.
