Two years before its scheduled opening, the New York Convention Center formally booked its first convention and said its calendar through 1986 was more than 80 percent filled.  James Misnis, president-elect of the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute, signed a contract with Jerry Lowery, the convention center's executive director; Governor Carey, and Mayor Koch in a ceremony on the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building.  The convention center is going up on a 22-acre site from 34th to 39th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues. The machine manufacturers plan to use the entire 750,000 squarefoot facility for a five-day convention in 1986 and are committed to hold a convention there every four years until 2002.
