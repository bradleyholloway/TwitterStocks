 APEC Leaders Declare Support For WTO Talks   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2005  "We all agree that the Hong Kong ministerial [meeting] will be a critical step in achieving this goal," the draft says. "Yet, we are all seriously concerned that the current impasse in the negotiations may lead to a potential failure of the round."  APEC officials hope a strongly worded statement by their leaders will help revive the round. APEC represents more than a third of the world's population, about 60% of the global economy and nearly half of world trade.
