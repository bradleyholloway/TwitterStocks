 Hedge-Fund Bets Went Bust in April For European Firms   By Reilly, David, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2005  Man Group, the world's largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager, has been hit on two fronts. Its AHL funds unit, which uses futures contracts to game market trends, fell 3.1% in April and is now down 5.6% from the start of the year to May 9, according to regulatory filings on Tuesday for a benchmark fund in the unit. And the company's stock is down about 20% since the start of the year as a result of the poor performance of AHL and general worries about the hedge-fund sector. In London trading, Man's shares rose 1% to close at GBP 11.86 ($22.32). A spokesman for Man declined to comment.  So far, such losses don't match the dire rumors of hedge-fund blowups that have circulated in financial markets this week. But given the firms' size -- each manages more than $10 billion and ranks among the world's biggest hedge-fund managers -- the losses will add to investor angst over these lightly regulated investment pools. Hedge funds of all kinds in Europe and the U.S. saw just about every trading strategy stumble in April.
