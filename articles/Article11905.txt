 American Industrial Properties   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1994  American Industrial Properties REIT said that its largest shareholder, American Holdings Inc, failed to win enough votes at the REIT's Nov 21, 1994 annual meeting to oust its current trust managers. However, the managers, William H. Bricker and president and CEO Charles W. Wolcott, didn't get enough votes to be re-elected to the board, so they will serve as interim managers until 1995.
