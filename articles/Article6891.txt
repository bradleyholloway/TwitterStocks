 DaimlerChrysler Net Falls 63% Due Mainly to Mercedes Woes   By Power, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2005  For 2005, DaimlerChrysler forecast a rise in vehicle sales by its Mercedes, Chrysler and truck divisions. But it warned that operating profit would rise "slightly," in part because Mercedes's quality problems are likely to burden the division's bottom line again. The severe decline in Mercedes profit surprised even some longtime company watchers and provided the most striking demonstration yet of the reversal of fortunes at DaimlerChrysler's German and U.S. halves.  Mercedes, which in 2003 accounted for more than half of DaimlerChrysler's operating profit, generated less than 3% of the full company's operating profit in the last three months of the year and slightly less than 30% of DaimlerChrysler's full-year operating profit. In response to the falloff in Mercedes profit, DaimlerChrysler announced a wide-ranging program to raise the division's return on sales to 7% by 2007 from their present annual level of 3.4%.  Mercedes's other headache is the Smart unit. Many industry analysts say DaimlerChrysler would be better off selling or closing Smart, but doing so would be a retreat from Mr. [Jurgen Schrempp]'s strategy of building a global auto maker with a presence in all segments of the market. Selling or closing Smart "would be one of the best decisions they could make and would have an immediate effect on earnings," said Georg Sturzer, an analyst with HVB Corporates & Markets Research in Munich. "It's very difficult to increase the volumes for Smart."
