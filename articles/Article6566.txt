 PURSUITS; Education: Internships For Sale   By Gamerman, Ellen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2006  "Is the Bronxville School reasonably related to Reed Business activity? In retrospect, I would say no, and that I made a mistake," he says. "I'm certainly never going to do it again." He says Reed won't suffer this summer, though, since the winner of the internship is a talented graphic artist. "There's going to be an internal battle to see who gets this kid."  Though most of the auction promotional materials describe these experiences as "internships," some companies say that's an exaggeration. "This was not an internship, but a mentoring or shadowing program," says Lindsay Nadler, senior manager of human resources at film studio Miramax, where a "summer internship" recently sold for $3,000 at the Montclair Art Musuem's charity auction in New Jersey. The item promised a two-week stint that included shadowing the film company's new president, Daniel Battsek, who donated it.  In New York, the Bronxville School's auction catalog listed a one- week internship in JPMorgan's asset and wealth-management division, at an opening asking price of $500. But Mary Sedarat, a spokeswoman for the firm, says "it wasn't an internship, it was a job shadow," adding that "it's not unlike bring-your-daughters-to-work day."
