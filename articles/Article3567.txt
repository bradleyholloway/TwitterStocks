 Everything's Up Except (Thud) Stocks   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  "Many investors appear to be worried once again about the dollar's gyrations and the potential impact," says Tobias Levkovich, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Citigroup. "However, the moves have been relatively modest and, historically, the dollar alone does not seem to be a determining factor for stock-price direction."  "Certain industries, such as energy, drugs, technology, and industrials, have greater exposure to foreign markets and might benefit from currency-translation gains" if foreign currencies continue to rise in value, says Mr. Levkovich. "In contrast, retailing, utilities, hospitals and home builders" have much less to gain if the dollar falls.  Goldman Sachs Friday expressed caution about Urban Outfitters (URBN). Although shares of the retailer already are down about 30% since late last year, disappointing first-quarter earnings and a cautious tone about the outlook from the company "should keep [a] lid on the stock," says Margaret Mager, an analyst at Goldman. Customer "traffic is still soft. . .We believe estimates [for future earnings] remain at risk." Goldman Sachs is more upbeat on J.C. Penney (JCP), partly because it has done a good job of cutting costs.
