 By the Numbers: The Tennis Turf Factor   By By Allen Barra and Allen St. John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  How fluky is grass? Remember Goran Ivanisevic, last year's champ? The huge-serving Croatian had an ATP ranking so low (No. 125) that he couldn't even make it into the draw. He was forced to default a match a few month earlier because he'd broken his only three rackets -- on purpose. But as a former finalist, "The I Man" got a wild card. Living up to his career Turf Factor of .734, he then beat five top players in a row. Don't bother looking for him to be sipping tea at the All England Lawn Tennis Club when the 125-year-old event starts Monday: He's out awaiting shoulder surgery.  The men's top seed, Lleyton Hewitt, comes in as the world's No. 1 player. While his Turf Factor (.816) is amazing, don't go crowning him yet. History hasn't been kind to counterpunchers like Mr. Hewitt. In the past 20 years, only two baseliners -- Andre Agassi in 1992 and Jimmy Connors in 1982 -- were able to win at Wimbledon.  In the past two years, there has been just one player who has beaten either of the Williams sisters at Wimbledon: Jennifer Capriati, who beat Serena in the quarters last year. (Venus beat Serena in the semis in 2000.) But Ms. Capriati is hardly a Williams-killer. Her career record is 4-6 against Serena, who has won five straight since that Wimbledon loss last year. Against Venus, "J-Cap" is 0-4, including three losses last year.
