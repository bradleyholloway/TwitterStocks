 Real estate: Downsizings blindside office-building owners   By Pacelle, Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1993  Downsizing corporations are not only cutting jobs, they are also reducing the office space they use. IBM Corp has vacated 1.7 million square feet over the past several years, while First City Bancorp of Texas's decision to leave 900,000 square feet of office space contributed to an increase in the vacancy rate from 24.2% to 26.6% in Houston.
