MEMPHIS, June 27â€” Jerry Pate rolled in a six-foot birdie putt on the final hole today to complete a round of 66 and take a onestroke lead in the third round of the $300,000 Memphis Golf Classic.  Pate, a former United States Open champion who has not won for almost three seasons, completed 54 holes in 205, 11 under par on the 7,249-yard Colonial Country Club course. Peter Jacobsen was a shot back going into tomorrow's final round for a $54,000 first prize.  Jacobsen, playing in front of Pate, made no bogeys and shot a brilliant 64 - aided by a tip from Pate three days ago - and had the lead when he finished with a 206 total.  Pate regained a share of the lead with an 18-foot birdie putt on the 17th, then went in front with the closing birdie. Pate Is Confident  ''I'm going to win the tournament,'' Pate confided to friends last night. ''And when I do, it's been such a long, dry spell, I'm going to jump in the lake on 18 and swim across it.'' Pate has finished second eight times since his last victory, in the 1978 Southern Open.  Tom Kite, who has been 10th or better in 11 of 16 starts this season, had a 68 (no bogeys) and moved into third at 208, three shots back. Bruce Lietzke, a three-time winner this season, had a 67 that left him at 209.  David Thore, who needs to win $1,931 in this tournament to retain his PGA Tour playing rights, shot a 71 and was alone in fifth at 211. Curtis Strange and Jeff Mitchell, each of whom fell victim to a double bogey, were next at 212. Mitchell had a 74 and Strange shot a 73.  Lee Trevino, the defending champion and a three-time winner here, matched par 72 and had a 213 total, eight shots back and apparently out of the title chase.  Jacobsen, now in his fifth year of PGA Tour activity, scored his only pro victory last year in the Buick Open.  Illustrations: Photo of Jerry Pate
