 Stocks Rebound After Monday's Steep Drop --- Nasdaq Bounces Back Above 2000; S&P 500, Dow Industrials Gain   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, recouped only part of Monday's 4.32% decline, which had put the broad index in bear-market territory for the first time since 1987. A bear market most commonly is defined as a 20% drop from a high. Despite yesterday's rebound of 1.48%, or 17.50 points, to 1197.66, the S&P 500 remains firmly in bear territory, down 21.6% from the record of 1527.46 that it set almost a year ago, on March 24, 2000.  The buying was driven partly by investors who concluded that some battered tech stocks, such as semiconductor or personal-computer shares that have lost more than 60% of their value, are looking cheap. The Nasdaq composite, which is dominated by tech stocks, pushed up 4.75%, or 91.42 points, to 2014.80, erasing most but not all of Monday's 6.3% decline. The Nasdaq still is deep in what by some measures is its worst bear market ever, down 60% from last year's high.  After a day in which the major indexes posted sharp late-day gains, didn't succumb to profit-taking and closed on the day's highs, investors normally would be feeling more upbeat. But they have seen so many failed rallies over the past year that many traders were taking a show-me approach. At the moment, not only the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 but also the Russell 2000 small-stock index and the broad Wilshire 5000 index are in bear markets. That leaves the Dow industrials and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index as rare examples of market indexes that aren't in bear markets. Just as the most common definition calls for a 20% drop from a high to put an index in a bear market, it calls for a 20% rise from a low for the bear market to be over. Even if Monday marked a low, investors won't be sure the bear market is over for some time.
