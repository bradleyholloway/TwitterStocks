 Rising Yields And Oil Hold Stocks in Check   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  With the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index both nearing the 4 1/2-year highs hit earlier this year, investors turned cautious. The Dow industrials fell 0.32 point, virtually unchanged, to finish at 11076.02. That is up 3.3% for the year, about 61 points short of the 4 1/2-year high of 11137.17 hit last month.  "There seem to be more negatives around than positives. Interest rates could be going higher. Oil was up," said Bob Basel, senior trader at Citigroup's New York brokerage arm.  Outside the U.S., stocks rose in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 1.22%, or 2.53 points, to 209.43.
