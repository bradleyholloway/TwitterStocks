 Mutual Funds Managed Investing: All That Glittered in 3rd Period Was Gold   By By Pamela Sebastian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1986  The average general equity fund fell 8.40%, steeper than the 6.97% decline in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index with dividends reinvested, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Taking specialized funds into account, the average decline softened to 5.94%.  Precious metals prices soared in the quarter as unrest in South Africa raised the specter of shortages among speculators and users. The metal turmoil, along with a weaker dollar and some inklings of awakening inflation, helped push up gold funds an average 28.69%. Gold funds' fortunes often run in different cycles than stock funds, and they haven't been in the top slot since the first quarter of 1985.  Among the general equity funds, the steepest drops were in capital appreciation and small company growth funds. Equity income and growth and income funds lost less ground than the overall market. Lipper measures 547 general equity funds, 174 specialized equity funds and 334 fixed-income, income and balanced funds.
