 House Approves Oil-Spill Legislation For Prevention, Cleanup and Liability   By By Glenn Hall, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1989  The House approved comprehensive oil-spill legislation intended to prevent accidents, improve cleanup efforts and make sure tanker owners and oil companies responsible for spills are held liable.  The measure, passed 375-5, would require all new tankers, foreign or domestic, operating in U.S. waters to be built with double hulls, but also would set stiff standards for proving negligence in case of a spill.  The Senate is likely to clash with the House on the unconditional requirement for double hulls. A Senate oil-spill measure, passed in August, would give the secretary of transportation authority to determine the necessity of double-hull requirements. Under the House bill, all tankers used in U.S. waters would be required to have double bottoms after seven years and complete double hulls after 15 years.
