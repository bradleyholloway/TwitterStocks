 Product Launches Cut BMW Profit; Better 2004 Seen   By Reiter, Chris, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2004  The German maker of BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brand cars said full- year net profit fell 3.5% to 1.95 billion euros ($2.39 billion), or 2.89 euros a share, from 2.02 billion euros, or 3 euros a share. The company took a 110 million charge to build up reserves for early- retirement programs.  BMW expects the launches this year of the 6 series luxury coupe, X3 sport-utility vehicle, and a convertible version of the Mini to boost sales and earnings in 2004. However, results are off to a slow start: Car sales in the first two months fell 1.6% from a year earlier, burdened by renovation work at its Munich plant, which shut down production from late December through the end of January.  The costs of BMW's product offensive burdened the auto division's 2003 pretax profit, which fell 4.2% to 2.76 billion euros.
