 BT's Earnings In Second Period Rose on MCI Sale   By By Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1998  Company officials, however, issued a mild warning about Britain's slowing economy. "We are starting to see the slowdown now in growth, although it's not going to be a blood bath," said Sir Peter Bonfield, chief executive of BT. If the economy were to deteriorate significantly, businesses and residential consumers could spend less on phone, data and Internet services. The international calling business would be especially vulnerable.  BT's latest results show a particularly healthy balance sheet. Its net debt is 526 million, and, including the MCI windfall, its cash position is 9.18 billion. The strong financials had raised expectations that BT might announce a share buyback. But BT officials played down the possibility.
