 Notable New Movies   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  Taken on its own, "Mickey Blue Eyes" is an amusing movie, although you'll probably be embarrassed that you laughed at parts of it. Hugh Grant, an Englishman who runs a New York auction house, falls in love with the daughter of a Mafia boss (Jeanne Tripplehorn). She doesn't want him to get involved in the family business, and he promises he won't, but before you can say fuggedaboudit, he's out by the river, burying a body with her well-intentioned dad. That's James Caan, who played a much more terrifying, and better-dressed, gangster in "The Godfather" in 1972.  The movie's best laughs come at the expense of Mr. Grant, who does a fine job of portraying himself as a dork. He has floppy hair. He's winded by the sucker punches of a paunchy doorman. And in one sequence, he tries to distract his girlfriend by doing a really funny -- and really unsexy -- striptease in his office. Mr. Caan is also great fun to watch as he hams it up, trying to teach Mr. Grant how to talk like a Mafioso. If you can buy into the lovable mobster premise, you'll probably enjoy this one.
