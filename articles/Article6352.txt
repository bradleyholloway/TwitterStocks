 The Parent Trap   By By Nancy Ann Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 2000  "The role reversal is absolutely weird," says Ms. O'[Reilly], who agonized for months over whether to accept the gift. Even after the trip was booked, she couldn't bring herself to acknowledge it. "My standard answer was, `We'll see.'"  "It wasn't 10 years ago that my mom was making me sweaters," says Ms. O'Reilly's son, Greg Durst, who is based in Johannesburg and will be traveling with his mother. "That I can turn around now and offer her a trip to Africa, I think that seems a little premature for her." His mom concurs: "Am I pleased that he is able to do it? I guess I am."  Consider Scott Blum, 36. The Internet entrepeneur is moving his parents from a modest two-bedroom house in Mission Viejo, Calif., to a much larger place with an ocean view. He has also bought new cars for his mother and mother-in-law. "They're your parents and you love them and you want them to have the best life possible," says Mr. Blum. His father, Bill, a retired manager for Hewlett-Packard, isn't agonizing over the generosity. "I love it," says Mr. Blum, 66. "I provided very well for him for the first 25 or 30 years. Hopefully, he'll provide for me for my last 25 or 30 years."
