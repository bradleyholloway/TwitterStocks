 Small Gulf Producers Miss Windfall   By Gonzalez, Angel, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2005  "The cost structure in the Gulf of Mexico is clearly going to ratchet up," said Dan Pickering, of Houston-based Pickering Energy Partners. "For the smaller players it's going to be a more challenging place to do business -- and it's going to result in fewer smaller players in the Gulf of Mexico."  Houston Exploration Co. Chief Executive William G. Hargett said during a recent conference call that giving up its sea-legs will make it easier to control spending and bring "far fewer surprises". The company, originally a Gulf offshore producer, will concentrate its efforts in Texas and in the Rocky Mountains. "Our production and the company growth will be more stable and consistent," Mr. Hargett said.  The Gulf of Mexico has good returns, but high investment requirements and wells decline rapidly, said Mr. Pickering. "It's a treadmill," he said. "Wall Street is looking for production growth, and production growth in the shallow Gulf is tough."
