 Better Off? Depends --- Mayor Says City Has Improved in 4 years; Data Are Mixed   By Athavaley, Anjali; De Avila, Joseph; Fox, Alison, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2012  A national debate took a local twist Tuesday when Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on behalf of New Yorkers on a familiar presidential campaign question: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" "Certainly we can say in New York City, and that's the only place I am an expert on, things are better than four years ago," the mayor said, answering a question at a news conference. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, and Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to be sold to Bank of America Corp. "From a standpoint of relative stability and being able to invest and think about the future in a more definitive way, the business community is much better off from four years ago, particularly the financial industry," said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group.
