 H-P, Microsoft, Intel Help Give Strong Boost to Forgotten Dow   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  On any other day, a 150-point-plus gain would give the Dow Jones Industrial Average the spotlight. But with the Nasdaq Composite Index closing above 5000 for the first time, the Dow got left in the shadows.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 154.20, or 1.56%, and ended at 10010.73, got its biggest contributions from its technology components. Hewlett-Packard added 11 to 151 7/8; Microsoft gained 4 7/16 to 100; and Intel gained 3 7/16 to 118 3/8. Together, those three stocks accounted for 93.69 points of the industrial average's rise.  Contrast that with the way investors have reacted to developments in the construction of some of these business-to-business Internet-based exchange systems. I2 Technologies, one of the makers of hot software used in Internet businesses, which gained 13% Wednesday after International Business Machines said it would take an equity stake, increased 30 1/4 to 220 7/8, setting another closing high.
