Switching from the world of what she calls ''serious dance'' to being a star of the Broadway musical ''Sophisticated Ladies'' has been an experience filled with trauma, according to Judith Jamison.  ''There are lots of different rules here,'' said Miss Jamison, long a star with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Company.  ''The principal one seems to be, 'Do unto others before they do unto you.' ''  Interviewed in the August issue of Ballet News magazine, Miss Jamison said: ''A lot of people here have smiles on their faces, then cut your throat the minute your back is turned. Broadway, unlike serious dance, is not about esthetics.''  Of her fellow performers in ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' the dancer said: ''Upstaging seems to be accepted as part of life here. You come out on a Broadway stage and begin doing your act, and all of a sudden you look around and someone upstage is waving their arms madly and jumping up and down. Things like that are inconceivable in the world of serious dance.''  Miss Jamison said she had been appalled to learn that she had to take orders from ''a person called the stage manager.'' ''Now I don't mind being corrected by someone whose professional opinion I respect,'' she said, ''but not by a stage manager. How can a layman tell me how to dance? When I get onstage, I always do what I want to anyway.''  However, Broadway has had its compensations, she said. ''I could never afford a house in the country, and I always wanted one,'' she said. She is now looking for one.  Illustrations: Photo of Judith Jamison
