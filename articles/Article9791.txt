 As Oil Demand Surges, Saudis Offer to Boost Output; Rare Move Aims to Head Off Cuts, Backlash From Buyers; Meeting With Bush Looms   By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2005  Indeed, the Saudis could be moving to head off a global backlash if prices continue to rise. Consumers looking at surging prices for gasoline and heating oil often don't distinguish between the Saudis and OPEC members that export the crude and the companies that refine and sell it. By offering to produce to the limit, the Saudis are sending a signal that they shouldn't be blamed if oil companies and refiners don't buy the crude, or if prices rise because the global refining system can't process more crude.  Saudi Arabia has rendered such action moot. "Right now, Saudi Arabia is meeting customers' needs, whatever they want," said one senior OPEC official familiar with Saudi oil policy. "For OPEC and for Saudi Arabia, from now on, there are no [supply] constraints," he said. Another increase in the cartel's output limit would be nothing more than "symbolic," he said.  In offering to produce all of the oil it can now, Saudi Arabia is taking a policy U-turn by making clear it wants consumers to fatten inventories. Since 1999, a Saudi-led OPEC has made sure that inventories in customers' hands don't build to such levels that they threaten the cartel's influence.
