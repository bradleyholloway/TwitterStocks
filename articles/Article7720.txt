 CFTC Report on Major Market Index Spurs New Questions on Its Oct. 20 Surge   By By James B. Stewart and Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1988  Separately, a congressional committee said it is investigating allegations that the CFTC, in reaching its conclusion, relied on MMI-contract trading data that was incorrect or doctored before it was submitted to the CFTC.  Data released by the CFTC on Monday confirm that the MMI futures contract turned sharply higher at a critical juncture on Oct. 20, the day after the Black Monday stock-market crash, at a time when trading in many major stocks had halted and the New York Stock Exchange was close to closing. The rise in the MMI contract, first reported in this newspaper, occurred when the index was the only stock index still trading.  The new CFTC data, a minute-by-minute chronology of trading in the MMI contract, were released as an appendix to the commission's report issued Monday. The report, which examined the behavior of the MMI on "Terrible Tuesday," concluded that fundamental factors caused the sudden rise in the MMI contract before noon CDT Oct. 20.
