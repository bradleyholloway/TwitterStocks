 U.S. Officials Make Arrests in 12 Cities For Drug Smuggling   By By Gary Fields, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 2002  The arrests make a total of 125 since April in connection with two alleged rings based in Chicago and Detroit. Authorities believe the rings were responsible for trying to bring millions of over-the-counter tablets of the decongestant into the country from Canada. Once in the U.S., the tablets were delivered to illegal laboratories in California, where they were used to make methamphetamine.  The smugglers made bulk purchases of the tablets in Canada, where the regulations on such purchases aren't as stringent as in the U.S. Since the operation began, U.S. law enforcement seized about 30 tons of pseudoephedrine, enough to produce about 37,000 pounds of methamphetamine, Mr. [Asa Hutchinson] said.  Pseudoephedrine smuggling and the outflow of money to the Middle East has been a concern for federal law enforcement since 2000, when federal agents arrested 140 people across the U.S., including eight ringleaders who came from Jordan, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
