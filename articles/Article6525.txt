 Time Inc. Plans Salty, Secretive Web 'Magazine'   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2006  Office Pirates is a way for the Time Warner Inc. division to reach out to young men, reflecting the sluggish ad-page performance of Time Inc.'s men's titles, such as Sports Illustrated and Fortune, compared with the relative strength of its women's magazines like Real Simple and InStyle. In addition, Ann S. Moore, Time Inc.'s chief executive, has said it is critical that her division raise its profile on the Internet, which is attracting an increasing share of ad revenue.  Leading the project is Mark Golin, the editor credited with making Maxim magazine a success in the late 1990s with a beer-and-babes formula imported from the United Kingdom. Mr. Golin's humor isn't highbrow, but many in the publishing industry agree it's sharp, and the magazine has captured legions of young men whom advertisers covet.  Web sites like Office Pirates offer a new "prime-time" slot for advertisers. Ads traditionally reached the general public after the workday, but the Internet has changed that. Now, the typical 9-to-5 office hours are seen as "very, very vital ground," says Todd Copilevitz, a Dallas-based digital-advertising consultant. That's when people email jokes or a piece of news to friends, or might print a coupon from the Web during a morning coffee break and use it later at a nearby retailer or eatery. Office Pirates likely will be aimed at workers in their offices.
