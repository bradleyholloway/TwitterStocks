 Business Brief -- FIRST UNION CORP.: Deal Is Reached to Buy Forum Capital Markets   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  First Union Corp. agreed to purchase convertible securities firm Forum Capital Markets LLC for an undisclosed amount. Officials at First Union, Charlotte, N.C., said the acquisition of Forum, a boutique firm in Old Greenwich, Conn., gives the banking company an entry into the sizzling convertible-securities market. Convertible securities are interest-paying securities that can be converted into company stock at a later date at a designated price. Forum in August hired an investment firm to assist it in either making an acquisition or selling itself. The firm handled just one convertible-securities deal in 1999 and was being shut out because of its small size, said Forum President Hal Purkey. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter. Forum's 30 employees are to be retained.
