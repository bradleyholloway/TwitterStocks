News Analysis  The energy agenda that Governor Cuomo offered on Wednesday was intended to send a message of hope to the state's business leaders, according to the Governor's aides.  Mr. Cuomo, they say, wants businesses in the state to know he is seeking solutions to the energy problems that make it difficult for them to operate in New York. As such, Mr. Cuomo sought attention for the broad outline rather than the specific details of his plans when he turned Wednesday into energy day at the State Capitol.  The Governor called legislative leaders to a meeting, released a thick packet of documents and held a full- dress briefing for reporters to hear from him and a group of his energy experts.  Getting People Involved  The Governor stressed that the focus should be put on the big picture. ''The important thing was to get involved,'' Mr. Cuomo said at the briefing. ''That's the important decision being made.''  The main reason for this decision, according to Mr. Cuomo's staff, is that business leaders around the state have been increasingly expressing concern about the troubles facing at least some New York utilities and the threat of big rate increases.  Indeed, business lobbyists say power - its cost and its reliable availability - is the most important issue facing the state government this year. Mr. Cuomo has signaled that he agrees.  ''Uncertainty is very high in people's minds,'' Michael J. Del Giudice, Mr. Cuomo's secretary, said. ''When you have the 49 other states attracting New York State's business it's important to deal with the perception. The idea is we have a rational agenda to calm the sense of uncertainty. That was an important message for us to get out.''  This perception of uncertainty comes from a variety of problem areas, some solely a result of outside forces and others contributed to by Mr. Cuomo. Major Areas of Concern  Business leaders, legislators and the Governor's own aides cite these key elements:  - Shoreham cost overruns. The Long Island Lighting Company has been severely strained by overruns of more than $3.5 billion in building its Shoreham nuclear plant. The company says that unless it gets outside help it will be out of cash by May, before the reactor is ready to operate. A panel appointed by Mr. Cuomo found that electric rates on Long Island were likely to double within five years whether Shoreham operated or not.  - Expiring hydropower contracts. Long-term contracts for the supply of inexpensive power from state-owned hydroelectric dams expire next year. The power is by far the cheapest in the state and permits the profitable operation of upstate industries that would otherwise be uneconomical. But with the contracts expiring, downstate consumers of expensive oil-generated electricity are casting envious eyes at hydropower supplies. In addition, Canada has recently increased the amount of hydropower that it is ready to sell to the United States, but a transmission network will have to be built.  - Overruns at Nine Mile Point 2. The nuclear reactor at Scriba, N.Y., is 1,000 percent over budget, and one of the partners, Lilco, says it can no longer afford the payments owed on its share. The other four partners serve the Hudson Valley and upstate areas. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported early this week that there were serious construction problems at the plant, which is scheduled to go into service at the end of 1986. Critics say the plant is uneconomical and its power is not needed. A Comprehensive Solution  Mr. Cuomo's point on Wednesday was that the solution to each of these problems affects the others. For example, Shoreham-induced rate increases can be held down on Long Island by shipping more cheap hydropower to the area. But if too much is taken, rates will rise upstate.  The mission that the Governor has set for himself and legislative leaders is to produce a comprehensive solution to all of these probelms and have it enacted by the Legislature before the summer recess.  Mr. Cuomo presented a six-page list of items - some specific, some general. Some were firm proposals, others were calls for consideration or more study.  Approaching the issue broadly will be complex and will require considerable leadership from the Governor, according to energy lobbyists and legislators. And Political Opportunities  But it provides political opportunities for him, too.  For one thing, business groups were beginning to feel that he was unwilling to come to grips with the problem of whether Shoreham should open or not.  Now he is able to say this is not even the issue. The issue is how to hold down power costs, he says, and that is what he is working on.  How well Mr. Cuomo is getting out his message of reassurance is not yet clear. The reaction from legislatrive leaders runs from tepid to cold. They all say that on the three big issues Mr. Cuomo has not yet proposed specific solutions.  ''He gave us some pads here with looseleaf but on most of the key issues the pages are blank,'' said the State Senate's majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton.  All of the leaders, Democrats and Republicans, said they agreed with Mr. Cuomo's overall approach, and that no legislation on any piece of the energy puzzle would move until the Governor offered an overall plan.  Business lobbyists said they were pleased that Mr. Cuomo was calling attention to the issue, but they still wanted to see his specific plans.  ''The decisions made this year will impact New York for the rest of the century,'' said Edward Reinfurt, vice president of the state's Business Council. ''That is, assuming the decisions are made.''
