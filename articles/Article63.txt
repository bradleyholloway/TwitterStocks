 Viewpoint: Students See the Light of Peace in Jesse Jackson's Rainbow   By By Michael Gartner, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1988  My daughter has come new to politics, and she is naive. But she and her friends took a real interest in the Iowa caucuses -- they'll be 18 by Election Day and thus were eligible to participate -- and their views are typical. Peace and caring appeal to high schoolers, and Jesse Jackson is the one candidate who talks to students in words and images they understand -- and believe.  All candidates talk about peace and caring, but students believe the Rev. Jackson means it. So did the farmers in Iowa. So did a 10th of the voting Democrats in New Hampshire. So do vast numbers of blacks and whites in the South. The people are listening to Jesse Jackson, so the politicians will have to, too. That's the importance of the Jackson rainbow.  "High-school kids are hungry for the message of peace," says Colman McCarthy, founder and director of the Center for Teaching Peace in Washington, and a columnist for the Washington Post. ("I'm an advocate, and I believe in advocacy journalism.") He believes today's wars -- Mr. McCarthy counts 41 -- won't end until we elect tomorrow's leaders. And tomorrow's leaders are today's students.
