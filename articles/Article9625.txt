 SmartMoney: Beyond December's Games   By Bradford, Stacey L, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2003  Every December, stock prices get yanked around by a couple of year- end rituals, and it's happening right now. Some stocks get buffeted by "tax selling" as investors shed their losers in order to harvest losses to cut next April's tax bill. Others get jolted by game-playing money managers who lock in this year's gains by selling stocks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, fervently hoping that no late-December rally arrives to make them look foolish.  For the rest of us, Wall Street's annual horse race doesn't matter. We just need enough money when we retire. So don't worry about whether year-end zigzags mean the pros know something you don't.  Not every Wall Street pundit is so upbeat. Merrill Lynch's Richard Bernstein continues to preach caution. He can't understand why investors aren't more worried about geopolitical risk. "Some claim that because one cannot quantify geopolitical risk...it should not be factored into investment strategies," he wrote recently. "We believe the opposite is true. It is the threats to performance that are not quantifiable that potentially pose the biggest risks because they are rarely factored into the strategy."
