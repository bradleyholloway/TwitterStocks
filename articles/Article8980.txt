 Household Is Giving Millions to Schools Dear to Somebody --- Firm Denies That Donations Are Linked to Departure Of Beneficial's Caspersen   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1998  The gift will be used by the Hightstown, N.J., private high school to build a new boathouse for its crew team and for two new dormitories. With Household's generosity, Peddie, enrollment 500 students, will probably be able to do all that and leave untouched its $165 million endowment.  Household was outspoken, however, on another development: It was off the hook for a $10 million two-year pay package it had agreed to give Finn M.W. Caspersen, the chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corp., which Household acquired last week for $8.37 billion in stock.  "He gets none of that," said Craig Streem, a Household spokesman. Mr. Caspersen, 56 years old, had been slated to stay on as Household chairman for a year and then a consultant for a year. But he recently decided not to, he said in an interview. "I didn't think being a titular chairman was of particular interest."
