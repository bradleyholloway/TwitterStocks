 SmartMoney: A Cheap Income Driver   By Hough, Jack, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2004  Searching through 8,200 companies, we selected those with yields greater than the S&P 500's median of 1.63%. Each had to have a payout percentage (dividends divided by earnings) of less than 75%, which increases the likelihood that it can maintain dividend payments. Price/earnings multiples had to be below industry medians, and price/earnings growth, or PEG, ratios (P/E divided by the long-term earnings-growth rate) had to be less than one. That's a sign of growth at a reasonable price. Our search turned up 22 dividend superstars, including Decoma, so the stock may be worth a second look despite the index deletion.  Why the index deletion? Decoma Chief Financial Officer Randy Smallbone says it's because tech companies have seen sharp market- capitalization increases in the past year that have pushed out some listed companies. A spokesman for S&P's Canadian index group confirms that the decision was based, as are most index adjustments, on a quarterly review of fundamentals such as market cap, and not on the company's prospects. Decoma was one of two deleted from the index, which added six companies.
