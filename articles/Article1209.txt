 Politics & Economics: Terrorism Concerns Prompt Greater Scrutiny of Exports   By Perez, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2007  Prosecutors' increased attention comes as industry groups are pushing the Bush administration to streamline the licensing required to export restricted technology, thereby helping U.S. companies better compete.  "What the Justice Department announced . . . is in keeping with what we want, making sure the good stuff doesn't get to the bad guys," says Jeremiah Gertler, acting vice president for defense and international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association. "At the same time, we want to help get the good stuff to the good guys, our allies."  The concerns about securing restricted technology have also shown up in the proposed acquisition of 3Com Corp. by Bain Capital Partners LLC and a company with close ties to the Chinese government. Bain and 3Com say they have notified the U.S. government that Huawei Technologies Co. won't have any operational control and won't be able to make decisions for 3Com if the deal goes through. The proposed transaction is under a national-security review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment.
