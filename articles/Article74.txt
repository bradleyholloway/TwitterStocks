New-product introductions in January inched up to 78 from 74 in January 1980, but both figures fell a good deal behind January 1979, when there were 90.  The data came from the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample New Product Newsletter.  One new product is Giraf Malt Liquor, which may not appeal to you immediately, but listen to the theme: ''Giraf Malt Liquor . . . It's heads above the rest.'' It's Danish, and will be competing with Magnum, a new malt brew from Philip Morris with a very powerfulsounding name.  And try to imagine this from National Ice Cream Enterprises: pudding on a stick. Where, but in America?
