MIAMI, Feb. 17â€” A county civil judge, armed with a pistol, interrupted an armed robbery Tuesday and exchanged shots with a teen-aged suspect while chasing him down an alley, the authorities said.  The police later arrested the youth, whose name was not given because he is only 16 years old, and he was questioned about the armed robbery of Richard Landi, according to a police spokesman, Calvin Ross.  Judge Jon I. Gordon of the Dade County civil division said he was leaving a cafeteria when he saw a teen-ager, armed with a gun, demand jewelry from Mr. Landi. ''I yelled, Halt!'' the 36-year-old judge recounted. ''I drew down on him, but I couldn't shoot because the victim was in the way.''  The judge said Mr. Landi ducked and then he and the suspect exchanged shots as the teen-ager ran. The police blocked off the neighborhood and found the teen-ager in an apartment meter room nearby.
