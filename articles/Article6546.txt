 Start-Up Firm Begins Service To Browse Web While Offline   By Delaney, Kevin J, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2006  "It's instantly available information -- that's the beautiful part of it," said Arif Maskatia, an Acer vice president of engineering and advanced technology. He said Webaroo would make it easier for consumers to use their laptops "no matter where they are, whether they are in the air, driving or in the train."  Webaroo is making available "packs" of Web content that consumers can download, starting with 16 packs containing Web sites about specific cities, such as Los Angeles and London. When a device is offline, the Web pages still appear largely as they do when connected to the Internet. Users can click on links to other pages and access them if those pages have been downloaded as well. Consumers can access Webaroo from some Windows-compatible hand-held computing devices, including some advanced phones.
