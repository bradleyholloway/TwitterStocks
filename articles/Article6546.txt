 U.S. Officials to Ease Habitat Designations For Salmon in Parts of Pacific Northwest   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2002  The National Marine Fisheries Service has agreed to rescind critical-habitat designations for salmon across a large swath of the Pacific Northwest as part of a proposed settlement of a home builders' lawsuit that some environmentalists say is more evidence of the Bush administration bowing to special interests.  Officials for the National Marine Fisheries Service said they were prompted to settle the case following a separate ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver recently that the government's economic analysis for critical-habitat designations must be more specific than it has been. Agency officials said they don't expect protections for the salmon to suffer, as the salmon still are listed under the Endangered Species Act.
