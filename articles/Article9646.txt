 NATO's Will Exceeds Its Resources; In Key Afghan Mission, Alliance Finds Itself Short Of Personnel, Equipment   By Shishkin, Philip, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2004  As NATO seeks to expand its peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan, one of the most ambitious missions in the alliance's history, its airport difficulties underscore a lingering quandary: NATO's political commitment to succeed in Afghanistan often exceeds its ability to furnish personnel and equipment.  In a speech last week, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer acknowledged that NATO's credibility is "on the line" in Afghanistan. "If we fail in Afghanistan -- if we do not meet our commitments to the people of that country to help them build a better future -- then who will have confidence in us again?" asked Mr. de Hoop Scheffer, who took office a month ago and last week met with President Bush and other U.S. officials in Washington to discuss Afghanistan and Iraq.  These NATO teams are modeled after units already fielded by the U.S., Britain and New Zealand in Afghanistan. But plans for deploying the new NATO teams remain vague, with the exception of a German detachment that just went to Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. Italy and Norway have also indicated their willingness to pitch in with soldiers and civilians, but no clear commitments exist yet. "Nations aren't rushing to create new teams," says an alliance official.
