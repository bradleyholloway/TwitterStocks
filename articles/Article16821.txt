 Bayer Halts U.S. Sale Of Trasylol   By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  Trasylol, which is supposed to reduce blood loss and allow patients undergoing heart-bypass surgery to avoid transfusions, would be the third drug this year whose sale in the U.S. was halted under scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, a signal of how the agency is weighing safety issues heavily in drug decisions. Still, the history of Trasylol, which was approved in the U.S. in 1993 and has been tied to high-profile safety concerns at least since early 2006, is likely to draw questions from Congress and plaintiff attorneys.  In September, another advisory committee examined the drug, this time including the Bayer study, which suggested Trasylol might be tied to a higher risk of death and kidney damage. A follow-up to the earlier New England Journal study, this one published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in February, also tied Trasylol to mortality risk, and it advised that its use "does not appear prudent." Still, none of the safety studies were randomized.
