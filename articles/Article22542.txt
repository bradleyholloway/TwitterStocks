 Pakistan Maintains Hard Line Against India --- Fighting Rages On Amid Diplomacy   By By Jonathan Karp, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1999  BASAL CHU, Pakistan -- As artillery fire echoes in this front-line Himalayan gorge, Lt. Col. Nawaz Herl reflects on the heaviest combat between Pakistan and India in 28 years. Soldiers under his command have shot down an Indian fighter plane, demolished a major Indian ammunition dump and crippled a vital Indian military supply road.  Yet eight weeks into the crisis, border fighting in the disputed region of Kashmir rages on, even as Pakistan and India make halting diplomatic attempts to prevent a wider war. Fearing an escalation between the two newly nuclear rivals, the U.S. and European countries are stepping up pressure on Pakistan to withdraw troops who crossed a 1972 cease-fire line in May and seized strategic ridges.  One obstacle to a quick pullout: Islamabad continues to deny assertions by Indian and Western powers that Pakistani troops infiltrated into India. It says India is battling Kashmiri guerrillas who want to free the mainly Muslim region from New Delhi's rule. The hard-line stand has isolated Pakistan diplomatically. Even China, Pakistan's closest regional ally, indirectly criticized Pakistan yesterday for not honoring the cease-fire line, known as the Line of Control.
