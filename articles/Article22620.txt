 Qwest, U S West to Discuss German Bid --- Merger Partners to Respond To Deutsche Telekom; Bell Firm's Stock Falls   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Blumenstein and Stephanie N. Mehta in New York, and Anita Raghavan in London, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2000  People close to the situation said that Deutsche Telekom's chief executive, Ron Sommer, is encouraging both Qwest and U S West to work out their differences over a possible merger of one or both carriers with the German company, before merger talks get more advanced. Any agreement with Deutsche Telekom wouldn't be expected for at least a month as all sides examine their options, according to people close to the situation.  U S West officials were surprised to learn this week that officials of the Denver-based Qwest have been in talks with Deutsche Telekom about a possible transAtlantic combination. Shareholders of Qwest and U S West already have approved their $50 billion merger, though some uncertainty was injected into the deal this week when U S West Chairman Solomon Trujillo announced plans to leave the company upon completion of the merger with Qwest. He cited differences with Qwest over "key strategic issues."  To that end, Qwest is announcing today that it has filled 15 of the top 20 spots in the combined Qwest-U S West management team. Robert Woodruff, 51, will be chief financial officer of the combined company, continuing his Qwest duties. Of the 10 positions reporting to Mr. [Joseph P.] Nacchio, five are Qwest executives, while three are U S West executives, one is neutral and one position remains unfilled.
