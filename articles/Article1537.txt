 Indonesia to Get $400 Million Credit On Fine Terms   By By Richard Borsuk, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 1991  Indonesia has lined up a $400 million standby loan at terms that show it remains in good standing with international banks.  Bank Indonesia, the country's central bank, is to sign the seven-year revolving credit facility Wednesday in Frankfurt. In recent years, Indonesia has arranged several similar standby loans that it could draw on for balance-of-payments support or other purposes. In practice, however, Jakarta hasn't drawn any of the funds pledged but has used the facilities to maintain confidence in its financial position. At any time, the government has at least $1.5 billion in standby facilities.
