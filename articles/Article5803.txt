 All Funds and No Stocks? You May Be Missing Out   By By Lynn Asinof, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1996  While lots of people still buy individual stocks, mutual funds are more and more becoming the investment vehicle of choice for novice investors and many sophisticates, as well.  Individual stocks offer investors the opportunity to capitalize on their special areas of expertise, to exert more control over their portfolios and to learn stock-market dynamics. Buying individual stocks can also make tax planning easier.  For one thing, taxable dividend income is usually much more predictable with a portfolio of stocks than with a mutual fund. And a long-term investor who buys individual stocks never has to worry about capital gains taxes until the shares are sold. In contrast, mutual funds typically make annual capital-gains distributions that are taxable unless the funds are held in a tax-advantaged account, such as an individual retirement account.
