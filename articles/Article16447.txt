 AT&T's Dorman Cancels Plans For Conference   By Young, Shawn, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2004  A company spokesman declined to comment on the Bedminster, N.J., phone titan's decision to skip the conference, hosted by Goldman Sachs in New York. He also wouldn't comment on the company's plans.  Analysts expect AT&T to announce at least 7,000 job cuts in the wake of its decision this summer to stop marketing phone service to consumers. The company is concentrating exclusively on its business customers, which already provides 70% of its revenue. AT&T is the nation's largest phone and data provider to businesses, but that division is also suffering from shrinking revenue and needs to cut costs.
