 Mellon Expects to Report Profit Fell 64% For Fourth Quarter, 9.4% for All of '86   By By Mark Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1987  Mellon Bank Corp., still hurt by problem loans, expects to report that fourth-quarter net income plummeted about 64% to $16 million, or 42 cents a share.  Concerned about its problem energy-related, heavy manufacturing and international portfolios, Mellon sharply increased its fourth-quarter provision for loan losses to $98 million from $53.6 million a year earlier. Mellon expects to report that net credit losses totaled $55 million, principally on domestic commercial loans. In the year earlier quarter, Mellon's net credit losses totaled $33.7 million.  The fourth-quarter earnings decline also reflects Mellon's cost-cutting efforts in its international banking operations. Mellon is taking a fourth-quarter charge of $9 million to consolidate its international banking operations.
