 MarketWatch: Hot Commodities Need a Cool Head   By Farrell, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2005  There's a case to be made for commodity exposure in your portfolio. For example, Jim Rogers, author of the book "Hot Commodities," a useful primer, notes that historically, stock and commodity cycles have had an inverse relationship.  small investors may want to focus on mutual funds. Mr. Rogers mentions two that are based on broader commodity indexes that go beyond oil: Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy fund (the no-load shares class is PCRDX) and Oppenheimer Real Asset (QRAAX). Pimco's fund, launched in 2002 and now the biggest, is riding the wave of commodities' popularity as investors seek to diversify.  The Pimco fund "is a particularly potent diversifier because it's among the few funds that provide direct exposure to a broad set of commodities, not just oil," said Morningstar analyst Sondra Morris in naming the fund as an analyst pick. "But in the end, most investors probably have sufficient exposure to the natural-resource sector through other funds."
