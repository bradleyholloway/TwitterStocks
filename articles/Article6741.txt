 The Steps to Claiming a Payout   By Jones, Ashby, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  The $4.85 billion agreement between Merck & Co. and plaintiffs' lawyers sets out a path for people to follow if they think they were injured by Vioxx. Here is how it's supposed to unfold, in Q&A format:  A: Claimants will have to pass through three "gates." First, a claimant will have to show medical proof of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) or ischemic stroke (caused by blockage of arteries leading to the brain). Those are the only injuries covered under the agreement. Second, a claimant will have to show documented proof that they received at least 30 [Vioxx] pills. Lastly, a claimant will have to show that a certain amount of Vioxx was received within 14 days before the claimed injury.
