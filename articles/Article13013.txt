 Big Airlines Cut Fares, Add Routes In Fight With Low-Cost Carriers   By Trottman, Melanie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2004  "It's blatantly obvious that this is a message to us to say 'stop flying transcontinental,' " said America West Chief Executive Doug Parker. "We've got the message and we're going to keep flying transcon," he said. One option for America West: Pull a flight off what it says is now an oversupplied JFK-Phoenix route and put that service into the coast-to-coast markets, he said, the very thing it believes American is fighting against in the first place.  Bargain Hunting Traditional carriers have matched fares on routes that low-cost carriers fly, and kept prices high where they don't. A pricing comparison on nonstop flights: ROUTE -- Boston to San Francisco CARRIERS -- American, United, US Airways PRICE -- $2,467 ROUTE -- New York's JFK to Los Angeles' LAX CARRIERS -- America West, American, Delta PRICE -- $470 ROUTE -- New York's JFK to Long Beach, Calif. CARRIERS -- JetBlue, American PRICE -- $363, $360 Note: Fares are for ticket purchase the day of departure for roundtrip travel from Feb. 5 to Feb. 12.
