 Reinventing the Wheel / The latest car technology   By Flandez, Raymund, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2005  Cost: The reconfigured Toyota Sienna Rampvans and others will cost almost twice as much as the original vehicle's suggested retail price. (For example, a 2005 Toyota Sienna LE sells for $26,900; the Rampvan version with an infloor-ramp conversion is projected to cost $45,230, not including shipping.) The Handybar devices, which retail for $39.95, can be found at most automotive and medical-supply stores. At dynamic-living.com, the Swivel Seat sells for $24.99; and the Universal Turner, for $21.99. Auto makers' mobility-assistance programs provide cash reimbursements of typically up to $1,000 to eligible customers, depending on the vehicle and the equipment. Adaptive equipment specialists are listed at car makers' mobility- program Web sites; for DaimlerChrysler, it's automobility.daimlerchrysler.com.
