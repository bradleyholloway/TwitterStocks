 Letters to the Editor: The End of Church-State Separation   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1995  The editorial is not about Christians; it concerns the Christian Coalition and its Washington convention. The Christian Coalition certainly does not speak for all Christians, nor even a majority of Christians. The Christian Coalition is Pat Robertson. Anyone who thinks Mr. Robertson speaks for all Christians has not read his books, heard his speeches or watched his "700 Club" on TV.  The first of the 10 points in the contract proposes "A constitutional amendment to protect the religious liberties of Americans in public places," the so-called Religious Equality Amendment. Americans already enjoy religious liberty and equality, mandated by the first 16 words of the First Amendment. All children are guaranteed the right to pray, the right to discuss their faith with others, the right to express their religious beliefs in their classroom and homework assignments, the right to distribute religious literature to their classmates, the right to wear religious symbols or to be released for off-campus religious instruction and the right to gather in groups with like-minded students -- all of these rights can and are enjoyed in our public schools across this country, within the same parameters as other nonreligious expression.
