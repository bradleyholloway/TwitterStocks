 U.S. Buys Additional Flu Shots, Seeks More for People at Risk   By McKay, Betsy, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2003  [Aventis Pasteur], the largest manufacturer of vaccine in the U.S., set the doses aside last week as an emergency reserve for possible government purchase before filling orders that depleted the rest of its supply. The government is also considering purchasing about 400,000 extra doses of vaccine from Chiron Corp., Emeryville, Calif., the other major manufacturer of vaccine for the U.S. market. But it must first determine whether it can import the vaccine quickly enough from Britain, where it was produced. "We're exploring all options for possibly purchasing additional supplies," Mr. [Tommy Thompson] said.  While some severe cases have been reported, CDC Director Julie Gerberding said it is still too early to tell how severe this flu season will be. While the percentage of visits by patients to doctors' offices for flu-like illnesses are ahead of those of the previous three flu seasons, the percentage of deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza haven't reached the agency's epidemic threshold, she said.
