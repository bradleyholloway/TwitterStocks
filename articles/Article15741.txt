 Lesson for Republicans -- II   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1998  These guys must really be dense. They don't get it. They refuse to get it. They don't want to get it. In 1986 their meltdown came in the middle of Ronald Reagan's second term, by which time many congressional Republicans had forgotten how Mr. Reagan won the presidency, or didn't care. They lost control of the Senate. Now in mid-term 1998, running against a brain-dead Democratic Party and a scandal-plagued presidency, they've gained no seats in the Senate and, incredibly, lost seats in the House. Quite a feat. How did they manage it?  This, for example, is what Republican voters were asked to swallow: The day the budget passed, this office received a raft of faxes from the House GOP leadership, and among them was one bragging that the Democrats' big school-construction outlay targeted only selected districts, while the Republicans had voted higher spending for all districts. The congressional GOP gives the impression they think their voters are idiots.  After news of a budget surplus emerged (a surplus in no small part generated by higher returns from taxpayers), the GOP grandiosely announced plans for a tax cut of $80 billion. The White House yawned and piped the "Save Social Security" cassette over the loudspeakers, while the Senate's Republican aristocrats wanly announced they didn't have the stomach or the votes for cutting taxes. So the GOP had to fold, shrinking its tax cut to $9 billion of cats and dogs. Then they threw nearly $6 billion of "emergency" money at farmers. Why should anyone vote to legitimize all this as appropriate Republican policy?
