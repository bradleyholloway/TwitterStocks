 On sports: Storm cancels tourney, but stars still shine   By Klein, Frederick C, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1996  Frederick C. Klein reviews the history of the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am golf tournament, started by Bing Crosby and now sponsored by AT&T Corp. Klein reflects on the changes in professional golf over the years, noting that the rain cancellation of the 1996 tournament the weekend of Feb 3-4, 18 holes short of official status, demonstrated the different slant on money from the 1937 crowd, as the leader, Jeff Maggert, was less concerned about money than a tour victory.
