 Politics & Economics: New Setback for Guantanamo Trials   By Evan Perez and Jess Bravin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2007  Col. [Morris Davis] headed the effort to prosecute Guantanamo prisoners suspected of war crimes, including the 14 "high-value" prisoners transferred there from Central Intelligence Agency custody last year. Since July, he has been in conflict with Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann over the direction of the prosecutions. Gen. Hartmann is a fellow Air Force officer and legal adviser to the convening authority, which runs the trials.  Under Pentagon regulations, the legal adviser has more authority than the title suggests, including supervision of the chief prosecutor. Col. Davis argued that language in the Military Commissions Act was intended to insulate the prosecutor from outside influence, including that of the legal adviser. An internal review by an Army judge sided with Gen. Hartmann. Informed of those conclusions yesterday, Col. Davis resigned, officials said. Col. Davis declined to comment, saying he had been ordered not to discuss "any facet of military commissions" with the media.
