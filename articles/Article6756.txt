 Deals & Deal Makers: Bids & Offers   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2003  First Call is "trying to be more precise," said its longtime research director, Chuck Hill. " 'Consensus' implies agreement [among analysts] and that's not what we're really doing. We're taking an average."  "We applaud this decision," said Louis Thompson, president and chief executive of the National Investor Relations Institute, in a statement. "Hopefully, it will diminish the securities market's and the media's focus on 'the number.' " The First Call mean "is not a so- called 'consensus,' which implied that analysts had come to an agreement on a specific earnings per share . . . number."  If First Call's switch catches on elsewhere, it would represent somewhat of a change in the vocabulary of Wall Street and the financial media. The term "consensus estimate" had become "generally accepted parlance in the industry," says Mr. Hill.
