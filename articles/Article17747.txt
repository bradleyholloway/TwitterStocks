 Zeckendorf Gets Loans to Build New York Hotel --- Credit Totals $227.7 Million; Holiday Corp. Will Run Midtown Manhattan Site   By By Roger Lowenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1987  William Zeckendorf Jr., a New York City developer, said he secured $227.7 million in financing to build a 45-story midtown hotel to be operated by Holiday Corp., one of the few major hotel chains that isn't represented in Manhattan.  The hotel, which will be on 48th Street several blocks north of Times Square, means that Holiday, based in Memphis, Tenn., will have a Manhattan hotel to accommodate requests from its reservations network.  The 770-room hotel, to be known as Broadway Crowne Plaza, will be developed by a group led by Zeckendorf Co. Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp., a New York-based mortgage banker, arranged for financing from an 11-bank consortium, led by First National Bank of Chicago and the Bank of Nova Scotia.
