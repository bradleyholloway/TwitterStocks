 China Announces Spending Plan That Relies Heavily on Red Ink   By By Peter Wonacott, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2001  That picture, say economists, offers a vivid reminder of dangers lurking on either side of Beijing's budget. Spend too little and risk an economic slowdown and mounting protests from rising unemployment. Spend too much and a bad balance sheet may hurt credit ratings and hamper reforms, such as cleaning up the banking system and rolling out a nationwide social-security system. "It's very clear-cut," says Ma Guonan, chief economist for North Asia at Merrill Lynch. "The room for stimulus is limited."  This year, Mr. [Xiang Huaicheng] outlined plans to offset a downturn in revenues by improving tax collection by plugging loopholes and cracking down on widespread fraud. The ministry also aims to intensify scrutiny over project funding to "put a stop to extravagance, waste and squandering," he said. In addition to finding funds for new highways, ports, rail links and water projects, China wants to increase spending on education and agriculture by at least 21% each.
