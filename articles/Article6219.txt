 When Building Up A Business Means Turning Around a Town   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1999  Turn onto Main Street, and another transition occurs. The shopping-center sprawl yields to the discordant stillness of a struggling downtown. There, Dave Wolff is trying to prove you can build a business in a place where many have given up on commerce. He is doing it by linking customers' basic needs to their higher aspirations, by being a neighbor instead of a competitor and by being a cheerleader for a more vital community.  In January 1998, Mr. Wolff and his wife, Janey, opened a coffee shop in the middle of a block on Main Street. People thought they were crazy. Most retailers in Bel Air -- like the five-and-dime, the shoe store, the hardware store and Richardson's pharmacy, with the old-fashioned soda fountain -- moved to the malls or shuttered for good years ago. Hardly anyone comes to shop or eat on Main Street anymore.  An interesting thing started happening, as Mr. Wolff hoped it would. People started coming to Main Street just to go to the Fine Grind. But he's offering more than coffee. He gives his walls to local artists to hang their work. One Saturday a month, he stays open late to host an art opening with entertainment from a local musician. Three people came to the first opening -- the artist, the musician and Mr. Wolff. Now it's standing room only, with people spilling out the door. He opens up one evening a month for a book club (the Barnes & Noble in the mall a mile away turned the club down), another evening for poetry readings, another for a political club. He allows the Cub Scouts to hold gatherings there. He lets people display brochures for everything from a meditation group to Scrabble night. This summer, he'll book live music every Saturday night.
