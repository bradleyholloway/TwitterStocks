 Campaign '88 -- The Issues --- Absent Agenda -- Forgotten Cities: The Urban Poor Feel Generally Neglected In Presidential Race --- Both Bush and Dukakis Woo Suburban Voters Instead; Costly Proposals Shunned --- Problems Too Hard to Solve?   By By Gerald F. Seib and Alex Kotlowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1988  Democrat Michael Dukakis pledges to "transform the cycle of poverty" -- yet although Walter Mondale stopped here in the 27th Ward in 1984, Mr. Dukakis hasn't responded to pleas of local Democratic leaders to visit.  Certainly, residents of the 27th Ward feel alienated by the election campaign. Many think that increasingly oppressive inner-city problems have been neglected while both candidates race after the votes of the suburban middle class. This neighborhood, overwhelmingly Democratic, is virtually devoid of presidential posters or other signs of interest in the election. Indeed, the local Democratic leader couldn't even persuade the Dukakis campaign to send him a box of bumper stickers and buttons until two weeks ago.  Such feelings probably will hurt Mr. Dukakis more than Mr. Bush because Democrats have traditionally counted on big turnouts of urban voters to carry key states such as Illinois and New York. Both parties seem to have decided that in this election the crucial voters are middle-class Americans living outside the inner cities. Democratic pollster Peter Hart says political analysts determined that "to be able to win states, there weren't enough votes in the major cities to do it."
