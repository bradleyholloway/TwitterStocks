 Tyco's Finance Chief Set to Leave As New CEO Begins to Clean House   By By Mark Maremont and Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 2002  Despite his reduced severance package, Mr. [Mark Swartz] has been one of America's most highly compensated finance chiefs. Over the four most recently reported fiscal years, according to Tyco filings, he made about $200 million in pay, restricted stock, and gains on stock options. In addition, Tyco's most recent proxy statement said Mr. Swartz was eligible for a retirement plan that would pay him about $1.9 million a year after age 65.  Mr. [Edward D. Breen], the 46-year-old former president of Motorola Inc., began work at Tyco on Monday. People close to the company said Mr. Breen had decided before joining Tyco to replace Mr. Swartz with a new finance chief as part of a general move to restore credibility to the company. Tyco's stock has declined 78% this year, wiping out $92 billion in market value.
