 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Futures & Options: Symphonic Finales   By Murphy, Theodore, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  THE LATE conductor Kenneth Schermerhorn helped shape the Nashville Symphony into a world-class ensemble over the 22 years of his leadership. Leonard Bernstein's music was an inspiration to the conductor. This concert celebrates Bernstein's work with performances of his 1943 ballet, "Fancy Free" (which inspired the musical "On the Town"), and "Dybbuk," of 1974. Concerts are at 8 p.m. 615-783-1200; www.nashvillesymphony.org  RICHARD STRAUSS may be best known for his operas such as "Elektra" and "Der Rosenkavalier," but his tone poems remain quite popular (and have been used for their immediate dramatic power by filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick). Strauss tone poems are the focus of these late- season concerts by the San Francisco Symphony. In addition to the familiar strains of "Also Sprach Zarathustra," the program includes "Don Juan" and "Brentano Lieder." Concerts are at 8 p.m. May 18, 20 and 21; 2 p.m. on May 19 and 22. 415-864-6000; www.sfsymphony.org  THE 1,700-SEAT Bartlesville Community Center, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright protege William Wesley Peters, and known for its fine acoustics, will accommodate 170 performances, tours, talks and workshops that make up the OK Mozart festival. The program includes performances of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and the world premiere of "Mozart's Magnificent Voyage," a new children's opera about the composer. 918-336-9800; www.okmozart.com
