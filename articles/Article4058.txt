 White House's Budget Director Stockman Quits --- Departure of Controversial Foe of Deficits May Alter Administration's Profile   By By Robert W. Merry and Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1985  The departure almost surely will alter the character of the Reagan administration. Constantly through his tenure the hard-driving Mr. Stockman took the lead in pressing for bold attacks on the deficits that plagued Mr. Reagan's domestic policies and so often mocked Mr. Stockman's efforts.  White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday that Mr. Stockman's departure probably won't affect the current negotiations among White House officials and congressional leaders of both parties over the fiscal 1986 budget resolution, currently jammed up in a House-Senate conference committee. Those negotiations either will have produced a final product or have failed for good by the end of the month when Mr. Stockman leaves, he said.  That put him in Mr. Stockman's camp. Also like Mr. Stockman, Mr. Baldrige often suggested the two choices facing the government were spending cuts or higher taxes. Thus, Mr. Baldrige joined Mr. Stockman in resisting the supply-side conviction that economic growth by itself could prove to be a major deficit-cutting tool.
