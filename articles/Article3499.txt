 DIY Media -- Marketers' New Idea: Get the Consumer To Design the Ads   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2005  Past ads for Ban have focused on the product and its benefits or "superiority,"" says Mr. [Steve Thibodeau]. A 2003 print ad, headlined "Ban Razor Burn,"" showed a pink razor with flames coming out of it and emphasized the product's "outstanding odor and wetness protection."  In focus groups with teens earlier this year, Ban learned that such messages weren't working -- and that teenagers "wanted input on the messages being directed to them,"" says P.J. Katien, Ban's assistant marketing director. The teens' feedback inspired a new look and emphasis for the campaign, which now evokes emotional challenges facing young women. One shows two high school cheerleaders in a screaming match, under the headline "Ban Drama." Another shows a girl standing on a scale, with the headline "Ban Peer Pressure."  One older ad, dubbed "College Hero,"" featured NBA rookies waking up, leaving their mansions, and driving to practice in SUVs, all with a hip-hop soundtrack. "Entertaining, but . . . formulaic,"" says David Maddocks, Converse's vice president of global marketing.
