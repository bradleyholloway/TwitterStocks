 Deere Posts Loss of $320 Million As It Discloses Cost-Cutting Moves   By By Joseph T. Hallinan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2001  To cut costs more, Deere will transfer the engineering, production and marketing of its skid-steer loaders, which are similar to fork lifts, from Loudon, Tenn., to a factory in Dubuque, Iowa. The Loudon plant will be closed and sold, cutting roughly 300 jobs and resulting in a pretax charge of about $30 million, most of which is expected to be taken in the current quarter.  The company expects its construction- and forestry-equipment division to be especially hard hit in the current quarter, with production tonnage likely to be down 36% from year-earlier levels. First-quarter production tonnage at the company's farm-equipment factories in the U.S. and Canada will probably fall about 20%, Deere said.
