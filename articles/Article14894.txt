 Telecommunications (A Special Report) --- Playing Politics: Soviet Deal Shows Pitfalls and Potential Of International Telecommunications Business   By By Mary Lu Carnevale, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1991  The script called for Leningrad's mayor to place the first call from a cellular phone as a group of top U S West and Soviet officials looked on. But when the first phase of the sophisticated cellular network was completed, the mayor was out of touch as the August coup attempt unfolded.  Fortunately for the Denver-based phone company, the coup quickly unraveled and the ceremony went on as planned. But the Soviet Union unraveled, too, raising a cloud over other U S West projects in that country. U S West's efforts to make inroads in the Soviet Union illustrate the politics, the pitfalls and the vast potential of doing business in the international telecommunications arena.  In addition to the cellular system for Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), the company set its sights on a trans-Soviet fiber-optic cable and a joint venture for a cellular system in Moscow. The fiber-optic project has been left in limbo by international politics, but the company and the Soviet Union hope to modify it in a way that will win approval from Western defense authorities.
