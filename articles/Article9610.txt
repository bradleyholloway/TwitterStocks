 Personal Health -- Aches & Claims: Products to Rub Out Rosacea   By Saranow, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2003  Many of the new products released this year, including Galderma Laboratories' Rosanil Cleanser and Bradley Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Rosula Aqueous Cleanser, contain concentrations of sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur, ingredients long used to treat rosacea. The companies claim their products, available by prescription, are a new generation of cleansers that are less irritating and drying to the skin, and don't have the typical bad smell of sulfur.  Sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur cleansers aren't considered first- line treatments for rosacea, which manufacturers concede. Although these treatments may be enough for people with mild cases, most patients generally will still need to use the mainstays of rosacea treatment: oral antibiotics to get the disease under control and some kind of topical for maintenance. A new topical treatment, Berlex Laboratories Inc.'s Finacea, hit the market in March. Doctors say it may penetrate the skin better than older formulations of azelaic acid, which helps old skin shed, but is generally no better than its main competition, the topical antibiotic metronidazole.
