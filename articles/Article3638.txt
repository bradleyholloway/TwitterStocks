 Citigroup to Buy Grupo Cuscatlan, U.K.'s Quilter   By Enrich, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2006  In October, Citigroup bought Grupo Financiero Uno, which it described as Central America's No. 1 credit-card issuer. The bank didn't disclose the terms of that deal. That month, Citigroup also agreed to buy a 20% stake in a big Turkish bank, Akbank TAS. In November, Citigroup led a group that agreed to buy about 86% of Guangdong Development Bank, a southern Chinese lender.  The moves illustrate a bet by Chief Executive Charles Prince that fast-growing overseas markets hold greater potential for the world's biggest bank in market value than the U.S. But it isn't clear the deals will quickly jump-start Citigroup's sluggish revenue streams, a source of angst among many Citigroup investors.
