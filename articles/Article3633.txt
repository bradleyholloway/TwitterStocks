 Monster Concedes Backdating, Cuts Past Profits; Filing Notes Loose Process For Handing Out Options; Charges Cover 9-Year Period   By Forelle, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2006  Steven Reich, a lawyer for Mr. [Andrew McKelvey], said the former CEO "had no idea that any of the company's practices were improper or had any accounting implications." As for the outlays to employees and relatives, Mr. Reich said "some expenses were advanced by the company on Mr. McKelvey's behalf," for which he reimbursed the company, but additional expenses hadn't been billed to him. "Mr. McKelvey voluntarily repaid all of these expenses when they were brought to his attention," Mr. Reich said.  The troubles affected a "substantial number" of grants between 1997 to March 2003, Monster said. Monster said it often wasn't able to determine exactly when the grants really were made. It said it needed to take $340 million in pretax charges for compensation expense related to options over nine years. On some occasions, the company said, it wrongly took tax deductions for options granted to top executives that it shouldn't have taken because they were backdated to favorable dates.  The company said certain personal employees of Mr. McKelvey had long been on Monster's payroll, though Mr. McKelvey would "generally" reimburse the company for "a vast majority of these salaries." The unreimbursed portion totaled $30,868.
