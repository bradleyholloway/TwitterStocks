 Clinton Trumpets Blueprint for Centers To Prepare Youth for Information Age   By By Jeanne Cummings and John Simons, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 1999  ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Hoping to encourage private investment in the labor pool of tomorrow, President Clinton used the White House bully pulpit to call attention to the launch of the Academy of Information Technology, an $8 million private initiative to prepare high-school students for information technology careers.  The White House's spotlight on training digital-age workers coincides with a separate study released yesterday that suggests that certain minority groups and low-income families lack access to technology. The report showed that although some 40% of American households own a personal computer and more than a quarter have access to the Internet, households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more are 20 times more likely to have access to the Internet than those at lower income levels and more than nine times as likely to own a computer.
