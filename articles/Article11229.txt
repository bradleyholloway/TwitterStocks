 IBM Unveils Software That Will Allow Companies to Exchange Business Data   By By Paul B. Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1989  IBM, which already sells EDI software developed by others, also beefed up the sales and training staffs devoted to the effort.  Bob Berland, an IBM division vice president, said the computer giant wants to throw its weight behind the technology because EDI will let companies capture electronically all the information on such documents as purchase orders and invoices. Using EDI, a company would produce, for instance, a purchase order on a computer screen using its regular software. Someone would then hit a button and send it over a phone line to a supplier, who would be able to call it up on a computer screen in whatever form the supplier was used to, because of the electronic translation that EDI provides. IBM needs to find such uses for computers if it is to dispel recent talk of slowing industry growth.
