 `Contumacious Misdeeds'   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1999  When a lawsuit by Elouise Cobell, the chair of the Blackfeet National Bank, reached the court of U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, he was appalled. In 1996, he ordered the government to surrender what records it had. That was when the patented (President) Clinton stonewall began, attempting to push the problem into the next administration. After two court deadlines were missed, evidence surfaced that Interior officials may have destroyed documents. Last February Judge Lamberth cited both Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin for contempt of court, charging that their employees had "engaged in a shocking pattern of deception."
