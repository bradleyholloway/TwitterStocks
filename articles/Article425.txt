MIAMI, Feb. 25â€” Eight persons and four corporations were indicted by a Federal grand jury late Wednesday on charges of illegally trading with Cuba in the 1980 Mariel sealift.  An 18-month investigation uncovered ''a big, gigantic conspiracy by the Cuban Government to obtain U.S. currency'' in exchange for the release of Cuban nationals seeking to flee the island, said James T. Schmand, the customs agent in charge of the investigation.  The sealift brought more than 127,000 Cubans to Key West in about four months.  A spokesman for the Customs Department said that the 35-count indictment dealt basically with violations of the Trading With the Enemy Act. The defendants are accused of shifting equipment and currency to Cuba without proper licenses and transporting undocumented aliens to the United States in violation of American laws.  The companies indicted were American Air Ways Inc., Canaveral Travel Inc., Cuban American Enterprises Inc. and Havana Tur. Individuals named were Carlos Alfonso Gonzalez, Charles Romeo, Fernando Fuentes-Coba, Roger Dooley, Jorge Debasa, Miria Contreras Ropert, Lourdes Rey Gonzalez Dopico and Orestes Damian Aleman.
