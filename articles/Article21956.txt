 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 1994  A business group, Alliance for GATT Now, tries to decide who should approach Dole to argue against delay. "I just think we need to sit down and have some serious discussions," Dole says. Groups out to kill GATT run TV ads in Nebraska, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota -- as well as in Clinton's vacation spot, Martha's Vineyard.  Lobbying against the bill backed by Sens. Hollings and Danforth is expected to step up when Congress briefly returns. The U.S. Telephone Association, state regulators, consumer groups and others complain that the bill would impose too many regulations. It also "certainly will push phone rates up," says Idaho regulator Joe Miller.  With elections near, lawmakers aren't eager to make tough choices that could anger various phone-industry, union and consumer interests. Democratic Sen. Metzenbaum still plans a hearing on the bill this month. And Danforth can't count on help from Dole, who was mad that the Missouri Republican backed the crime bill.
