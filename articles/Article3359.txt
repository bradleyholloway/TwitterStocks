 A Market Marriage in Europe?; Deutsche Boerse's Courtship of London Exchange May Elicit a Rival   By Ascarelli, Silvia, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2004  Mr. [Werner Seifert] long has been interested in the London exchange. He first proposed an alliance in 1998 that didn't happen. In 2000, the Germans and Britons tried again, this time with a full merger proposal to create a combined company known as iX. It was vetoed by the LSE's owners, then dominated by smaller brokers, and the exchange's chief executive resigned as a consequence. Since then, both companies have become publicly traded.  What happens to London could be a turning point for European stock trading. Conventional wisdom long has held that Europe's three largest stock-market operators eventually would be winnowed to two and that the LSE was the most likely to fade. Moreover, if the London Stock Exchange agrees to a partner, it quickly could push other, independent but midsize exchanges -- particularly Italy's and Spain's -- to sell out, too.  Investors appeared to believe that yesterday's salvo by Deutsche Borse was just the first round and that Euronext may make a rival offer. In London, the London Stock Exchange's share price surged more than 25% to close at 540 pence, above Deutsche Borse's proposed price. Deutsche Borse shares fell 4% to 42.75 euros ($56.59), while shares in Euronext dropped 4.7% to 21.55 euros.
