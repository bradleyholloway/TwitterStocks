 UPS Launches Package-Return Service For Web Purchases That Tracks Progress   By By Rick Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  While the new service now is being used by just one retailer, buy.com Inc., UPS said it plans to roll out the electronic-returns system widely during next year's first quarter. Retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Lands' End Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. already ship huge numbers of parcels through UPS, and UPS clearly hopes they will consider using the electronic system.  The service works by having customers print a shipping label generated on a personal computer and authorized by the retailer. The system provides the customer with nearby drop-off locations for the return package, which also can be handed over to brown-uniformed UPS drivers. And the parcel-tracking capabilities that UPS already has in place allow customers and merchants to zero in on the exact whereabouts of any return item.
