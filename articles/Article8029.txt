 Letters to the Editor: Arguing Against NEA Isn't Censorship   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1990  As a theatrical historian who enjoys all the arts, I can share Edwin Wilson's contempt for political and religious extremists who would censor what we read or watch, but I am dismayed when he concludes his essay with the observation that "debating whether we should have an NEA at all . . . is a wrongheaded exercise in demagoguery" ("In Search of an Authentic Debate," Leisure & Arts, June 29). Battling censorship ought to be a duty for every decentminded citizen; advocating that taxpayers be forced to underwrite the arts (and saying the subject is not open to legitimate discussion) is quite another matter. There are good and proper arguments for closing down the National Endowment for the Arts.
