 LTV Corp. Net Increased 26% In First Quarter   By By Cynthia F. Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1988  LTV Corp., aided by higher steel prices and the continuing benefits of federal bankruptcy-law protection, said its first-quarter net income rose 26%.  A one-time gain of $24.8 million from the sale of certain steel unit assets that had been substantially written down resulted in net income for the latest quarter of $163.9 million, or $1.36 a share. Net income in the year-earlier quarter, in which there weren't special gains or losses, totaled $129.6 million, or $1.14 a share. Sales declined 1.6% to $1.88 billion from $1.91 billion.  Strong improvement at LTV Steel Co., the nation's second-largest steelmaker, offset a 54% drop in profit in aerospace and defense business -- traditionally LTV's most profitable unit. Two of LTV's biggest contracts -- the Army's B-1 bomber and Hummer military vehicle -- are winding down. But the unit's order backlog, at $3.24 billion, remains healthy, thanks to several new programs in the development stages.
