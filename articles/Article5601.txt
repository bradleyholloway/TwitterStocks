 Democratic losing streak   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1994  An editorial notes that wherever voters go to the polls, Democrats are losing races they should be winning, and when President Clinton's party loses almost every race of consequence, the Democratic party should start worrying. The editorial says the real shocker came in Apr 1994 in Delaware, where Margaret Rose Henry became the first black woman ever elected to the state senate by defeating the two best-known African-American politicians in the state--State Rep Herman Holloway, Jr and Sam Guy.
