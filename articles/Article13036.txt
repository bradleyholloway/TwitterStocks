 Why Wall Street Snubs Viacom; Darling of Investors a Year Ago, Media Titan's Karmazin Feels Heat Over Radio Woes, Profit Concerns   By Gregory Zuckerman and Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2004  A year ago, investors held their collective breath as Mr. [Mel Karmazin], Viacom Inc.'s president, considered leaving the company. They viewed Mr. Karmazin as the most gifted manager in the media world, and fretted that his departure would send Viacom shares plummeting. Eventually, Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman and chief executive, bit the bullet, retaining Mr. Karmazin with a juicy contract on par with Mr. Redstone's hefty salary.  "Mel Karmazin is definitively one of the foremost managers in media, but there have been several false-starts in radio," says Frank Bodenchak, who runs Edge Capital LLC, a New York media hedge fund, which owns Viacom shares. "Investors are watching to see if the radio industry -- and Viacom's radio under Mel's auspices -- can get back to above-average growth."  The short selling, and the stock's difficulties, have executives frustrated because they come on the heels of improved earnings. Viacom reported a 30% jump in first-quarter profit, excluding a tax benefit. Thanks to solid gains in cable and broadcast-television networks, the results easily topped analyst expectations. In fact, Viacom's CBS is the top broadcast network, with a prime-time average audience growing to 13.2 million viewers from 12.5 million last season. And it has made inroads on General Electric Co.'s NBC in the race for the coveted 18- year-old to 49-year-old demographic. And Viacom's cable channels, including MTV and Nickelodeon, remain cash cows. Messrs. Redstone and Karmazin have been telling investors to expect revenue growth of as much as 7% this year, amid a robust advertising environment.
