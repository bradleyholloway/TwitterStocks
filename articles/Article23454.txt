 Lifestyle; A Fish Story: For our Type A angler, a good coach and lots of practice worked miracles   By Sease, Douglas R, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  For Type B fishermen, it may be enough to hang out on the water with a line dangling over the side of the dock or boat. For them, fishing doesn't have to be catching. But for the Type A fisherman -- I count myself among them, for better or worse -- fishing that isn't catching isn't fun. It's frustrating.  Practice doesn't do you much good unless you pay attention. Many of my fishing friends judge a location by whether or not it "looks fishy." Of course, they're judging it by the surface surroundings -- not what's under the water, which is all that matters. It doesn't seem to dawn on them that if they've never caught anything there, that spot really isn't very fishy.  At the same time, I'm buying higher-quality -- both more expensive and more durable -- equipment. And I won't buy a rod that doesn't have a lifetime guarantee; I've broken three on big fish, including a shark that disconcertingly showed up in the river. I've even toyed with the idea of getting my captain's license and becoming a guide myself.
