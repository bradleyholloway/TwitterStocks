 Health Costs: Grads, You Need Coverage   By Whitehouse, Kaja, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2006  College students generally are covered under their parents' health insurance or by a school-sponsored policy. Once they graduate, however, they risk losing this coverage. Even those who find jobs right away can be without insurance for a few months since there's often a waiting period before employer-sponsored coverage kicks in.  You'll need to pinpoint exactly when you will be booted from your current plan. If you have school-sponsored insurance, you may be covered through the summer. If you're on your parents' plan, you may be dropped as soon as you receive your diploma, says Larry Akey, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group in Washington, D.C.  You could be in better shape if your parents' plan is self- insured, meaning that the employer essentially foots the medical bills rather than paying for insurance coverage. In that case, you're more likely to be considered a dependent eligible for coverage until the end of the year, says Tom Billet, a senior health benefits consultant in Stamford, Conn., with Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
