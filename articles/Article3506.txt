 Cable Consolidation: Is Bigger Better? Failed Bid for AT&T Cable Unit Could Make Cox Attractive Target   By By Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2001  That is promising, because analysts and industry insiders said Cox can't make it on its own forever. With 6.2 million subscribers, Cox was three-quarters the size of the old Comcast operation. Now that Comcast is joining with the AT&T Corp. unit, Cox will be dwarfed by a nationwide giant of more than 21 million subscribers.  The question now is whether Cox will be predator or prey. With its control of seven of the nation's top 25 markets, Cox would appear a ripe target for the likes of AOL Time Warner Inc., which is hoping to fight back the influence of Microsoft Corp. Cox also has one of cable's highest profit margins, at 39%, and is a clear leader in what the industry offhandedly calls the "three-pack," a converged offering of video, data and telephone service over one connection.  Sharon Armbrust, an analyst at Kagan World Media, said Microsoft is likely to make its backing available again, as it did for Cox's AT&T bid, should Cox pursue the likes of Adelphia or Cablevision. That could prove crucial should Cox eventually get in a bidding war with AOL over those properties.
