 If Artists Get Their Cut; A coming change in British tax law could reshape the world's resale market   By Peers, Alexandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2006  "It's a bad idea," says Anthony Browne, chairman of the trade group the British Art Market Federation, who sees the adoption of droit de suite eroding London's market share and confusing art buyers and sellers as to what's covered and isn't. (Some tapestries and "plastic arts," for example, are included in France.)  A study by the European Fine Art Foundation shows British art dealers already have reason to be concerned. Britain, for decades the world's leader in the market (Christie's didn't even start art auctions in the U.S. until the 1970s), lost its dominant position in 2001 to the U.S. (Europe has about 45% of the global market vs. America's 47%). It has trailed ever since. Given that, Mr. Browne dubs droit de suite well-meaning but "sentimental."  Some opponents argue that the reasoning behind droit de suite is faulty. It assumes that most artworks are resold at higher prices. Most contemporary art isn't resold at all -- let alone resold for a profit. There's barely a market for it. The artists whose works are resold are generally "hot" or commercially successful and have already been able to negotiate better contracts with their dealers. Far from the starving artists in garrets envisioned in Puccini's "La Boheme," they, too, have become rich in the art market's run-up.
