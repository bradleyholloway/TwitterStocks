 Icahn's Offer For Phillips Clears One Court Obstacle   By By Charles F. McCoy and John D. Williams, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1985  A federal judge in Tulsa, Okla., removed one of the obstacles blocking Carl Icahn's takeover bid for Phillips Petroleum Co.  Judge Dale Cook lifted a temporary restraining order that would have delayed Mr. Icahn's $60-a-share tender offer for 70 million Phillips shares. The order, granted by an Oklahoma state court, stemmed from a suit filed by a group of distributors of Phillips products.  But another temporary restraining order, issued by a state court in Bartlesville, Okla., Phillips's hometown, remained in effect. That order is expected to be lifted today, sources said, and Judge Cook is expected to decide tomorrow whether to grant permanent injunctions against the two state court orders.
