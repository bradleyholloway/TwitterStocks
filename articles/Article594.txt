Stephen J. Crowley, former president of the Detectives Endowment Association of the New York City Police Department, died Monday at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 63 years old and lived in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.  Mr. Crowley served as president of the association, the collective-bargaining agent for the 4,000 detectives on the police force, from 1972 to 1978.  Mr. Crowley, the son of a police captain, received 21 decorations during his 28-year career. Three of his sons are police officers and a fourth is awaiting appointment to the force.  A high school dropout, Mr. Crowley graduated from St. John's University on a six-year scholarship program, attending evening sessions. He finished in five. A Time of Change in Bureau  ''When I started, I was probably the only college freshman in the world who had 10 kids,'' he once joked in an interview. As president of the association, Mr. Crowley clashed with Police Commissioner Michael J. Codd in the late 1970's, asserting that the Detective Bureau had lost its effectiveness because of administrative changes.  When women were assigned to homicide investigation squads in 1977, Mr. Crowley, speaking on behalf of the association, whose membership included women, said that he expected no problems nor did he expect objections by other detectives.  ''The women have fit in very well in their present assignments,'' he said at the time, ''and there is no reason why they should not do well in any future assignments.''  His last assignment before he retired in 1979 was as a detective second grade assigned to the Brooklyn South homicide squad. He is survived by his wife, the former Helena Schultz, 15 children and 10 grandchildren.
