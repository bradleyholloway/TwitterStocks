 Soviet Media's Harder Line on German May Signal Conservative Counterthrust   By By Mark D'Anastasio, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1987  An intensifying Soviet propaganda campaign to paint daredevil pilot Mathias Rust as a possible spy rather than a youthful prankster could mark a political setback for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  Almost overnight, the Soviet media have eased off blaming the military for letting the maverick West German fly his plane unchallenged through Soviet air space and land in Red Square. Instead, the press is now implying he may have had official support in the West for his action. The turnabout could signal that Mr. Gorbachev has lost political control over the affair. Some Western sources speculate that the controversy over the 19-year-old Mr. Rust's stunt may be providing a rallying point for the Soviet leader's numerous opponents in the military, the KGB security police and the party elite.  At first, Mr. Gorbachev moved adroitly to turn the incident to his advantage, creating an impression of decisiveness by firing both his defense minister and air-defense chief. But now his detractors appear to be encouraging a backlash to the idea of blaming Soviet defenses by switching the onus to foreign enemies.
