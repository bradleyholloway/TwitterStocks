Correction Appended A NEW jazz group called the Tentet (despite the fact that it has 11 members) led by Lynn Welshman, a pianist and arranger, is showing an unusually strong combination of imaginative arrangements, polished ensemble performance and distinctive soloists on Sunday evenings at J.P.'s, First Avenue at 76th Street.  Mr. Welshman's arrangements have depth and color and they make perceptive use of Dave Roberts, a bass trombonist with a marvelously dark cavernous sound and an attack that is as vividly dramatic as it is virtuosic.  As source material, Mr. Welshman draws on Thelonious Monk, the Beatles and Keith Jarrett, among others. But even in this company, Mr. Welshman's own composition, ''Pavanne and Stomp'' stands out. The piece, a bit of bright funk, is basically a showcase for Gerry Neiwood, who bears an agitated sense of swing with his piccolo and soprano saxophone solos.  Jim Pugh, who was one of Woody Herman's finest trombonists, contributes some brilliantly slippery solos to the group; and Pete Yellin, a tenor saxophonist, is the driving center of an adaptation of a Count Basie arrangement on which the Tentet projects the impact of the full Basie band. The only weak element in the Tentet is the tinkly sound of Mr. Welshman's electric keyboard. John S. Wilson Correction: March 30, 1981, Monday, Late City Final Edition In a review of a jazz group, Tentet, in The Times on Thursday, the name of the bass trombonist was given incorrectly. It was Dave Taylor.
