 New Orders: After Four Years in the Rear, Boeing Is Set to Jet Past Airbus; U.S. Giant Thrives With Plane Built for the Post-9/11 Era, While Archrival Scrambles; A 24-Hour Engine Change; By J. Lynn Lunsford and Daniel Michaels   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2005  Air Canada Chief Executive Robert Milton calls the Boeing 787 a "game changer." Just a few years ago, he appeared in an Airbus sales video saying anyone flying non-Airbus planes would be "left in the dust." Swayed by Boeing's pricing and promises of operating efficiency, Air Canada in late April announced plans to replace its entire long-range fleet of mainly Airbus planes with Boeing jets. "We were totally outmaneuvered at Air Canada," Mr. [John Leahy] says.  Mr. Leahy says while Boeing's bounce caught Airbus off guard, his competitor is "a little unfocused, chasing every deal" and "buying market share" -- criticisms Boeing has long leveled at Airbus. "Basically, they've won the PR game" on the 787, Mr. Leahy says. The sales boss admits his new plane is about a year late.  "Scrambling from a position of second place has been a powerful motivator," says Scott Carson, a longtime Boeing executive who took over as chief salesman in December. He says years of cutting costs have enabled his company to offer better prices. He denies Mr. Leahy's assertion that Boeing is doing unprofitable deals. "Airbus is always below us on price," Mr. Carson says. "Always."
