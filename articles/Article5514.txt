 Clinton unveils anticrime bill calling for tighter gun controls, more police   By Birnbaum, Jeffrey H, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1993  An anticrime bill unveiled by President Clinton is discussed. The bill would stiffen gun-control laws and put 50,000 more police on the streets, a "down payment" on his pledge to add 100,000 police officers. Clinton has also suspended importation of assault-style handguns and ordered a government review of the regulations concerning gun sales.
