 Morgan Stanley puts more in stock than in the title   By Raghavan, Anita, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1997  In the new Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Co, it is Dean Witter's Philip J. Purcell who has the top titles of chairman and CEO. But it's the Morgan Stanley executives who will hold one key measure of the power at the merged firm. Morgan Stanley Group insiders, who own 40% of Morgan Stanley in the form of restricted stock, options and other compensation, will have an 18% stake in the combined company once the $10.22 billion merger announced on Feb 5, 1997 is completed.
