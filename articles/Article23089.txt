 For Some Home Buyers, a Nice Hedge   By Nasaw, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  The Syracuse program, called Home Equity Protection, protects about $4.6 million in home equity against declines in the value of an index of local house prices. It sells protection of as much as 150% of a home's assessed value for a one-time fee of 1.5% of the value protected, which Home HeadQuarters Inc., the program's not-for-profit administrator, can finance for low-income homeowners. There are no income limitations, although slightly less than half the program's 66 policyholders make less than $32,000 a year. The program is open to first-time homeowners and those who previously owned homes.  Prof. [Barry Nalebuff] says "I think it's a wild success. . . . We have people who literally say 'I was going to leave and sell my house, but now the program is there and I'm staying.' "
