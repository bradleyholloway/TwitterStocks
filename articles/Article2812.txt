 Lott Calls for Cut In the Tax Rate On Capital Gains   By By John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2001  Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the president-elect, said Mr. [George W. Bush] prefers to stick with his own tax proposals, which concentrate on across-the-board income-tax relief. Mr. Bush has "focused on those areas that he believes are the top priorities," Mr. Fleischer said. Mr. [Trent Lott]'s proposal came in an interview aired over the weekend on CNN's "Evans, Novak, Hunt & Shields." Mr. Lott called for cutting the basic capital-gains rate to 15% from the current 20%, citing the short-term economic boost it would provide. "The last time we did it, we had another spurt in the economy," he noted, referring to the 1997 cut to 20% from the previous 28%.
