 Dollar Ends Mixed After Central Banks Intervene to Reverse Earlier Advances   By By Christy Hale, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1989  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, seven European central banks and Bank of Canada knocked the dollar off its intraday high of 1.8878 marks with dollar sales during the European afternoon.  Most market participants had overbought dollars after Friday's U.S. employment data showed a large increase in nonfarm payrolls, dealers said. Little news emerged from last week's meeting in Washington of monetary officials from the Group of Seven nations to indicate the group would strongly oppose a higher dollar. As a result, most market participants left those positions intact over the weekend.  In late trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8713 marks, down from 1.8788 marks late Friday in New York. The U.S. currency also was quoted at 129.38 yen, up slightly from 129.33 yen. Sterling fell to $1.7385, from $1.7420 late Friday.
