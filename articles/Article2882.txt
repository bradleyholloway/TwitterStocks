 House of the Week: Built on a Battlefield   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 2001  Due Diligence: This three-story home, built in 1925, is in Sunset Hills, one of Kansas City's priciest neighborhoods. But the area isn't just home to expensive real estate, it was also the site of the Battle of Westport in 1864. The Civil War battle, which involved some 29,000 Union and Confederate troops, was the largest engagement on the nation's then-western border and later became known as the "Gettysburg of the West." History-minded tourists equipped with metal detectors flock to nearby Loose Park in search of musket balls and other relics from the battle, and local children often go on similar expeditions in their yards.
