 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2005; Foreign Offerings Spice Up the IPO Market China's 3 Popular Issuances Dominate the Top 10 Deals; The U.S. Gets Shut Out   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2006  Although the U.S. stock market briefly rallied in February and again in November, IPO flow was affected by lackluster trends for much of the year. "I think the marginal stock-market performance certainly weighed on IPO issuance," says Matt Johnson, global head of equity syndicate at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. He said IPO issuance in 2006 could be just as challenging in the U.S. as it was in 2005.  "Russia will continue to be a focus. The Middle East will also be active, because all the oil revenue from this year is going to need to be recycled into the local economy," Mr. [Paul Raphael] says. "I think next year we will see IPOs from 'new' countries, such as the Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia. These are countries you wouldn't have imagined listing stocks on exchanges a few years ago."  Although the U.S. IPO market didn't perform as well as other regions, bankers say that in the context of a difficult stock market, deal flow was better than expected. "IPOs outperformed the broader market indices, and that makes investors more eager to look at the next deal coming down the pipeline. I think that will continue in 2006," Mr. [Quinten Stevens] says.
