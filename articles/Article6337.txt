 Scientists Report Diabetes-Research Advances   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2000  Researchers at the University of California at San Diego said they developed in the laboratory a line of human cells that make insulin. They then transplanted some of the cells into rodents where they functioned like normal insulin-producing cells called beta cells. The achievement is a crucial early step toward producing unlimited quantities of such cells so patients won't have to wait for organ donations.  One potential problem: Coaxing the beta cells into growing outside the body required making them behave like proliferating cancer cells. While the researchers then tweaked the biology again to make them function like beta cells, Dr. [Fred Levine] said his group will have to show that the new beta cells won't revert to cancer-like behavior once they are transplanted. Still, he's hopeful that he'll have a cell line to test in humans within four or five years. Several other groups are experimenting with other strategies to develop an unlimited supply of beta cells.  Researchers have long figured that curing Type 1 diabetes would require replacing the destroyed islet cells with islets from a donor. Islets are clumps of cells about the size of a grain of salt that reside in the pancreas and contain beta cells, which secrete insulin. During the 1990s, islet transplants were tried on 267 patients, but just 8% were successful in enabling patients to stop using insulin.
