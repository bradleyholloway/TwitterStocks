 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2005; Underwriting Volume Sustains Record Pace; More Private-Equity Deals, Global Spending Lift Fees, But U.S. Issuance Falls 13%   By Smith, Randall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2006  Some bankers predict U.S. companies will be more adventurous in 2006, which will lead to more underwriting activity. "For five years in a row, corporate America has been repairing its balance sheet" by reducing debt and raising cash, says Raj Dhanda, head of debt capital markets at Morgan Stanley.  Among the biggest IPOs that followed buyouts, according to Dealogic, were Huntsman Corp., which sold $1.59 billion of stock in February, chemical producer Celanese Corp., which sold $800 million of stock in January, Warner Music Group Inc, which sold $554 million in May, and commodities broker Refco Inc., which sold $583 million in August. Refco showed there can be risks in a quick-flip resale. Refco's private-equity sponsor, Thomas H. Lee Partners, invested $453 million in a mid-2004 buyout, then took Refco public a year later. Refco was forced to seek bankruptcy-law protection from creditors within just three months, in October, after the company said the former chief executive had hidden bad debts.  With overseas stock markets outperforming those in the U.S. for 2005, investors are "finding greater growth opportunities in many foreign markets and emerging markets," said Jeff Bunzel, head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Credit Suisse First Boston. David Topper, head of equity capital markets at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., called a late-year spate of IPOs in biotechnology and overseas technology "a sign of market life."
