 The Ghost of Social Security   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  Granted, investing involves risk, but it also generates returns and, in this case, returns are doubly attractive. First, rates of return from even a conservatively diversified portfolio will out-pace returns to be had from Social Security over the long term. Second, the assets from which those returns flow are owned by the investor, not subject to political exigencies of government "ownership." (Yikes! Talk about risk.)  Accordingly, the number of workers supporting each Social Security dependent has dropped like a stone. It was 41 in 1940; then fell to 16 in 1950, and to 3.4 workers in 1998. Economists estimate the number is going to fall to 2.1 by 2030. Fewer workers supporting more dependents meant that workers have had to ante up more and more of their wages. Way back when, the payroll tax was 2% on income of $3,000; it's now 12.4% on income of $68,400. And the real rate of return for a single male born in 1960 and retiring in 2025 has collapsed to 0.97%.  In a word, I have become a huge tax-funded Ponzi scheme that is starting to go seedy -- and I am starting to look it, too. All the beneficiaries are bulging my belly over my waistband, the declining number of workers supporting the dependents are making my jacket bag around the shoulders and the increasingly skimpy rates of return are creating a gap between my cuffs and my shoes.
