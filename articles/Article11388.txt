 Long-Term Bond Rates Push Higher --- Anxieties Over Oil, Inflation Send Buyers To Short-Term Issues   By By Constance Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1990  Investors, worried about the inflationary impact of rising oil prices, are shying away from buying long-term Treasury bonds, driving long-term interest rates higher.  Yields on two-year Treasury notes have fallen sharply in recent weeks and now are about 7.8%. Meanwhile, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds have risen slightly to about 8.56%. The difference between the short-term and the long-term yields, which is called the yield spread, is about 3/4 percentage point. Ms. [Maria Fiorini] Ramirez said the spread is likely to widen to one full percentage point.  The yield curve had been slowly steepening for several weeks as short-term interest rates fell faster than long-term rates. But last week, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, investors made a mad dash for short-term Treasury securities, buying up three-month and six-month bills as well as two-year, three-year and five-year Treasury notes.
