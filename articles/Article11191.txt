 More Art: Christmas Books: A Holiday Sampler   By By Jack Flam, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1988  Although it may seem that just about everything that can be written about the impressionists already has been, this is most definitely not the case -- as is beautifully demonstrated in Robert L. Herbert's "Impressionism: Art, Leisure and Parisian Society" (Yale University Press, 324 pages, $50; $60 after Jan. 1). Mr. Herbert masterfully balances his discussion of the social background of impressionist painting with illuminating analyses of individual works. Along the way he explains and clarifies a number of things about the relationship between life and art in late 19th-century France. The color illustrations are especially fine, and include details of numerous paintings, which allow us to see impressionist brushwork as if from up close. This is a landmark in its field.  One of the loveliest books of the season is "Degas" (Harry N. Abrams, 228 pages, $67.50; $75 after Jan. 1) by Robert Gordon and Andrew Forge. It is arranged by themes in Degas's paintings -- theater, horses and riders, portraits, bathers and dancers. Many of the illustrations are rarely reproduced, and they are supported by photographs that document the world of Degas's art and the milieu in which he worked.  Charles Stuckey's "Monet Water Lilies" (Hugh Lauter Levin, 132 pages, $75) is one of those rare books that has a reason for being proportioned like a coffee table. The wide horizontal format provides a sensible way to reproduce Monet's panoramic paintings of his lily pond at Giverny. The numerous color illustrations -- including 36 pages of foldouts -- evoke Monet's large and elusive paintings quite well. They are accompanied by a brief but informative introduction and by black-and-white photos of Monet at work.
