 AOL Time Warner Transition Won't Damp Colossal Cable Ambitions --- Parsons Affirms Commitment To AT&T Broadband Bid   By By Deborah Solomon and Martin Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  Designated yesterday as successor to AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin next May, Mr. [Richard Parsons], now co-chief operating officer, will need that smooth touch more than ever as AOL pursues a merger of Time Warner Cable with AT&T Broadband. Mr. Parsons is leading those negotiations "and will probably continue to even through the transition period," he said in an interview yesterday.  A merger with AT&T Broadband could divert some of that cash flow. Under the bid AOL has proposed, AT&T would spin off its cable division and simultaneously merge it with Time Warner Cable. For the transaction to be tax-free, AT&T shareholders would need to own at least 50% of the combined company, and AOL would own 40% to 45%. Under these terms. AOL would only get a portion of the revenue and cash from the business.  AOL Time Warner and AT&T have also been in talks for months about AT&T's interest in selling its stake in Time Warner Entertainment, a joint partnership. But it is the merger of the cable units that has taken center stage. Reaffirming his commitment to pursuing the merger, he said: "We are believers in the cable platform, always have been, and have been engaged in discussions with AT&T going back almost a year now about how we restructure our relationship with them."
