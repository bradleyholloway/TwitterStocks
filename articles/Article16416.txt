 Raggedy Stocks Could Bring Riches   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 4, 2004  "Everyone is buying Wal-Mart and selling short Winn-Dixie, and that makes sense," says Erik Hess, an analyst at International Strategy & Investment. "Ultimately, Wal-Mart squeezes out Winn-Dixie."  "While everyone has turned negative on management, we look at underlying earnings power. They should earn $4 a share" eventually, says Mr. [John Goetz], whose firm owns some shares of Washington Mutual and may buy more now that it has been marked down. "It probably won't happen next year, though," so investors probably would need to stick with the stock for the long haul to profit.  In general, Mr. Goetz argues, it can pay off buying stocks that others despise, in spite of the clear risks of such an approach. "You can't buy these stocks in a mindless way," he says. "But separating the sinking ships from the temporary problems" leads to profits.
