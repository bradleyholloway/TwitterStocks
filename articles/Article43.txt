HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 16â€” Marian Nixon, who was Spencer Tracy's first leading lady and the wife of the late director William Seiter, died two days after undergoing open heart surgery. A spokesman for the actress said Tuesday that she died Sunday night in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  She was 78 years old.  She made her motion-picture debut in 1925 in the silent film ''Riders of the Purple Sage,'' starring Tom Mix. In 1926 she made ''What Happened to Jones,'' directed by Mr. Seiter, who died in 1964. She married him in 1934 -following several films that they made together, including ''Rolling Home,'' ''Out All Night,'' ''Chance at Heaven'' and ''We're Rich Again'' - and the following year left show business to raise a family. Miss Nixon played opposite Tracy in ''Face in the Sky,'' his first leading role in 1933, and she performed with several other young actors of the era, including Al Jolson, James Cagney and Joel McCrea. She also had the title role in the 1932 version of ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.'' Her other films included ''Devil's Island,'' ''Show of Shows,'' ''Charlie Chan's Chance,'' ''Winner Takes All'' and ''Walking Down Broadway.''  After Seiter's death, Miss Nixon married the actor Ben Lyon, who died in 1979.
