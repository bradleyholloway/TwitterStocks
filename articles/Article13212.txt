 Hurricanes' Effects on Oil, Gas Trickle Down to Other Products   By Mary Ellen Lloyd, Timothy Aeppel and Kemba J. Dunham, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2005  August's Hurricane Katrina and September's Hurricane Rita shut down most offshore Gulf of Mexico production of oil and natural gas, both of which serve as a feedstock for chemicals and plastics. The hurricanes also hindered chemical factories and refineries and have bogged down key transportation routes in an era of thin, just-in-time inventories at many companies.  On Tuesday, Citigroup slashed its rating on shares of auto-parts supplier Lear Corp. to "sell" from "hold," and cut its price target to $28, citing headwinds from higher resin prices and potential near-term shortages of foam for seats. Andrea Puchalsky, a spokeswoman for Lear in Southfield, Mich., said, "There is tremendous price pressure on foam products because of the run-up in resin prices, but we are not currently experiencing any supply issues."  Aad van Heijden, a vice president at Cabot Corp., the world's largest maker of carbon black, said that two of the company's five plants in North America were affected by the hurricane, both of them in Louisiana. One of the plants was shut down only during the storm and is now back in full operation, but the other was flooded and still isn't back on line. Cabot declared force majeure -- the contract clause that kicks in following acts of God or unavoidable accidents -- and has had to slow deliveries to some customers, said Mr. van Heijden. "Because we have long-term contracts, we have to make sure our customers understand that there might be a problem."
