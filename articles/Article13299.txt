 We Must Fight Against the Tyranny of Kelo   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2006  Scott Bullock's commentary was a welcome reminder of the havoc wreaked by the Supreme Court in Kelo v. City of New London and it is to the credit of The Wall Street Journal that the anniversary of this truly outrageous injustice did not go unrecognized ("The Specter of Condemnation," Rule of Law, June 24). Our private property rights are threatened today not just from eminent domain abuse but from regulatory takings such as the Endangered Species Act, as well as by local government telling us which legal activities, such as smoking, we can and cannot engage in while on the premises of private businesses.
