 Welcome to Europe, Mr. Ashcroft   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2001  In the interest of comity and practicality, the U.S. has agreed not to seek the death penalty in some extradition cases. Would that Europe showed comparable accommodation. If the death penalty so offends them, perhaps Parisians would be willing to take the terrorists back after their U.S. conviction and be responsible for their imprisonment. Or, if the French are in a paying mood, maybe they'd reimburse the cost of lifetime incarceration stateside, along with some payments to judges who need the lifetime protection of federal marshals after presiding over terror trials.  Among his contacts was Ramsi Binalshibh, a Yemeni who investigators think would have been the 20th terrorist had he been able to get a U.S. visa, which he failed to do four times. Mr. Binalshibh wired $14,000 to [Zacarias Moussaoui] a month before September 11, which would have helped pay for the $6,300 fee at the flight school. The Yemeni also wired money to one of the hijackers. His number was in Mr. Moussaoui's personal address book.  It's charming that Europeans are worried about an outbreak of American fascism, though we'd point out that the real version always seems to pop up on their side of the pond. But confronting the U.S. on this issue will have lasting and damaging effect on trans-Atlantic ties. Spain has walked point against military tribunals, so it shouldn't expect help bailing out its banks if they go under in Argentina. The Bosnian peacekeepers might very well have to do without the U.S. Army. And forget about a European defense force using U.S. airlift.
