 Bracing for Disaster; Insurers Require Homeowners to Make Expensive Upgrades To Protect Property; Using Google Earth for Inspections   By McQueen, M P, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2007  Tracy L. Butler, a 44-year-old Realtor in Oakland, Calif., where wildfires destroyed thousands of homes in 1991, says she received notice a few months ago that Allstate was dropping her policy at the end of her annual term because her property hadn't been properly cleared of overgrowth. Ms. Butler says Allstate had checked the property just before she prepared for the city's own fire-safety inspection, required by local law. After a new inspection, Allstate reinstated her policy, she says.  State Farm, which began inspecting homes in California, Arizona and a few other states in 2003, recently expanded the program to five additional states, including Montana and Oregon. Its agents look for dead vegetation and debris or fuel stored near the home, flammable roofing and other hazards. Homes that aren't considered fire-safe get 18 to 29 months to have the necessary changes made. If they aren't, State Farm may drop the policies, but a spokesman says the bulk of homeowners thus far have complied with insurer recommendations and kept their coverage.  Meanwhile, in hurricane-prone areas in the East, some insurers are requiring that houses be equipped to withstand heavy winds. The Florida legislature recently passed a bill requiring many homes valued at $750,000 or more to have permanent storm shutters within two years as a condition of receiving a policy from Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-run insurer that covers a majority of homes in Florida. The bill is awaiting the governor's signature. And Privilege Underwriters Inc., a new insurer that covers high-end homes in the state, says it refuses to accept any property that isn't built to 2001 state building codes for high-wind resistance.
