 Dollar Drops On Uncertainty About Mexico --- Traders Still Apprehensive About Whether Nation Can Meet Foreign Debt   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1986  In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 2.2085 West German marks, down from 2.2200 marks the day before. The currency fell to 166.25 yen from 167.25. The British pound rose to $1.5285 from $1.5190.  In early trading in Tokyo Thursday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 165.95 yen from 166.25 in New York yesterday afternoon.  In Washington, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker told the House Government Operations Committee that a Mexican default or missed debt payments would be "manageable" for the U.S. banking system. But he cautioned that the debt problems of the major developing countries are interrelated and that the outcome of the Mexican situation probably will influence the resolution of similar problems in other debtor nations such as Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Nigeria.
