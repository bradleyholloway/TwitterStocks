 Futures Markets: 'Weather Scare' Spurs Moderate Price Gains In Corn and Soybeans   By By Marj Charlier, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1985  Record heat and dryness in the southeastern U.S. and some corn-producing regions sparked the first "weather scare" of the season in the grain markets, sending corn and soybean futures prices moderately higher.  Drought in Georgia, the Carolinas and Mississippi is threatening to extend into crop-producing regions of Iowa and Illinois, meteorologists said, easing fears of a burdensome harvest. Although farmers have planted an abundant soybean crop, "It'll amount to so much birdfeed if it doesn't get the rain to make it germinate," said Robert Lekberg, analyst in Chicago for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.  Corn futures for July delivery rose two cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday to $2.7775, and soybeans for July delivery rose 9.5 cents a bushel to $5.7725. Soybean oil for delivery in July, also boosted by the weather news, rose the daily permissible limit of one cent a pound to 31.29 cents. Wheat for July delivery fell 2.25 cents a bushel to $3.2025.
