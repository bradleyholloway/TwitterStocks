 Fund Proves Looks Can Deceive --- Hotchkis & Wiley Mid-Cap Attains Relative Success With Dubious Holdings   By By Desiree J. Hanford, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2003  The fund's larger holdings include Computer Associates International Inc. and Eastman Kodak Co., companies that have attracted considerable negative attention in recent years. But it isn't that the Hotchkis & Wiley fund is looking for every company with negative news and saying, "let's own it," said Stan Majcher, lead manager of the $355 million fund. The fund seeks "securities that are misunderstood or which people dismiss outright without much analysis," he said.  The money-management firm was attracted to Kodak for several reasons, Mr. Majcher said. When Hotchkis & Wiley ran its analysis, it discovered Kodak's growth in emerging-market film sales offsets declines in sales from mature markets. Also, Kodak is in an oligopolistic business and companies in those situations tend to work out their problems because there fewer players, Mr. Majcher said.  After running screens, Mr. Majcher said other factors are taken into account that aren't picked up by the screens, such as off-balance-sheet debt or asbestos liability. In-house research also is used in looking at stocks, and Mr. Majcher said he and others who consider possibilities try to get past the consensus about an equity and instead put the focus on the long term.
