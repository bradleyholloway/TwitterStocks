 Deals & Deal Makers: Merrill Considers Eliminating 2,000 Jobs In Brokerage Division in Bid to Cut Costs   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2000  So far this year, Merrill shares have jumped 48%, more than double the 21% rise in the Dow Jones Securities Brokers Index. Yesterday, Merrill shares surged $6, or 5.1%, to a 52-week high of $124 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid speculation that it was in takeover talks. A Merrill spokesman declined to comment on any talks.  Indeed, Merrill surpasses its rivals in a widely watched gauge of expenses on Wall Street. Analysts estimate that Merrill's pay and benefits this year will represent about 52% of net revenue -- far higher than 39% at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and 49% at Goldman Sachs Group.  Merrill's move is unusual. For years, Wall Street firms largely have followed a boom-and-bust cycle. So Merrill, like many of its rivals, has beefed up its staff in good times, often waiting for downturns in the business before making drastic cuts. Now Merrill is planning to cut professional positions when the markets are relatively calm. One other firm, Bear Stearns, also is looking to slash costs through a "firmwide review" of expenses, according to an internal company memo, though Bear officials say they have no plans for layoffs.
