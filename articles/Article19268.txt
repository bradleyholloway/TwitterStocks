 Feuding Russia Aluminum Chiefs Discuss Peace, Possible Alliance   By By Jeanne Whalen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2000  The unlikely union of bitterly divided business rivals marks the second shake-up in Russia's aluminum industry this year and comes one week after the election of Vladimir Putin as Russia's new president. Russia is the world's second-biggest aluminum producer, behind the U.S. Output last year grew 4.7% to 3.5 million metric tons.  "There are three-way consultations taking place among certain shareholders of AO Sibneft, Siberian Aluminum Group and Alfa Group," said a spokesman for AO Sibneft, Russia's seventh-biggest oil company. "The talks could lead to an alliance, a strategic partnership or nothing at all. The point of the consultations is to avoid confrontation on the market in light of serious structural changes that have taken place."  A feud over alumina ore supply has prompted the peace talks. Two big shareholders in oil company Sibneft, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, shook the aluminum market last month by buying controlling stakes in Russia's two biggest smelters in the Siberian regions of Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk. But their rival, Siberian Aluminum, responded by snapping up the huge Mykolayevsky ore plant in Ukraine, leaving Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich vulnerable to ore shortages.
