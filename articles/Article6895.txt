 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus: The Good Life Goes On Tour   By Kaminski, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2005  The U.S. will be the world's top consumer of wine by 2008, passing France, according to a new study for the Vinexpo wine fair in Bordeaux. That same year, Americans will drink 28% more wine than they did in 2003; the French, 7.4% less. With wine consumption down nearly 40% since 1970, France will also cede its top spot in glasses per capita to Italy.  With a large dose of northern European, Asian and African stock, Americans aren't naturally wine people. Beer still accounts for nearly 90% of all alcohol consumption. Forty years ago milk -- a joke to this day in Europe -- was more likely to accompany a fine piece of beef than a glass of red. Wine consumption stayed flat from the end of World War II until the 1970s and only really took off in the mid- 1990s, according to Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, a consulting firm. Last year, 278 million cases were sold in the U.S., the most ever. The market share of imported wine -- 26% -- also hit a record high. Red wine sales are up 124% since 1991.  My local Paris wine shop -- once exclusively French -- not long ago started to market the Gallo Brothers as exotic foreign fare. Meanwhile, Germans are souring on beer. Last month, two large breweries went bust, a first in recent memory. The average German now drinks 123 liters of bottled water a year, and "only" 117 of beer. In Poland and Russia, the cradle of the really hard stuff, beer is up and vodka down. In the U.S., vodka is hot.
