 MEDICINE & HEALTH (A Special Report): Fixing It --- A Racial Imbalance   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 1990  Cases like Mr. Jones's represent a disturbing countertrend to U.S. advances against heart disease. Efforts to cut hypertension and other risk factors, coupled with better treatments, have sharply lowered the heart-disease death rate since the mid-1960s. But blacks aren't sharing equally in the gains.  Around 1979 the decline in heart-disease mortality began to level off among blacks while continuing for whites, according to a 1988 study by the National Center for Health Statistics. In a grim reminder of that disparity, researchers recently reported that black men in New York's Harlem district were less likely to live to age 65 than men in Bangladesh. Murder, alcohol and drugs caused many of their early deaths, according to the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But the leading cause was cardiovascular disease.  Surveys have shown that the smoking rate among black men is 8% to 9% higher than among white men, although the rates have been dropping for both groups. Another factor may be diet: In one survey, a third of inner-city black mothers said frying was their first choice among methods of preparing food. About half of black women and a third of black men in the U.S. are overweight -- a risk factor for heart disease -- compared with about a fourth of white men and women, according to federal statistics.
