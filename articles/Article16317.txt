 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: Big Illumination In Small Packages   By Lipton, Lauren, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2003  Store/Price/Phone: Brookstone; Microbeam keychain flashlight; $20; 800-351-7222; www.brookstone.com Quality: Best Overall. Great-looking, simple to use, with a stay-on switch and beam that lit up our dark yard. (No SOS or strobe function, though). Tiny: 1 1/2" long, 1" wide, 1/4" thick. Shipping Cost/Time: $5.95 standard shipping; five to seven business days. Our next-day air order was late. (Company partially refunded shipping.) Return Policy: Within 60 days for refund; credit or exchange after that. You pay shipping unless company erred; or return to Brookstone store. Phone/Web Experience: Ordering was a breeze. Comment: Site sells a $25, multicolor-beam version of this light. Store/Price/Phone: Karst Sports; CMG O-4 Mini Task Light; $9.95; 800-734-2851; www.karstsports.com Quality: Best Value, with limitations: Slightly wider and fatter (1 1/2" x 1 1/4" x 3/8") than the Photon and Brookstone lights, it beamed to more than 200 feet but not as brightly. Shipping Cost/Time: Standard shipping, one to five business days, $4.95. Return Policy: Within 30 days, in new condition. If item is defective company will provide return postage. Phone/Web Experience: Customer-service rep told us over the phone, "we've just sold tons" since the big blackout. "Before, we hardly sold any." Comment: Site is currently sold out, but manufacturer's site, www.cmgequipment.com, lists other online retailers. We liked Flashlights 4 Less, which has it "4 less" ($7.95). Store/Price/Phone: Flashlights 4 Less; PALights Survival; $15.50; 931-801-1146; www.flashlights4less.com Quality: The best and brightest performance, but at 3 1/4" long and an inch thick, with a nine-volt battery for power, better for glove box than keychain. Shipping Cost/Time: Standard shipping, five to 10 business days, $3.85. Return Policy: Within 30 days, with receipt and in original packaging, for refund. You pay return shipping unless company erred. Phone/Web Experience: Service award: Our original pick was sold out, so site's owner called to suggest this as an alternative -- and got it to us in a day. Comment: Tennessee shop also sells Photon Micro-Light and CMG Task Light. Store/Price/Phone: PhotonLight.com; Photon Micro-Light 3; $20.95; 877-584-6898; www.photonlight.com Quality: Even smaller than our Best Overall choice, it has seven modes including "SOS" and power-saver, but isn't hands-free.
