 Politics & Economics: Disclosures Could Undermine Libby Case; Revelations That Cheney's Ex-Aide Wasn't Original Source of Leak May Hinder Prosecution   By McKinnon, John D, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2006  "In some ways it [the [Richard Armitage] disclosure] undercuts the government's case as a whole," said Dan Richman, a former federal prosecutor and colleague of Mr. [Patrick Fitzgerald] who is now a Fordham University law professor. But, he added, "if the focus of the trial is properly kept on what [Lewis "Scooter" Libby] was doing and what was in Libby's mind, the Armitage disclosures are irrelevant," and therefore inadmissible.  Prosecutors have suggested in court pleadings that Mr. Libby lied to investigators to conceal a White House effort to leak Ms. [Valerie Plame]'s identity. At the time, prosecutors say, Mr. [Cheney] was "upset that his personal credibility had been attacked" by Ms. Plame's husband, former diplomat Joseph Wilson, then an emerging critic of the war in Iraq. The vice president was urging Mr. Libby to "get out 'all' the facts," including spreading the story that a CIA fact-finding trip Mr. Wilson made was in fact a junket arranged by his wife, according to prosecution filings in the case.  After the federal probe began, Mr. Armitage quickly informed federal investigators of his role, but failed to disclose the conversation with Mr. [Bob Woodward]. Mr. Fitzgerald's erroneous statement at the news conference that Mr. Libby was the first leaker led Mr. Armitage to reveal to prosecutors that he had had the earlier conversation with Mr. Woodward. For nearly three years, Mr. Armitage withheld information about his role from the public, at the request of Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Armitage said publicly he was Mr. [Robert Novak]'s original source after publication last month of "Hubris," a book by Michael Isikoff and David Corn about how the administration made its case for the war in Iraq.
