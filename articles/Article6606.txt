 Volkswagen Urges Scania and MAN to Reach an Amicable Deal   By Jason Singer in London, and Christoph Rauwald and Stephen Power in Frankfurt, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2006  The Volkswagen CEO said that he wants negotiating teams from both sides to propose a new deal to replace the cash-and-stock bid made by MAN that was rejected by Scania as well as Volkswagen and Swedish investment firm Investor AB, Scania's second-largest shareholder. He suggested the teams take no longer than four weeks to reach a conclusion.  Mr. [Bernd Pischetsrieder]'s conference call was the first time he has outlined his views since Volkswagen became the key shareholder in both the bidder and the target. He said his comments were made as Volkswagen's CEO and not as chairman of Scania, a position he also holds. He said he has recused himself from Scania board meetings because of his conflicting interests. Mr. Pischetsrieder refused to take questions from reporters during the call.
