 Leading the News: FCC to Ease Spectrum-Auction Snarl --- Wireless Firms Will Be Freed From $16 Billion in Bids For NextWave Licenses   By By Yochi J. Dreazen and Jesse Drucker, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2002  At issue are dozens of spectrum licenses that the government reclaimed from NextWave Telecom Inc. when the company filed for bankruptcy protection before paying the $4.7 billion it bid for the spectrum in 1996. The FCC reauctioned the spectrum last year, only to see the results of the auction nullified by an appellate-court decision, ordering the agency to return the spectrum to NextWave. A settlement calling for NextWave to transfer the licenses to the winning bidders fell apart last year, and all parties are waiting for the Supreme Court to decide the matter.  Privately, FCC officials concede that the agency was driven by high-level concern about the wireless industry's condition. FCC spokeswoman Robin Pence declined to comment on the expected move, and NextWave spokesman Michael Wack also declined to comment.  The FCC decision could have a dramatic impact on Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC, which successfully bid about $8 billion for numerous NextWave licenses. In May, Moody's Investors Service put Verizon Communications and Verizon Wireless on review for a possible downgrade, citing, among other factors, the uncertainty surrounding the money bid for those licenses.
