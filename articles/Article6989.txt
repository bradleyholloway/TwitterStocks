 Masterpiece: God's Manmade Handiwork; Olmsted and Vaux's democratic model of an urban retreat took decades of effort   By Kimball, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2005  Well, that's what I once thought, too. I wasn't alone. Horace Greeley visited the park when it was under construction in the early 1860s. "They have let it alone better than I thought they would," Greeley reported. But in fact [Frederick Law Olmsted] and Vaux (the name rhymes with "box") left almost nothing alone. "We concealed the processes from him," [Calvert Vaux] wrote in 1865. "But there were processes and nearly all was intended and foreseen."  Olmsted and Vaux were both visionaries. In the 19th century, the word "park" still had connotations of privilege and exclusion. It used to be that a park was a royal hunting ground, or a rural fastness enclosed by aristocratic prerogative. Central Park offered a new, democratic model of urban retreat. "It is one of the great purposes of the Park," Olmsted boasted, "to supply to the hundreds and thousands of tired workers . . . a specimen of God's handiwork that shall be to them, inexpensively, what a month or two in the White Mountains or the Adirondacks is, at great cost, to those in easier circumstances."  The reference to "God's handiwork" was not gratuitous. Olmsted and Vaux were both infused with a sense of the divinity of nature. Like the artists of the Hudson River School, or the great Victorian critic John Ruskin, they looked to art to provide a palimpsest for nature's sublimities, themselves tokens of a transcendent panoply of significances. God, Vaux wrote, was the park's real contractor: He and Olmsted were mere lieutenants discharging the plan as best they could.
