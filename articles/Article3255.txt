 International -- A Global Journal Report: Closed Pocketbooks Abroad Imperil Recovery   By Christopher Rhoads in Berlin and Sebastian Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 2004  Although growth is picking up in the world's major economies outside the U.S., consumers in Europe and Japan still aren't pitching in.  Fourth-quarter consumption expanded 0.2% in the euro zone from the previous quarter, according to a Barclays Capital estimate. That is up slightly from the third quarter's 0.1% growth. "More than ever, euro- area growth has to rely on an improvement in domestic demand," said Julian Callow, European economist with Barclays Capital in London. "But it's not rising to the challenge."  Mr. Callow and other economists expected a surge in consumption in the final months of 2003 and in the beginning of this year, driven by a brightening outlook and pent-up demand from the hot summer when consumers slowed their buying. That hasn't happened. European auto sales in January increased at an annualized rate of 10.7 million cars, a slower pace than December's 11.3 million increase, according to Barclays.
