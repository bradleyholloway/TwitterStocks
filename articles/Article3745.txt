 Political Surge   By Strassel, Kimberley A, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2007  Then there are those Republicans who'd like to have Mr. [Bush]'s job. Sen. John McCain stands to get the biggest bump, and his team is already noting that it was the Arizonan who for "four years" "consistently advocated for a new strategy in Iraq" -- meaning, of the sort today yielding success. But in general, Gen. [David Petraeus]'s testimony has given other GOP candidates, in particular Rudy Giuliani, a chance to remind voters that he's stood for success in Iraq all along and that his Democratic opponents haven't.  Don't think it hasn't occurred to Democratic presidential contenders that their political terrain is also shifting, and uncomfortably. The likely effect of the Petraeus report is to buy the Bush administration another six or nine months in Iraq. Even if the general feels confident enough to follow through on his initial withdrawal proposals, an estimated 130,000 U.S. troops will remain on Iraqi soil come next summer or fall. Should the Democrats win the White House, those troops will be their responsibility. And they'll also take the blame if they cave to a politically motivated withdrawal that results in an Iraq that descends back into chaos. This unpalatable thought helps explain the bombs Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were lobbing at Gen. Petraeus this week.  Republicans would do well to absorb the military-success lesson, and quickly, because big challenges remain. The John Warners and Chuck Hagels of the world aren't yet ready to relinquish their self- proclaimed roles as "brave" GOP war dissenters; expect them to team up with Democrats on creative legislative language that might yet tie the military's hands. An even bigger challenge for Republicans will be to find the courage to follow President Bush's lead and make clear to the American public that true success in Iraq may involve a troop presence for many years.
