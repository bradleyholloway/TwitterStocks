 World-Wide [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1986  The Libyan operations are in apparent response to renewed U.S. Sixth Fleet activity in the disputed waters off the Libyan coast. The Defense Department said the U.S. naval maneuvers were "routine exercises."

The kidnapping on Mindanao island came one day after 10 Filipino Roman Catholic nuns were abducted from a nearby convent. Responsibility wasn't claimed, but military officials suspected that the gunmen were Moslem terrorists seeking to embarrass the Aquino government. In Manila, riot police chased supporters of deposed leader Marcos to prevent them from holding a rally.  The Air Force maintained tight security over a wide area of a national forest in California where what is believed to have been a top-secret Stealth fighter jet crashed Friday. The pilot was killed in the crash. The Air Force's refusal to provide routine crash data seemed to lend credence to speculation that the plane was a Stealth fighter.
