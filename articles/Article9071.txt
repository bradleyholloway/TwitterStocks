 In Albania, Bandits And Killers Welcome Displaced of Kosovo --- Medieval Tract Governs Life, Including Blood Feuds; --- `This Is a Fellini Movie'   By By Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  Indeed, in recent days, local gangsters have evinced a growing sense of solidarity and used their talents to help welcome the ethnic-Albanian deportees from Kosovo, the ravaged Yugoslav province a few miles away. When a first wave of 3,000 refugees walked into Bajram Curri last weekend, armed youths roared up in a blue truck stolen from a German aid agency and began tossing cola, bread and cheese to the cold and hungry Kosovars. "We bought it ourselves," said a thickset young man, who claimed, "I've even taken 10 refugees into my own home."  How long the hospitality will last is an important question. Border towns like Bajram Curri are likely to be the staging grounds for refugee-aid operations and for any Albania-based military campaigns by the U.S. and its allies. Aid workers and soldiers will find the area a treacherous place to work. Chaos has gripped Albania since communism fell in 1991. Things worsened after pyramid schemes wrecked the financial system in 1997, triggering the collapse of the government and anarchic violence that killed 1,500.  When the vendettas became more common in the rising turmoil of recent years and spread to Bajram Curri, population 13,000, the townspeople called on Man Mulosmani, a "standard-bearer," or headman, of the main tribe of the Tropoje region around Bajram Curri. Mr. Mulosmani, who spent the communist years managing a collective farm, concedes that the Kanun needs to be modernized. But he notes that "everybody obeys its rules for vendettas."
