 NATO Plans Troops for Kosovo After Bombing --- Force Totaling 60,000 Could Enter Province As the Serbs Retreat   By By Thomas E. Ricks and Carla Anne Robbins, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1999  The "concept of operations," which allied commander U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark is expected to discuss with President Clinton in Brussels today, isn't a plan for a combat invasion of Kosovo, where 40,000 Yugolsav troops are dug in. Instead, it is an overview of how a "semi-permissive" entry by North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops would be executed once alliance bombing has either shattered Belgrade's political will to continue the war or the Yugoslav military's ability to fight on the ground.  Alliance planners don't know how long it will take to break the Serbs' will. The plan, however, sets a deadline of late July for NATO troops to start moving into Kosovo, mainly because of weather constraints. The plan estimates that it could take as long as six weeks to pacify the province-disarming any remaining hostile troops or civilians-before winter begins to set in, requiring the alliance force to turn most of its attention to a massive humanitarian relief operation.  Most of NATO's political leaders, including President Clinton, continue to insist that they have no intention of sending troops into Kosovo without a political settlement. But late last month, alliance leaders approved a broad-brush reassessment of ground-troop planning, in part to quell critics who were calling for ground forces in Kosovo. Gen. Clark apparently used that "tasking" to draw up these more detailed plans.
