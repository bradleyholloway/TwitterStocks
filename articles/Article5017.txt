 Tiny Drug Company Aims to Get Ads for Birth Control Pills on TV   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1989  Lexis Pharmaceuticals, a tiny Austin, Texas-based drug company, was all set to announce tomorrow that a CBS affiliate in Texas, San Antonio's KENS-TV, had agreed to air ads for its birth control pills. The commercials would have been a first: Not only do they urge women to ask doctors for Lexis's N.E.E. 1/35 pill by name, but they boast that the pill is "up to 50%" cheaper than competing brands. The ads would have shattered longstanding taboos and would have leapt to the forefront of the burgeoning movement to advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers.  All three major networks and Fox, among others, had firmly nixed Lexis's proposed TV ads. KENS-TV, however, gave the nod and agreed to a six-week run of the ads in time periods after 10:30 p.m., starting tomorrow.  Lexis conferred with its attorneys and KENS-TV over the weekend to try to persuade the station to reverse itself. The station did decide to review its decision today, Mr. Bryer said, but he added he isn't optimistic. Whatever the outcome, the pharmaceutical industry will be watching closely. Lexis is a tiny player in the industry. It controls less than 1% of the $900 million birth control pill market and just 3% to 4% of the $200 million market for its type of pill. Yet it is a swashbuckling pioneer in the advertising of prescription drugs directly to consumers.
