 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste: An Idea Whose Time Has Come   By Norman, Geoffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2005  As national festivals go, the Super Bowl is fairly young. Sunday's game is merely the 39th (XXXIXth) time it will be played. But the Super Bowl's youth is one of its strengths. Having been around fewer than 40 years, it is not encumbered with the religious baggage that has made Christmas so agonizing for sensitive humanists. There is nothing for the ACLU to object to except, possibly, the censoring of the halftime show. And unlike Thanksgiving, the Super Bowl does not have the kind of suspect history that gets the blood of the p.c. police pumping. No slaughter of birds; no exploitation of indigenous populations. Just football and hedonism. What's not to like?  If the Super Bowl were a national holiday, there wouldn't be any question about just what is being celebrated. Football. Which is already the national sport. The new holiday would come complete with rituals, ceremonies and food. On Thanksgiving, Americans in the millions eat things they rarely eat any other time of year and probably don't like that much, anyway -- roast turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes with marshmallows. But on the day of the Super Bowl, Americans eat what they most like to eat and much more of it, gluttony being permissible on a holiday.  There is so much amateur action on the big game -- let's call it a form of cultural democracy -- that sports books have come up with increasingly exotic "propositions" to separate the suckers from their money. You can bet on which way the coin toss will go and who will score first. And if the first score will be a safety. After that, it gets really baroque. Last year, you would have won money if you'd bet there would be a streaker at the game. This year you can wager that Paul McCartney's first song during halftime will be "Here Comes the Sun." Put down $10 to win $330.
