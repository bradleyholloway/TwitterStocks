 Taking Stock in China   By Fang Xinghai, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2007  Last week the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Composite Index unexpectedly dropped 8.8%, the largest one-day decline in 10 years. Surprisingly, to those of us inside China, leading stock markets around the world followed the drop. In same-day trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 3.3% and the NASDAQ 3.9% -- their sharpest falls since 9/11. While China's trade and production have a big global impact, the sell-off in the SSECI is a watershed event that marks the beginning of the integration of China's financial markets into the wider world.  Lastly, China's Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor program -- the primary vehicle for Chinese investors to invest overseas via mutual funds -- should be expanded. So far a total of $14 billion in international investing quotas have been distributed among participating institutions, but less than half that amount has been taken up by investors. That's because under current regulations QDII funds largely can only invest in overseas fixed-income products. The lower returns on these investments, and the appreciating Chinese currency, encourage people to keep their money at home.  If the investment scope of the QDII program is expanded to include stocks, investors surely will be more enthusiastic, given the increasingly large price gap between domestic and overseas shares. For example, securities firms are trading at 40 times earnings in China, whereas in overseas markets the best international securities firms are trading at less than 15 times earnings. Given a free choice, many domestic investors would opt for international firms. Some argue that Chinese institutions don't yet know how to invest in overseas stocks. But this can be solved by linking up with international money managers.
