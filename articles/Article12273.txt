 U.S. Pursues Coverup Case In Carey Local   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1997  Federal officials are investigating whether Teamsters President Ron Carey or his aides covered up a corruption case in the Queens-based local Mr. Carey has run for more than 25 years.  The collection of exhibits -- more than 40 different depositions and records -- support charges recently filed against Mr. Carey by the federal Independent Review Board regarding illegal diversions of Teamsters funds for the benefit of Mr. Carey's 1996 bid for a new term as president. The board oversees the Teamsters.  Conversations Mr. Carey had with grand-jury witnesses about his role in the Teamsters fund-raising scandal, despite instructions from his lawyers not to do so. Mr. Carey was asked at length about conversations he had with his former secretary Monie Simpkins, a key witness. In one instance, Mr. Carey was asked by investigators whether a conversation he had with Ms. Simpkins shortly before her testimony had been tape-recorded. "I would have no idea," he replied.
