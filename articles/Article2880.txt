 By the Numbers: An International Game   By By Allen Barra, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 2001  Some would say the Golden Age of Latin Players has arrived: The game's best starting pitcher is Mr. [Pedro Martinez] (who hails from the Dominican Republic); the best reliever is Mariano Rivera (Panama) of the New York Yankees; the best shortstop is Alex Rodriguez (Dominican-American) of the Texas Rangers (also the best all-around player in the game); the best second baseman is Mr. [Roberto Alomar] (Puerto Rico); the best catcher is Ivan Rodriguez (Puerto Rico) of Texas; the All-Star home-run derby champ was Arizona's Luis Gonzalez (Cuban-American) and the most prolific home-run hitter and RBI producer over the past four seasons are a pair of Dominicans: Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa and Boston's Manny Ramirez, respectively.  Yet, through a combination of luck and some new hitters in front of him in the batting order, Mr. [Bret Boone] was able to drive in 32 more runs before the All-Star break. If ever a season had "fluke" written all over it, it's the first half of Mr. Boone's 2001. Yet that's enough to get him on the All-Star team ahead of Mr. Alomar, a clearly superior fielder and base runner, to say nothing of being a far superior hitter. The unwritten rule is that if you're Latin, you not only have to be better, you have to be a lot better. (Of course, it helps to have local fans punching extra ballots for you.)
