 American Opinion (A Special Report): A Quarterly Survey of Politics, Economics and Values --- Nationally, Democrats Lead in House Contest   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 1996  According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters now favor the Democrats over the Republicans in the House races, 42% to 36%. This is the generic congressional test, or a national survey, whereas the real election is actually 435 local races. Currently in the House, the GOP enjoys a 235-198 edge, with one independent member and one vacancy that was held by a Republican; this is the first time in more than 40 years that the Republicans have been in the majority.  The chairmen of both the Democratic and Republican congressional campaign committees, however, are skeptical of how predictive the generic vote is. "We'd rather be ahead than behind, but generally I think the generic vote is overplayed," says Rep. Vic Fazio, the Californian who heads the Democratic Campaign Committee.
