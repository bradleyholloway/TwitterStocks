 Now Isn't the Time to Buy Soaring Funds   By By Aaron Lucchetti and Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  Consider Amerindo Technology Fund A, which soared 390% in the 12 months ended Aug. 31. The figure bests all but one stock fund over the same time period, according to fund tracker Lipper Inc., and is one of the best all-time one-year records. But the fund's manager, Alberto Vilar, acknowledges that the fund is currently sitting atop a potential capital-gains distribution of about half -- yes, half -- its net asset value. The fund expects to offset some of that gain between now and the end of its fiscal year, Oct. 31.  To many investors, the potential in such funds may seem so great that any tax bill later this year will soon pale beside the capital appreciation they will enjoy. And there's little question that funds like Amerindo and Nicholas-Applegate have been trumpeting their eye-popping returns lately. Amerindo officials say they intend to announce today that the fund's nearly five-fold one-year gain is the best ever for a U.S.-focused fund in the history of record-keeping by Lipper. The Nicholas-Applegate fund is technically a global fund. Lipper, using month-end figures, confirms that the Nicholas-Applegate fund and the Amerindo one sport the best one-year performance records since the firm has been compiling data in 1959.  So eager has Amerindo been to attract new investors that earlier this year it lowered certain investment minimums to $2,500 from $10,000. And the fund recently became available in some mutual-fund "supermarkets" run by discount securities brokerage firms, among others. The Nicholas-Applegate fund is more exclusive, so far. It requires a minimum $250,000 investment.
