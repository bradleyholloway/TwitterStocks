 SmartMoney Stock Screen / Impatient?   By Hough, Jack, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2006  Our Impatient Value screen is for investors who are looking for long-term success in the stock market -- so long as it happens relatively quickly. It looks for companies whose shares appear cheap relative to their growth prospects, but whose share prices have also been rising in recent weeks and are close to hitting new 52-week highs. The skimpy valuations are a sign these stocks may be poised for outperformance over the next several years. The price momentum offers a shot at the same over the next several months.  We screened for stocks with PEG ratios below the broad market's average of about 1.5. The PEG ratio divides a company's price/earnings ratio by the rate at which Wall Street analysts figure its earnings will grow over the next several years. The lower the resulting number, the better.
