 Portuguese Government Holds the Key To Settling Takeover Battle for Bank   By By Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1994  OPORTO, Portugal -- With the battlelines drawn in the fight for Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the Portuguese government holds the key to a face-off between two opposing concepts of the future of Portuguese banking.  In spite of claims from Atlantico's management and a group of core shareholders that they are in a position to beat off Banco Comercial, people familiar with Banco Comercial's position say it remains optimistic, subject to a green light from the government, that its bid will be successful.  Banco Comercial, which is being advised by Merrill Lynch, wants to take advantage of Atlantico's more extensive network and international business links to develop its own already highly successful franchise. It launched its takeover attempt for Atlantico on July 26, with a 132 billion escudos ($821.3 million) offer to buy what would amount to a controlling stake of as much as 40% of Atlantico's shares at a price of 3,000 escudos a share. Control of Atlantico, with a 14.5% market share, would put Banco Comercial in charge of a banking group just behind the state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos group in size.
