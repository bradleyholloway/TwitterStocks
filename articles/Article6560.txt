 Mining-Equipment Shortage Lingers   By Hotter, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2006  "There's high demand for tires along with trucks as miners try to increase output, but we can't get them quickly enough," said Patricio Huerta of Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile, or Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, with annual output of 1.8 million metric tons.  "Machinery is being replaced but there is a two-year wait for trucks and diggers, which means we will continue to see production falling or at best remaining stable," said Marcelo Awad, chief executive of Antofagasta Minerals of Chile. "The future of copper supply is in question," he said.  Komatsu, which also makes mining trucks, produces about 400 trucks a year, said Andres Aguirre, managing director of Komatsu Chile SA. "We're producing at capacity," he said. "If a company is looking for a number of trucks, the chances are we'd be delivering in 2007."
