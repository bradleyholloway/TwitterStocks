 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Kurt Waldheim Case   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1986  No charges of war crimes were raised against Mr. Waldheim when he campaigned for the U.N. office in the early 1970s. It took Austria's democratic election for people to look into his record. As by now everyone knows, Mr. Waldheim admitted he hid part of his war record, and further evidence still seems to be coming out. Gen. Alexander Lohr, Mr. Waldheim's commander when he served in Yugoslavia and Greece, led a brutal war against partisans. During this time the Jews of Salonika, a fifth of the city, were shipped to their deaths in German concentration camps. Gen. Lohr was hanged as a war criminal in 1947.
