 Investor's Calendar   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2005  -- Musical Cellphones: Cingular Wireless will unveil a cellphone this week that will play songs from Apple's iTunes Music Store, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple also may introduce a new line of iPod digital music players at a media event in San Francisco on Wednesday.  -- Job Growth Slows: Employers slowed the pace of hiring in August and gave smaller wage increases to workers. Payrolls grew by 169,000, well below the 242,000 increase in July and shy of the 190,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate, however, dropped to a four-year low of 4.9%. -- Savings Evaporate: Consumers spent more than they earned in July, sending the personal-savings rate to minus 0.6%. The decline was largely due to employee-discount programs for auto sales.
