 Breakaway (A Special Report): Parting Shot --- Calling All Misfits: Are you a corporate loser, drifting from job to job, unable to follow orders? Maybe it's time to start a business   By By Hal Lancaster, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2001  Some bought basketball teams. Mark Cuban, the pugnacious owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is a classic example of the breed. He started his career by lasting only nine months in Mellon Bank's customer-service group and not too much longer at a company where he sold franchises. "It became clear to me I was a terrible employee," he once told me in an interview. He later was fired from a sales job with a software retailer. In each case, he clashed with authority, usually for doing something without first clearing it. At Mellon Bank, he rankled bosses by starting a Rookie Club for newcomers because he didn't feel they were getting enough training from the company.  Mr. Cuban appears to share what Ms. [Rieva Lesonsky] says is a common trait of entrepreneurs-as-misfits: They think they're a little extra-creative and chafe at authority. Until recently, though, they often didn't realize that owning their own business was a viable option. "This idea of thinking out of the box is something we've come up with in the '90s," Ms. Lesonsky says. "Before that, if you did it, you were branded a freak."  Early in his career, Mr. [Phil Hall] was fired from a series of jobs with trade magazines and public-relations agencies, seemingly unable to satisfy the demands of any employer. Only after he went through a series of employers whom he considered stifling and threatened by creative people did he even consider the possibility that he was part of the problem. He clearly chafed at authority and believed that he could do things better. He wasn't a "subservient desk jockey," as he puts it, and his bosses didn't appreciate it. He needed to be an entrepreneur.
