 Researchers Hurry to Respond As Car Engines Knock Again   By By Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1985  Engine knock, a problem once thought to have been solved, is back. And finding a cure for it has become a top priorty of two of the nation's most advanced scientific laboratories, the Sandia National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., and the neighboring Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The laboratories are best known for research on such things as "star wars" and nuclear weapons. But their parent agency, the Department of Energy, considers engine knock of such national importance that it ordered the labs' scientists to use such exotic tools as supercomputers and lasers on the problem. "It's the hottest thing in combustion research," says Michal Dyer, a former aerospace engineer who supervises the Sandia team tackling the knock problem.  Engine knock not only puts undue wear and tear on the engine but indirectly leads to lower fuel mileage and sluggish engine performance. In the early 1930s, engineers discovered that lead compounds added to the gasoline could short-circuit the spontaneous ignition and prevent the knock. The advent of leaded antiknock gasolines, measured by an "octane" rating, allowed auto engineers to build peppier, more powerful engines by increasing the compression of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder, causing the fuel to burn at higher, more efficient temperatures. Instead of the piston compressing each six or seven cubic inches of fuel-air into one cubic inch -- a 7-to-1 compression ratio -- engines by the mid-1950s were reaching 10-to-1 or higher compression ratios as leaded gasolines climbed to 100 octane and above.
