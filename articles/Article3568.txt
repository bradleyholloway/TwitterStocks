 Dining: Hurry Up and Eat   By By Pooja Bhatia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  Just how fast are we expected to chew nowadays? To find out, we dispatched reporters to eat dinner -- at a relaxed but not obstinate pace -- in upscale restaurants across the country. We clocked how long it took to be seated, counted how many times overeager busboys tried to snatch away our plates (four times at one Chicago foodie haven alone) and measured how long we could hang out after paying. All told, we had 20 three-course meals for two people, with coffee, booking at the restaurants' busiest times (usually the weekend). Our meals ranged widely from a languorous, "refill, please?" three hours and 21 minutes to a do-the-hustle 91-minute dinner that went by in a creme-brulee blur.  Overall, we found that paying more for a meal didn't ensure we had more time to linger. Who would have guessed that at storied Le Cirque in New York, the waiter would try to reclaim our chocolate dessert before we'd gotten halfway through it? (He lost that battle.) Or that one of the kitschiest restaurants in frantic Las Vegas would provide one of our more leisurely meals? (Everybody else was out gambling.) We found out, too, that while Ritz-Carlton prohibits asking a diner to decamp a table, Disney World will do it, albeit with an offer of free drinks.  Five years ago, it was hard to get a great cup of coffee in Las Vegas, says Chicago stay-at-home mom Jennifer Clesle, but now the level of the cuisine is "overwhelming." Indeed, since Jean-Georges, Nobu, [Charlie Palmer], Todd English and Le Cirque decamped there, Sin City has become a foodie's paradise, especially for those with big savings accounts or lines of credit. Yet a haute steak can't compete with high stakes, and Las Vegas restaurants play a supporting role to the circus going on outside: showgirls, loopy architecture, people-watching and, oh yes, gambling.
