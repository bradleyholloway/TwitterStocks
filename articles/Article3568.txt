 Tips for the Volunteer   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  A few readers wrote in to ask about volunteer opportunities for people who have a tough time leaving home, and Neal Band, an East Lansing, Mich., retiree suggests an interesting idea: "If you are limited in mobility, get involved in a local Amateur Radio club," he says. "They are tied in with emergency radio [networks] and give classes on how to get going in radio communication." The American Radio Relay League in Newington, Conn., has information on becoming a "ham" and a directory of local clubs (www.hello-radio.org, 860-594- 0200).  Christopher Brown of Guilford, Vt., has found "one of the most satisfying of volunteer opportunities" working for a local affiliate of the Score Association in Washington, D.C., through which business executives counsel small businesses and nonprofit groups (www.score.org, 800-634-0245).
