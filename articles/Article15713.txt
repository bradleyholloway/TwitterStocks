 City Electricity Trader Worked Briefly For Firm That Is Involved in Defaults   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1998  Craig Perks, the senior electric-power marketer for Springfield's municipally owned City Water, Light & Power, was employed by Federal Energy Sales Inc. for about six weeks beginning around Feb. 1, 1997, while he was on personal leave from his city job, lawyers for Springfield said.  The lawyers, Springfield's Corporation Counsel Robert M. Rogers and Thomas H. Wilson, an outside attorney for the city, were scheduled to brief city council members last night on Mr. Perks's brief tenure at Federal Energy.  City officials and outside auditors and lawyers have been working to understand the full extent of the city utility's potential losses in electricity markets that sustained a dramatic meltdown in a late-June heat wave in the Midwest. Federal Energy, of Rocky River, Ohio, failed to deliver promised electricity to Springfield, which then failed to deliver equal amounts of promised power to four big utilities.
