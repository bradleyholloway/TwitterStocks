 Letters to the Editor: Fiat Money   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1986  Because this legislation would affect Fiat of Italy, a firm important to the Italian government, you assert it costs the U.S. "good friends." What friends? In the months preceding the U.S. attacks on Libya, we received minimal cooperation against Qadhafi. Some of our European "friends" have done very little in the fight against terrorism. That is one reason the U.S. attacked Libya. Along with a dozen Senate supporters of this legislation, I want to send a message to our "friends" abroad that we need help in pursuing economic sanctions against Libya.
