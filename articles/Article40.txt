In a Midtown Line, Time for Introspection  T aller spires have made the gray-lace sculpture that is St. Patrick's Cathedral seem almost diminutive in the midtown scale. But on Ash Wednesday it loomed large as ever for New Yorkers starting Lent with the penitence of ashes.  At noon on Fifth Avenue - still curbed with snow but showing some special attention - the cathedral bells pealed in the bright sunshine. Colors, ages and languages mingled as lines two deep formed on Madison Avenue to enter side doors. From early morning until 6:30 P.M., the cathedral expects 20,000 to 25,000 people, but many in line thought there were more.  ''It's never been like this,'' said a young woman. In from the Star of the Sea parish in Far Rockaway, Queens, 80-year-old Josephine Dussling said, ''I'm happy to see the line but I don't think I can stand that long.''  ''This is a time for introspection,'' said Lucille DeStefano, who leaves home at 7:30 A.M. in the Whitestone section of the Bronx, and had lunched at her desk on 57th Street. A new season seemed to shine as William Flynn of Murray Hill, N.J., and Tom Moletto of Fort Salonga, L.I. arrived from their insurance office. ''It's just delightful,'' said Mr. Flynn, lifting his face to the sun. ''But it's still Ash Wednesday.''
