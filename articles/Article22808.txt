 REIT Interest: Consumer Uncertainty Blurs View of Bottom for Mall, Hotel Stocks   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2001  Regional mall REITs had been posting better returns to investors than hotel REITs before Sept. 10, the last trading day before the attacks. In fact, their returns were among the highest of all REITs, according to the Morgan Stanley REIT index, up 25% year to date on Sept. 10. Hotel REITs were up 8%.  After the attacks, regional mall REITs fell but still outperformed hotel REITs, dropping 7% compared with 29%, as of the end of last week.  James W. Sullivan, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. in New York who covers both retail and lodging companies, says investors should "take advantage of any price weakness" in regional mall REITs. He recommends CBL & Associates Properties Inc., Chattanooga, Tenn., General Growth Properties Inc., Chicago, Simon Property Group Inc., Indianapolis, and Glimcher Realty Trust, Columbus, Ohio.
