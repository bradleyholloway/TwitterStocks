 IBM Earnings Increased 12% In Third Period --- First Gain in Six Quarters Is Recorded, but Results Fell Short of Forecasts   By By Hank Gilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1987  Third-quarter earnings rose 12% to $1.21 billion, or $2 a share, from $1.08 billion, or $1.76 a share, in the year-earlier period. But the gain was largely caused by such factors as the sale of Intel Corp. stock, foreign-currency translations and a significantly lower tax rate. In addition, the latest earnings figures follow depressed third-quarter results in 1986.  For about a year, many analysts have been advertising the third quarter as the period that would mark the robust beginning of IBM's recovery, largely because of a slew of new products, lower expenses and easier year-to-year quarterly comparisons. That view was reinforced last April by an uncharacteristically upbeat assessment of IBM's prospects by the company's chairman and chief executive officer, John F. Akers.  "IBM is like a battleship ever so slowly turning in the wind. Much slower than the captain had allowed people to assume early this year," said Ulric Weil, an analyst affiliated with Gartner Securities Corp. Earlier this year, Mr. Weil said, computer industry gurus were looking forward to third-quarter earnings gains of 20% to 25% from Big Blue.
