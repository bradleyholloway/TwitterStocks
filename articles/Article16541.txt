 Ahead of the Tape   By Sender, Henny, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2005  Robert McAdie, global head of credit strategy for Barclays Capital in London, says it always takes time for things to go wrong -- "the seasoning effect," as he puts it. For early signs of distress, Europe may be the place to look. More-intense competition to finance deals in Europe led to easier terms, he says, and now European investors are finally beginning to consider tougher terms and conditions, like limits on future leverage, to better ensure repayment, he says. Some bondholders there are seeking legal redress to address losses they've suffered. It may be too late for them, but such fights have wider implications for issuers in the future.
