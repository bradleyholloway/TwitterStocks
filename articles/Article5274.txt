 Oregon Shift on South Africa Investment Is Unlikely to Signal Start of Stampede   By By Howard Hoffman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1991  Oregon's pension funds seem certain to be the first to reverse their stance on South Africa and open their $14 billion investment portfolios to any company -- whatever its ties to the apartheid state.  South Africa's segregationist racial policy has made it one of the ethical investing community's biggest targets. Since 1984, more than 200 institutions have renounced investment in companies doing business there. Most of the pension funds, money managers and mutual funds that abandoned South African investments years ago say they are unpersuaded by the president's decision and the de Klerk government reforms. Unlike Oregon, they say they will keep their money free of any association with South Africa.  It's a different story in Oregon, where State Treasurer Tony Meeker sought the legislative change that makes it possible for state pension funds to reverse their investment policy. A 1987 state law required Oregon's pension funds to rid themselves before February 1992 of all investments in companies doing business in South Africa. Since the Oregon legislature meets only every other year, whatever policy was in effect at the end of the 1991 session would remain in force until 1993.
