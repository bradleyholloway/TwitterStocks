 Leading the News: Pechiney Weighs a Corus Bid To Thwart Takeover by Alcan   By Carreyrou, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2003  Acquiring Corus's aluminum business, located mainly in Germany and the Netherlands, would enlarge Pechiney's big footprint in Europe, making an Alcan-Pechiney combination unlikely to get antitrust clearance from the European Commission. It could also force Alcan to raise its 3.4 billion euro bid, depending on how Pechiney would finance the Corus acquisition.  Reviving a deal with Corus would just be one plank in Pechiney's defense strategy and wouldn't be sufficient to rebuff Montreal-based Alcan, the person familiar with the matter said. "It would be one brick of a larger edifice. Alone, it's not enough," the person said, adding that such a move would be mainly construed as "obstructive," so it would have to be coupled with other "positive" moves to convince shareholders it adds value.  Daniel Gagnier, Alcan's senior vice president, corporate affairs, said he "would be surprised" if Pechiney revived its deal with Corus, since Corus's Dutch supervisory board "was totally opposed" to the original deal. Mr. Gagnier also expressed doubt that Pechiney would be able to find a "white knight" that would make a more attractive merger partner than Alcan. "There's no other combination that I can think of that has the same kind of synergies" as Alcan-Pechiney he said.
