 CBS Net Soars on Sale of Records Unit; TV Network Has $10 Million Pretax Loss   By By Dennis Kneale, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1988  The $2 billion sale of CBS Inc.'s records business sparked a huge increase in first-quarter net income, despite a 4.6% decline in revenue.  But CBS's television network, about to finish last in prime-time ratings for the first time in 36 years, had a loss of $10 million or so before taxes in the quarter, said Peter W. Keegan, CBS's senior vice president of finance. And interest income on CBS's big cash reserve -- rather than its core business -- provided the broadcast company's only source of growth in earnings from continuing operations.  CBS's first-quarter net soared to $911.3 million, or $35.34 a share -- boosted mostly by the after-tax gain of $866.6 million, or $33.61 a share, from the sale of the records business to Sony Corp.
