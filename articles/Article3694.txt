 GE's Financial Units Help Boost Profit; Earnings Rise 2% Despite Weakness In Industrial Arms   By Kranhold, Kathryn, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  Investors are typically wary of GE's financial businesses taking the lead, but they appeared to be encouraged by strong growth in GE's infrastructure unit, specifically sales of aircraft engines, power turbines, and oil and gas equipment. Revenue in the infrastructure group rose 18% to $12 billion, and operating profit climbed 28%, to $2.18 billion.  Robert Millen, co-portfolio manager of the Jensen Portfolio, said the results highlighted the advantages of GE's diverse portfolio of businesses. GE had some "pockets of weakness" but it is "very unlikely that you're to have a large hiccup," he said.  Analysts said WMC probably cost GE about four cents a share in earnings, more than the two-cents-a-share impact they had predicted. Despite WMC's troubles, GE said profit at its consumer-finance group, GE Money, rose 2% to $851 million. Mark Begor, GE Money's chief executive of the Americas region, said GE had put a "fence" around the subprime losses.
