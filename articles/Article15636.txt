 Budget Pact Hurts Some GOP Lawmakers Down Home   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1998  Yet in South Carolina, where the Confederate flag still flies over the capitol, Mr. Inglis's bid for a U.S. Senate seat is running into trouble. And it's fueled, ironically, by conservatives' anger over the achievement of a longsought GOP goal that Mr. Inglis backed: a balanced budget agreement.  Mr. Inglis is campaigning for the Republican nomination to oppose Sen. Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a five-term Democrat. But in the first test of his statewide appeal and campaign apparatus, Mr. Inglis lost three of four regional straw polls in late October to Stephen Brown, a party activist from Greenville who has pounded the congressman on his vote for the budget deal.  Mr. Brown briefly entertained running for Congress in 1996, when there was public speculation that Mr. Inglis might challenge legendary GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond. Mr. Brown says he has supported Mr. Inglis throughout his career, but saw a change in the congressman -- a drift toward the center -- after Mr. Inglis announced his candidacy for statewide office. After supporting the all-or-nothing budget tactics GOP leaders used in 1995, Mr. Inglis embraced last year's shift to pragmatism.
