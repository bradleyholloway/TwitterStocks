 In Guatemala, A Battle Over Logs And a Lost Kingdom; Mr. Hansen Aims to Preserve Vast Mayan Ruin as Park; Skeptical, Villagers Fight   By Davis, Bob, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2005  Logging money is once again providing a glimmer of prosperity in the old "chiclero" towns. In the past few years, Uaxactun, with a population of 900, bought its first communal satellite phones, started a junior high school and built two evangelical Protestant churches. Residents call the one where alcohol is permitted, "the sinners' church"; the other, where alcohol is banned, is "the saint's church."  "When high-class tourists come, they won't want to use us" as tourist guides, says Floridalma Bo, the secretary of Uaxactun's logging cooperative. After complaining that Mr. [Richard Hansen] doesn't meet with villagers, she quickly declines any interest in his coming to town. "It would be best for him not to come," she says. "It could be like when the Spanish people came here and fooled the Maya by giving them trinkets."  Aided by a media-savvy German spokeswoman, the villagers have adeptly turned Guatemalan public opinion against Mr. Hansen. Their lawyers sued to reverse the 2002 presidential decree. This spring Guatemala's current president, Oscar Berger, repealed it, while his chief of staff, Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo, warned Mr. Hansen to butt out of Guatemalan affairs. "I have spoken to him in American terms," says Mr. Gonzalez. "He should interpret [warning] letters as two strikes."
