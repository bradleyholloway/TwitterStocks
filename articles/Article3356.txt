 Stock-Option Awards Sharply Cut; Value Fell 41% for CEOs, 53% for Lower-Level Staff From 2001 to 2003   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2004  "There's this gigantic shift in stock-based incentives," says Ira Kay, national director of compensation consulting for Watson Wyatt. Stock-option awards are likely to face another round of cutbacks in 2006, the first full year after expensing is slated to take effect, after leveling off in 2004 and 2005, Mr. Kay adds.  Many companies are also keeping a tighter grip on their wallets, particularly outside the executive suite. Those who aren't among the top five executives got an average of 123 stock options, down 56% from 277 in 2001, the study found. By contrast, the average CEO got 213,000 stock options, down 17%. Restricted-stock awards to CEOs climbed 69% from 2001 to 2003, according to Watson Wyatt.
