 Spanish Officials Raid Coca-Cola Offices   By By Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  The unannounced visits were conducted in response to complaints filed last year by the Spanish division of PepsiCo Inc., and a Spanish beverage company, La Casera. In a statement from its Spanish division, PepsiCo accused Coke of "illegal" marketing and sales practices "for the purpose of obtaining a monopolistic control of the sector." Such practices include discounts for large-volume purchases and exclusivity agreements between Coke, its bottlers, and retailers, which encourage retailers to cut back on Coke competitors' stocks, PepsiCo said.
