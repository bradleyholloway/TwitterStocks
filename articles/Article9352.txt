Hoffa's re-election campaign, was banned July 30 from election activities for four weeks for assisting Mr. Hoffa's campaign on his own time and for discussing a fund-raiser during union business. Mr. Leebove is appealing. "It's a few `gotchas' against Hoffa," he says, adding, "we've been through this before."  Indeed. During the 1991 election, supporters of eventual President Ron Carey accused a Leebove-run newsletter of smear tactics. In 1997, with sleuthing and inside sources, Mr. Leebove helped expose an election scandal that brought down Mr. Carey. Then Mr. Leebove was banned from the 1998 election for allegedly underbilling Mr. Hoffa. "I still remain a target," Mr. Leebove says.
