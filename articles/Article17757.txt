 Major Retailers' Sales in August Were Sluggish --- Late Back-to-School Season Cited; Sears Posts Drop, K Mart Had a 3.2% Rise   By By Francine Schwadel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1987  The delay was caused by a quirk of the calendar that resulted in Labor Day falling almost a week later than last year. The change is significant because back-to-school purchases typically heat up the week before the holiday. "Last year, all of the pre-Labor Day business came in August," said Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer of F.W. Woolworth Co. "This year, the last week of it will be in the September reporting period."  As a result, many analysts and industry executives reserved judgment on the significance of the August report. "The month of September will really be a telling story of whether general merchandise sales will maintain modest growth, in line with the economy," said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  Sales on a comparable-store basis rose 2.7% at New York-based J.C. Penney Co., 2.8% at Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., 2.3% at St. Louis-based May Department Stores Co. and 3% at Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. Chicago-based Montgomery Ward & Co., a Mobil Corp. unit that operated five more stores in August than a year earlier, posted a 1% sales increase.
