 Pact Is Signed For $1 Billion Burma Pipeline --- Total SA, Unocal Will Join With Local Companies; Slave Labor Fears Raised   By By Paul M. Sherer, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1994  BANGKOK, Thailand -- Total SA of France, Unocal Corp. of the U.S. and the state energy companies of Thailand and Burma signed an agreement in Rangoon to build a $1 billion natural-gas pipeline from Burma's Yadana offshore field to the Thai border.  Under terms of the agreement, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand will pay 10 billion baht ($400 million) annually for the delivery of 15.8 million cubic meters of natural gas a day. The total cost of developing the gas field, which has proven reserves of 171 billion cubic meters, and building the pipeline is estimated at $1 billion, says Kenneth Stevens, head of research at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia) Ltd. in Bangkok.  To deliver the gas, Total and Unocal will build a 240-mile pipeline from the gas field to the Thai border. The Thai petroleum authority is expected to announce plans to build a 10 billion-baht, 180-mile extension of the pipeline running from the border to a 2,800-megawatt power plant that will be built in Ratchaburi province.
