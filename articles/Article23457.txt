 PURSUITS; Books: Misadventure Capital; A hapless entrepreneur recounts his New Media pratfalls   By Young, Toby, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2007  Fortunately, a book can no more be judged by its name than by its cover. In fact, "The Royal Nonesuch" is a fairly lively example of what is rapidly emerging as a mini-genre: the New Media memoir. The first instance that I know of was "Burn Rate" (1998), Michael Wolff's hilarious account of his own misbegotten Internet venture. While Mr. Phillips's book isn't quite in that league, it manages to hold your interest nonetheless because he is such a self-confessed loser. Most New Media memoirs are about failure -- if their authors had become rich they wouldn't be writing books -- but "The Royal Nonesuch" stands out because Mr. Phillips achieved so very little. For him, a first round of financing was a distant dream, never mind the IPO. This book chronicles the Internet gold rush from the point of view of a pack pony.  One of the few people to cut him a check was Matt Stone of "South Park" fame, who invested $25,000 in a low-budget film that was designed to cash in on the success of "The Blair Witch Project." In what must qualify as the sickest New Media venture ever conceived, Mr. Phillips planned to make a fake snuff movie in which he pretended to murder his girlfriend and then broadcast it over the Internet, presenting it as a live event. His hope was that the ensuing media brouhaha would propel the film to the top of the video charts. Incredibly, Mr. Phillips made the film, enlisting the help of a Hollywood special-effects company, but he wisely decided not to release it after an Internet porn baron described it as a "monstrosity."
