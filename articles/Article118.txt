STAMFORD, Conn., April 24â€” A three-year dispute over a proposed cemetery in a wealthy residential area of this city will reach a crucial juncture next week.  The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport wants to build a complex with grave sites, a mausoleum, a combined office and chapel, and roads and walkways on an 18.8-acre, thickly wooded area.  The staff of the city's Environmental Protection Board is to submit its recommendations to the board by Thursday. The five-member board, which usually follows the advice of its staff, will make the city's final ruling. Opponents of the cemetery would then have the courts as their only recourse, and they say such a suit is possible.  The diocese purchased 114 acres in the northern part of Stamford in the late 1950's for a cemetery. In June 1978, it submitted plans for a 40-acre cemetery, but after meeting opposition, it withdrew the plan and submitted a scaled-down version the following year.  Plans for the remaining property on the site have not been decided, a church spokesman said. Fears of Possible Pollution  The site is across from the University of Connecticut's Stamford branch and stretches north into residential areas from the intersection of Rockrimmon and Scofieldtown Roads.  One of the strongest objections to the proposal involves an adjacent landfill site that was closed 12 years ago. City officials have been unable to ascertain what the landfill contains, and there has been speculation that toxic materials may be buried there, since it is known that chemical companies used the site for disposal.  Residents and city officials say they fear that the landfill may contain chemicals buried in drums and that such drums could rupture during the cemetery construction and pollute wells.  ''You could wake one morning and find you have no water, or polluted water, in your well,'' said Marna Harbert, who has lived on Scofieldtown Road for 12 years.  ''Of course there should be concern for the dead, but don't forget the living and their needs,'' she added. Extensive Granite Deposits  Other objections expressed at public meetings have dealt with concerns of increased traffic on the area's winding, narrow roads, ecological danger to wetlands on the site and what they see as the inappropriateness of a cemetery in the residential area.  While noting a series of concerns over construction of the cemetery because extensive granite deposits less than 10 feet below the surface, requiring blasting or pneumatic drilling, Mark Lubber, executive director of the environmental board, said he did not see any ''insurmountable problems'' to construction.  He pointed out, however, that the former landfill presented unknown factors and that extensive precautionary measures would have to be taken if construction was allowed.  When Stamford's Planning Board rejected the cemetery proposal twice as ''inappropriate,'' Mrs. Harbert said, area residents believed the matter was closed. But the diocese then appealed to the city's Zoning Board of Appeals. Zoning Changes Approved  ''We kind of fell down,'' said Mrs. Harbert of the residents' failure to challenge the proposal before the Zoning Board of Appeals, which approved the necessary zoning changes for the project. They then formed a group called Concerned Area Residents for the Environment of Stamford.  ''Knowing property values in that area and the nature of the land, we knew there'd be some opposition, but the fact is we're running out of land,'' said Vern Barone, manager of cemeteries for the diocese.  Mr. Barone oversees 13 cemeteries, including St. Michael's in Bridgeport. The largest of the cemeteries at 100 acres, St. Michael's handles 1,500 burials a year, half those in the diocese, and has only half an acre left, Mr. Barone said.  Although burial or entombment has not been required by the church since 1963, it remains the preference, according to the Rev. Nicholas Grieco, spokesman for the diocese.  And while the church does sanction cremation, he said, it is obligated to provide burial facilities for its members.  Illustrations: map of Connecticut
