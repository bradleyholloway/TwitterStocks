 Disney Net Fell 71% in Fiscal 4th Quarter --- As Woes in Some Divisions Are Confronted, Slump Is Likely to Continue   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1999  Disney said its fiscal-2000 earnings will be about the same as fiscal 1999, excluding restructuring charges and the pending creation of its Internet tracking stock, Go.com. Disney's fiscal-1999 earnings were down 30%, to 62 cents a diluted share from 89 cents a share in fiscal 1998.  In a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings -- a first for Disney -- Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Eisner declined to commit to a timetable for a Disney rebound. "It's impossible to predict the day that growth will be back," he said, adding: "I think it's coming, but it's not coming tomorrow."  But Mr. Eisner and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs used the call to express their confidence that Disney's core assets still are healthy and will rebound in time. They reiterated their commitment to cutting costs, and said Disney now is embarking on a "strategic sourcing" initiative to cut purchasing costs. Combined with other cost-cutting measures, Disney said it expects annual cost savings of $500 million in 2001.
