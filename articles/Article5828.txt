 Chase Is Nearing an Agreement to Buy British Investment Bank Robert Fleming   By By Michael R. Sesit and Erik Portanger, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2000  The people familiar with the matter said that, if completed, the acquisition will be financed with a combination of cash and Chase stock. Chase and Robert Fleming are planning to announce the deal tomorrow.  Negotiations had earlier been complicated by Fleming's relationship with T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore-based fund manager, according to people familiar with the talks. Simultaneous with the transaction, T. Rowe Price is expected to exercise its right of first refusal and buy out Fleming's stake in a joint venture, which involves Fleming managing U.S. investors' money in international markets. Whatever T. Rowe Price pays for the Fleming stake would go to Chase, reducing the big U.S. bank's overall acquisition costs.
