 Asian Report: Japan Eyes Chinese Nuclear Sales; Singapore Fights Economic Slump   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1985  The agreement restricts to peaceful uses the nuclear technology that Japan supplies to China. The U.S. has just concluded a similar pact with the Chinese. European companies whose governments came to terms much earlier on nuclear cooperation have a head start in the jockeying to supply a building program that seeks to develop 10 million kilowatts of nuclear power-plant capacity in China by 2000, industry officials say.  Although it is likely China will seek to stop importing and rely on its own nuclear technology as soon as possible, the China market now is a bright spot for a nuclear-power plant industry plagued by a slowdown in projects in many other parts of the world.  Japanese companies have a strong chance of winning a contract for a planned pair of million-kilowatt plants on the Liaoning peninsula in northeast China, according to Kazuhisa Mori, executive managing director of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry group. The project isn't officially on the books, but is expected to be announced later this year, the official adds.
