 Enterasys CEO, Two Officials Quit Amid Widening Internal Review   By By Laura Johannes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2002  Enterasys Networks Inc. Chief Executive Enrique P. Fiallo and two other executives resigned as the company announced a widening internal review of its accounting and a possible restatement of prior results.  Yesterday, the Portsmouth, N.H., company said the internal inquiry has expanded to include a review of revenue recognition in its North American, European and Latin American operations. Enterasys, which is the bulk of the former Cabletron Systems Inc., declined to give further details on the nature of the accounting review, but said that "certain quarters may be restated" as a result.  Enterasys said it is cooperating with the SEC, but said the company doesn't yet know the focus of the investigation. Previously, the company had said it didn't believe the SEC investigation was focusing on the Asia accounting issue, but yesterday it said it would be "reasonable to assume" that the agency will look at that matter as part of its review.
