 United Airlines, Delta Post Big Losses, Caused by IUnmpact of Terrorist Attacks   By By Susan Carey and Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 2001  Separately, the Air Line Pilots Association filed a grievance challenging Delta's decision to lay off 1,700 of Delta's 10,000 pilots. The union's contract has a no-furlough clause, but Delta has said it can make emergency job cuts because of the industry crisis spawned by the Sept. 11 attacks. In a statement, Delta said it "believes the grievance is without merit. The events of Sept. 11 and the resulting reductions in passenger demand are outside the control of the company."  UAL warned that it expects its fourth-quarter loss will be "substantially greater" than the third-quarter red ink, excluding items, given the weak fare environment, lower traffic and capacity, and higher expected unit costs. Leo Mullin, Delta's chairman and CEO, said Delta will report a "sizable" loss for the fourth quarter.
