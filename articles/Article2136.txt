 Some Firms Skip the Middleman, Sell Stock Directly to the Investor   By Brooks, Rick, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1996  Companies joining the no-load trend see the strategy as an attractive way to raise new capital.

"We love them," says David Carr, president and chief investment officer of Oak Value Capital Management of Durham, N.C., which owns about a half-million shares of the insurer's stock. He expects annual earnings to grow by about 15% for the next five years, as Aflac expands its business in Japan, which already accounts for the bulk of Aflac's revenue.

Regions Financial. "The big [banks] in Alabama are either going to continue to make money and continue to grow," says David Moon, president of Moon Capital Management in Knoxville, Tenn., "or someone will step in and buy them." And Regions, with $14 billion in assets, looks attractive no matter what the outcome. Earlier this month, it completed acquisitions of two banks in metro Atlanta, extending its foothold in the growing market -- and making it more enticing to potential acquirers, Mr. Moon says.
