 Deals & Deal Makers: Asset-Management Firms Crowd the Sales Block Now   By By Ken Brown and Steven Lipin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 2, 2000  Nicholas-Applegate manages mostly institutional stock funds that focus on technology and other growth areas. Its Global Technology Fund returned 498% in 1999. At 3% of assets, a standard price for a fund firm, Nicholas-Applegate could fetch $1.35 billion, though in the current environment, the price likely will be much higher, industry executives said.  Among the other big firms on the block are Perpetual PLC, a British company that has retained Merrill Lynch, of New York. The growing international nature of the deal-making has played into the hands of big investment banks such as Merrill and Goldman Sachs Group, also of New York. In fact, Nicholas-Applegate hired Goldman for this deal after using Putnam Lovell for its two previous acquisitions and three previous divestitures. Neither Goldman nor Nicholas-Applegate would comment on the matter. The hiring of Goldman by Nicholas-Applegate was reported in the Financial Times yesterday.  Putnam and Goldman are both top-five players in the advisory business for asset-management firms. But at a time when the business is going global, Goldman's huge overseas presence gives it a broader platform from which to find a buyer, compared with Putnam, a boutique whose operations are concentrated mostly in the U.S. Putnam officials declined to comment.
