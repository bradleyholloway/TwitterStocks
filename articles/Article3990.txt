 Bumpy Road Led to Alliance Of AOL, Google   By Angwin, Julia, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  Although the decision about whether to partner with Google or Microsoft was critical to AOL's future, Time Warner took the negotiations out of AOL's hands and put them under the control of Mr. [Olaf Olafsson]. Negotiators from Microsoft and Google noticed tensions between the AOL camp and the Time Warner camp led by Mr. Olafsson, and occasionally received conflicting messages from AOL executives and Mr. Olafsson, according to people familiar with the situation.  Since then, nearly all of AOL's executives -- who had hoped to inject AOL's new-media ways into Time Warner's magazine, movie and TV operations -- have been swept out of the company. Richard Parsons, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, has stabilized the overall corporation's operations, pared down its massive debt and invested in AOL's turnaround plan, which involves transforming AOL.com into a free "portal" site to compete with Yahoo, Google and others.  Many at AOL believe that Time Warner hasn't been a good parent, most prominently AOL co-founder Steve Case, who made his feelings public after he left the Time Warner board in October. Chief among their complaints is that Time Warner has only recently taken steps toward merging AOL's Internet service with Time Warner Cable's high- speed Internet service. In the intervening four years, AOL has lost millions of subscribers to Internet competitors -- including Time Warner Cable. Similarly, AOL hasn't rolled out its Internet telephone service in Time Warner Cable's markets, to avoid competing with that unit's own Internet phone offering.
