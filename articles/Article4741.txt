 When a Married Name Is a Nom de Guerre   By By Jeanne C. Meister, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1987  It was the first day back at the office after my honeymoon. When the phone rang, I picked up on the first ring and proudly said my new name, Jeanne Cioffi Meister. Silence. I repeated, this time with more feeling. "I know what 'meister' means in German," said the voice on the other end, "but what, please, is a 'cioffi?'"  And so it went, silences, giggles, several "huh's?" and a few "Jeanne who's?" Then a marketing and creative type from an advertising agency asked if he could enter my name in a contest to name a European coffee machine that he was helping to introduce. Another caller demanded to know why I had dropped the "von" from such a "wonderfully aristocratic German name like von Cioffimeister." I had to explain that I'm Italian, my husband is Jewish and there has never been a "von" in either family tree.
