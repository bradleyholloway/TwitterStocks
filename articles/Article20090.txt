 Starting Out: Money for Grad Students   By Ransom, Diana, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2007  According to 2006 data from the College Board, graduate and professional students use loans to fund 69% of their education costs, while undergraduates rely on loans for 52% of their funding. Students who received master's degrees in 2004 graduated owing an average $27,000 in debt, while undergraduates weighed in just above $19,000, says the National Center for Education Statistics.  For grad school, as for undergraduate study, there are generally three types of federally backed loans and also private loans. Among the U.S. loans, there are subsidized Perkins loans for needy students, both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans and unsubsidized Plus loans.  To apply, head to the financial-aid office, where staffers may also have information about outside scholarships and fellowships that other students have received. For a list of such programs, go to FinAid.org, click on "Scholarships" and then click on "prestigious scholarships and fellowships."
