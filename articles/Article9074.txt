 FTC Tackles an `Anonymous' Web Survey   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1999  Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Liberty reached a consent agreement with the FTC over the agency's complaint challenging its Web site www.younginvestor.com. The site still asks lots of personal questions, such as whether or not the children earn money from odd jobs. But from now on, Liberty promises it won't keep track of the name of, say, that 12-year-old in Cincinnati who earned $500 from babysitting last year.  A Liberty spokesman, L. Harrison Thayer, notes that the site has been changed to comply with new Internet privacy rules for children that were proposed by the FTC earlier this year. "We've changed the site to meet the emerging standards," he says. "At no time did our company ever compromise a child's privacy. We've never used {the survey information} for our purposes or shared it" with another entity.  On the Web site, Liberty sought to persuade young Web surfers to fill out a survey by dangling a chance to win prizes and a free newsletter. Problem is, the FTC says, the free newsletter never came and the company didn't select as many prize winners as it represented on the site. What's more, the site falsely represented that personal information would be maintained anonymously. In fact, Liberty retained the names, addresses and e-mails of the people who participated in the cyberspace survey, the FTC complaint alleges.
