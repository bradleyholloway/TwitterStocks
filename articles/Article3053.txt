 Small-Stock Focus: Firms With Dream but No Dollar Laud Nasdaq   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  Executives were reacting to comments on Thursday by Nasdaq Chairman Hardwick Simmons that the $1 minimum requirement might be relaxed because of the way the market has treated "companies with real balance sheets and real business." Mr. Simmons said that about 500 of the Nasdaq's 3,800 stocks are below $1.  Mr. [Michael DeMaio] confirmed that stocks already delisted because they're below $1 wouldn't automatically be reinstated. Nasdaq has delisted 206 stocks this year and these companies "would have to reapply for inclusion," he said.  Clothing and fabrics stocks also rose after falling on concerns about less retail buying and the West Coast dockworkers lockout. Tommy Hilfiger (NYSE) rose 13%, or 1.01, to 8.85; Fossil rose 6.9%, or 1.07, to 16.69; and Quiksilver (NYSE) added 9%, or 1.79, to 21.58.
