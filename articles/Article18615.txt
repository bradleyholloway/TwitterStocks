 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Raju Narisetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1994  Most companies don't have formal part-time policies and tend to approve only some reasons. The most likely: working mothers, who ask most frequently, followed by employees attending school. Target Stores finds part-timers more efficient -- coffee breaks are shorter, memos more succinct -- because "they want it to work," says Harlan Limpert, Target official. Arizona Public Service Co. pays full benefits for anyone working 20 hours.  Now that the auto maker has agreed to hire 779 new workers to settle a strike in Flint, Mich., more GM plants are trying to get in on the action. About 100 workers could be added to a transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, which has threatened to strike, say United Auto Workers union officials who spent the weekend negotiating with GM over this issue.  And at a Cadillac plant in Hamtramck, Mich., a UAW official said a request to hire another 50 workers has been approved by plant management and now needs approval from top brass at GM. Meanwhile, in Flint, Mich., where 11,400 workers went on strike last week, Dave Yettaw, UAW Local 599 president, celebrates the UAW's gains, noting that most new workers will come from a pool of 2,000 laid-off workers.
