 British Air to Retire Concorde   By By Daniel Michaels, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  British Airways has Europe's largest trans-Atlantic operation, with 227 flights weekly between Britain and the U.S. on conventional subsonic jetliners. Concorde has offered a marketing advantage for the airline, which has relied heavily on such big corporate customers as investment bankers, who are able to pay its $12,000 fare for round-trip Concorde service. Since mid-2001, that market has been dwindling.  The Concorde entered commercial service on Jan. 21, 1976, and immediately became a symbol of the burgeoning "jet set," but also of waste and excess. It is an enormously expensive plane to operate and maintain. To cross the Atlantic in less than three hours, the 100-seat, four-engine jetliner consumes as much fuel as a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, yet carries fewer than one-fourth the passengers. It requires many times the upkeep of a modern Boeing or Airbus plane and demands a specially trained flight crew of three, compared with two in all current Boeing and Airbus models.
