 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Karen Hube, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1999  A new IRS program that lets taxpayers charge taxes is unexpectedly attracting some super-wealthy individuals. At least seven taxpayers have asked to charge between $1 million and $9 million in taxes on American Express or MasterCard, says U.S. Audiotex, San Ramon, Calif., which is processing credit-card tax payments. At least 20 taxpayers have asked to charge more than $100,000, the firm says. The large payments haven't been processed yet.  "People are attracted to the rewards programs" the cards offer, says Robert McKinley, president of CardWeb.com Inc., Frederick, Md. Even after paying a fee as high as 2.5% to charge taxes ($25,000 per $1 million), in some cases the rewards can pay off: For example, a $4 million charge could rack up enough points "to buy 40 friends first-class round-trip airline tickets to London," Mr. McKinley says. The tickets' value: about $400,000.  Official estimates, which by law must be printed on each form or its instructions, are "a terrible reflection of how long it really takes," an IRS spokesman says. For example, according to official IRS estimates, it will take taxpayers an average of 11 hours and 34 minutes to fill out a form 1040 this year, two hours longer than last year. That includes 40 minutes just to copy and mail the form. But, an IRS spokesman says, "unless you're copying it by hand, I don't think it's going to take you that long."
