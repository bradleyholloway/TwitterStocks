 Tiny Gemstar Agrees to Buy TV Guide --- Stock Acquisition Is Valued At About $7.72 Billion; Ends Litigation of Rivals   By By John Lippman and Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1999  The deal unites Gemstar, the leading provider of onscreen program guides builtin to electronic devices, with the leading publisher of program guides and operator of program-guide cable channels, TV Guide. The combined company is likely to have a dominating influence on the operation of TVs in the future.  Pasadena-based Gemstar, which has only 211 employees and had revenue last year of just $166 million, is a highflying intellectual-property company that holds several lucrative technology patents that allow viewers access to electronic program guides through hand-held remote controls. Gemstar and TV Guide and their predecessor companies have been slugging it out in Oklahoma state court for six years over technology for delivering program times and other information into TVs, computers and other video services.  Under terms of the deal, each class A and B shareholder of TV Guide Inc. will receive 0.6573 common share of Gemstar, giving the transaction a value of $7.72 billion, based on yesterday's closing price of Gemstar and TV Guide's 154.2 million class A and B shares. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, shares of Gemstar closed at $76.1875, down $7.4375, or 9%. TV Guide's class A shares, meanwhile, jumped 11%, or $4.4062, to $45.9375.
