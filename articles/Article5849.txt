 Senate Approves New Disclosure Laws For Secretive `527' Political Groups   By By Jim VandeHei, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  The new 527s operate as political organizations, but as long as they don't advocate the election or defeat of particular candidates, they can escape FEC disclosure requirements. This loophole has prompted everyone from lawmakers to the Sierra Club to form 527s, raise piles of money, and operate free of scrutiny.  The Senate measure would require that 527 groups disclose how much they spend on political activities and the identities of donors. Given the convincing victory, Sen. [John McCain] now plans to work with GOP leaders to expand the legislation to cover all politically active tax-exempt groups, from labor unions to think tanks. He also plans to accelerate his campaign to purge unregulated soft money from the political system, a key tenet of the reform agenda he pushed during his presidential bid.  Fourteen GOP senators ignored impassioned pleas from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and voted to mandate full disclosure for 527s.
