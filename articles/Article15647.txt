 Japan's Saison Group Seeks Cash Bids For Its Inter-Continental Hotels Unit   By By Christina Binkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1998  Japan's Saison Group, looking to raise funds quickly to pay off its debt, is soliciting all-cash bids for its luxury InterContinental Hotels unit, and wants to have a definitive pact by late March, according to people close to the bidding for the hotels.  The hotel unit, which is based in London, is expected to fetch at least $2.5 billion as a cluster of U.S. and international hoteliers compete for the top-flight properties. A deal would include 215 hotels under the Inter-Continental and Forum brand names that Inter-Continental owns, leases or operates in partnerships, the people said.  Marriott International Inc., based in Washington, D.C., and British-based Bass PLC and Ladbroke Group PLC are among those engaged in a heated bidding contest for Inter-Continental, the people said. Marriott recently altered its stock structure to allow it to buy assets without diluting ownership of current shareholders. A Marriot official declined to comment. Bass officials didn't return a call for comment.
