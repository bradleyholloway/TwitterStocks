 Pennsylvania Charges Deloitte Contributed to Insurer's Failure   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2003  Deloitte told KKR about the shortfall "in exchange for millions of dollars" in accounting fees, the state alleges. Deloitte "exploited the competing interests of KKR and Reliance and benefited financially by receiving payments from clients on opposite sides" of the proposed deal, according to the state. KKR hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. It had no comment on Reliance or the state's charges, spokeswoman Ruth Pachman said.
