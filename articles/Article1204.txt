 Lockheed Earnings Declined by 27% In Second Quarter   By By Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1989  CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp., having taken write-downs for cost overruns on two aircraft programs and the near phase-out of a third, posted a 27% drop in second-quarter net earnings.  "They're not doing bad just to be holding their own," said Jerry Cantwell, of Wertheim Schroder & Co. His adjusted earnings, removing $27 million in special pretax charges, showed less than a 5% year-to-year dip in operating income. Nonetheless, Mr. Cantwell said Lockheed's aircraft margins appear tighter than he had assumed, and thus was planning to lower his 1989 earnings estimate to under $5 a share from $5.25.  Daniel M. Tellep, Lockheed's chairman, said the aerospace company has been hit this year by the completion of the C-5B aircraft transport program at its Marietta, Ga., facility and a higher tax rate. He cited the same factors when accounting for lower first-quarter results.
