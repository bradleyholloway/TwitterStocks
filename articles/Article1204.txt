 Coming of Age With Clarence   By Suk, Jeannie, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2007  I came of age during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. As a feminist freshman at Yale, I scrutinized the photos depicting Anita Hill's sad and fatalistic resolve, and pondered how an accusation of sexual harassment could be "a high-tech lynching for uppity black folks," as Mr. Thomas called it.  The tenor of the reaction to Justice Thomas's recent memoir, "My Grandfather's Son" has been: Why must he dredge up this sordid tale, 16 years later? He is a Supreme Court justice, after all, and we have all moved on, even Anita Hill.  One need not be soft on sexual harassment to realize, after 16 years, that our country put Clarence Thomas through hell on the basis of accusations that don't approach the sexual allegations that we have rightly allowed to recede into the background of [Bill Clinton]'s distinguished career. The high-tech lynching didn't keep Justice Thomas off the Court, but it did plenty of damage that, on closer scrutiny today, doesn't look fair by our own standards.
