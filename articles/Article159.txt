George J. Vojta, who was in the running to succeed Walter B. Wriston as chairman of Citicorp, has resigned to become senior vice president and chief financial officer of the Phibro Corporation, according to sources in the banking industry.  In an interview last year, Mr. Vojta, who is 45 years old, said that he thought he had a chance to succeed Mr. Wriston.  And earlier this year, Mr. Wriston would not rule out the possibility that Mr. Vojta (pronounced voy-ta) might fill his post.  However, since that time, other executives have moved to the forefront as possible successors for Mr. Wriston. Considering that he decided to leave Citicorp, which he joined 20 years ago, Mr. Vojta apparently has determined that his hopes were dim or nonexistent. Mr. Vojta left for home yesterday before he could be reached for comment. His resignation will become effective June 30.  Earlier this year, Mr. Vojta was named deputy to G.A. Costanzo, Citicorp's vice chairman. Mr. Costanzo will reach the mandatory retirement age later this year and is expected to retire at that time.  A native of Chicago, Mr. Vojta developed the plan that led to Citicorp's present organizational structure. After graduating from Yale University, he joined Citibank (then First National City Bank) as a trainee in 1961. He was stationed in various posts throughout the Far East until 1972, when he took charge of the corporate planning department. A year later, he was promoted to senior vice president and general manager in charge of the international banking group. In 1977 he was put in charge of corporate strategy and development, where he remained until being named deputy to Mr. Costanzo earlier this year.
