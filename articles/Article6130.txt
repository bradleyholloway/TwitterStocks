 Marriott Moves to Answer Accounting Questions   By By Christina Binkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  The Washington, D.C., hotelier counters that it isn't doing anything inappropriate. It recently renegotiated its contracts with Host Marriott, settling that dispute. A lawsuit regarding procurement practices at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was dismissed earlier this week by the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico, Marriott said. That hotel is currently in bankruptcy proceedings, and its owners are attempting to cancel the management contract with Ritz-Carlton, which is owned by Marriott. At least four other lawsuits by other owners remain unresolved.  In the letter, Marriott outlined its role in Avendra, a joint-venture purchasing company with Hyatt Hotels Corp., Chicago, Six Continents PLC in London, and several other hotel companies that has been central to many Marriott-owners' questions. It notes that Marriott recorded a $1 million loss last year for its "less-than-50%" stake in Avendra.  Marriott says that Avendra retained $13.5 million in cash rebates for Marriott properties last year, and passed another $8 million back to the hotelier, which returned them to owners. It's the first time that Marriott has disclosed how much money Avendra retains for these rebates, which have played a big role in the lawsuits.
