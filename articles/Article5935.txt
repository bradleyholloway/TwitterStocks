 Engineers Set Legislative Effort To Recapture Outsourced Work   By By Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1997  The union representing state-employed engineers soon will begin an all-out lobbying effort to recapture the work performed by outside engineering consultants at a taxpayer cost of nearly $160 million a year.  Union representatives say there's little chance the legislation will become law, given Gov. Pete Wilson's penchant for contracting out work. Their hope, instead, is that legislative debate will raise public awareness of the union's concerns and help pave the way for passage of a proposed constitutional amendment -- virtually identical to the legislation -- that the union has already qualified for the June 1998 statewide ballot.
