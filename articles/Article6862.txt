 Hartford Fires Two Underwriters Amid State Probe   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2004  According to the lawsuit, Marsh would list the quotes other insurers had provided, instructing Hartford to bid "typically 25% above" those figures "to ensure that Hartford would not get the business." The lawsuit adds: "Hartford provided these quotes because Marsh was its biggest broker, and it felt that Marsh would limit its business opportunities if it refused."  Mr. [Eliot Spitzer]'s lawsuit against Marsh also maintains that Marsh employees in Lake Mary, Fla., "on numerous occasions" requested inflated quotes or nonbinding "indication" quotes from Hartford for small-business clients. Hartford "colluded in the scheme," the lawsuit alleges, noting that Hartford "had office space in Marsh's Lake Mary facilities."
