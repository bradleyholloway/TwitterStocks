 Many Companies Fail to Heed the SEC On Its Revenue-Recognition Guidelines   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  Since issuing the bulletin last year, the SEC has revised it twice -- most recently in June -- and twice delayed its implementation date. And the agency on Oct. 12 released a series of questions and answers to help companies still grappling with the guidance. For companies implementing the SEC bulletin this quarter, adoption is retroactive to the beginning of the year. So, if a company has to change its revenue-recognition policy this quarter to comply with SAB 101, it also must restate its financial results for the first nine months of 2000, notes Pat McConnell, an accounting expert at Bear Stearns.  Ultimately, the SEC says it expects as many as 300 companies will change the way they book revenue to comply with SAB 101, which doesn't formally change any accounting rules but is designed to clarify the SEC's stance on acceptable practices. Accounting experts say investors probably will see the most warnings from sectors including biotechnology, health care, computers and telecom, where revenue often has included upfront payments, and semiconductor-equipment, where revenue often is booked when products are shipped rather than when customers accept them.  Since that filing, Novellus did announce on Nov. 30 that SAB 101 may cause fourth-quarter sales to fall 5% to 10% short of the company's previously announced estimate of $415 million. Because of SAB 101, Novellus will delay recognition of revenue until customers have formally communicated their acceptance of Novellus products. Before, Novellus recognized revenue at the time of shipment.
