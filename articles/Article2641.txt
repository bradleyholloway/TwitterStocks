 Kiddie-Porn Law Upheld   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1994  A federal appeals court upheld a child-pornography law that publishers have challenged as unconstitutional.  The law aimed to discourage the use of child actors or models and to make it easier for prosecutors to go after producers of child pornography. Opponents attack the statute as a means to prosecute producers of otherwise lawful depictions of adult sex who merely fail to follow record-keeping and labeling requirements. The statute will inhibit production of material that isn't itself illegal, opponents contend.
