 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; For Managers of Diversified Funds, Big and Small Bets Pay Off; Top Performers Don't Mind Dumping a Lagging Stock If That Will Make Money   By Laura Saunders Egodigwe, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2005  Mr. [Andrew P. Pilara Jr.] and his team establish an intrinsic value for each stock and will sell when they determine that value has been reached. They'll also bail out if something just doesn't work. If a company uses capital in a way that destroys shareholder value, take an ill-advised acquisition, RS Value Fund may sell. They'll also re-evaluate a company if its return on capital begins to decline. The fund's exit strategy is all part of its low-risk investing style. "If you're going to make a mistake and fall out the window, Mr. Pilara says, "fall out the basement window."  The fund's biggest investment is in energy stocks, which represents more than 25% of assets, partially due to appreciation of the stocks it holds. In 2004 "I became very bullish on the price of crude oil," Mr. [Ken Heebner] says, adding, "we're going to make a lot of money in these stocks even if the price of oil doesn't go up."  His picks include Murphy Oil Co. Mr. Heebner says Murphy, an oil and gas producer based in El Dorado, Ark., has "decent sensitivity" to rising oil and gas prices in addition to "exceptional" exploration prospects. The company has concessions in deepwater offshore Malaysia, the Congo and the Gulf of Mexico. The concessions offshore Malaysia are extensive, obtained years ago when oil was a fraction of its current price, he says, and the company is splitting rights to it with the Malay government. "Not only do they have a lot of prospects there," Mr. Heebner says, "But a number of these prospects have been found to have oil." Mr. Heebner bought Murphy Oil shares at $76.8 apiece, and it recently traded around $97.
