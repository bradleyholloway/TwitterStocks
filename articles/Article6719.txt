 Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis; Fundamentals of Investing: Passage to Asia?; Four fund managers discuss strategies for playing it safe in a region with a history of volatile stock movements   By Cui, Carolyn, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  "The markets are taking global risks seriously, which is very healthy," says Mark Headley, portfolio manager of the Matthews Pacific Tiger fund since 1996. He says the August selloff took stock valuations in Asia from "very expensive" to "quite reasonable," making him more inclined to start new positions in places such as China and India. But while he believes the bull market is "quite intact in Asia," he cautions those considering an investment: Ease in, don't jump. "It isn't a fantasy land," he says.  Investors may have a tough time determining how thoroughly their mutual funds examine financial statements. They can look for words like "fundamental research" or "detailed company research" in the section of the fund's prospectus that explains how managers make investment decisions. "But you don't really know if the managers are actually doing that," Ms. [Madelynn Matlock] says. If the prospectus says a fund uses "quantitative methods" or "macropolicies," that might mean it isn't spending a lot of time analyzing the nature of a company's expansion, she says.  Ms. Matlock frets about the potential unwinding of a practice of arbitrage by hedge funds and other big players known as the "carry trade," under which they borrow in lower-interest-rate currencies, like the Japanese yen, and invest in higher-rate markets like New Zealand or Iceland. With little known publicly about the size of the trades, Ms. Matlock calls the matter "a gorilla in the room."
