 Israel Prepares Military Response To Bus Bombing; Palestinian Leader, Bowing To Pressure, Vows to Arrest The Militants Behind Blast   By Chazan, Guy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2003  Mr. [Ariel Sharon]'s security cabinet met late yesterday to give the final go-ahead for the plan, which Israeli media reported would include arrests, raids and "targeted killings" of militants from the three main hard-line groups: Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. Israeli tanks also moved to take position round the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian government.  Meanwhile, Secretary of State Colin Powell called Mr. [Mahmoud Abbas] to demand "immediate action" against terror groups, Palestinian officials said. Earlier, in a phone call to Israel's Mr. Sharon, President Bush said terrorists had to be dealt with. "Those organizations whose raison d'etre is to murder innocent people and to destroy the peace process must themselves be eliminated," Mr. Bush said, according to an Israeli government transcript of the conversation.  "The showdown has come," said Elias Zananiri, a spokesman for Palestinian Security Minister Mohammed Dahlan. "This is a turning point."
