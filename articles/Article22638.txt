 Telefonica, KPN Must Surmount Much on Way To Megamerger   By By Gautam Naik and Carlta Vitzthum, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2000  A merger between Spain's Telefonica SA and Dutch carrier Royal KPN NV would create a European powerhouse in mobile phone and Internet services, but the deal could get bogged down in managerial and political problems.  Telefonica yesterday confirmed in a statement to Spain's securities watchdog that it "has been holding conversations with KPN on several matters, including the possibility of integrating all or part of their businesses." It added, however, that "there is no certainty the mentioned talks will yield positive results."  If successful, the deal would value KPN at more than $60 billion and create Europe's third-largest wireless company by subscribers, after Vodafone AirTouch PLC and Telecom Italia Mobile. The merged entity would be a big European provider of Internet access to corporate customers, second in size only to MCI WorldCom Inc. It would reach from Latin America, where Telefonica is the biggest player, to Europe, where KPN has several businesses.
