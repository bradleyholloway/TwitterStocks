 Rules Change Could Alter the Fate of Long-Distance Giants   By Almar Latour and Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 2004  If MCI exited the consumer-phone business, it would be abandoning a market it virtually created as the first company to successfully challenge the old AT&T monopoly in the 1980s. "It's sad for MCI in our hearts because we have a certain pride about being the ones to first deliver competition to the consumer market," said Wayne Huyard, MCI's president of U.S. sales.  John Donoghue, a former MCI official who designed that company's innovative "Friends and Family" calling plan, said the result of the developments is that the Bells will so thoroughly dominate the consumer phone business "there will be one competitor in each [geographic] area. It's pretty much the end of an era."  Bell company Qwest Communications International Inc. already has signed a commercial wholesale agreement with MCI to lease its lines under new terms that aren't dictated by the old rules covered by the court ruling. The reason? "We have accepted that we are a commodity," says Gary R. Lytle, who handles Qwest's relations with the federal government. "When you're a commodity, the more people distribute your product, the better. So we welcome wholesale customers."
