 Bush Tax Panel Targets Mortgages   By Robert Guy Matthews, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2005  While details are still being worked out, the bipartisan panel is leaning toward lowering the cap for mortgage deductions to about $300,000, disallowing deductions for interest payments to the extent the mortgage exceeds that amount. That would put the deduction more closely in line with the Federal Housing Administration's maximum insurance on loans. Currently, the deduction cap is $1 million. The median price for a home in August was about $220,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.  If the commission moves toward recommending a ceiling on employer- provided health insurance, it could affect only the most generous health plans. Panel member Timothy J. Muris, a professor at George Mason School of Law and former head of the Federal Trade Commission, suggested that the ceiling should be around $11,000 for family coverage -- about the average amount provided by the federal government to its employees. A tax would be applied on the amount over the agreed ceiling.
