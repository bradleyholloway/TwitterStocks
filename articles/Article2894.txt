 Pessimism Sinks Two-Year Bond Yield, but Stocks Show Life Signs   By By E.S. Browning and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2001  The fed-funds rate is the rate at which banks lend one another money overnight, and it helps determine the prime rate that U.S. banks use as a base for a wide range of loans. By influencing market interest rates, cuts in the fed-funds rate help make it easier for companies and consumers to invest and spend money, stimulating the economy.  "The economy isn't falling off the precipice but some people in the market are now saying the Fed may cut rates" on Aug. 21 by half a percentage point, to a fed-funds rate of 3.25%, says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Barrington, Ill. Whatever the Fed does next week, many investors believe, it is likely to cut rates further later.  Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.02%, or 0.02 point, to 130.86.
