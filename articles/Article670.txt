 GCA Expects to Post A Third-Quarter Loss Exceeding $27 Million   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1985  BEDFORD, Mass. -- GCA Corp., reeling from the semiconductor industry slump, said that it will report a third-quarter loss of more than $27 million and that it dismissed 500 workers, about 15% of its U.S. work force.  GCA, which makes semiconductor manufacturing and factory automation equipment, said about half of the quarterly deficit is an operating loss and the rest results from write-downs and expenses associated with the dismissals.
