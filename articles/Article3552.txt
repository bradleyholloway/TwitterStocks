 Map Quest: New Genetic Tools May Reveal Roots Of Everyday Ills; Rapid DNA Tests Can Search Many Variations At Once; Probing Obesity, Memory; One Worry: Statistical Errors   By Regalado, Antonio, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2006  The technology may quickly uncover genes that influence one's odds of getting many everyday ailments, says Francis Collins, head of genome research at the National Institutes of Health. If so, it could transform wide areas of medical research. For instance, with the most common form of diabetes, called Type II, years of study using older methods have uncovered only three genes known to influence risk. "I expect there are about 12 genes involved," Dr. Collins says, "and that all of them will be discovered in the next two years."  There are many caveats. It's a "big question" how well the technology will perform, says Robert Waterston, a genome expert at the University of Washington. He says the genome-association studies entail a "critical assumption" that common diseases are influenced by common gene variants. If, instead, it turns out that rare versions of genes are to blame, he says, the new approach won't detect them.  [TGen], in operation for just over three years, is housed in a $50 million new glass-and-concrete office building in Phoenix paid for by the city as part of an effort to bolster the region's health-care sector. A medical school under construction will offer a specialty in "personalized medicine." TGen's Dr. [Dietrich Stephan] hopes the memory study involving the Swiss youths will be among the first to be published using the newest biochips.
