 New Regimen: Inside Abbott's Tactics To Protect AIDS Drug; Older Pill's Price Hike Helps Sales of Flagship; A Probe in Illinois   By Carreyrou, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2007  As for the price-increase scenario, the document listed as a "Pro" that health insurers might stop covering Norvir, which would hurt sales of other protease inhibitors and force patients to use Kaletra. Among the cons, it cautioned that the move would "tarnish" Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White's debut as chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade group, and "position" [Abbott] as a "big, bad, greedy pharmaceutical company." Abbott says this slide presentation was made by a public-relations firm working for the company at the time.  In early October, as a second new protease inhibitor from GlaxoSmithKline PLC neared FDA approval, another internal document recommended the price increase. It warned that if Norvir's price wasn't raised, "the Abbott franchise will be severely threatened by the competitor's ability to 'piggy back' on Norvir's uniqueness." If Abbott took no action, it predicted, Kaletra prescriptions would fall 10% in 2004.  John Erickson, a former Abbott scientist who did much of the research work on Norvir, spoke in favor of the request. He testified that it was unlikely Abbott would have funded Norvir's early development without a $3.5 million grant it received from the NIH in 1988. Abbott doesn't dispute the grant was important but says it also invested its own money in HIV research, including $300 million on clinical trials of Norvir. The NIH decided in Abbott's favor, saying it wasn't empowered to determine whether a drug's price was too high.
