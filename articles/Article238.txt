DENVER, Aug. 22â€” The Library Commission here, over the opposition of its chairman, has voted to charge nonresidents $10 a day or $100 a year to use Denver's public library.  ''This is fundamentally wrong,'' the chairman, Edward Miller, said after the commission approved the plan Wednesday.  ''The public library system is predicated on old principles set up 150 years ago for free libraries and free access.''  The library, which is operating with a $900,000 deficit, has been seeking new sources of money since the Colorado Legislature appropriated only $310,000 of the $1.2 million the library had requested.  Under the new plan, all those who want to use the library must have a library card or a daily pass, beginning Oct. 1. A day pass would cost $10. Those who live outside the city would pay $100 a year for an individual or $200 for a family.  The new plan would allow free library use by residents of counties that pay part of the library's deficit. Neighboring Jefferson County, for instance, would have to pay $200,000 to for its residents to use the library for free.
