 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: House of the Week / Golden-Gate View   By McMullen, Troy, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2005  Due Diligence: This red brick, Georgian-style home, built in 1904, sits on a tree-lined street in the residential neighborhood of Presidio Heights, near Pacific Heights and a few blocks from the Golden Gate Bridge. Its owners, Robert Kassel, a 60-year-old former executive, and his wife, Maureen, bought the property in 1993 and spent several years renovating it, including enlarging upper-floor bedrooms and adding a large window in the family room for views of the Golden Gate Bridge.
