 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Friends of Public Television   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1992  Public television to most people means an oasis of intellectually respectable programming. They think of Ken Burns's series on the Civil War, MacNeil-Lehrer, "Nature," "Mystery" or wonderfully acted dramatic series. But somewhere off in the far corners of American life, there are those who believe that public television's real mission is programs such as "Endangered Species: The Toxic Poisoning of Communities of Color" or "Tears: The Ho Chi Minh Trail."  A nice little flap has now developed around the decision by Senator Bob Dole and other Republicans to hold up funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting until a good explanation is given for why federal money should underwrite efforts such as "Citizen Dhoruba," a documentary extolling the virtues of a former Black Panther convicted of shooting two New York policemen. This, of course, has raised cries and screams of censorship. But it's also given everyone a chance to have a closer look at the relationship between Congress's politics and public TV's politics.
