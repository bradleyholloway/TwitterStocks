 Long & Short: General Motors Faces a Bumpy Road, And Reverberations Could Be Wide   By Eisinger, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2005  Indeed, GM faces big long-term health care and pension liabilities, as investors have recognized. Last year, the stock fell 25% and the shares are down more than 40% since the heady spring of 2002, when GM's revival was the talk of Wall Street. Ratings companies raised red flags about GM's debt, with Standard & Poor's now saying the company's bonds are just a notch less risky than junk bonds.  If GM took a turn for the worse and was downgraded again, it could have reverberations beyond the car industry. GM's debt load would amount to about 10% of regularly traded junk bonds, according to Morgan Stanley. That means that GM isn't only too big to fail, it could even be too big for the junk-bond market. A flood of GM junk bonds could hurt junk-bond prices across the board.  Auto-sector investors have soured on this practice, but they haven't grasped that GM isn't the only misguided Pavlov. It's a retail-wide phenomenon. Look at Christmas sales, notably Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s. The end-of-the-year pattern keeps getting more pronounced. First, early holiday season sales are weak. Retailers get nervous and respond by discounting. Their sales end up OK, but profits suffer.
