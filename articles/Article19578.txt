 Disputed Party Wins Turkish Vote For Parliament --- Party With Islamist Roots Promises Alliance to U.S. And a Cleaner Government   By By Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2002  A party with Islamist roots swept parliamentary polls yesterday in Turkey, the most secular state in the Islamic world. But it did so by promising convergence with Europe, continued alliance with the U.S. and clean government after a decade of weak coalitions and economic mismanagement.  Worries still undercut Turks' hopes of an end to a decade of woes that culminated in a 9% contraction of the economy last year. Mr. Erdogan is himself banned from standing for election because of his jail conviction, and nobody yet knows who the next prime minister will be. A state prosecutor has filed suit to close the whole party down for keeping Mr. Erdogan as leader despite his conviction. Other such clashes with the secular establishment in Ankara seem inevitable.  The Justice and Development Party says it has changed to become electable. Mr. Erdogan, who will remain the dominant force behind any prime minister, started out in politics as an Islamist. He now calls himself a conservative who believes in the separation of religion and politics. "We are going to push hard for membership of the European Union," Mr. Erdogan said last night. "And we don't plan to disturb anyone's way of life."
