 Big Retailers Had Mixed Gains for July With Apparel Sales Leading Durables   By By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1989  The nation's big retailers posted mixed sales gains in July, with stores primarily offering apparel merchandise outperforming those with inventories containing more durable goods.  The July results, which averaged about a 5% gain from the year earlier, only modestly outpaced general inflation, and were in line with analyst expectations. But the sales increase came off relatively weak 1988 results and indicate a generally lackluster retailing environment likely to continue for the rest of 1989, analysts said.  "Sales were mixed, but generally only modest, and reflective of the general weakening conditions of the overall economy," said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. "Apparel sales were favorable against a weak performance in 1988. By contrast, big-ticket durable sales this year were quite soft, reflecting both high interest rates and the fact that demand has already been satisfied for many of these items."
