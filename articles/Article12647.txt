 Why Are Europeans Still Fighting Missile Defense?   By By Kenneth Adelman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2001  Europeans faulted President [Ronald Reagan] for his "harsh rhetoric" toward Moscow, such as calling the evil empire "the evil empire." European leaders didn't relish American badgering to boost their defense budgets -- which stayed shamefully low compared to U.S. outlays. And, of course, European leaders couldn't stomach Reaganomics, with its bold plans to trim taxes and cut wasteful government programs, or its votes against United Nations regulatory schemes. Add to all this European grumbling over high American budget deficits and the strong dollar.  After all, the Russians never adored the ABM Treaty enough to abide by it. Former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze once told Mr. Reagan over a White House lunch that the Soviet Union had been violating the treaty for years. No, the Russians cherish the ABM Treaty because the Americans abide by it. Under the treaty's terms, the U.S. can't build a real missile defense. Under the Soviet economic system -- and Russia's today -- they couldn't build one.  It's certainly comforting to have allies tag along in any conflict. But they actually contribute more by building support in U.N. halls than by mustering military might on real battlefields. U.S. high-tech prowess has become obvious in air, ship and tank capabilities. It's even more so in intelligence, communications and airlift. It will be most so in creating vast and complicated network systems to form the foundation for ballistic missile defense. Hearing such U.S. plans doesn't make Europeans feel good about their own technological capabilities.
