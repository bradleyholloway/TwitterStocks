 Business Technology: Now, Computing Can Handle Long-Distance Relationships; Teradici's 'Blade' Technology Provides Efficient Connections From Far-Flung Data Centers   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2007  "I can't believe what it can do," says Joe Makoid, president of Devon IT Inc., a company that worked with International Business Machines Corp. to develop a recently announced PC-blade offering. Bruce Cohen, chief executive of ClearCube Technology Inc., an Austin, Texas, company that pioneered PC blades, says, "I think it's going to blow people away."  Until recently, users could be no more than 200 meters from blades. Teradici's trick is to compress and convert display data, along with so-called USB signals used by PC accessories, into the digital format found on corporate networks and the Internet. The approach, which Teradici calls PC over IP, is incorporated into chips for PC blades and desktop connectors called portals.  Likely customers include hospitals, intelligence agencies and any organization concerned about data security. Teradici's technology sets different access privileges; some portal's users, for example, may be allowed to plug in USB "thumb drives" to remove data, but others may not, Mr. [Dan Cordingley] says. "It has a bunch of security features that are unachievable with desktop computers," says Tom Bradicich, a vice president in IBM's systems and technology group.
