 Fill 'er Up, With Color; Ink-Jet Cartridge Refillers Spread to Malls, Main Streets; Going After H-P's Lifeblood   By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  The fast growth of franchisers such as Cartridge World marks a new twist in the multibillion-dollar ink and toner business. While refilling cartridges isn't a new concept, consumers haven't had easy access to it. But since setting up shop in the U.S. in January 2003, Australia-based Cartridge World Inc. has opened about 50 stores and currently is selling new franchises at the rate of five a week. Meanwhile, Canada's Island Ink-Jet Systems Inc., of Courtenay, British Columbia, is opening four new franchises a month, mainly shopping-mall kiosks, in states including Nebraska, Ohio and Oregon. And Caboodle Cartridge Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., with four franchise locations now open, plans to have 60 stores around the country by year end.  Boris Elisman, H-P's vice president of supplies marketing and sales, insists the company isn't gouging consumers. Instead, he says, consumers get the best value for their money from an H-P cartridge, because of the higher quality of the company's inks and the way new cartridges work seamlessly with H-P printers. "Our cartridges still provide superior value," Mr. Elisman says. A May 2004 article from the magazine Consumer Reports, he adds, decried off-brand inks as "lower- quality" and "messier" than regular name-brand cartridges.  H-P says it hasn't tried to mount a legal challenge to Cartridge World's business, and Cartridge World says no other cartridge supplier has done so, either. The problem for the big branded cartridge makers is that it just isn't that hard to figure out how to get ink back into an empty cartridge. Until the day the big companies make a cartridge that permanently seals or self-destructs as soon as it is empty, refillers will have a business.
