 Internet Fund Leads the Pack And Also Trails   By By Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 2002  Unfortunately, mutual funds are judged more typically by three-year returns, a milestone that Mr. [Ryan Jacob]'s portfolio hits today. By that gauge, Jacob Internet Fund is on track for a record of a different sort -- the worst three-year performance among all actively managed funds, according to Morningstar Inc. With a negative return of about 57% annually since its inception, the performance of Jacob Internet Fund ranks as the worst of any of the 9,933 funds tracked by Morningstar during that period with one exception -- a tiny index fund that, like other bigger funds, tracks the Nasdaq 100.  Mr. Jacob's extraordinarily high expenses -- amounting to 4.6% of assets for the fund's fiscal year ended Aug. 31 -- is another blow to shareholders. Mr. Jacob said the high expenses, which compare with 1.4% for the average domestic-stock fund, were a result of the portfolio's sharp drop in assets. Since August, he said the fund's expenses have been reduced, but couldn't give a precise figure.  The move had been expected as The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation, reported Dec. 2 that Janus Capital Management was set to take over 13 Berger mutual funds. Janus and Berger are both Denver-based units of Stilwell Financial Inc., a Kansas City, Mo., firm whose reorganization plan announced in September touched off the need to find new managers for Berger's struggling growth-stock portfolios.
