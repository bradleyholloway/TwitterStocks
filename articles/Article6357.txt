 Deals & Deal Makers: Bids & Offers   By Compiled by Randall Smith, with contributions from Terzah Ewing and Kara Scannell, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 2000  Once, investors in initial public offerings of stock craved any company that had anything to do with the Internet. Then they were rabid for outfits that made Internet equipment-wires, switches, storage, software. Now, IPO fanatics are getting even more basic: Some of this week's hottest new stock issues were from companies that deal in plain old electricity, the Internet Age's fundamental juice.  The hottest IPO in the U.S. recently, based on investors' response, was Active Power Inc., which makes devices that allow telecommunications and networking companies to smooth out electricity-grid problems like power surges and interruptions before they reach their networks. Caterpillar Inc. is a big marketing partner. Active Power's shares more than tripled from its offering price on IPO day Tuesday; the stock has since fallen back a bit but is still 151% above the offer price.  David Gino, the company's chief financial officer, was modest in an interview about the market's giddy reception. "People now understand that there's a need for a power-quality solution, but that kind of message has been, to some extent, ignored or lost until now," he said.
