 World-Wide [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1987  The president called for "a bipartisan effort" to confirm the 51-year-old appeals court judge, and urged "prompt hearings" by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The selection of Kennedy, described as a traditional conservative who believes in a limited role for the courts, was expected. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Kennedy has been on the appellate court in California for 12 years. Some doubt hearings will begin before January.  In a victory for moderate Arab states, a declaration issued at the close of a summit in Jordan also faulted Iran's aggression against Kuwait and called upon Tehran to accept a U.N. call for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war. The leaders also took a significant step toward bringing Egypt back into mainstream Arab politics, with the United Arab Emirates re-establishing formal relations and Baghdad announcing that it would do so soon.  The removal of Yeltsin, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo who recently faulted as too slow the pace of Gorbachev's economic and political campaign, wasn't seen as a personal setback to the Soviet leader. Yeltsin was succeeded by Lev Zaikov, secretary for defense industries and a full Politburo member. Zaikov is considered an ally of Gorbachev, who elevated him over several rivals in 1983 to be Leningrad's first secretary.
