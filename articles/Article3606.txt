 Politics & Economics: Fox Reviews His Leadership of Mexico; Departing President Leaves Successor With Economic Gains and a Divided Nation   By Lyons, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2006  "To have changed the form of government after seven decades was a great achievement of the people of Mexico," Mr. [Vicente Fox] said in his official residence at Los Pinos, Mexico's White House. "Now, to turn over the government in a democratic manner is more evidence that Mexico is a solid democracy, one that has its critics and has its people who think differently, of course, but this is the essence of democracy."  When Mr. Fox's National Action Party won the presidency again, it was in many ways a testament to his legacy. Buoyed by declining interest rates and a steady currency, millions of Mexicans crawled out of poverty and into an expanding lower middle class. In an election that became a referendum on Mexico's economic path, those voters formed a key pillar in the PAN's victory. The victory was far from a mandate; in a multiparty race, Mr. Calderon won just 35% of the vote, and must now govern a divided country.  Passing economic overhauls has also taken on more urgency. Under Mr. Fox, the economy's sluggish average growth underperformed the U.S. and failed to provide anywhere near the 1.25 million jobs needed to meet the demand of an expanding labor force. That prompted millions of young Mexicans to migrate illegally to the U.S., an exodus that stains Mr. Fox's record.
