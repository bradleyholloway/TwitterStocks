 We're in This Fannie Mae Battle Together   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  Which is why I find it surprising that you would label as "laughably weak" reform legislation (H.R. 1461) that passed the House last year by an overwhelming margin of 331-90. As the bill's author, I must defend it and remind you of your earlier writings on this subject. My favorite is from June 2003, advocating the need for congressional action in the wake of Freddie's accounting scandal: "Yet in Congress. Louisiana Republican [Richard H. Baker] has been a lone voice demanding more disclosure. . . . House Speaker Dennis Hastert should now give Mr. Baker a platform for wider hearings, if not a promotion." There is little substantive difference between the bill I introduced that year, which elicited your flattery, and last year's version, which you dismiss with mockery.
