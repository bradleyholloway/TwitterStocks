 Reality Check   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1997  Just 24 hours before the release of videotapes of Bill Clinton hosting campaign contributors at the White House, Attorney General Janet Reno released a formal letter that was in effect a defense brief exonerating the President. Having determined in her opinion that a great many angels can dance in the Lincoln Bedroom without breaking the laws, she shocked the Beltway with her letter absolving the White House of most of its sins. This evades the main point of abuse of power.  While we return to this below, we should stop to note that on their face Ms. Reno's arguments are not totally unreasonable. After all, the current campaign finance laws are an edifice of rules so complicated that an entire agency cannot keep track of them, let alone enforce them. And the Beltway response? Pass more of the same, in the form of the McCain-Feingold reform bill.  Our next stop on the Beltway reality tour brings us to today's vote in the Senate on the Lott-Nickles Paycheck Protection Act. This proposal essentially would give Congress's imprimatur to the Supreme Court's Beck decision, which freed union members from having their dues used for politics they find disagreeable. The Clinton Administration, and Ms. Reno's Justice Department, refuse to enforce the Court's decision. In Beltway speak, the amendment to enforce the Constitution is a "poison pill" to kill McCain-Feingold.
