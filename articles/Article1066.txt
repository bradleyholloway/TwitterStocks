 Time, Warner Communications May Set Cable-TV Venture, Perhaps With HBO   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1988  Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. are discussing a possible combination of their cable-television subsidiaries into a jointly held company that could also include part or all of Time's Home Box Office unit, according to executives familiar with the talks.  Separately, Home Box Offfice said it is discontinuing its two-year attempt to launch a new pay-cable network, Festival, after test-marketing efforts failed to produce enough interest among cable-TV subscribers for the family-oriented movie channel.  While both Time and Warner declined official comment, executives of both companies acknowledged they have had discussions regarding a possible combination of their cable operations. While they stressed that such talks are in very exploratory stages, industry analysts noted such a combination could create a cable giant with more than five million subscribers, more than $2 billion in revenue and a market value of more than $12 billion. Time and Warner might also consider selling a piece of the company to the public, the industry executives said.
