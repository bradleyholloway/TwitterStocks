 De la Madrid at the Halfway Mark   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1985  The world will soon face a renewed debt crisis unless the international financial community finds a "new formula" for dealing with Latin American debtors, warns President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado.  Mr. de la Madrid, almost halfway through his six-year presidential term, talked for more than an hour with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors about oil prices, debt, protectionism, Mexican politics and the state of U.S.-Mexican relations. Speaking in Spanish, despite his Harvard education and fluency in English, the president was serious, almost somber.  Mr. de la Madrid insisted Mexico's political system is stable enough to guide the country through these tough times, and he chided foreigners for their "morbid interest" in Mexico's social problems. Despite three years of austerity imposed to allow Mexico to repay its massive foreign debt, the government still maintains its ability to negotiate among competing interests, he said, likening his job to that of mixing a "suitable cocktail."
