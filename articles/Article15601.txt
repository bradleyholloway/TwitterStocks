 Double Trouble in Thailand for Goodyear --- Drop in Baht, Car Sales Take Air Out of Tire Market   By By Peter Waldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1997  BANGKOK, Thailand -- This summer's steep fall of the Thai baht against the dollar was the first blow to hit Goodyear (Thailand) PCL, which sells tires in baht but buys 70% of its raw materials in dollars.  "The biggest thing affecting our business is the uncertainty," says William Ford, managing director of Goodyear (Thailand), which is 60%-owned by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of Akron, Ohio. "We don't know what to expect next, and nobody can tell us." Last year, the Thai subsidiary was one of the five most profitable companies on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, earning $11.6 million on $129.9 million in sales.  The math is simple. Since the baht's sudden fall, Goodyear's cost to produce tires in Thailand has increased about 20%, Mr. Ford says. Though many of the company's raw materials are purchased locally, Goodyear pays dollars for most of them, based on long-term contracts the company has with its main suppliers world-wide. Goodyear's 600 workers in Thailand produce about 6,000 tires a day.
