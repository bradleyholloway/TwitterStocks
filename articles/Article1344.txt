 Japan's Surplus in Trade Rose by 28% in June   By Chipello, Christopher J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 1990  Japan's trade surplus for June surged, and some economists say the politically sensitive trade surplus, which has eased substantially since 1988, is likely to grow again in coming months.  The 28% increase in the June surplus, to $6.72 billion from the year-earlier $5.27 billion, occurred despite a 10% decrease in the bilateral surplus with the U.S. That was more than offset by a 57% surge in Japan's surplus with other Asian nations and a 4% increase in its surplus with the European Community.  The overall June increase "puts the trade surplus back on a rising path for the second half of the year," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist with Salomon Brothers Inc. in Tokyo. "I think we're getting exactly the kind of switch toward exports and away from imports that you'd expect as a result of 15 months of a soft yen." The lower value of the yen makes imports to Japan more expensive while making the price of Japanese exports more competitive on world markets.
