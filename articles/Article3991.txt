 Me & My Car   By Welsh, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  A: While buying a used vehicle always involves risks that new-car buyers avoid, I'd still recommend the Acura MDX or Lexus RX 330 over the Ford and Mercury. Having driven all three, I think the Acura and Lexus have smoother rides and are better-engineered than the Ford. Even a used one should be a good bet for the long haul, especially if you find one that just came off a two- or three-year lease and still has time on its warranty. Still, you should shop around and test-drive all three to see which is most comfortable for you. Generally, I find the Lexus to be a car in disguise. It doesn't ride at all like a truck but also lacks the rugged feel of the Ford and Acura. The Ford is much more trucklike and I would recommend it more for people who drive off- road frequently.
