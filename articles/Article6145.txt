 Cable & Wireless Had Flat Pretax Earnings In Fiscal '99 First Half   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1998  Cable & Wireless PLC reported flat pretax profit for the first half of fiscal 1999, partly because of weaker results at its Hongkong Telecom Ltd. unit. The company also confirmed that it has ended a nascent alliance with Telecom Italia SpA.  The alliance fell apart weeks ago because of turmoil in Telecom Italia's boardroom and the ouster of its chairman and architect of the Cable & Wireless deal, Gian Mario Rossignolo. Mr. Rossignolo will receive a contract buyout of three billion lire ($1.8 million) from the phone company. The Italian carrier has now failed at four separate alliances.
