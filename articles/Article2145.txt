 International Game Lures Back Executives From Casino Data   By Orwall, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1996  IGT controls approximately 70% to 80% of the domestic slot-machine market, but has been under attack recently from a growing field of feisty challengers, including Casino Data Systems, hoping to knock off IGT with innovative new products. The company's earnings dropped more than 30% in 1995, and its stock price, which had peaked at 41 in 1993, has been in the low teens lately. When the six executives abruptly announced their departure to Casino Data Systems last December, many observers said IGT's management depth was disappearing with them.  The executives -- four IGT vice presidents and two division heads -- will return to work at IGT after asking for release from their contracts at Casino Data Systems. Because the men had one-year noncompete clauses at IGT, none had started work at Casino Data Systems or been paid by the company. Their contracts stipulated that they begin work at Casino Data Systems in December.
