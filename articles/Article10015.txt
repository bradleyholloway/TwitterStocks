 Ethanol Boom Fuels Brisk Sales of Midwest Farmland; Double-Digit Price Rises Are Common as Growers Add Acreage for Corn   By Ilan Brat and Thaddeus Herrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2007  Just last week, Larry King, a 65-year-old farmer who owns and rents 2,400 corn and soybean acres in northwest Iowa, with his 28-year-old son, Steve, snapped up 64.7 corn and soybean acres for $5,250 an acre at a public auction. Mr. King's bid prevailed 16 minutes after the auction started at $3,300 an acre. The same land would've sold for about $3,800 an acre a year ago, says John Hjelm, founder of the Acre Co., which ran the auction. Mr. King got the land after another farmer outbid him at a November auction for 160 acres of corn and soybean land. Back then, he says, he'd decided not to top a bid of $5,130 for an acre of farmland.  Kip Tom, president and chief executive of Tom Farms LLC in Leesburg, Ind., owns, rents and operates 12,000 acres of corn, soybean and tomato acres in northern Indiana and 4,000 acres in northern Argentina. He wants to expand his Indiana farmland, but has had trouble because little land is available nearby. He got lucky in January when one of his neighbors called to say he was retiring and wanted to sell the 85 acres Mr. Tom had been renting from him. Mr. Tom paid $4,100 an acre, about $750 more than he would've paid for the same land a year ago, he estimates.  The spike in land costs could pose problems for farmers renting their land, especially if they have a poor crop. But farmer Chris Gould, 38, who rents 750 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat while managing his father's hog-breeding operation in Maple Park, Ill., thinks higher crop prices will offset rent increases. In January, he went to most of his landlords and offered to raise his own rents 5% to 10%, pegged to the productivity of the land. With crop prices soaring, he says he's afraid neighbors may try to grab his land by offering higher rent payments.
