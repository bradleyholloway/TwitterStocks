MIAMI, Feb. 16â€” Several prominent stock-car drivers are the subjects of a major Federal inquiry into the smuggling of marijuana between the Bahamas and the southern United States, Government sources confirmed today. A Federal official said that more than 60 drivers, mechanics and others in the industry were being investigated.  The investigation was first reported by The Miami Herald, which said today that Billie Harvey, who finished 39th in Sunday's Daytona 500, was among the subjects. Five years ago, Harvey was arrested in Fort Lauderdale in the seizure of a 28-foot speedboat carrying eight tons of marijuana. He was found guilty of trafficking in marijuana, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.  Herbert Tillman, 52 years old, a top driver at Hialeah Speedway, was convicted last year of bribery. He is appealing his conviction, which stemmed from his effort to buy information about the smuggling investigation from a clerk in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
