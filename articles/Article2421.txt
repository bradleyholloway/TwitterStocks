 St. Louis Fed Names Prominent Monetarist As Its New President   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 13, 1998  William Poole, a prominent member of the monetarist school of economics, was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, effective March 23.  For more than 30 years, the St. Louis Fed has been a bastion of monetarism, which emphasizes the importance of the money supply in determining the pace of inflation and economic growth. Although the money supply's key role is acknowledged by most mainstream economists, it isn't a major factor in Fed decision-making at the moment, primarily because of the difficulty in linking any measure of it to the economy's recent ups and downs.
