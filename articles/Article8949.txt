 Akzo Nobel Seeks to Buy Courtaulds In a Consolidating Chemicals Industry   By By Matthew Rose and Martin du Bois, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1998  Dutch chemicals giant Akzo Nobel NV said it is in exploratory talks to acquire United Kingdom chemicals company Courtaulds PLC for about 1.8 billion ($2.98 billion).  The announcement of the possible deal, which values Courtaulds around 450 pence ($7.46) a share, comes just days after Courtaulds said it had been approached by a possible buyer. It marks further consolidation in the competitive chemicals industry and would make Akzo an industrial chemicals powerhouse with around 8.5 billion in annual sales and the world's leading maker of paints and coatings.  Although the London market was rife with speculation that other chemicals companies might join the bidding, one official close to the talks said, "As far as we know, there's no one else" talking to Courtaulds. Courtaulds declined to comment.
