 A Day of Terror: Thousands Stranded As the FAA Grounds Flights --- Airlines Are Diverted To Canada; Travelers Look for Rental Cars   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  About 35,000 flights a day take off and land at U.S. airports, a number that includes domestic flights to and from foreign countries and private planes. It doesn't include the many general aviation flights that operate by visual flight rules. As a result of what the FAA calls the "ground stop," an estimated 8,300 U.S. jets and commuter planes are now parked at airports large and small in the U.S. and abroad.  After the attacks, more than 120 flights within U.S. air space were diverted to airports in Canada. Reports from Halifax said that hotels and motels in and around that city quickly filled to capacity, and many stranded passengers were shuttled to gymnasiums and sports complexes in the area for the night. Many other people rented vehicles and headed out of Halifax in search of accommodations.  A Thai Airways International flight bound for Los Angeles but rerouted to San Francisco was escorted by U.S. military fighter jets. In the hour before that, 15 other flights from Asia, bound for Houston, Chicago and West Coast airports, were diverted to Honolulu. "We don't want aircraft flying over the U.S.," said Tryg McCoy, San Francisco airport duty manager.
