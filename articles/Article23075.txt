 Media & Marketing -- The Advertising Report: Boutique Shop Is Out to Prove That It's 'The Real Thing' Too   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2003  Mr. [Andy Berlin]: The "Real" campaign has preformed better than any ad that Coke has done in the last 15 years. Every consumer trend has a basis, but it's not that hard to change it if you are consistent and persistent. It wasn't that long ago that Coke was drunk as a sports drink on the sideline of professional and college games because it gave you a boost. This is before the electrolyte drinks. Coke has been refreshing people for a long time. It's only recently that we have had a marketplace dynamic of enormous choice and that makes it harder.  Mr. Berlin: We have heard that question from prospective clients and I tell them we haven't lost any accounts this year. Coke has made it possible for us to substantially upgrade the talent at our shop. It's a better place and all our clients get their share of that. Our senior people divide their time evenly from our Tasty Baking account to Coca- Cola. Having said that, someone has to run the Coke business. Ewen Cameron, our chief executive, took that leadership post. I act as a backup to Mr. Cameron on Coke.  Mr. Berlin: During the recession clients were afraid to make changes. Making a change when everything is going to hell in a large corporate structure is like raising your hand and saying: 'I have done something wrong.' Clients only started to make changes when things got better -- and when the greed for market share started to come back. There was a period of deadness that lasted until early 2003. Now clients are moving their accounts with a vengeance. That is creating the appearance that people are unhappy with their agencies. I don't think there is systemic dislike of large agencies but this a time for the herd to be restless.
