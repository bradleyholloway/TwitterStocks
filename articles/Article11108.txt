 Asset Managers Spur Moderate Gains, But Traders Say No Pattern Emerged   By By Priscilla Ann Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1988  Asset managers resumed light buying of over-the-counter stocks yesterday, but traders said the purchases didn't appear to have any pattern or direction as prices rose moderately.  Institutions, including a number of cash-rich pension funds, bought heavily in the OTC market early last month, but withdrew toward the end of the month in favor of exchange-listed stocks. Traders said some of the big buyers reappeared yesterday, but their purchases didn't reveal any recognizable strategy.  Most OTC prices didn't move very much. Shoney's, the big fast food chain, closed off 1/8 at 24 1/2 on volume of 2.6 million shares, making it the day's most active issue. MCI Communications rose 1/8 to 11 1/4 on 1.1 million shares.
