WASHINGTON, May 5â€” A private legal group today accused the Mobil Oil Corporation of violating United States law and United Nations sanctions by shipping oil to Rhodesia, which in now Zimbabwe, from 1967 to 1979.  The Washington-based International Human Rights Law Group said it had obtained customs documents from Mozambique showing that Mobil shipped oil to Mozambique that had the indicated destination of Rhodesia.  Mobil denied the charges. Previous Treasury Department and Congressional investigations had dismissed the allegations, but the Law Group said the documents had not been available until now.  The United Nations imposed trade sanctions against Rhodesdia between 1967 and 1979 because of its white minority government. The sanctions were lifted in 1979 after Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and blacks were allowed to vote.  The Law Group said Mobil officials would be asked about the charges at the company's annual stockholders meeting in New York on Thursday.
