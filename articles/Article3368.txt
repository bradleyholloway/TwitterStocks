 Art Journal: Is Surfing for Art a Wipeout? --- Sites Struggle as Buyers Just Windows-Shop; Don't Write an Obit Yet   By By Alexandra Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  First, some history: Not that long ago, buying and selling fine art online seemed to make sense. For millions of people, point-and-click art offered options beyond the local poster store, the museum gift shop or the lone gallery downtown with those "sunset over the beach" paintings. It promised an end to the geographical advantages that have kept the best material in big cities. And it offered Art Without Attitude: a chance to buy the hottest artist's hottest print without walking into a gallery and suffering the cold shoulder of a snooty Gen-Xer wearing sunglasses indoors. So, by the spring of 2000, at least four dozen sites had sprung up, auctioning or selling art and antiques online.  Questions about authenticity still dog the business. There was eBay, of course, which first offered, then had to cancel, the sale of a $135,805 painting because of misleading information from the seller. Spurious Salvador Dali works, Rolex watches and autographed sports memorabilia have also popped up online. Even when a piece is authentic and the price is good, the sites have an annoying habit of omitting crucial information -- listing photographs, for example, without saying who developed the negative (if it wasn't the photographer, it's usually worth less). Or they list art without disclosing the seller, raising issues of authenticity and title.  While Amazon and Sotheby's are shutting down their joint-venture site, Amazon will now link customers to Sothebys.com, a higher-end site that offers more baubles than Barbies. Traffic on the site was once almost embarrassingly low, but now the site is generating more than $1 million in sales a month. Sure, that's a slow minute in Sotheby's Impressionist paintings department, but it bodes well for eventual acceptance of online buying.
