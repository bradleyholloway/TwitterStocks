 A Day of Terror: U.S. Newspapers Resort to Special Editions As Traffic Overwhelms Nation's Web Sites   By By Jonathan Eig, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  Both the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Jose Mercury News planned to put out extra afternoon editions covering the attacks.

The San Jose Mercury News sold its eight-page special edition in downtown San Jose and San Francisco. The last time the Chronicle published an extra afternoon edition was after the 1989 earthquake.
