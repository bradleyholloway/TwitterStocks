 Treasury Chief Hones Effort on China Ties; Quick Action Is Sought Over Foreign Investment, Environment, Patents   By Phillips, Michael M, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2007  "We're going to start making progress" by May, when the next round of talks takes place in Washington, Mr. [Henry Paulson] said yesterday. His comments came as he named a former drug-industry lobbyist and former deputy U.S. trade representative, Alan Holmer, to coordinate the strategic dialogue. The secretary picked Mr. Holmer, the ex-president of Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America, in large part because of his negotiating experience, a Treasury spokeswoman said.  Nicholas Lardy, an Asia expert at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, called it a "good move" to appoint a single individual whose sole task will be to deal with China. "My only question is, 'Why did they wait so long?'"  Meantime, House lawmakers said they plan to introduce legislation today that would make it easier for the U.S. to retaliate against China for its currency practices. U.S. manufacturers argue that Beijing keeps the yuan artificially weak against the dollar, making its exports cheaper and giving China an unfair advantage over American goods. The Chinese authorities "increased the rate of appreciation, but it's still not fast enough," Mr. Paulson said.
