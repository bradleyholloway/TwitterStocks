 FDA Removes Panel Member From Drug Review   By Anna Wilde Mathews and Scott Hensley, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2004  "They'd said because I had taken a public position, I was disinvited," Dr. [Curt D. Furberg] said. He added that he felt he wasn't biased, and he was "trying to be evidence-based" in making findings about Bextra from an analysis of data. "I collected the information to get evidence to contribute to the debate, I drew a conclusion, and I'm off," he said. Dr. Furberg said he still is on the FDA's drug safety and risk management advisory committee, but won't be part of the February Cox-2 meeting.  Pfizer called the findings "unsubstantiated." A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company had nothing to do with Dr. Furberg's departure from the panel. "Pfizer would never intervene in any way with the FDA's regulatory process," she said.
