 Bookshelf: The Grisly History of an Abomination   By By William H. Riker, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1985  Since Mr. Peters wishes to study only torture itself and not other kinds of cruelty, he defines it precisely as a legal concept, namely, the imposition of physical suffering, or the threat of it, to obtain evidence. He rejects metaphorical extensions (such as "poverty is torture") that include all sadism and misery. Then he clearly describes torture in classical, medieval and modern times. I believe, though, that he does not quite understand the nature of the politics behind contemporary torture. So his book ends in baffled, uncertain hope that good will may triumph.  In Greece and Rome, initially only slaves were tortured because they were seen as incapable of citizens' dishonor from perjury. Eventually, the distinction between slaves and freedmen blurred, so torture of lower-class citizens was condoned. In the Dark Ages, Germanic law, based on ordeal and combat, needed no torture. But the medieval-renaissance revival of Roman law renewed its practice. Public criminal law required proofs, and the best proof in continental and canon law (but not English law) was confession, even confession obtained by torture. So it became acceptable, even legally enjoined, from the 12th to 18th centuries.
