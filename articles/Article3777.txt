 Hypertension? No Sweat   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2004  "The remainder of the day, your blood pressure will be lower, for up to 22 hours, merely as the result of engaging in one walking session," says Linda Pescatello, lead author of the position statement and director of the University of Connecticut School of Allied Health's Center for Health Promotion in Storrs.  In a new twist, that half-hour of exercise can be sprinkled throughout the day. The exercise intensity, recommended in the range of 40% to less than 60% of aerobic capacity, is "equivalent to a walk where you are clearly comfortable talking, up to a brisk walk where you still could carry on a conversation although you sweat some and feel your breath increasing," Dr. Pescatello says.  "I think the average American has the idea that being physically active means packing a gym bag, driving to the gym, working out, and driving home," says Barry Franklin, a co-author of the position statement and director of cardiac rehabilitation at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. "But for most people, most lifestyle activities -- like gardening, walking, playing golf, hiking -- are considered moderately active. I tell our patients, 'You don't have to put the dollar bill in the piggy bank all at once. You can do it one quarter at a time.'"
