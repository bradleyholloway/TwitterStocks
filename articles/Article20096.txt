 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  A: Just fill in the amount on your regular income-tax return. For example, if you file Form 1040, put it on line 71. If you file Form 1040A, it's line 42. If it's Form 1040EZ, it's line nine. If it's Form 1040NR, it's line 69. For those who file Form 1040NR-EZ, it's line 21.  The IRS says an analysis of federal income-tax returns filed so far this year shows about three in 10 returns didn't request it. While some early birds may not have been eligible, millions of others probably were and just didn't realize it. For details on eligibility, see the IRS Web site (irs.gov) and click on "Telephone Excise Tax Refund."
