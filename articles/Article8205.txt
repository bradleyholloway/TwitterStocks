 Big Al Unearthed   By Rudner, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1992  The discovery in Greybull WY of the complete remnants of an Allosaurus fragilis dinosaur in 1991 pointed out the fact that the US has no laws protecting paleontological finds from export. The dinosaur was found by a Swiss commercial enterprise, but luckily, it was determined to be on federal land.
