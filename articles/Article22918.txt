 H-P Loses Share But Still Leads PC-Server Market   By By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2002  The two research companies' figures differ slightly because of differences in methodology. "The big loser is the new H-P," said Jeffrey Hewitt, principal analyst at Gartner.  Mr. [Mark Melenovsky] predicts H-P would benefit from a return of big corporate buyers to the PC server market. "I'd think over the next couple of quarters, it would be a much more competitive environment," he said.  The market for PC servers with two or fewer processors account for as much as 80% of total sales. In contrast, the most costly servers with richer eight-processor configurations accounted for 6,000 of the estimated 900,000 machines shipped world-wide last quarter, IDC said.
