An article on July 27 about Abbotsford, the house of Sir Walter Scott in Scotland, misspelled a word in a Scott poem and the name of a castle. The line of poetry should have read ''November's leaf is red and sere,'' not ''sear.'' The castle near Edinburgh is Stirling, not Sterling.  The article also referred incorrectly to two plants. Heather does not bloom in early spring, and goldenrod does not grow wild near Edinburgh.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
