 New Computer Gives Doctors Second Chance To Spot Breast Cancer   By By Tara Parker-Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 2001  About 200 radiology practices in the U.S. use computer-aided detection, or CAD, technology to help doctors spot hard-to-find cancers on mammograms. An independent study of 12,860 women undergoing screening mammograms in Plano, Texas, found an increase of nearly 20% in cancer-detection rates when the computer was used, according to an article in the September issue of Radiology. Research to be presented this fall to the Radiological Society of North America found a 37% increase in detection rates for the earliest, most curable forms of cancer.  So far only one firm, closely held R2 Technology of Los Altos, Calif., has won FDA approval for such a device to help read mammograms. The FDA says that for every 100,000 breast cancers detected by screening mammography, the use of R2's ImageChecker could result in early detection of 20,500 more cases. In the real world, that translates to an estimated 28,000 women a year whose cancer is missed by the human eye but could be detected by computer.  PLANO RESIDENT Elizabeth Senderling, 58 years old, knows first hand the difference ImageChecker can make. When she arrived for her annual mammogram earlier this year, she paid an extra $15 to have the test double-checked by ImageChecker. The computer flagged a precancerous cluster that the radiologist hadn't noticed. After a lumpectomy and radiation treatment, Mrs. Senderling has been given a clean bill of health. "I couldn't see it with my eye," she says. "It was like looking at the universe but trying to pick out a nebula or something."
