 AIG's CEO Questions Terror-Insurance Costs   By By Christopher Oster and Dean Starkman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2003  For more mundane properties, buyers can expect to pay an additional 10% to 20% on top of their stand-alone property insurance, Mr. [James Costner] said. The buyers who are accepting the coverage are doing so in many cases only because it is required by lenders. One problem with the act, he said, is that it covers only certified acts of terrorism, which doesn't include domestic terrorism. But some property owners are experiencing higher prices. Prentiss Properties Trust, a Dallas real-estate investment trust that owns about $2.5 billion of mostly suburban buildings around Dallas, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay area and elsewhere, negotiated with a group of 11 insurers for the sort of all-risk policy of which the federal law was designed to encourage more. The terrorism portion worked out to about seven cents a square foot, while the business's total other insurance costs were running about 18 cents a square foot. The company said it found it more economical to buy a separate $100 million terrorism policy, for about 2.5 cents a square foot, from AIG. The seven-cents-a-foot price quoted by the group suggests to Tom August, Prentiss's chief executive, "Most of them didn't want to do it."
