 Letters to the Editor: Scouts Battle Isn't Gay `Agenda'   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  Gay men involved in Scouting were not trying to make a point or be gay role models. They wanted to be Scout leaders and adult male role models, just like heterosexual Scout leaders. It was BSA leadership that created this fight in the first place, not gay Scouts or Scout leaders. One of the key lessons I learned as a Scout was that I was responsible for the consequences of my own actions. BSA, Inc. decided to deny gays the right to participate in Scouting, the Supreme Court said they had the right to do this if they wanted to, so now they have to live with the consequences. It is they, not gay activists, who are responsible for any lost opportunities for poor and minority boys to benefit from what Scouting has to offer.  With this letter, I renounce the rank of Eagle Scout. I cannot support the continued position of the Boy Scouts of America to promote homophobia among the young men and women who look to its leaders for guidance. I am not taking this action to harm Scouting or the many good men and women who serve America's youth through Scouting. I am not taking this action to create animosity toward those who will continue involvement in Scouting. I am taking this action because the Boy Scouts of America, through an open policy of bias, has proven itself to be an organization from which I must disassociate.
