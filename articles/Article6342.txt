 New AIDS Drug Reduces Virus In Monkeys   By Efrati, Amir, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 2004  Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, says the monkey study "isn't reason for massive celebration," but "we're on the road to getting an integrase inhibitor." Any drug that might be developed from this approach -- and risks remain that it could fail -- probably wouldn't be approved for use until the end of the decade.  The integrase enzyme's function is to carry and paste a section of the viral DNA into a human white cell's long DNA strand, which is analogous to adding letters into the middle of a long word when using a word processor. The human cell then copies the viral DNA. The inhibitor sticks to the integrase, preventing the virus from embedding itself in human DNA. This causes the enzyme to bend the viral DNA into a circle, which is then "chewed up" by the human cell, Merck's Dr. Young says.  HIV Therapy  Three classes of oral drugs are currently combined to control HIV. Integrase inhibitors may one day be part of the cocktail, too:  -- Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors and Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors block an enzyme that HIV uses during early stages of copying itself.  -- Protease inhibitors keep protease enzymes from breaking single long strands of viral proteins into many smaller ones.
