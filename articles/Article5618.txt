 The Americas: Larry Summers Swats Home Buyers With a 2x4   By By Greg Rushford, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  It didn't look like a sophisticated economic policy matter in February 1997, when Customs officials in the Port of New York classified wooden 2x4s from Canada with two holes drilled in them under heading number 4418 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules. But that routine decision quickly became controversial in Washington. The bureaucrats in New York had unwittingly stepped directly into politics -- sparking a new political brushfire in one of the oldest, bitterest trade spats between the U.S. and its biggest trading partner.  While most people wouldn't think the top international economic-policy official in Washington would take much notice of the HTS classification of Canadian wood, it turns out that Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers cares very much. Mr. Summers, who is otherwise occupied with weighty macroeconomic issues such as plunging Asian currencies, cares because he has heard from a dozen-plus lawmakers from timber producing states, including Sens. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) and Richard Shelby (R., Ala.). Now, pressed by Mr. Summers, Customs says the imported 2x4s properly belong in HTS number 4407.  What's the big fight over the HTS numbers about? As HTS 4418, the Canadian lumber -- termed "drilled studs" in lumber yards -- can be sold freely across the border at market prices. (The holes in the drilled studs are for the convenience of carpenters to run wiring through.) But as HTS 4407, drilled studs would fall under quotas associated with the 1996 U.S.-Canadian Softwood Lumber Agreement.
