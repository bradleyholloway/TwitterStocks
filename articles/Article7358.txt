 Two Ex-Workers Of Mocatta Plead Guilty in Fraud Case   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1985  Ronald J. Andersen, former vice president, administrative operations, and Eugene A. Sandler, a former Mocatta coin trader, waived indictment and admitted in federal court that they received cash bribes from a Mocatta customer. Each man faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $2,000 fine.  Frank Maas, assistant U.S. attorney in the case, said that Mr. Andersen, 42 years old, improperly authorized a $25 million trading limit and a $1 million unsecured credit limit for Mr. Sohnen's accounts, without charging interest on trades executed for those accounts. Mr. Andersen, of Centereach, N.Y., also knowingly accepted counterfeit coins from Mr. Sohnen, the U.S. attorney's office said. In return, he received more than $20,000 from Mr. Sohnen, prosecutors said.
