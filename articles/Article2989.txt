 Depreciated: Did You Hear the One About the Accountant? It's Not Very Funny --- How Decade of Greed Undid The Proud Respectability Of a Very Old Profession --- Prospects for Andersen Dim   By By Ianthe Jeanne Dugan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2002  It did, and it didn't. The Big Five accounting firms -- PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, Arthur Andersen and KPMG -- collectively doubled their revenue in less than a decade, to $26.1 billion last year, according to Public Accounting Report newsletter. But most of that increase derived from the consulting services and went to consultants and hard-sell accountants, not to the likes of Mr. [C. Anthony Rider].  "What would Luca Pacioli think?" asks Larry Crumbley, an accounting professor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Mr. Crumbley is referring to a Franciscan friar considered the father of accounting for his 1494 "Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" ("Everything About Arithmetic, Geometry and Proportion"). The treatise described double-entry bookkeeping -- that for every credit entered into a ledger there must be a debit, a concept created by Florentine merchants and hailed by Goethe as "one of the most beautiful discoveries of the human spirit."  In the 1970s, the federal government, amid questions about some companies' accounting procedures, set up the Financial Accounting Standards Board to oversee accountants. But it soon also removed a lot of the restrictions that had prevented big firms from competing with each other. In the late 1970s, the Federal Trade Commission, concerned about anticompetitive practices, began pushing AICPA to allow accountants to advertise. By 1990, the group had lifted most restrictions on ads.
