 Barron's Insight: Duke Energy's Spinoff Could Unleash Efficiency   By Willoughby, Jack, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2006  Nathan Judge, an Atlantic Research analyst based in London, has a "buy" on Duke stock. He argues that the deal will produce value well above Duke's recent share price of $32.  "There are catalysts to release this value," says Mr. Judge. "Gas and [pipeline] assets will be revalued upward as they deliver accelerated growth."  John Bartlett, a utilities analyst with W.H. Reaves in Jersey City, N.J., calls an investment in the shares of Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke "an excellent way to capitalize on both the need for new energy infrastructure and the potential for higher valuations as the market recognizes the strength of the underlying utilities business."
