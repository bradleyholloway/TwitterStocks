 Soviet Appetite Gives Grain Prices a Boost   By By Sue Shellenbarger and Carlee R. Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1989  Wheat, corn and soybean futures rose amid talk of the Soviet Union's increasing interest in U.S. farm commodities. With Moscow's purchases of U.S. grain expected to hit a record for the year ending Sept. 30, many traders see the Soviets as a big market factor in the coming months.  Speeding the trend was a long-awaited announcement late Tuesday that the U.S. would offer an additional 1.5 million metric tons of subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union. Analysts also noted rumors that China may want to take steps to buy 900,000 metric tons of wheat that the U.S. has already offered to subsidize.  Worries about the weather fueled the rally, which sent wheat futures for May delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade 11 cents a bushel higher to $4.375. The National Weather Service's forecast yesterday for the next six to 10 days signaled below-normal rainfall on much of the Great Plains, where the big winter-wheat crop is already in trouble.
