 'Corporate Democracy' Ultimately Means Improved Shareholder Value   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  Henry Manne defines "corporate democracy" in a way that is unrecognizable to those advocates for greater shareholder rights who use that expression as shorthand for trying to improve the corporate governance system to increase and, in some cases, begin to establish accountability of directors and management to shareholders ("The 'Corporate Democracy' Oxymoron," editorial page, Jan. 2).  Prof. Manne was correct when he stated, "We need corporate activists today more than ever, but we need them to lobby and argue for repeal of our many costly and ill-serving bits of corporate regulation." One of the most "costly and ill serving bits of corporate regulation" is SEC Rule 14a-8, which hinders shareholders from nominating director candidates and causing their names to appear on the corporate ballot.
