 Rating Providers Remain Cautious On GMAC Bonds; Financing Arm's Links to GM Could Maintain Drag on Credit, Keeping It Below Investment Grade   By Serena Ng, Simona Covel and Aparajita Saha-Bubna, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2006  GMAC bondholders showed cautious optimism at the fact that the lender's fortunes won't be as closely tied to GM's. The price of GMAC's 8% bonds due in 2031 rose 1.5 cents, to trade at 96.5 cents on the dollar, in late trading yesterday, according to data from MarketAxess, an electronic-trading platform. Parent-company GM's 8.375% bonds due in 2033 slipped 1.9 cents to 73.5 cents on the dollar after a report that GM's auto sales fell 14% in March from a year earlier.  Ratings companies said they aren't sure what the change of control means for GMAC in the longer term. Moody's Investors Service said its rating on GMAC is likely to remain at Ba1, its highest junk rating, even after the deal closes. Noting that GMAC and GM's businesses will continue to be intertwined in many ways, about 40% of GMAC's operations are tied to GM's auto business, Moody's analyst Mark Wasden said an improvement in GMAC's rating to investment grade would be unlikely unless GM's own credit rating improves.  Bond investors and analysts were also somewhat wary because the deal includes various breakup terms that will allow Cerberus to walk away if, for example, GM's credit ratings deteriorate significantly. "In other words, if Delphi melts down, it seems the deal could die before closing," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at bond-research firm CreditSights, in a report. GM's biggest parts supplier, Delphi Corp., is operating under bankruptcy protection and is facing a possible labor strike by its unionized work force, which could cripple GM's production. But if the GMAC deal goes through, the sale will reduce the likelihood of GMAC defaulting on its debt, he said.
