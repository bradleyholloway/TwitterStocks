 Small stock focus: Would tax cut ignite a fire? Don't be sure   By Lohse, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1997  Capital-gains tax cuts have historically been good for small-cap stocks. But don't expect any capital-gains tax cut Congress may pass in 1997 to jump-start the sagging small-cap investor. In Feb 28, 1997 trading, the Russell 20000 small-stock index fell 1.10 to 360.05 and the Nasdaq Composite INdex slipped 3.66 to 1309. For the week, the Russell 2000 index fell 6.32, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 25.32, or 1.9%.
