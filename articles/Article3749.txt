 Barron's Insight: Everything That's Old Is New Again -- Steel and Cold   By Ward, Sandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2003  It's worth heeding these two: Jeff Gendell, principal of Tontine Associates, Greenwich, Conn., with $1billion under management, and Arnie Schneider, chief investment officer of Schneider Capital Management, Wayne, Pa., which manages about $2 billion. Both have a history of making prescient calls and delivering outsized returns to clients. This year, Tontine Financial Partners, one of the two funds managed by Tontine Associates, was up 75.3% through November and his more broadly invested Tontine Partners was up 138%, after fees. Since its start in the spring of 1997, Tontine Partners has returned 24% a year, on average.
