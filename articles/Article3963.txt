 The Driver's Seat: Small-Car Tweaks Pay Off --- New Chevy Cobalt gets great mileage; Nissan Versa 1.6 is easy on the wallet   By Sabatini, Jeff, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2009  (GM first applied the XFE tag to some 2008 Cobalts built during the end of the model year's production run, but those cars didn't have all the improvements of the '09 models.) The Cobalt's sticker starts at $16,330, and while both coupes and sedans are available as XFE models, the name applies only to cars equipped with five-speed manual transmissions and 15-inch wheels and tires. [...] adding all three of its options -- air conditioning, an automatic transmission, and antilock brakes -- brings the Versa 1.6's price to $12,935, which is about where you have to start asking how much sense it makes to buy one of these rather than stepping up to the more feature-laden Versa S at $13,795.
