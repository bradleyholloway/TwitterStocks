 Tennessee Cattlemen Are Suin' Jack Daniel Instead of Sippin' It --- Farmers Are Battling Distiller Over Cutoff of the Supply Of 'Slop' for Cattle Feed   By By Timothy K. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1986  This is where the Jack Daniel Distillery makes its whiskey and where it makes the advertisements that made the whiskey famous. The ads, which have been running for 31 years, feature black-and-white photographs of ducks and oak barrels and leather-faced, middle-aged Tennesseans who aren't in any particular hurry. They draw some 300,000 tourists to Lynchburg every year. But even so, Billy Joe Blackburn doesn't like them.  Mr. Blackburn and at least 10 other local residents charge that Jack Daniel drove them out of the cattle business when it cut off their cheap supply of "thick slop," a distillation byproduct that makes good cattle feed. A county official confirms that 75% of the cattle-feeding operations in Moore County, of which Lynchburg is the seat, have been wiped out by Jack Daniel's action. Jack Daniel, a subsidiary of Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., replies that it never promised anybody an unlimited supply of slop and that it now saves money by disposing of the stuff differently.  In the quiet streets of Lynchburg there are few hints that anything is amiss. That may be because the Jack Daniel Distillery owns the hardware store, the soda shop, the handicrafts store and the White Rabbit restaurant. Jack Daniel doesn't own the telephone poles, though, and tacked to one is a sign of another problem -- a notice from District 35 of the United Steelworkers of America urging the distillery's employees to join the union.
