 Leading the News: UST Must Pay $1.05 Billion in Antitrust Case   By By Robert S. Greenberger and Gordon Fairclough, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2003  Conwood charged in a 1998 lawsuit that UST, among other things, violated antitrust law by manipulating retailers' product displays, including discarding Conwood racks.  Yesterday, an elated Thomas Pritzker, one of three cousins who run the family empire, said UST "went beyond the bounds of appropriate competition and this was the consequence." The windfall award comes at a delicate moment for the Pritzker family, which recently started a decadelong process to divvy up its $15 billion empire after feuding broke out between rival factions of cousins.  UST is facing a separate antitrust suit by another competitor in the smokeless-tobacco market, Swedish Match. The case is set for trial late next year.
