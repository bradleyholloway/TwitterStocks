 Companies Are Hedging Their Bets By Hiring Contingent Employees   By Nasaw, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2004  Yet contingent jobs make sense in some circumstances. Technology worker Matthew Jacobs, 26, took one this year with a New York technology company after a year of unemployment. "I was anxious to get back to work," he says. "Benefits are not critical." He can get health-insurance coverage through his new employer by contributing part of his pay.  Brad Karsh, president of JobBound, a Chicago employment-coaching service, recommends that individuals keep job hunting after they take a contingent position. "It's exactly like dating," he says. "You don't want to be loyal if they're not going to be loyal to you."  They aren't. Last month, Mr. Marlott's employer decided to reshuffle his department and eliminate his spot. "I'm just a cog in the system," he laments. "It hurts, because I liked my job."
