 The Gulf Oil Spill: Hardship Endures in Alaskan Zone Hit by Valdez Spill   By Carlton, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2010  To illustrate the point, Dave Janka, a charter boat captain from Cordova, flew in by float plane earlier this week to a rocky beach along Disk Island in Prince William Sound. Scientists are divided on whether the best way to clean up beaches is to excavate them or to leave the oil under the ground, said Scott Pegau, research program manager at the Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute, a think tank set up by Congress to try to improve technologies and research on oil spills in the region.\n
