 Bad News for Med School In Search of a Fiscal Cure   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1998  It has long been a truism in Austin that what Texas Tech University wants, Texas Tech gets.  According to Texas Tech officials, who have been shuttling between Lubbock and Austin to pitch their request for a sizable increase in state aid, their medical school lags the state's large health-sciences centers in state aid. The school ranks dead last in terms of the share of its budget that comes from state funds. Its per-student appropriation for teaching nurses and other health professionals is among the lowest in the state.  Texas Tech has long been thought of as benefiting from the kind of legislative largess that comes from having friends in high places. Indeed, the school counts among its graduates Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, House Speaker James E. "Pete" Laney and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Junell. Until two years ago, Lubbock was represented in the state Senate by John Montford, ex-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and now Texas Tech chancellor.
