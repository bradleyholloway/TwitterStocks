 Starr, Aide Win Appeals Court Victory On Illegally Leaking Grand-Jury Facts   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  The office of independent counsel Kenneth Starr and a former Starr aide are off the hook, at least for now, for allegedly leaking grand-jury material to the news media.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ended the contempt-of-court proceeding, reversing a lower-court finding that Mr. Starr's office appeared to have illegally disclosed the material. The case involves a 1998 report that Mr. Starr was weighing an indictment of President Clinton. Overruling the district court, a three-judge appeals court panel found that the information isn't protected by grand-jury secrecy rules.  The ruling showed the dire legal circumstances into which Mr. Starr's office had fallen earlier this year. Until yesterday, the case against Mr. Starr's office and his former spokesman, Charles Bakaly, had proceeded largely behind closed doors.
