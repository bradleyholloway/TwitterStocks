 Technology (A Special Report): Applications --- Automating Software   By By Stephen Kreider Yoder, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1986  Government planners have brought together 128 Japan-based computer and software makers in Tokyo, and have so far kicked in the current equivalent of about $31 million to have the companies create a more efficient way to make software.  The result is the Sigma project, a five-year, roughly $162 million push to increase software productivity by creating a national library of software "building blocks" that programmers can tap into no matter which make of computer they use. The Sigma project seeks to automate many aspects of program-writing for large computers, and, its proponents claim, will make programmers five to eight times more productive than they are today.  If Japan's projection of a software-writer shortage is correct, that could be Japan's only hope to feed a voracious appetite for software. But Sigma also could give Japan a competitive edge in software -- Japan's admitted weakness in computers. While Japanese-made computers rival American and European models in price and quality, Japan still depends heavily on software from the West.
