 Entrepreneur Is Ringmaster of U.S.-Soviet Promotions --- Steven Leber Is Among Troupe of Americans Cashing in on Perestroika   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1989  Pinned to the wall of a large reception room in the Soviet Embassy here, not far from a heroic portrait of the father of Soviet communism himself, hung a poster heralding the arrival in Washington of the Moscow Circus. At the bottom in bold print was a line smacking unequivocally of free enterprise: "Brought to you by Snuggle."  Vladimir Lenin, meet Steven Leber. Mr. Leber, a 47-year-old, Brooklyn-born, rock 'n' roll impresario, has launched a new career promoting the Soviet Union to the U.S. and the U.S. back to the U.S.S.R. Billboarding the name of a laundry product inside the Soviet Embassy is just one of the tricks he uses in trying to blend Soviet "perestroika" with American public-relations "chutzpah."  Two years ago, Mr. Leber snagged exclusive rights to promote the Moscow Circus in North America. Two other Leber efforts are in their infancy. One is a joint venture with a Soviet collective to manage the overseas affairs of Soviet professional athletes. The other is a proposed world tour of Kremlin museum treasures, including the crown jewels of the Russian czars. The jewel tour requires approval from the highest levels of Soviet bureaucracy.
