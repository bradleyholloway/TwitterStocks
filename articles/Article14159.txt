 Political Scientist's Open Letter on Leninist Interchange   By By Arnold Beichman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1985  Your records may show that I was once a member of IPSA. I dropped out when your organization held its 1979 triennial world congress in Moscow. I protested publicly at the ignominy of holding meetings of free scholars dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the capital of a country where the hosts are loyal servants of a totalitarian dictatorship, one which derides the very idea of objective truth.  How can you suggest that IPSA is an organization whose objectives are to promote the advancement of political science throughout the world when your members include the so-called political science associations of Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia? What can such communist associations advance except Marxist-Leninist laws of history or the legitimizing of communist repression of academic freedom? Can there be a genuine interchange of ideas among free scholars and those who very possibly are informants of the KGB?  I cannot understand how, in the age of Sakharov and Shcharansky, an American political scientist of the moral stature of Seymour Martin Lipset can sit on the same executive council with a Soviet policeman, whose government as a matter of policy and practice is anti-Semitic. What would Prof. Lipset say if the international confederation of free trade unions were to accept into membership the trade unions of the U.S.S.R., East Germany, Yugoslavia and China? Would not free trade unions be violating their code of ethics, their charter if they sat at the same table with communist labor leaders? Can there be free trade unions in a communist country? Can there be academic freedom in a communist dictatorship?
