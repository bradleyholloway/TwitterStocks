 GE Reshuffles Its Dot-Com Strategy to Focus on Internal `Digitizing'   By By Matt Murray and Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  GE also expects to eliminate 11,000 jobs this year out of its 340,000-strong work force, mostly in administrative and back-office positions. Analysts say that figure is likely to grow, especially if GE succeeds in its proposed $42 billion acquisition of Honeywell International Inc.  For instance, GE recently unveiled a Web-based system that organizes its business with suppliers. Like any large company, GE takes 60 days or more after delivery to pay its suppliers. In the interim, a supplier normally sells the IOU to a factoring company that collects the payment for a stiff fee to the supplier. The new system would cut the time lag to 15 days -- fast enough to eliminate the need for a factoring middleman. The savings on fees to suppliers would be split with GE, which says it can cut 12% out of its accounts payable each year.  Despite the criticism from some quarters, these changes are just the beginning, Mr. [Gary M. Reiner] says. As GE moves more business to the Web, he believes it will need fewer sales offices, less travel -- maybe even fewer headquarters buildings for its many operations. The biggest challenge for GE, he says, will be "knowing how far to go."
