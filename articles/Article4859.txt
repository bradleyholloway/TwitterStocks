 Khomeini Confronts Deep Disagreement As Iranian Revolution Enters 10th Year   By By Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1988  U.S. analysts say Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, at age 86, is struggling harder than ever to keep his nine-year-old revolution on track in the face of factional infighting at home and growing pressures from abroad.  "The revolution isn't in danger, but it is facing some of its most serious problems yet," says Shaul Bakhash, a history professor at George Mason University outside Washington and author of "Reign of the Ayatollahs." He adds: "There are deep disagreements about how to handle the economy, the war (with Iraq), and the post-Khomeini era. Iran's success or failure solving these problems is bound to influence attempts elsewhere in the Islamic world" to establish Moslem states on the Iranian model.  Yesterday's anniversary of the revolution ended 10 days of official celebration, but the revelry masked daunting problems. Iran's military has been unable to stage its usually big winter offensive against Iraq. The economy is failing. And Tehran's top leaders are preoccupied with April 8 parliamentary elections that will determine to a large extent what policies and which leaders will succeed the aging ruler.
