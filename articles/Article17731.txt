 Gangsters and Good Guys With Flesh Impact   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  If the movie retreads (or pays homage to) anything, it is to the great pictures of action film makers like John Ford. Pulitzer Prize winning playwright David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay, has set things up as a cowboy story played out in Prohibition-era Chicago. His Eliot Ness is a naive rookie who strides into town ready to take on the corrupt Machine and Al Capone. But he has no idea how to do it. Mr. Mamet's Scarface is a round-cheeked charmer who sweet talks reporters -- describing himself as "a businessman" -- then jovially orders his flunkies to kill someone.  Though his Ness starts out as a wholesome prig, he is also a bit of a publicity hound himself and maybe not all that different from his nemesis Capone. But when Ness discovers he has to bend the law to uphold it, he at least feels remorse. He's not exactly Dirty Harry: When he kills a man for the first time, he agonizes. Actor Kevin Costner, as Ness, makes this a genuinely touching moment -- and a rare one in the movies these days, a moment in which the act of killing, even a justified killing, causes someone to feel shame.  There is, of course, plenty of action here too. Director Brian De Palma, best known for his bloody, stylish, suspenseful pictures ("Carrie," "Dressed to Kill," the 1983 "Scarface"), has learned a lot in the 20 years he's been making pictures, and all of it's up there on the screen. The action sequences -- particularly a glorious shootout on horseback and a virtuoso Eisensteinian baby-carriage-falling-downstairs stunt -- are among Mr. De Palma's high-spirited tours de force of cinematic technique.
