 Judge Dismisses Suit by JetBlue Passengers   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2005  Acxiom and Torch are database-management companies and SRS is a Department of Defense contractor. JetBlue and Acxiom supplied passenger information to Torch, an SRS subcontractor that analyzed it in an effort to identify people who might be a risk to military installations.  "The only benefit JetBlue derived was 'the potential for increased safety on its flights and the potential to prevent the use of commercial airlines as weapons that target military bases,' " Judge [Carol Bagley Amon] wrote.
