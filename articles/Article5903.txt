 Cholesterol-Reducing Drugs Called Statins May Reduce Risk of Developing Dementia   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2000  Statins have transformed treatment of heart disease since the mid-1990s, when several large-scale trials showed they substantially reduced the risk of heart attacks and deaths among people considered at various degrees of risk of such events. They work primarily by lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol, the "bad" form of cholesterol that builds up in the walls of coronary arteries causing atherosclerosis.  Among these patients, those who were taking statins were as much as 70% less likely to have been diagnosed with dementia than those who had untreated high cholesterol, those whose high cholesterol was treated with other medicines and those who weren't diagnosed with high cholesterol.  Indeed, "it would be plausible if statins had an effect on dementia," Dr. [Jonathan Tobert] explained. Statins have proved to be effective in reducing strokes, which can be a cause of dementia. And other researchers have found that a certain genetic variation of a protein associated with atherosclerosis is also present in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
