 EPA Finds Benefits Of Stricter Limits On Lead Exceed Costs   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1986  The analysis is expected to generate pressure for the EPA to lower its maximum contaminant level for public drinking water systems. The agency has proposed setting a goal for lead of 20 parts per billion. Goals are hypothetical benchmarks, set at levels that would eliminate harmful health effects. Mandatory standards are usually set higher, to reflect what is feasible and cost-effective. The agency is expected to consider next whether to lower its mandatory standard.
