 Market's Ride: Subprime Fallout: CDO Managers Feel Heat of Subprime Slide; Losses of $50 Billion May Hit Companies; A Margin-Call Squeeze   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2007  Critics say these CDO managers should have known the risky nature of the debt backing the CDO pools. In many cases, CDO managers "weren't doing their job," says Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm in Chicago.  Almost $1 trillion of debt was in CDOs at the end of last year. New CDO issuance surged to more than $300 billion last year from less than $50 billion in 2002. While Bear Stearns Cos.' asset-management unit was the third-largest manager of CDOs that include subprime mortgages, no other Wall Street banks were in the ranking of top-20 managers as of Dec. 31, 2006, according to Standard & Poor's.  Mr. [Jeffrey Gundlach] says TCW avoided including riskier debt, such as second-lien mortgages, in its CDOs, but that others included that debt to make the interest rate on the CDO slices more attractive. Nonetheless, he says blaming CDO managers for the problems is like "an investor who bought the Nasdaq at 5000 back in 1999," blaming his broker when the high-technology bubble burst and stocks tumbled. "It's pretty silly."
