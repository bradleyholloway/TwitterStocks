 China Will Delay Tax-Rate Increase On Foreign Firms; Higher Bracket Ensnaring Domestic Companies Awaits Manufacturers From Abroad   By Areddy, James T, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2005  The plan, which would unify differing corporate income-tax rates for foreign and domestic companies, had been widely expected to be approved at the annual meeting of the national legislature currently under way, and implemented next year. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Xie Xuren, director of the State Administration of Taxation, said China still intends to merge the rates, a move required under China's World Trade Organization commitments. He said the government has studied the issue thoroughly, and "this year, we're going to make more efforts to deepen that study."  Foreign companies say they agree that a single tax rate is fair. Instead, their lobbying effort has focused on obtaining "grandfather clauses" to delay for five years or more the application of a unified rate for investors already in the country, say people familiar with the lobbying efforts. Taxes are an important part of any company's investment decision, and "if you change [the rate], it's going to throw a lot of their plans off," says a person familiar with the situation.
