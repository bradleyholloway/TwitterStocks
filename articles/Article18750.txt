 Orange County Suit Reinstated Against Merrill --- Grand Jury May Accuse Current, Ex-Officials Of Civil Misconduct   By Pasztor, Andy, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1995  Friday's ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John Ryan not only sets the stage for obtaining a ruling on the county's fundamental claims, but it's likely to prompt some 200 school districts, cities and other local agencies to sign a long-awaited comprehensive financial recovery plan. The county and the agencies lost a total of $1.7 billion after a highly leveraged, county-run investment pool collapsed last December. The county's ability to repay a big chunk of those losses depends on winning the litigation against Merrill.  Following a two-hour hearing that seemed to shift the momentum squarely back in the county's favor, Judge Ryan rejected all of Merrill's arguments to throw out the revised action on procedural grounds. Merrill's lead attorney said the brokerage firm was considering appealing what he called the "preliminary but very important decision."  The county's jubilant legal team said the ruling sets the stage for a trial, perhaps as early as mid-1996, on the underlying constitutional and so-called ultra vires claims, which allege that transactions between Merrill and former county treasurer Robert Citron exceeded the county's legal powers. Merrill consistently has denied any wrongdoing and asserted that Mr. Citron, who has pleaded guilty to fraud charges in state court, and other county officials were responsible for the ill-fated investment decisions. As part of its strategy, Merrill has asserted that it could take years to complete the discovery process for a trial on the merits of the county's allegations.
