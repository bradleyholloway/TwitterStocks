 Got $100,000 to Invest? Pros Tell How   By Gottschalk, Earl C, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1990  As might be expected, many of the pros suggest that investors go lighter than usual on stocks. But none would avoid the stock market, which is down 13% from mid-July. Even the most bearish of the bunch would put $25,000 into stocks.  NED DAVIS would put half the money, or $50,000, into stocks. A Nakomis, Fla., investment adviser who is widely followed by other pros, Mr. Davis would funnel $30,000 of the rest into 10-year Treasury notes and $20,000 into Treasury bills.  Mr. Davis is a "market timer," using hundreds of economic and technical market indicators to discern when to jump in or out of the stock market. Although stocks hit a bottom Aug. 23, he isn't convinced that a strong upturn is under way. "Major bull markets need a sold-out condition, deep pessimism and an accommodative Federal Reserve before they begin," he says. And stocks now are "reasonably priced."
