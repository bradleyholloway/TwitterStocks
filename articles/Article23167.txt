 Tip of the Week: Notify Bank Before a Trip   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2004  If this is something completely out of your normal pattern, it will probably raise red flags," says Jim Donahue, spokesman for big credit- card issuer MBNA Corp. "If it appears that a customer is being victimized, then we'll step in and prevent that from happening." He suggests calling the bank to request a travel note on your account before you leave. He warns that this still doesn't guarantee the bank won't suspend the account if suspicious charges arise. It makes it much less likely, however.
