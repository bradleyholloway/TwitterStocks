 Price-Coopers Merger Clearing Hurdles With Regulators but Not All Partners   By By Elizabeth MacDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 13, 1998  The proposed merger between Big Six accounting firms Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand appears to have overcome regulatory hurdles in the U.S. and Europe, but the combination still faces opposition from a number of reluctant partners in several countries.  Yet the proposed merger faces internal opposition from some partners, including those in the consulting units of both firms. Some Price and Coopers consulting partners say they are angered that Messrs. Schiro and Moore have chosen more accountants than consultants to run the merged firms' global operations. Consultants at the two firms recently met in Princeton, N.J., and "we decided that if things don't go our way, we're going to unite and bolt," said a Coopers consulting partner. A Price consulting partner said there's "disenchantment" in the consulting ranks. Peter Horowitz, a Price spokesman, said, "That's nonsense."
