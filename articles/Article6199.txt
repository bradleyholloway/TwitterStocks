 Fertilizer Firms Are Seen Posting Lower Earnings --- Nitrogen Chain's Weakness And Foreign Production Have Affected Results   By By Gaston F. Ceron, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1999  Hurt by the continually low prices for nitrogen-based fertilizers, most major North American fertilizer makers are expected to post lower first-quarter earnings, compared with the year-earlier period.  The nitrogen chain has been weakening since 1997, when China stopped purchasing urea, a nitrogen-based fertilizer, which sent prices lower and put the squeeze on earnings. And high production from abroad hasn't helped matters either, said David Silver, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.  In a sign of the times, Mississippi Chemical Corp. recently said it would post a loss of between 18 cents and 26 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, ended March 31. In the year-earlier quarter, the Yazoo City, Miss., company earned two cents a share. Not surprisingly, Mississippi Chemical blamed the nitrogen markets for its weak performance, noting that average prices fell as much as 10% from the quarter ended Dec. 31.
