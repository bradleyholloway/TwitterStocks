 Law Firm Charged With Felonies Over Advice on Hazardous Waste   By By Amy Stevens and Milo Geyelin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1991  The case arose when William Scherer, a lawyer at the firm of Sullivan, Roche & Johnson, informed a client's landlord that the client, a biotechnology company, didn't intend to clean up toxic waste at a laboratory it had operated. The company, InFerGene Inc. of Benicia, Calif., had filed for bankruptcy-court protection.  Under California law, felony charges can be brought against anyone who causes the disposal of hazardous waste without a license. According to Solano County deputy district attorney Mark Pollock, the lawyer's act of writing the letter effectively abandoned the waste at an unlicensed site, thus "causing" an illegal disposal.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bruce Fox ruled that MNC Commercial Corp., of Baltimore had used "surreptitious and misleading methods" to select the most opportune time to cease making loans to the debtor, M. Paolella & Sons, and foreclose on its collateral. The Philadelphia judge decided that three tobacco companies should be allowed to jump ahead of MNC to reclaim a total of $1.9 million in unsecured credit they issued to Paolella in December 1985, a month before MNC forced Paolella into involuntary bankruptcy by canceling its loan agreement.
