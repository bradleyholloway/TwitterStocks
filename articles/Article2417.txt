 Unexpected Turn: The Issue of `Spinning' Ended Merrill's Interest In Hambrecht & Quist --- Controversial IPO Allocation Crystallized Cultural Gap Between the Two Firms --- Hard to Gauge the Exposure   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1998  Two months ago, Merrill Lynch & Co. and Hambrecht & Quist Group Inc. abruptly put on hold advanced talks over a $1 billion Merrill takeover of H&Q. Investment bankers cited H&Q's rising stock price.  The scuttling of the deal underscores concerns on Wall Street from the high-profile probes of "spinning." Spinning occurs when an underwriter allocates IPO shares to the personal brokerage account of a corporate or venture-capital executive shares often sold, or "spun," for quick profits -- in a possible bid get future business from the executive's company. H&Q was among firms discussed in a November Wall Street Journal article on spinning that triggered the inquiries. The aborted deal represents the first corporate fallout from the probes.  But Merrill is sensitive to legal issues these days. It was stung by the 1994 financial collapse of Orange County, Calif.; Merrill, which acted as a broker and underwriter to the county, last year paid $30 million in a settlement with the Orange County district attorney that ended a criminal probe of Merrill's role. Merrill denies any culpability for the county's troubles but still faces civil litigation over the matter.
