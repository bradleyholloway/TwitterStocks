 Little Difference Is Found Between TPA And Rival in Small Study of Heart Drugs   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1988  Harvey D. White, an Auckland cardiologist, found that "no dramatic difference" emerged from a small study comparing TPA with streptokinase in preserving the heart's pumping power and in prolonging survival following a first heart attack. However, more TPA patients actually survived, though Dr. White cast doubt on the statistical significance.  The report shed more heat than light on the protracted market war between TPA, which costs $2,200 per dose, and its much older rival streptokinase, priced at about $200 per dose. TPA, approved one year ago, has sold more than any other first-year drug in history, but has failed to meet inflated expectations for its debut, causing a recent plunge in stock price of its maker, Genentech Inc.  In survival, the TPA-treated patients enjoyed a numerical advantage -- though the researcher questioned its statistical significance. After 30 days, five patients, or 3.7%, of the TPA group had died, vs. 10 patients, or 7.4%, of the streptokinase group. After nine months, eight patients, or 5.9%, of the TPA group had died, compared with 12 patients, or 8.8%, of the streptokinase group.
