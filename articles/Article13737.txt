 LEISURE & ARTS -- Music: The Rocker Makes Wine --- Maynard James Keenan defies expectations   By Fusilli, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2010  The winemaking Mr. Keenan appears in "Blood into Wine," a documentary that had its Feb. 19 premiere in Scottsdale, Ariz., about two hours south of this former mining center and ghost town that's home to his Caduceus Cellars and Merkin vineyards as well as his handsome wine-tasting room and his Puscifer store, which sells distinctive clothing and other branded materials. When I visited him here on the cold and rainy day following the film premiere, he drove me over to his vineyards and explained in detail his passion for winemaking and the potential for Arizona's Verde Valley to be an important source of American wines.
