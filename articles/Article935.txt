 Fannie Mae Bookkeeping To Reflect Prepayments   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1987  The Federal National Mortgage Association plans to revise its accounting procedures substantially in order to reflect a faster-than-expected rate in the prepayment of mortgages.  As a result, the company said it expects to report "significantly" higher earnings than it had expected for 1987. The new accounting procedures require Fannie Mae to report much of the additional prepayment income for the current year, rather than spreading it over several years.
