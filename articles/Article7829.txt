 Drexel's Paper Placed on S&P's CreditWatch --- Move by Ratings Company Is Prompted by Concern Over Loan for Buy-Out   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1988  Standard & Poor's Corp. put commercial paper of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on its securities CreditWatch list because of concern over Drexel's planned $3.5 billion bridge loan for the buy-out of RJR Nabisco Inc.  Critics of the financing for the $25 billion RJR buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. have questioned its heavy reliance on Drexel at the same time that Drexel and certain key junk-bond employees face the imminent prospect of criminal charges for securities-law violations in the government's insider-trading investigation.  The RJR financing envisions a $5 billion offering of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds by Drexel and Merrill Lynch & Co. The offerings would replace temporary financing, in the form of bridge loans, of $3.5 billion by Drexel and $1.5 billion by Merrill.
