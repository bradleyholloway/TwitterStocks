 Popping Megavitamins May Sabotage Therapy To Eradicate Cancer   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1999  Let's face it: Americans see vitamin supplements as the fast track to wellness. For years, the conventional wisdom has held that antioxidant vitamins A, E and C protect us against cancer.  In DeKalb, Ill., Mary Lee Cozad took that message to heart. The Northern Illinois University Spanish professor was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. She underwent surgery and four grueling rounds of chemotherapy. Then, like a lot of fatigued and frightened cancer patients, she thought, "I've got to do something." So she started downing vitamin C and E pills, taking comfort in her proactive stand.  Next week, researchers will present early studies suggesting that vitamins E and A may help tumor cells resist chemotherapy and radiation. Rudolph Salganik and colleagues from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will present the research Tuesday at the American Society for Cell Biology meeting in Washington. Dr. Salganik found the vitamins block a natural housecleaning process called apoptosis, in which a reactive form of oxygen triggers the mass suicide of sick or cancerous cells. The researchers also fear the vitamins may deflect the punch of radiation or chemotherapy to help the cancer cells survive.
