 Futures & Options: Rhymes and Reasons   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2000  NATIONAL POETRY MONTH was created four years ago, the inspiration of the Academy of American Poets, who decided that poetry in the U.S. needed higher visibility. In the coming weeks, poetry festivals, so-called "slams," and exhibits will be celebrating poetry and its place in American culture. Highlights include a poetry festival that examines the concept of hometown and an exhibit of artwork inspired by poems.  "LIKE LIMERICKED generals, phrases marshal, ever hopeful these good words, will meet the present need," writes Dillon McKinsey, in an anthology of Austin poets from the city's 1999 International Poetry Festival. Those words could apply to the 260 poets appearing at this year's festival. The festival includes readings, a poetry slam with poets from all over the world, performances by "cutting edge" poets, presentations on young poets and Latin American writers, and panels on topics such as illusion and reality. Passes are $10; selected events are $5 at the door.  THIS EXHIBITION explores the kinship between painter and poet. It showcases 22 paintings by California artist DeLoss McGraw, responding to works by poet William Heyen on General Custer and Crazy Horse. Mr. McGraw has painted interpretations of such writers as Mary Shelley, Emily Dickinson and William Blake. An earlier book of Mr. Heyen's poems, "Crazy Horse in Stillness," explored the lives of Custer, Crazy Horse and Custer's wife, Elizabeth, as well as the spirituality of Native American culture. Admission is $5 for adults, $4 for seniors and students.
