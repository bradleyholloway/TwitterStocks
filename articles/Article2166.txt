 World Wire   By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1996  Russia's national pension fund needs a government bailout this month totaling 3.4 trillion rubles ($684.7 million) to meet obligations, despite an emergency loan of 4 trillion rubles ordered last month by President Boris Yeltsin, the Itar-Tass news agency said. Delays in pension payments, blamed on corporate tax evasion, have become a powerful political weapon for Mr. Yeltsin's Communist opponent, Gennady Zyuganov, in the June presidential election campaign.  In the second year since Japan ended its ban on U.S. apples, imports in the December-March season sank 91% to 803 tons from 8,497 tons. Both countries blamed high prices and perceptions in Japan that U.S. apples are less tasty than Japanese varieties and are likelier to contain dangerous chemicals. And Japan's growers offered discounts to compete with lower-priced U.S. apples.  Czech government and SPT Telecom AS officials said a Prague court decision wouldn't affect their partnership with the TelSource joint venture of Netherlands PTT and Swiss Telecom. The ruling invalidated the state-controlled phone company's shareholder meeting that had allowed TelSource to take a 27% stake. SPT Telecom said it would appeal the decision that the government lacked authority to remove preference for existing holders to buy new shares later issued to TelSource.
