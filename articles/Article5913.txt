 Producer Prices Rose 0.4% Last Month As Soaring Energy Costs Boosted Index   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1996  The "core" producer price index -- which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors -- rose only 0.1%, the Labor Department said. The core index, considered a good measure of inflationary pressures, has increased only 0.6% so far this year, compared with a 2.6% jump for all of 1995. Today, the government will announce the November consumer price index, which measures inflation at the retail level. Analysts expect a similarly tranquil report.  The 2.3% surge in November energy costs was spurred by supply shortages and followed a similarly large leap in October. Over time, such a trend could begin to force up production costs, but economists expect fuel prices to start receding. "We have probably hit the peak," said William Byers, director of futures research for Bear, Stearns & Co. "If you were to take a snapshot of energy prices now vs. the end of November, they would be flat to slightly lower."
