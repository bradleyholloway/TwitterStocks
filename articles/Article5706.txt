 U.S. v. Microsoft: The Monopoly Myth   By By Alan Reynolds, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 1999  Microsoft is trying to cut a deal with the Justice Department to settle the bothersome and costly antitrust suit. One key sticking point is that government lawyers have insisted on branding Microsoft a monopoly. That, as they understand very well, would expose Microsoft to an endless flood of private lawsuits.  Similarly, Sun Microsystems computer sales rose by 30% last year. That includes expensive servers, but those are commonly networked to many workstations. Sun's cheapest Ultra 5 workstation costs nearly $3,000, but is still just a desktop computer by another name. Like Microsoft, Sun offers a free browser, Hot Java. Industry experts count Sun as Microsoft's most aggressive competitor. Exhibit One does not count Sun at all. Sun also does not make Intel-based computers.  Sun does make an operating system, Solaris, that runs on Intel-based computers. But under the Justice Department's tendentious definition, Solaris does not qualify as a Windows competitor either. Computers using Solaris or other versions of UNIX are invariably part of a business network, sharing printers and disk directories through a powerful server. Windows NT has little more than a third of this lucrative business. Justice officials even speculate that most Windows desktops may one day be displaced by network computers running hypothetical Java-based applications from servers and websites. But none of this matters in determining Microsoft's market share. The figures in Exhibit One are for "single-user" computers only.
