 The Payback Presidency   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1999  The Feb. 12 editorial "Payback Presidency" should have said that Arizona GOP Sen. Jon Kyl believes that U.S. intelligence agencies might have taped White House phone conversations central to the Lewinsky investigation. Sen. Kyl has not himself independently confirmed the alleged tapings. (WSJ Feb. 16, 1999)  Meanwhile various Senators, purporting to be morally torn by it all, have been saying they'll vote to acquit because whatever we know about Bill Clinton, it doesn't affect his ability to govern. This whole Clinton thing is irrelevant to being President of the United States, we are assured. It's just about sex, it's just about lying as a way of life and now, it seems, it's just about revenge. Bill Clinton is beginning to sound like something out of a Mario Puzo novel.  The White House spent yesterday trying to knock down reports of Mr. Clinton's plans to wipe out his enemies. But in recent days he'd made his plans clear to so many Democrats that the story was being circulated all over Washington. Retribution serves Mr. Clinton's political interest because his goal with so little time left is to rescue his reputation for history. That means delegitimizing the House impeachment vote, getting Hollywood capos like Barry Diller to spend millions to drive James Rogan and Asa Hutchinson out of public life, and returning control of the House to Dick Gephardt, who graciously bowed to Mr. Clinton's desire to turn over the Oval Office to Al Gore, the one associate who never crossed him.
