 Political Gossip: A Scoop That Never Ran   By By James M. Perry, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1987  Twenty-five years ago, while working for the old Philadelphia Bulletin, a scoop fell into my lap: I learned that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York, a leading presidential contender who had caused something of a stir by divorcing his first wife, was surreptitiously dating a married woman and planned to marry her as soon as she could get a divorce.  Times, as the Gary Hart story seems to suggest, have changed. A quarter-century ago, American journalists, in general, were more circumspect. We were more impressed by "important" public figures. We weren't so ambitious and we reported on a much smaller universe. We moved slowly and didn't always publish the tough ones. What happened to my story chronicles, I think, how journalists' values have changed. Under today's aggressive conditions, I suspect, my story about Nelson Rockefeller would have made headlines.  But in his eyes it wasn't a story the paper might decide to report because there was something salacious about it. It was a story to be seriously looked at because the woman Gov. Rockefeller wanted to marry came from Philadelphia. News in those days at papers like the Philadelphia Bulletin was essentially local. The Bulletin's world extended generally to Camden, N.J., to the east, Paoli, Pa., to the west, and Wilmington, Del., to the south. The paper that survives in Philadelphia, the Inquirer, a sister publication of the Miami Herald, is a great deal more sophisticated, with world-wide ambitions and a thirst for journalistic prizes.
