 Cable & Wireless PLC Chooses Software From Oracle Affiliate for Cable-TV Box   By By Don Clark and Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1998  Cable & Wireless PLC picked software from an Oracle Corp. affiliate for new digital cable-television boxes, a badly needed endorsement for one of Microsoft Corp.'s main competitors in selling Internet technology for the living room.  The British communications company said it chose software from Network Computer Inc. over offerings from Microsoft and other rivals. This is the first major cable deal for NCI, a Redwood Shores, Calif., company. Oracle spun off the software company and owns about two-thirds of NCI's stock, with a smaller stake held by Netscape Communications Corp.  The technology will first be deployed by Cable & Wireless Communications PLC, Britain's largest cable company, which was formed last year from the merger of three cable companies and Cable & Wireless' long-distance telephone operator. Cable & Wireless is the company's largest investor.
