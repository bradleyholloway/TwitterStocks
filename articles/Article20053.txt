 Mobile ESPN's Struggle Illustrates Hardships Serving Niche Markets   By Cheng, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2006  "It comes down to differentiating yourself and demonstrating what the value-added proposition is," said William Power, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. "It was never clear to us what the true value add was other than more direct access to ESPN and a few other bells and whistles. I don't think that was enough to move existing customers to a new carrier."  In July, Mobile ESPN's general manager, Manish Jha, acknowledged difficulties in getting the message out on how its service differed from the nationwide carriers such as Sprint or Verizon Wireless. As a result, it disappointingly has added only 50,000 customers since its hype-filled Super Bowl launch in February. Critics say the rabid sports fan made up too narrow a customer base. Mobile ESPN said it believes the licensing model represents a bigger opportunity.  Mobile ESPN's failure is indicative of the challenges that companies face when they have little experience in the wireless-service business. "ESPN's experience is confirmation that moving away from your core competency requires super-diligence," said Rich Nespola, chief executive of consulting firm Management Network Group Inc.
