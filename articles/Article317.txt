 Marketers Discover Black Brazil --- Despite Their Huge Numbers, Blacks Are Just Emerging As Distinct Consumer Group   By By Miriam Jordan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2000  Part of the excitement stems from Brazil's growing and increasingly acquisitive black middle-class. Although Brazilian blacks as a group are poorer than whites, their power as a consumer group has been given a big boost in recent years as Brazil has tamed the hyperinflation that long ravaged its working class. Perhaps because of their increased disposable income, one-third of black consumers responding to a 1998 survey said they wanted more soap, make-up and other products catering to their specific needs, according to Brazilian market researcher Luis Grottera.  Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888. But scholars say racism in Brazil historically has been subtler than in the U.S. Blacks here experience prejudice in many forms but not as a matter of law. Brazil has never excluded blacks from voting or had a tradition of segregating the races.  Mainstream investors, most of them white, remain wary of staking capital on black-targeted ventures -- even when they are controlled by whites. Two years ago, Miguel Pires Goncalves, who is white and a former executive of Brazil's biggest independent television network, Globo Network, was inspired by black television in the U.S. to launch a cable channel in Brazil targeted at blacks. "I thought it would be impossible for this not to work," Mr. Pires says, noting "We have twice as many blacks as the U.S."
