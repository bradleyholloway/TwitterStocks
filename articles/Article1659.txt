 Alberta to Reduce Its Royalty Rates On Oil, Gas Output   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1992  Alberta announced changes in the way it collects royalties on oil and natural gas production in the province that could boost the energy industry's cash flow by a total of 368 million Canadian dollars (US$295.9 million) annually.  Under the plan, Rick Orman, Alberta's energy minister, said royalty rates will be cut 10% to 15% on most forms of oil and gas production, while companies with natural gas production in the province could save as much as 60% of their royalty administration expenses because of revamped accounting mechanisms.
