 Election '96: Tip Sheet for the Races --- Ten Key Congressional Candidates to Watch, Where to Head On the Web and What It Would Take for Dole to Win   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1996  But the biggest battle will be for control of the House and Senate. In the Senate, Republicans now have a 53-47 margin. Tomorrow, 34 seats are up for election, including 13 held by Republicans, seven held by Democrats and 14 with no incumbent. Especially uncertain is the fate of the House, which now has 235 Republicans, 198 Democrats, one vacancy and one independent. Here are 10 people to watch as you try to assess which way Congress might tip.  Rep. Fox of suburban Philadelphia backed Newt Gingrich's Contract with America as one of the House's 73 freshman Republicans. Now he fears for his political life, with President Clinton running strongly in his district. Mr. Fox's new motto: Who's Newt? Some of his campaign literature doesn't even mention he is a Republican. His challenger, Montgomery County Commissioner Joe Hoeffel, attacks Mr. Fox for votes to limit Medicare spending and restrict abortion rights.  There are 53 open House seats -- many of them formerly held by Democrats in the South. In Tampa, Republicans hope to replace retiring Democratic incumbent Sam Gibbons with Mark Sharpe, a former naval-intelligence officer. Mr. Sharpe is trying to win the allegiance of local veterans, and is wooing younger voters with promises of lower taxes and school vouchers. But his real fighting words in this increasingly Republican district: A vote for his opponent, Florida House Majority Leader Jim Davis, is a vote to make Dick Gephardt majority leader.
