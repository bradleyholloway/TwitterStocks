 Strike Virtually Shuts Down Zimbabwe, Presenting Big Threat to Mugabe's Rule   By By Robert Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1998  JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- A general strike yesterday virtually shut down Zimbabwe, hammering an already deteriorating economy and presenting President Robert Mugabe with perhaps the biggest threat to his 18-year rule.  The country's main industries were shut and Harare's central business district was only partly open as thousands of workers heeded calls by Zimbabwe's labor movement to show their anger over last week's 67% rise in fuel prices by staying at home. Apart from a few demonstrations, including one in the eastern town of Mutare where one man was shot dead by riot police, most people heeded the calls to keep off the streets.  "The stay-away was overwhelmingly supported," said Morgan Tsvangirai, the charismatic secretary general of Zimbabwe's Congress of Trade Unions, or ZCTU, which has called for strikes every Wednesday until Mr. Mugabe rescinds the price rise and engages the unions in talks over how to stem the country's deepening economic crisis.
