 California Water District Proposal With Cadiz Rouses Thirsty Public   By By Sydney B. Leavens, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2001  Although a handful of private companies, including Western Water Co. and Vidler Water, a unit of Pico Holdings Inc., have dabbled in the water market, the Cadiz proposal is the most ambitious one floated by the private sector to help ease Southern California's woes. It calls for the company to store water on behalf of the district in natural basins it controls beneath the Mojave Desert and separately to supply additional groundwater. Water-district officials say the 50-year deal could cost the district about $300 million at current rate levels. The Santa Monica, Calif., concern argues that its plan is a cost-effective and environmentally sound way to help Southern California cope. But "we're the pioneer in this business," says Keith Brackpool, Cadiz CEO. "We are the guys with the arrows sticking out of our backs."  Still, the energy crisis has affected the way the Cadiz deal is structured. In April, the MWD and Cadiz amended the proposal to include a 15% annual cap on price fluctuations on the 30,000 acre-feet of ground water per year the district has committed to purchase during the first 25 years of the program. As part of that agreement, Cadiz also has the option to sell an additional 30,000 acre-feet of ground water annually to third parties at market prices.  "The Cadiz project doesn't make much economic sense unless you are a shareholder in Cadiz Inc.," he says.
