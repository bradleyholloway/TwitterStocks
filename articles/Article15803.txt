 EU Moves to Keep Ban on Hormone-Treated Beef   By By Julie Wolf, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1999  The European Commission, all but ensuring the U.S. and European Union will wage another trade war over beef hormones, ruled out ending a 10-year-old ban on hormone-treated beef.  "The commission agreed there can no longer be any question" that the ban on hormone-treated beef won't be lifted, the EU executive body said in a statement following its weekly meeting in Strasbourg, France. The commission cited a report released Monday by the EU's scientific committee on veterinary measures, which concluded that one of six hormones used in the U.S. is carcinogenic.  Mr. Scher added that the World Health Organization, "as recently as February, reviewed all six hormones and determined that the proper use causes no risk." The statement -- and its hard-line tone -- bode ill for efforts to prevent the long-running EU-U.S. dispute over hormones from turning into a trade war. The World Trade Organization last year upheld the U.S.'s contention that the EU ban on hormones in meat contravenes international trade rules and gave the EU until May 13 to comply with the judgment.
