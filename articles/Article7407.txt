 House Members Weigh Fourth Tax Rate In Bid to Recast Three-Tier Reagan Plan   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1985  The jockeying has begun on Capitol Hill to reshape President Reagan's tax-overhaul plan, with a particular eye toward the possibility of adding a higher, fourth tax rate to the president's proposed three-rate structure.  In a breakfast meeting with reporters, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee said that he viewed as "very positive" a suggestion by committee members -- Republicans as well as Democrats -- to examine a rate structure different from the president's. Specifically, he said that adding a fourth rate was a possibility as a way to improve the "fairness" of the tax-revision.  Additional changes being contemplated by the chairman and other members of his panel include retaining at least some deductibility for state and local taxes, making the president's proposed depreciation schedule less generous, tightening tax breaks for the oil industry and making the changeover to a new system more lenient, perhaps by curtailing the president's plan to tax "windfalls" caused by lower rates.
