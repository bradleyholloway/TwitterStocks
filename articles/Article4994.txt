 Northrop Indicted on Federal Charges Of Falsifying Tests on Weapons Parts   By By Roy J. Harris Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1989  A federal grand jury indicted Northrop Corp. on charges of falsifying tests on two weapons-system parts, the first case sparked by what the U.S. attorney's office here describes as a two-year continuing criminal investigation focusing solely on the defense contractor.  The indictment includes a total of 167 fraud charges and other counts against Northrop and Joseph Yamron, vice president and general manager for the Precision Products division, along with one other current employee and three former employees. It alleges that below-standard flight-data transmitters were provided for use in the guidance system of the Air Force air-launched cruise missile and that poorly tested Northrop stabilization systems were installed in the Navy Harrier fighter jet, among other charges.  He declined to detail the breadth of the task force's inquiry, except to say that it was separate from a Justice Department probe of $7.75 million in foreign payments and other financial dealings involving Northrop and South Korea during the company's attempts to sell F-20 fighters to Korea. Northrop also has been investigated separately in relation to production of its guidance system for the MX intercontinental ballistic missile and in the Pentagon probe related to influence peddling by consultants on defense programs.
