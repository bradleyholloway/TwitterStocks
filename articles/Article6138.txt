 Racial Politics at the Supreme Court   By By Eugene Volokh, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1998  The 1,000-plus demonstrators were protesting the Supreme Court's record in hiring black and Hispanic clerks. Of the clerks who have worked for the currently sitting justices, only 1.7% have been black and 1.2% have been Hispanic. "This is not ambiguous," says Rep. Albert R. Wynn (D., Md.). "This is clear (discrimination). The numbers speak for themselves."  Ethnic groups don't distribute themselves evenly throughout the workforce. Asians occupy more than 40% of the freshman class at the University of California at Berkeley. Jews, 2% of the full-time working population, make up 26% of the nation's law professors. Jews also tend to make up about 30% of the Supreme Court clerks, which means non-Jewish whites are underrepresented among the clerks compared to the population at large. Asians are slightly overrepresented, at 4% of the clerks compared to 3% of the overall population. Yet surely this isn't a result of vast pro-Asian, pro-Jewish or anti-Gentile bigotry. Disproportion does not prove discrimination.  Civil rights law recognizes this. In discrimination cases involving skilled jobs, the racial makeup of those hired must be compared not against the general population, but against the qualified labor pool. As a matter of both law and logic, it's irrelevant to a discrimination claim that the clerks' racial breakdown doesn't match the country's. What matters is the difference between the makeup of the pool of clerks and the pool of top law school graduates -- the group from which the justices select their clerks.
