 Vioxx Plaintiff Faces Choice: Slashed Award or New Trial   By Tesoriero, Heather Won, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2007  Judge Eldon E. Fallon's order followed a verdict last August, when a federal jury found Merck & Co.'s painkiller was responsible for plaintiff Gerald Barnett's heart attack. The former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent was awarded $50 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. The judge threw out the award shortly thereafter, finding it "grossly excessive," and ordered a new trial on damages.  "The judge has spoken," Mark Robinson, a lawyer for the plaintiff, said in an interview. "I think my client needs to accept this." He added that he believes the judge's order stands a strong chance of being upheld on appeal. "No one can say after a heart attack that $600,000 is excessive."
