 Railroad Mergers Are Seen Yielding Mixed Quarterly Results for Industry   By By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1997  Major railroad companies are expected to post mixed results, as earnings of Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. are dragged down by the cost of acquiring Conrail Inc.  As a group, the rail companies are expected to post higher results. Their earnings will vary widely, however. That's largely because different companies are in various stages of the merger mania that has gripped the industry. For Western railroads, which are implementing major acquisitions, cost-cutting is expected to buoy results.  Union Pacific Corp., Bethlehem, Pa., is expected to post sharply higher per-share earnings, up 37% to 92 cents a share from 67 cents a share a year earlier, according to a First Call consensus of analysts. The year-ago results include the earnings of Southern Pacific Rail Corp., which merged with Union Pacific last September in a $3.9 billion deal.
