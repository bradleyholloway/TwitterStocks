 Cross Country: Lone Star Spending Spree   By Stout, Mary Katherine, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2007  It was supposed to have limits. [Schip]'s champions argued that the program would not be an open-ended entitlement, obligating the state to pay for anyone who met eligibility requirements and signed up. Instead they promised to cap the costs at a specific dollar amount each year. If too many people sought to sign up, Schip administrators were to draw up waiting lists and halt enrollment.  Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat and Schip supporter, said on the House floor: "Would I like to see more kids added? Absolutely. Would I like to see 700,000 kids that would qualify for [S]chips on the rolls? Absolutely." He also urged his colleagues to "do the right thing for kids today, hoping that as we move forward, we'll take another step for kids tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow." In the end, only a handful of Texas legislators voted against expanding the program by loosening eligibility standards, relaxing the assets test and reversing other 2003 reforms. Gov. Rick Perry has already signed it into law.  This is where President [George W. Bush]'s experience in Texas comes to play a role in his fight at the national level, where Schip must be reauthorized this year. As the governor who signed Schip into law in the state, he can remember the arguments and the promises made during the initial debates of the program. He can see how Schip has been used to expand government control of health care and how it has been abused. He can see how a program that started out for poor children has become an instrument for universal and, increasingly, socialized medicine.
