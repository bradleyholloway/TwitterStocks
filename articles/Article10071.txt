 Don't Panic About the Credit Market   By Malpass, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2007  U.S. growth has endured other waves of equally loud pessimism -- over high gasoline prices, low (pre-revision) estimates of job growth, a supposedly negative personal savings rate (revised to positive on July 27 by the Commerce Department) and even the 2003 tax cut on labor and capital. Remember the argument that tax cuts would put the economy on a path toward fiscal collapse and recession? Now, the U.S. deficit is set to fall below $150 billion by Washington's September fiscal year-end, thanks to strong tax receipts.  While it's frowned upon to look for a silver lining when markets tumble and painful losses accumulate, the housing- and debt-market corrections will probably add to the length of the U.S. economic expansion. Overly low interest rates in 2004-2006 channeled economic activity into housing and debt financing. Corporate bond yields fell relative to Treasurys, causing leveraged investments. This artificial allocation of U.S. capital now looks like it will be corrected before inflation kicks in (CPI will likely top 4% later this year) and higher tax rates bite (the massive increase scheduled for 2011 when the Bush tax cuts expire).  In the long list of worries about consumption, the threat of mortgage-rate resets is providing the latest fixation. It shouldn't. Payments on some $500 billion of adjustable rate mortgages are scheduled to go up in 2007. If the mortgage rate is adjusted upward by an average two percentage points, that's $10 billion in added payments. To put this in perspective, wages for nonsupervisory workers increased by $296 billion over the last 12 months. The July 27 revision alone added $130 billion to the last year's total U.S. personal income, raising it to $11.5 trillion, reflecting the hard-to- track dynamism of the U.S. economy.
