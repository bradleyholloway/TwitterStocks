 CA Could Face Suit to Recover Payouts to Aides   By Forelle, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2004  Mr. [Sam Wyly] staged proxy fights in 2001 and 2002 that sought to replace some CA directors with a new slate. He accompanied his campaign with advertisements asserting that CA lacked integrity. Mr. Wyly's slate garnered only about a quarter of the votes in 2001, and he ended the 2002 bid prematurely by accepting a $10 million payment to stay away.  Mr. Wyly acquired a stake in CA after the Islandia, N.Y., company bought his software concern Sterling Software Inc. in 2000. A lawyer for Ranger, Bill Brewer, said in an interview that the Wyly family was "never really comfortable that they were served a pig in a poke when they merged. We now know that [CA] was not a company that was growing but was a company that was recycling its financials." Mr. Brewer says Ranger has "small" holdings, but that the Wylys also have a CA stake.
