 Doskocil Offers to Pay Wilson $12.50 a Share, Sets Deadline Today   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1988  HUTCHINSON, Kan. -- Doskocil Cos., again trying to push Wilson Foods Corp. into a merger agreement, said it was willing to negotiate an accord with Wilson's board at $12.50 a share, but only until 9 a.m. today.  As reported, Doskocil, a maker of pizza toppings, currently is making a $12.25 a share tender offer to Wilson shareholders. The tender offer was cut from $12.50 a share, or $115 million, last week after Wilson's board refused to negate the Oklahoma City, Okla., pork producer's poison pill antitakeover measure. More than 76% of Wilson's shares had been tendered under the original offer.
