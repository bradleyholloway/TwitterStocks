 U.S. Probes Whether Airlines Colluded on Fare Increase   By By Asra Q. Nomani, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1989  The scope of the federal investigation isn't known, but officials at several major carriers privately confirmed that they are complying with the request for documents. The airline executives said the Justice Department appears to be focusing on a fare increase announced by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines on Sept. 18. The fare increase, which went into effect Sept. 29, was quickly adopted throughout the industry.  Amy Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said prosecutors sent documents known as civil investigative demands to carriers "within a short period of time after" the Sept. 29 fare hikes. She said the investigation is to determine whether "there was any agreement among two or more of the airlines in connection with the Sept. 29, 1989, increase in airline ticket prices." She declined to identify the airlines targeted "or any other specifics," including what action prosecutors are considering.  In addition, industry people said most other carriers are complying with the demands, too. They include: UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, NWA Inc.'s Northwest Arlines, Trans World Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines and Midway Airlines.
