 The SEC's Case Against Drexel -- Tough Choice: Drexel Faces Difficulty Whether It Settles Case Or Gambles on a Trial --- Milken Future Is in Question, As Is Junk-Bond Business, Despite a Sizable Cushion --- Warning of Criminal Action   By By Steve Swartz and Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 9, 1988  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is flush with cash and getting the support of the overwhelming majority of its clients. But the government's extensive civil charges against it are threatening to drain its management, subject it to continuing bad publicity and confront it with the difficult choice of either settling or fighting the charges.  Moreover, a criminal prosecution could lead to prison terms, and any fines resulting from a conviction could be greater than civil fines. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani recently showed in a case involving a former Drexel employee and a Drexel client that he won't hesitate to seek triple damages under the federal anti-racketeering statute. Drexel is believed to have recently increased its reserve for the litigation to $650 million from $500 million. Its officials decline to comment on it.  In a brief telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Joseph said he remains in full control of Drexel. Regarding questions about his and Mr. Linton's supervision of Drexel, Mr. Joseph said, "I think our compliance systems {for detecting wrongdoing} are as good as any on the Street." Mr. Linton couldn't be reached for comment.
