 World Wire [3]  By Compiled by William Mathewson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1991  Cacuk Sudarijanto, president-director of the state telephone company, Perumtel, said that PT Citra Telekomunikasi Indonesia had been selected as partner for a consortium led by American Telephone & Telegraph Co., while PT Elektrindo Nusantara had been chosen to work with a partnership of Japan's NEC Corp. and Sumitomo Corp.  Citra Telekomunikasi Indonesia was set up last year by Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, Mr. Suharto's eldest daughter. Elektrindo Nusantara is part of the Bimantara Citra Group headed by Bambang Trihatmodjo, the second of the president's three sons.  Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French channel-tunnel consortium, said its chief construction executive, Alistair Fleming, is departing and is being replaced by his deputy, Roger Picard. Mr. Fleming, who joined Eurotunnel in February after a management reshuffle designed to keep the project on track, will resign at the end of January to become an executive director of Weir Group, a Glasgow-based engineering-services concern. Eurotunnel called Mr. Fleming's departure "amicable" and said the opportunity offered by Weir was the basis for his resignation.
