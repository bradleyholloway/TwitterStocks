 Review / A Surfer's Guide to TV: Trials and Triumphs   By By Barbara D. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2000  Some 10 years ago, Sir David Attenborough bought a weird-looking wooden carving with a curved, elongated body and limbs, prominent ribs and a Punch-like face with goggly eyes. He had a hunch the figure, said to come from Easter Island, was a lot more valuable than the New York auctioneers thought. In this fascinating journey, which takes in art, history, anthropology and science, Sir David sets off in search of the origins of his carving, on a trail that leads him to London, St. Petersburg, Sydney, Tahiti and Easter Island itself.  Maybe the fault isn't Alec Baldwin's. Perhaps Justice Robert Jackson, the chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg trials, really was as stiff and opaque as Mr. Baldwin's portrayal of him, which seems to consist of an intense squint, a manly jaw, an earnest delivery and little else. But either way, it makes for a creepily lopsided miniseries. For despite the best intentions of the filmmakers (including co-executive producer Baldwin) to remind a younger generation of the importance of prosecuting war crimes -- and their inclusion of horrifying real footage from the concentration camps -- the two-parter is hijacked by Brian Cox's powerful performance as the theatrical Hermann Goering. Mr. Cox is so skilled at locating the Nazi's flawed humanity, at depicting his soldierly sense of honor, that impressionable viewers may reach the wrong verdict.
