 Europe's Auto Makers Report New-Car Sales Fell 1.3% Last Month   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1997  Sluggish growth coupled with an erosion in consumer confidence pushed new-car registrations down a provisional 1.3% last month in Western Europe compared with a year ago, the European auto makers' group said.  Sales fell to 1,039,300 units from 1,053,200 units in the year-ago month and dropped 8.1% from 1,130,000 units in January, the Association of European Car Manufacturers said, noting that the slide most likely will continue.
