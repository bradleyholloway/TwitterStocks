 PURSUITS; Books: Tales of a Horseman in the Not-So-Wild West   By Kauffman, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2006  Acting upon [Eliza Stevenson]'s wisdom ("Defend what you love"), the aging [Rossie] runs for governor in 1968 to save Montana with a mixture of fresh-air populism and offbeat liberalism. "Give Montana back to the independent people," he urges, quoting such unlikely sources as H.L. Mencken and Adam Smith. He emphasizes local industry and tourism, envisioning a coalition of horsemen and working people and hippies. "We've lost all sense of how to control our fate and our lives," he laments, but for Rossie, if not Montana, it's too late. Somewhere along the way -- Mr. [William Kittredge] suggests in this troubling novel -- the West and its people lost the trail back home, to the place where simpler and better truths reside.
