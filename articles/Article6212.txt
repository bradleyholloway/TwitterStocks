 `Parity' Isn't Charity   By By Steven S. Sharfstein and Sally Satel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1999  At this week's daylong White House Conference on Mental Health, Tipper Gore called mental illness "the last great stigma of the 20th century." She bemoaned the practice of most insurance companies to give mental conditions less coverage than physical ones. "It's high time our health plans treat all Americans equally," said President Clinton. In insurance circles, the word for treating mental and physical conditions alike is parity. But while it's a worthy goal, the administration's plan for parity is unlikely to work.  The plan would require the 285 private insurance plans that make up the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to cover treatment for mental illness on the same basis as other medical conditions. A plan in the FEHBP could not limit the length of stay in a psychiatric hospital or the number of visits to a psychiatrist -- unless stays and visits were similarly curtailed for physical illnesses such as heart attacks or broken legs.  For the roughly 9.5 million federal employees and their dependents under the FEHBP plans, parity is intended to remove the constraints managed care has imposed on psychiatric care. These limits have gotten so severe over the past decade that some very sick patients have been kicked out of the hospital prematurely, only to be readmitted. At Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt hospital, the rate of readmission within 30 days of discharge has doubled in the past seven years. Meanwhile the average length of stay has decreased from 30 days to seven while doctors waste hours haggling with poorly trained "utilization reviewers" for a few extra inpatient days or outpatient visits.
