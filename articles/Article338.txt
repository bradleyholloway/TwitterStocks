 Review / Film -- Sleeper of the Year: `In the Bedroom' Is Rich Tale of Tragic Love --- Spacek Plays Small-Town Mother Anguished Over Son's Affair; `Spy Game' Never Hits the Mark   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 23, 2001  "In the Bedroom," which opens today in New York and Los Angeles, is the debut feature of Todd Field; the director shares credit with Rob Festinger for the eloquent and ambitious adaptation of a story by the late Andre Dubus. The movie stars Tom Wilkinson as Matt Fowler, a doctor with a solid practice in a picturesque town on the coast of Maine, and Sissy Spacek as Ruth Fowler, his wife, the leader of a school choir. Nick Stahl is their son Frank, a college student home on vacation. There's trouble brewing in this picture-postcard paradise, but no agreement on how serious it may be. Frank's passionate affair with an older and not-quite-divorced single mother named Natalie (Marisa Tomei) has his own mom alarmed. Matt finds himself more amused than anything else; he figures the romance will burn itself out before the boy goes back to school.  Every one of the lead performances is a marvel. Mr. Wilkinson, an English actor perfectly at home in the American idiom, makes Matt so effortlessly likable at first that we're stunned by the discovery of what this father and professional healer can do in his desperate efforts to treat wounds that may never heal. Ms. Spacek seems to get beyond acting in her portrayal of a mother whose long-buried feelings have nowhere to go. I don't mean to suggest that she's not a skilled performer, but only that her skills are invisible here; it's as if a woman who looks a lot like an actress we're fond of has been discovered at the most anguishing moments of her life. Mr. Stahl makes Frank his father's lovable son with a minimum of fuss. Ms. Tomei does the best work of her career as the ardent but fearful Natalie. William Mapother, as Natalie's husband, Richard, is memorable in several short scenes and eerily brilliant in a very long one.  YOU NEVER KNOW about movies that sound awful. "Black Knight" stars Martin Lawrence as Jamal, a menial worker at a dilapidated theme park called Medieval World who suddenly finds himself in 14th-century England (which of course he mistakes for a theme park.) Jamal's magical transmigration takes place when he nearly drowns in Medieval World's polluted moat. I thought he'd pull us down into the muck with him -- such recent Martin Lawrence vehicles as "Big Momma's House" have not been long on subtlety. Yet star and character alike prevail in this goofball "Camelot" as Jamal passes himself off as a knight and falls in love with a beautiful maiden.
