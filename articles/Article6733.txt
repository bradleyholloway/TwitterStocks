 Telecom Italia Deal Still on Hold   By Giada Zampano and Serena Saitto, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2007  "If either the Brazilian or Argentine regulator made a condition of approving the deal that either Telefonica or Telecom Italia sells assets, then this is a very big issue," said Robert Grindle, telecom analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London. "For Telefonica to sell, it would mean to go against the company's whole Latin American footprint strategy. If Telecom Italia was forced to sell on the cheap, investors would go crazy."  Telefonica executives say they are doing all they can to alleviate concerns about competition. Earlier this month, Antonio Carlos Valente da Silva, chief executive at Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA, a fixed-line operator owned by Telefonica, said Telefonica had given Brazilian regulator Anatel a guarantee that it wouldn't interfere in questions concerning TIM Participacoes SA, Telecom Italia's Brazilian wireless unit.  In Argentina, Telefonica operates via its local unit Telefonica de Argentina SA, and Telecom Italia owns a 50% stake in the Sofora holding company that controls Telecom Argentina, Argentina's second- biggest operator by subscribers after Telefonica. Both companies have said Telecom Argentina's control structure won't change as a result of the Telco deal, and Telefonica won't unduly influence Telecom Argentina's decision making.
