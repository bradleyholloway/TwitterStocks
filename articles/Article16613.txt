 Your U.S. Fund May Be Scurrying Abroad   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2006  "Many managers in the last few years have said that foreign stocks appeared cheaper than U.S. stocks," says Russel Kinnel, director of mutual-fund research at Morningstar. "Now, that gap has narrowed slightly, but it's still there."  "I don't know if it's so much our conscious move as the fact that the world is changing," says Dodge & Cox CEO John Gunn, referring to the shift of Dodge & Cox Stock Fund towards foreign companies. "There are more and more very high-quality multinationals that are based outside the U.S., and that has expanded our universe somewhat. What you're charting is the integration of the global economy."  Ron Sloan, lead portfolio manager at AIM Charter Fund, another fund that has bumped up its foreign holdings lately, concurs that investing has taken on a more global flavor. "We're on a global stage and so if you're managing a large fund, you're owning companies that have a large global exposure whether they're based in the U.S. or not," he says. "To be analyzing brewers and to only look at Budweiser and Coors while ignoring Heineken or [SABMiller] is just silly."
