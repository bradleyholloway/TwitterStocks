 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Theater / View: Build It -- They'll Laugh   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2004  Lisa D'Amour's "Anna Bella Eema," which the New Georges brought to HERE Arts Center last week for a five-performance showcase, isn't as user-friendly as "The Beard of Avon," but it'll stick in your mind a lot longer. An avant-garde theater piece about an agoraphobic woman (Gretchen Lee Krich) who lives in a trailer park with her precocious daughter (Monica Appleby) and an imaginary playmate made of mud (April Matthis), "Anna Bella Eema" moves with bewitching self-assurance from storybook sweetness to near-Gothic surrealism and back again. The acting is breathtakingly good, as is Katie Pearl's resourceful direction. I hope this lovely, unsettling show finds a permanent home soon.  As directed by Maria Mileaf, the four characters are caricatures drawn in strychnine, each speaking his or her preferred brand of how's-that-again gobbledygook ("Rather than focus on a vocabulary of pliant and reconfigurable forms and gestures, I think it's important that you research a procedural agenda, or practice, that is pliant and reconfigurable.") At the same time, each character is given his fair share of sensible things to say -- a shrewd authorial tactic. Even poor [Margaret] turns out to be brighter than she looks: "You ask us to come up with these abstract ideas that aren't even meant to be built, but then before you know it, someone publishes it in some chi-chi poo- poo New York magazine, and then all of a sudden there's a show at MoMA, and then pretty soon after that, it gets built, and then others get built, cheap knock-offs start showing up in office buildings, shopping malls, hospitals . . . and all from what? Some narcissistic attempt to stand out from the rest as if they're trying to come up with a new craze in designer jeans."
