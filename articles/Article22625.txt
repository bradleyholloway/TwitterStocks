 EPA Labels PT Cruiser a Car, Creating Potential Trouble for Some Auto Makers   By By Jeffrey Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2000  DaimlerChrysler AG calls its eye-catching PT Cruiser a "segment buster" that blurs the lines between cars and trucks. But federal environmental regulators have ruled that the PT Cruiser is really a car, and that could cause trouble for a number of auto makers.  Over DaimlerChrysler's objections, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which must certify new vehicles to make sure they don't pollute too much, has labeled the PT Cruiser a car. The EPA's decision doesn't itself matter much to DaimlerChrysler, because the emissions rules for cars like the PT Cruiser aren't markedly different from those for trucks. But the EPA's decision has created a sticky situation at another federal agency whose opinion on the issue matters a great deal to DaimlerChrysler.  Enter the PT Cruiser, which will get an estimated 20 to 26 miles per gallon of gasoline. If DaimlerChrysler is able to get the vehicle classified as a truck for CAFE purposes, the PT Cruiser will help the company comply with the rules by offsetting the far lower fuel efficiency of the company's other trucks. That's particularly true given that the PT Cruiser, which goes on sale this month, is expected to be a runaway best-seller.
