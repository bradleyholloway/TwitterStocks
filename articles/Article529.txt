WASHINGTON, July 9â€” The latest round of contract talks between the National Football League's management and player union ended today after three days, with neither side changing its position on the players' major demand.  The players association wants 55 percent of the N.F.L.'s gross income to be set aside for salaries and other benefits.  The head of the Management Council, Jack Donlan, said he had told the union ''unequivocally'' that his group would not accept the plan. The members of the Management Council left for New York, where there will probably be another meeting in two weeks. But many of the players in the union remained here to testify before a Congressional subcommittee Thursday on charges of racial bias related to employment opportunities in the N.F.L.
