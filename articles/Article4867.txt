 Gulf Oil Spill Of 1991 War Is Evaluated --- Saudi Beach Areas Remain 'Paved' With Crude Oil, U.S. Agency Team Says   By By Ken Wells, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1992  Fourteen months after the Gulf War oil spill, as much as 375 miles of Saudi Arabian beaches remain "paved" under footdeep slabs of crude oil that have left Saudi's intertidal zone "devastated." In secluded stretches along the Gulf shore, the hardened oil may take four decades to dissipate.  That's the preliminary finding of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is in the midst of a 100-day United Nations-sponsored research cruise to measure both short-term and long-term impacts of the January 1991 catastrophe. The U.S. scientists, along with researchers from numerous Persian Gulf countries, are expected to report detailed findings next January.
