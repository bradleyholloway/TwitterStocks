 Option Funds Lag as Stocks Swing Sharply   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1988  The widely touted advantage of the funds' strategy is that they boost income with the premiums received from writing the calls. Those premiums, along with dividends, can increase annual income by more than 10%, fund specialists say. In recent years, the funds have attracted a lot of new money, with assets swelling nearly tenfold to about $7 billion during the bull market.  But critics say these funds typically perform poorly in sharply fluctuating markets. If the market rises, the funds don't reap the full benefits because holders of the call options buy the shares while prices are still going up, specialists say. And if the market drops, the funds lose if the stocks fall by an amount greater than the income generated by selling the options.  The funds have their backers, of course. Some portfolio managers contend that option-income funds can do well in flat or gradually moving markets. This year the funds have gained 8.8% through last week, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated in a 200-point range. (The average general equity fund gained about 9% during the same time.)
