 Politics & Economics: South American Leaders Defuse Some Tension Over Bolivian Gas   By Matt Moffett and Geraldo Samor, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2006  Mr. da [Silva] emphasized Petrobras's "autonomy to invest," in any country where it can reach agreements, including in Bolivia. He said Bolivia had the "sovereign right" to determine how it exploits its natural resources.  Analysts hadn't been expecting dramatic results from the meeting. "I think they just want to open up some diplomatic space and then let the diplomats and lawyers take over," said Riordan Roett, a Latin America specialist at Johns Hopkins University. Mr. [Evo Morales], who was inaugurated in January pledging to lift the country out of poverty, "was being pushed by his base to do something dramatic," Mr. Roett said. "But you have to believe Morales isn't suicidal and isn't going to drive out investment from his major industry."  After the meeting, Mr. da Silva dismissed the notion that Brazil was the victim of a squeeze play by Mr. [Hugo Chavez] and Mr. Morales. "I don't believe there is an alliance between Bolivia and Venezuela to challenge Brazil," he said.
