 Gains by Yahoo, Amazon.com, Oil Firms Fail to Lift Market   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2003  Yahoo jumped $1.05, or 4%, to $27.22 on Nasdaq -- a 52-week closing high, but far from its Internet-bubble peak of 250 -- after a report that the company's stake in Yahoo Japan, valued at $734 million last September, is now valued at $3.56 billion.  SoundView Technology Group provided that report, while Deutsche Bank also had positive things to say about Yahoo as well as Amazon.com and eBay in regard to renewed revenue prospects through their paid listing services. Amazon.com (Nasdaq) advanced 1.25, or 3.9%, to 32.95 -- a new 52-week closing high, but still way off its all-time peak of 113 -- and eBay (Nasdaq) rose 2.74, or 2.9%, to 97.48 -- also a 52-week closing high, but well below its all-time high of 127.50. All three stocks were top performers on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index of large nonfinancial stocks.  Dow industrial average member Exxon Mobil -- an oil supplier -- couldn't manage a gain, instead falling two cents to 35.53. In fact, declines were marked by 24 of the 30-member Dow industrial average, which fell 47.48, or 0.5%, to 8679.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell an iota, 1.72 points, or 0.1%, to 1539.68, after marking on Monday its highest level since last June 18. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index lost 2.81, or 0.3%, to 942.30, after Monday's marking of its best close since Aug. 26 of last year.
