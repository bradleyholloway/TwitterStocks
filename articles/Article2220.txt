 A trucker's lot isn't an easy one in South China   By Wong, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1996  The daily routine of Chinese truck driver J. Y. Yung is profiled. Dodging trouble is all in a day's work for the streetwise Yung, who hauls cargo between Hong Kong's Kwai Chung container port and the clusters of boomtowns along the south China coast. In British-run Hong Kong, everything hums like clockwork. Once Yung crosses the border, he is in a chaotic society plagued by corruption as well as banditry.
