 Mixed Blessing -- Rev. Chesnut's Lot: A Wealthy Church And Plenty of Critics --- At East Liberty Presbyterian, The Market's Rise Yields Embarrassment of Riches --- When the Choir Walked Out   By By Lisa Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1998  In Mr. (Robert A.) Chesnut's case, that treasure is East Liberty's endowment. With the help of the relentless bull market, the church's "big pot," as the reverend calls it, has more than doubled to $36 million since 1988. And though the money has sustained East Liberty through decades of hard times, it also put the church in a bizarre, but not uncommon, bind: The richer it got, the more it seemed to be languishing.  So it was when Mr. Chesnut came along with his financially ambitious plans to resurrect the spiritual life of the church: Those deep-seated feelings erupted, dividing the congregation, a mix of old Pittsburgh families and poor people from the neighborhood. Many members -- including almost everyone in the choir-walked out, emergency meetings were called, the pastor nearly quit his job.  Yet in 1988, the church hired Mr. Chesnut, an old-style liberal with a plan to save the church: Spend more money. Mr. Chesnut came out swinging, starting up experimental programs to lure members to the church, hoping that young families, gays and ethnic minorities would find their home at East Liberty.
