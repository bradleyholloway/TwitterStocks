 Chileans Disoriented by Pinochet's Loss --- Both Opposition and Regime Are Beset by Conflicts   By By Roger Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1988  Gen. Augusto Pinochet still sits in the Moneda Palace. His cabinet is the same. The changing of the guard, at 10 every morning, is as punctual as always. In Santiago's busy center, the same street clowns draw crowds in the unrelenting spring sun. The nights are punctuated, still, by distant sirens. The tumult of the past week, when Chile voted against its 15-year dictatorship, has quickly subsided into the humdrum.  The disorientation is acute in the opposition. Long divided, 16 opposition parties united behind the banner of ousting Gen. Pinochet. But, after their victory, he is still in the palace -- and the 1980 constitution drafted by the military allows him to stay there until March 1990. The opposition is torn between its desire to advance this date and awareness that rushing things could provoke the regime.  Its conflicts are illustrated by an argument between Jorge Schaulsohn and Sergio Bitar, respectively secretary-general and political director of the center-left PPD, a major opposition party. "We have held up the promised land and we aren't delivering," says Mr. Schaulsohn. "We said we'd get rid of Pinochet and that hasn't happened. If we don't soon deliver facts, our constituency will become more extremist. That could be explosive."
