 Ad Use Is Issue in Suit Against Viacom   By By Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  Specifically, Mr. Ballard said CBS executives encouraged its television station operators to find various ways to add commercials to broadcasts. One practice he says was encouraged is known as "covering," in which spots sold by a network or syndicator are quietly pre-empted by local advertisements. Another such practice was the use of a Lexicon machine, which can compress programming and allow the insertion of more commercials. The suit says that in a December 2000 meeting, Anton Guitano, a CBS vice president of finance, said that while the company's official policy on using the machine was "no," the unofficial policy was "yes," as long as "you can get away with it."  In a meeting in January 2001, Mr. Ballard claims, John Severino, then president of CBS's television station unit, told him that KCBS, the company's Los Angeles outlet, had used a Lexicon machine to add commercials to football games. The National Football League imposes strict rules on the amount of advertising that can be shown during its games. Mr. Severino, who is now retired, said he didn't "recall having a conversation with Bill Ballard ever." Mr. Ballard also charged that last year another executive said the CBS-owned stations should use Lexicons during the network's broadcast of that year's Super Bowl. The NFL declined to comment.
