 OPEC Leans Toward Status Quo; Insiders See Ample Supply, Softening of the Oil Market; Rise in Output Still Possible   By Chip Cummins in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Neil King Jr. in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  OPEC insiders point to a number of indicators to buttress their case that the market is softening and doesn't need more crude. Oil's recent price slump tops the list. U.S. benchmark crude has fallen about 10% since reaching a commodity-markets high of $98.18 a barrel Nov. 23, just a few dollars shy of an inflation-adjusted high of $102 a barrel reached in April 1980. Oil fell again yesterday, settling down 99 cents, or 1.1%, at $88.32 a barrel, in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Before the meeting in Abu Dhabi's Emirates Palace hotel, several ministers said they didn't see the sort of heightened demand that would warrant a production increase. Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, told reporters that "all options are open" for the cartel, but the cartel's unofficial leader has argued in recent weeks that the market is already sufficiently supplied.  Algeria's energy minister, Chakib Khelil, said in a weekend interview that it didn't make sense for OPEC "to be talking about increasing or decreasing [production], because we really don't know whether the market really demands it." He argued that global stockpiles could rise markedly in the second quarter of next year if demand slumps by as much as two million barrels a day, as some in OPEC predict.
