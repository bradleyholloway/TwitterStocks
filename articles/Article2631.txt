 A Proposal to Cut Through the Stalemate on Education   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1999  Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and President Clinton rarely meet. On Capitol Hill, some committee chairmen and ranking minority members don't even speak. When there are bipartisan efforts -- HMO reform in the House or some of the appropriation bills -- they are denounced, especially by the establishment right.  Education, for instance, is a top priority for voters, yet the stalemate paralyzes any action. Republicans talk about vouchers and greater accountability, while Democrats talk about attracting more teachers, reducing class size and building more schools. They talk past each other, trying to posture and score points.  Poor kids would be the losers; Democrats and Republicans alike would be the hypocrites. Conservatives refuse to face up to the need for national testing, or the fact that reliance on local property taxes hurts the poor (Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's Republican superintendent of public instruction is a notable exception). They also don't accept that education isn't going to be significantly improved without devoting more resources. As for vouchers, public support is mixed at best; most referendums have failed.
