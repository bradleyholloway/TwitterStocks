 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Weekend Adviser: Armenia, Revisited; Amid Protests, PBS Slates Film and Panel Show; LL Cool J's Starry CD   By Schechner, Sam, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2006  While the documentary itself will be accessible to about 93% of U.S. television households, most major PBS affiliates in the top 20 TV markets aren't airing the panel show. That program will nevertheless reach about 58% of U.S. households through smaller PBS affiliates. A spokeswoman for WGBH in Boston, which is among the channels not airing the panel, says the station felt the documentary "stood on its own." ("The Armenian Genocide" airs in most markets on Monday, 10 p.m. EDT; check local listings)  Ms. [Plum Sykes] is the first -- and least kindly reviewed -- among three women who are publishing novels in the next few months after making best-selling debuts. In January 2005, Curtis Sittenfeld put out the well-received "Prep," a coming-of-age novel, and she is back in May with "The Man of My Dreams," in which her new heroine searches for romance. Meanwhile, Carolyn Parkhurst is facing high expectations with June's "Lost and Found," in which 14 characters compete in a global treasure-hunt reality-TV show. (The popular "Today" show book club selected her 2004 first novel, "The Dogs of Babel," about a linguist who teaches his dog to talk.)  On Tuesday, the hip-hop personality released "Todd Smith," his 12th album (and his third titled with some form of his real name, James Todd Smith). Already, his new single, "Control Myself," which features both a pulsing electronic melody and Jennifer Lopez, has ranked among the top five videos on MTV and hit the top 10 on Billboard's rap-song chart. "Todd Smith" also features tracks with Jamie Foxx and Mary J. Blige, among others.
