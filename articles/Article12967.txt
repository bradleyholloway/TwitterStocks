 Drug-Data Chasm Punishes Small Investors   By Landers, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2003  Robert Consalvo, a Schering-Plough spokesman, said it "would not be correct" to attribute the company's share-price fall over the summer to the information from the private databases. He notes that on July 23 the company released information about poor sales of its hepatitis C drugs as part of a press release and conference call on second- quarter earnings. That release didn't include market-share figures, however, and came after the stock price had already fallen considerably.  Baruch Lev, an accounting professor at New York University's business school, says the drug-sales information "definitely gives an early warning" to big investors. But he is skeptical about stricter regulation, saying it would cause more harm than good by discouraging useful research. "I don't have a good prescription for this," Mr. Lev says.  If unequal access to market-moving drug data is a problem, the solution isn't clear. Database companies spend millions collecting their numbers and can't give them all away free. And don't look for stepped-up drug-industry disclosure.
