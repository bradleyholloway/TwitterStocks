 Ahead of the Tape   By By Dave Kansas, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2003  Economists surveyed by Dow Jones and CNBC anticipate a rise of 8,000 claims to 410,000, keeping the four-week moving average well above the 400,000 mark. The disappointing jobs number continues a string of dismal data that stretches back to February, prompting intensifying discussion about whether the economy is going into another prolonged funk.  Mr. [Mickey Levy] is an optimist, sticking with a GDP growth rate of 3% in the second half of the year. He says investors should look past the ugly employment numbers. "Lots of people focus on the jobs data, but they're backward-looking," Mr. Levy says. "What's forward-looking is oil and what the consumers are doing."
