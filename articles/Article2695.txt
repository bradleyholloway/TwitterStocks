 Biggest Oil-Inventory Drop in Decade Intensifies   By By Steve Liesman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2000  "Without more oil from producers who are limiting output, the first-quarter stock draw will be even larger, increasing the risks of spot outages," said the IEA, formed by the industrialized nations to monitor world oil supply and demand.  The IEA said inventories in industrialized nations fell by 1.7 million barrels daily in the fourth quarter, with the sharpest drop coming in heating oil. The industrialized nations had just 77 days of supply on hand at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 81 days a year ago. World production in January increased by 630,000 barrels daily with Iraq adding most of the new oil. Other OPEC members also boosted output slightly, and the group's compliance with its cutback agreement fell to 76% of the target from 78%. Still, OPEC is producing 9% less oil than the IEA estimates the world will need from the cartel this year.
