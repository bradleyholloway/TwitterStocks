 GSA Head Asks Agency to Investigate His Possible Misuse of Travel Expenses   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1994  Roger Johnson, the head of the General Services Administration and a key player in the Clinton administration's plan to "reinvent government," has asked the agency's inspector general to investigate his own possible misuse of taxpayer-paid travel.  Mr. Johnson, the former chief executive of Western Digital Corp., asked for the probe after The Wall Street Journal obtained his travel vouchers through a Freedom of Information Act request. The vouchers show that Mr. Johnson visited his residence in California, where his wife was living, during five of the nine official trips he took in his first seven months on the job.  In an interview Friday, Mr. Johnson said he intends to refund to the federal government at least some of the $38-a-day expenses he received during the four weekends he spent at his home in Laguna Beach, Calif. Aides also said he would refund some of the $30-a-day expenses he received during the two weekends he visited his other home in Utah in the midst of the official travel.
