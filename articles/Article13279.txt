 breakingviews: Buffett's Batting Average Is Sinking; Some Fans of the 'Oracle' Wonder If He's Lost Edge; Sitting on Billions in Cash   The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2006  The deal may crowd out other issues. For instance, Berkshire's stock price has lagged since the last gathering of shareholders. Berkshire's Class A shares are up 5.2% since last year's meeting compared with the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gain of 13.6%. This underperformance is leading some of Mr. [WARREN BUFFETT]'s fans to quietly wonder whether the sage is losing his edge. (Mr. Buffett didn't respond to requests for comment.)  Berkshire bulls justify the premium on the grounds that Mr. Buffett has a proven track record of picking up dollar bills for 50 cents. In today's booming markets there aren't many such bargains. The value of this option inevitably declines as Mr. Buffett approaches retirement, though it isn't clear when that will happen.  Over 40 years, Berkshire's book value has grown at an average annual rate of 21.5%. That's twice the average return of stocks. This extraordinary performance has earned Mr. Buffett a well-deserved place in the Investor Hall of Fame. But his batting average has declined of late. Now in his final innings, Mr. Buffett's followers hope their hero can slug one more ball out of the park. The Israeli deal may be a good add-on, but it's no home run.
