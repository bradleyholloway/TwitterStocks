 Panel to Vote on Judgeship Nominees After Republicans Complain of Delays   By By Jill Abramson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1988  Facing a backlog of 31 candidates for federal judgeships and Republican complaints about delays, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote today on President Reagan's longest pending nominee. But Republicans probably won't like the outcome.  The committee is likely to reject Bernard Siegan, a law professor who holds controversial libertarian views and whose nomination is opposed by many of the same groups that helped defeat Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.  The committee's rejection of Mr. Siegan, says one aide, will be "a final parting shot" at departing Attorney General Edwin Meese, who has championed the nomination. Mr. Siegan is a professor at the University of San Diego Law School, where Mr. Meese formerly taught.
