 Politics & Economics: Democrats Propose Mortgage Aid; Plan Increases Role Of Fannie, Freddie; Foreclosure Concern   By Damian Paletta and Henry J. Pulizzi, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2007  The government slightly increased the investment portfolio caps for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last month, but the action didn't go as far as Democrats had hoped.  Mr. [Barney Frank] joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in calling on the Bush administration to appoint a senior adviser charged with limiting the record number of homeowners entering the foreclosure process. The Democratic leaders also added their support for the plan to raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's portfolio limits.  "Why are Democrats calling for a 'housing czar' when [Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson] are calling for key legislative reforms and meeting with mortgage counselors, lenders, and servicers to discuss the best way to contact troubled borrowers and educate them on their options?" the White House said in a statement.
