SUFFOLK, Va., Sept. 13â€” Jan Stephenson won her third tournament of the year today, capturing the $125,000 Suffolk L.P.G.A. Classic by three strokes from Sally Little and Janet Alex, who tied for second.  Miss Stephenson had five birdies in a four-under-par round of 68 and covered the 54 holes at the Sleepy Hole Golf Course in 205. It was her eighth victory in a seven-year professional career and was worth $18,750, raising her season earnings to $169,400.  Miss Little set a course record with a 65 and tied Miss Alex, who had 68, at 208. Beth Daniel and Amy Alcott tied for third at 210. Miss Alcott was applying pressure to Miss Stephenson until the par-5 15th hole when her drive hooked out of bounds, forcing her to take a one-stroke penalty. She scored a double-bogey 7 that took her out of contention.  Miss Stephenson, a 29-year-old Australian, said the pressure Miss Alcott placed on her helped her. ''Amy putting so much pressure on me really made me win,'' said Miss Stephenson. ''If she hadn't, I may have relaxed and not noticed the others making the charge.''
