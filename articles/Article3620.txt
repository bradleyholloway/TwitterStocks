 Shop Ahoy! On Target's Holiday Boat   By By Amy Finnerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  Target -- known for the thin profit margins that make it a draw for penny-pinchers -- has started by actually shouldering for the consumer some of the cognitive and emotional burden of gift selection. "Just relax," they seem to imply. The merchandise has been pre-edited, down to 92 items -- as in "kids from one to 92" -- that are presumably Target's idea of what Manhattanites will find irresistible and affordable this year. (There are already several Target stores in the outer boroughs of New York, where thrift is not a new idea and real-estate prices aren't as high, but this is the company's first Manhattan presence.)  Along with our choices, Target has also eliminated the sensations and athleticism of shopping. They have placed prototypes of their mysterious selections in transparent cases, some of them embedded in synthetic iceberg-like structures. Thus, all the "shopping" goes on in one small but airy observation center the size of a large two-bedroom apartment. Assuming customers line up to board the ship between Thanksgiving weekend (the start of Christmas shopping season) and Dec. 1, only 150 of them will be allowed onboard at one time.  Customers can't touch or smell the microfleece pjs or men's suede jacket, but are instructed to take one of the written descriptions provided for each and present it at Merchandise Pickup. Manhattan shoppers, Target seems to have concluded, will be more open-minded than most people about virtual shopping and unorthodox delivery systems. But at first I feel, well, at sea, and outraged that I have schlepped all the way to Chelsea Piers only to be deprived of both the right to handle the goods and the decision-making prerogative of the shopper.
