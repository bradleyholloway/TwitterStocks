 What's Going On in China?; In a Scandal, Shareholders, Not Citizens, Are the First to Know   By Areddy, James T, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2006  Since July, investigators have been looking into possible corruption and malfeasance associated with Shanghai's $1.2 billion pension fund. The probe has brought down the city's top official, Communist Party Secretary Chen Liangyu, who was fired in September, and has ensnared some two dozen less well-known officials. Mr. Chen has been held by Chinese authorities since his dismissal and hasn't made any public comment.  Shanghai Electric listed in Hong Kong, for instance, closed yesterday at 2.79 Hong Kong dollars (36 U.S. cents), compared with HK$2.85 before the company told investors on Aug. 8 to expect an important announcement. The company later confirmed an executive was under investigation for corruption but that it was unrelated to the business. It took more than a week for it to announce more details. Shares in its Shanghai-listed unit, Shanghai Mechanical & Electrical Industry, closed at 7.40 yuan(94 U.S. cents), up from 6.76 yuan before the scandal broke.  -- July 24 Fuxi Investment -- Aug. 8 Shanghai Electric Group -- Aug. 14 Shanghai Mechanical & Electrical Industry -- Sept. 7 Shanghai New Huangpu Property -- Oct. 18 Hua An Fund Management -- Oct. 30 Shanghai Haixin Group -- Nov. 7 Huawen Media Investment; New Huangpu Real Estate
