 Four Major Publishers Enter Bidding War For Tribune's Times Mirror Magazines   By By Matthew Rose and Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  Times Mirror's magazine unit, which publishes titles such as Golf, Popular Science and Field & Stream, was put up for sale in June by Tribune Co., which acquired Times Mirror earlier in the year.  Time Warner's Time Inc. publishing unit wants Times Mirror's magazines to complement its Sports Illustrated franchise. New York Times, which already owns Golf Digest and a number of other golf-related titles, is bidding to protect its powerful presence in that arena.  For American Media, publisher of the tabloid National Enquirer, an acquisition would go some way towards the company's goal of building a major magazine company. Emap, which entered the U.S. market through its acquisition of Petersen Cos. in 1998, may be hard pressed to top the other bids.
