 GOP governors, lawmakers are split on welfare, as Democrats find unity   By Georges, Christopher; Milbank, Dana, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1997  In 1997, it is the Democrats who are unified on welfare, while Republicans are squabbling among themselves. Republican governors and members of Congress bickered over the weekend of Feb 1 as to whether, and in what ways, to revamp the 1996 welfare bill. Some GOP governors, for example, wanted to restore federal funds for legal immigrants. In addition, congressional Republicans are split over President Clinton's effort to help food-stamp recipients who face a cutoff.
