 EchoStar-Hughes Deal Comes Under Fire   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2002  The Hughes and EchoStar executives insisted that the $25 billion deal -- which would combine EchoStar's Dish Network with Hughes's DirecTV unit to form a satellite-television powerhouse with nearly 17 million customers -- would allow the merged company to become a viable competitor to the cable industry by giving it enough spectrum to offer local television stations and high-speed Internet across the country.  "These are things that we simply could not do on our own," said EchoStar Chief Executive Charlie Ergen. "The merger of EchoStar and Hughes will promote competition, provide a greater choice of services and provide much needed benefits for all American consumers."  Under sharp questioning from Mr. [Herb Kohl], Mr. Ergen and his counterpart from Hughes, Eddy Hartenstein, said they would be willing to sign a legally binding consent decree with the government, designed to protect consumers and ensure that the merged company lives up to its vow to challenge the cable industry.
