 Private Properties   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2001  A PIECE OF HOLLYWOOD history is on the market in Westport, Conn. The Old Hatchery, a circa 1928 stone-and-timber residence that's housed the likes of Helen Hayes, Lillian Gish, Groucho Marx, Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli, is for sale with an asking price of $2.795 million. The actors stayed there while performing at the Westport Country Playhouse, a popular regional venue. The seller, a private investor, paid $675,000 for the home in a 1992 distress sale. He gutted the house and spent about $1 million on upgrades, completing renovations in 1999. The Old Hatchery (the name comes from the spring-fed lily pond it overlooks) is on 1.4 acres and has 12 rooms, including three bedrooms. It has massive front doors that came from a Belgian castle but also spent time on a home that belonged to Broadway composer Richard Rodgers (one-half of Rodgers & Hammerstein). There's also a one-bedroom guest cottage with a wood-burning stove. The listing agent is Gun Sharp, of Coldwell Banker in Stamford. Up the road in Washington, Conn., real-estate agent Patricia Cliff of New York's Corcoran Group has sold her home on Lake Waramaug for $1.2 million. The Adirondack-style home, built in 1890, has lake views and sits on a 21-acre parcel right next to a 1,000-acre land trust. It was on the market for $1.25 million. The buyer is listed as a trust. Ms. Cliff and her husband, Karl von Frieling, a marine architect, bought the property in 1991 for $340,000 and spent $750,000 renovating it.
