 CBS's Jay Kriegel, A Senior Official, To Leave Company   By By Elizabeth Jensen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1993  Mr. Kriegel's departure had been rumored following the end of a frustrating and embarrassing episode for CBS in October, when it failed to reach an agreement with cable systems to compensate it for the use of CBS broadcast signals.  Mr. Kriegel was one of the key architects of the federal cable legislation allowing stations to be paid for use of their programming. While ABC and NBC used the law to launch new cable channels, CBS first insisted on cash for its signals, which the cable systems refused to pay, and then tried to find a concept for a cable channel, which cable systems refused to carry.
