 Year-End Review of Markets and Finance: Tax Law Debates Dominated Year's Activity in Municipal Bonds   By By Alexandra Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1987  The tax legislation under debate in Washington created an atmosphere of "paralyzing uncertainty" for bond issuers and buyers, according to Brian Carty, executive director of the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency. When the tax bill was finally signed into law, he says, "It was like going to bed speaking French and waking up speaking Spanish."  Throughout much of the year, the pace of issuing and trading seesawed with each new proposal out of Washington, and trading nearly came to a halt March 19, when Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood suggested a retroactive tax on municipals -- a plan that was later defeated by other committee members.  A fierce lobbying effort mounted by the municipal bond industry and state and local governments was largely unsuccessful. The fact that "Wall Street has gone to Washington frequently to try to protect its own special interests" reduced the effectiveness of the lobbying effort, which was already somewhat fragmented, says Peter Gordon, president of tax-free funds for T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore.
