 Blue Chips Drop To Lowest Level Since October   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2003  The blue chips fell 55.88 points, or 0.70%, to 7929.30, down 5% this year. It was their third consecutive decline and the lowest close since Oct. 14. Stocks sagged just before the end of regular trading hours on news that President Bush was going to speak about the war, but then recovered on reports that he would welcome a U.N. resolution in support of military action.  On top of the war jitters, he noted, the Labor Department announced that U.S. labor productivity fell unexpectedly and labor costs rose in the fourth quarter. It was the worst productivity news in a year, and appeared to confirm the economy's weakness.  Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 1.31%, or 1.34 points, to 100.86.
