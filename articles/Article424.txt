 Winter Olympics -- Here & There: Curling Rocks My World   By McKee, Steve, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2006  Pete Fenson, U.S. curling skip and pizza-parlor owner in Minnesota, looked like a young Al Pacino. Curling analyst Don Duguid sounded like Walter Cronkite, bringing unexpected gravitas to the proceedings. In the third of 10 ends, "Pizza Pete" took out two Brit stones, scoring three for the Yanks. Americans 4, Brits 1.  Back at curling: Britian's David Murdoch took out two U.S. rocks, scoring three. U.S. 6, G.B. 5; seventh end.  In the 10th and final end, the U.S. leading 7-6, Mr. Fenson once more took the hammer and nailed it to the house, the stone excrutiatingly making its way down the sheet. U.S. 8, G.B. 6. Game, set, ice. The U.S. team was gracious in victory, the Brits stiff- upper-lipped in defeat. We see Butch Rojeski, father of U.S. vice-skip Shawn, in the stands, visibly shaken.
