 Love & Money: A Tale of Love Lost -- and Found   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2007  It's an odd question, I know. But it is, nevertheless, a question I often hear from readers. I'm even told that the reporters and editors at one of the newspapers where my column runs have a pool going on when we'll finally split. (To that newsroom: Can I put $100 on never?)  As is obvious, we never followed through on the paperwork. This weekend, in fact, we are celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary. And based on how close we've grown in the past seven years, I have no doubt we'll be together for the duration.  They're struggling with a relationship, or what promotions to pursue. They're yearning for a different lifestyle, angry, looking to escape the mind-numbing rut they are in. And they can't see what they really have. Divorce is the quick fix.
