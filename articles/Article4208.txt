 China Visit Gives Weinberger Platform For Hard-Line Stance Toward Soviets   By By Tim Carrington, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1986  U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has been hammering home a message to his Chinese hosts: You can't trust what the Soviets say.

Mr. Weinberger's sharpest criticisms came in a session with Chinese defense officials in which he warned that the Soviets were hatching a "ruse" to create the false appearance of reducing troops in Afghanistan.
