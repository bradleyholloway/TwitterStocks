 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1999  Q. This may sound stupid, but is there any kind of screen that would allow me to use my laptop outdoors? I live by the ocean and would love to use my laptop outside on the deck or at breakfast/lunch/dinner at the local restaurant.  A.I'm not sure whether to envy your seaside lifestyle, or pity you for wanting to work on a laptop outdoors when you could be soaking up the atmosphere. Anyway, you're right that laptop screens work poorly outdoors. And, since all laptop makers use only a relative handful of screen suppliers, I don't know of any that have the inherent brightness and contrast to look great in sunlight. The best suggestion I can make is to buy a hood or shade that attaches to the laptop to block out glare and make the screen readable. One example of this is a $20 item called Glare Stopper, which is sold online by a company called Mobile Outfitters, at www.mobilegear.com, and possibly by others. If you buy one, however, do me a favor: turn off the laptop once in a while and enjoy the ocean.
