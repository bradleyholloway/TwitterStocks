 GM's Bid for Hughes Isn't Expected to Launch Similar Takeovers, or Rocket Aerospace Prices   By By Dean Rotbart and Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1985  General Motors' successful bid for Hughes Aircraft isn't likely to launch other acquisitions of major aerospace and defense concerns, according to many analysts and money managers.  Although some aerospace concerns such as Raytheon share characteristics with Hughes -- both, for example, are big cash generators -- analysts note that the similarities only go so far. Hughes, after all, sought a buyer, while many of the publicly held aerospace outfits recently have enacted anti-takeover measures.  Many analysts believe big aerospace companies such as Raytheon, General Dynamics, TRW, Grumman and Northrop are just as likely, if not more likely, to be suitors rather than targets in future takeovers. In the meantime, many analysts believe the best chance for further advances in aerospace stock prices lies in new or accelerated stock repurchase programs.
