 Heard on the street: As United Auto Group's stock rolls downhill, Marshall Cogan's steering is put to the test   By Sandler, Linda, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1996  Only a couple weeks after an IPO, shares of United Auto Group have gone flat. Now the pressure is on Marshall Cogan, United Group's vice chairman and the real power behind the auto dealership enterprise with a 19% stake, to prove he can prosper in the competitive and faddish business. United Auto shares, which initially traded as high as 35 1/4 on Oct 23, 1996, closed at 29 1/2 in NYSE trading on Nov 11.
