 Incomes in U.S. Beat Inflation During '90s Boom   By By Kelly K. Spors, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2002  The median U.S. household income rose almost 8% faster than inflation during the booming 1990s, reaching $41,994 by 1999, according to newly released census data.  The biggest gains in overall economic growth were in outlying suburbs of large U.S. cities such as Denver, Atlanta and areas of northern California, the AP reported. Silicon Valley-area Santa Clara County had the largest job growth in the 1990s, due largely to the tech boom, followed by Los Angeles and Manhattan in New York City.
