 Charter Communications Posts Loss, Revenue Gain   By Grant, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  Since taking over, Mr. May has increased Charter's focus on customer service, doing such things as using more company employees and fewer vendors to handle service issues. He also has decreased Charter's use of discounting and promotions to add video subscribers.  These changes resulted in an increase in average monthly revenue per video subscriber in the first quarter to $37.80 from $37.52 in the 2004 fourth quarter. But the added costs of improving customer service helped to decrease Charter's cash-flow margin to 37% from 38% in the first quarter. Charter defines cash flow as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate noncash and nonrecurring items.
