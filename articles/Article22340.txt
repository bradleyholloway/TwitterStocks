 Opposition Rises Against Nominee For Civil-Rights Job   By By Eva M. Rodriguez, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1997  Bill Lann Lee, who would be the first Asian-American to hold the civil-rights job, appears to lack the 10 committee votes needed to forward his name for final approval. He is supported by the committee's eight Democrats, but needs votes of at least two Republicans. Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) and Republican committee members Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania are said to be undecided.  The pressure on Senate Republicans to block Mr. Lee's nomination is likely to mount this week. Today, members of the U.S. Pan-Asian American Chamber of Commerce, a trade organization that represents Asian-American business interests, are scheduled to meet Sen. Hatch and other committee members to voice their opposition. And at least 10 Republicans from California's House delegation are expected to send a letter criticizing his civil-rights record to Sen. Hatch, according to people close to the matter.
