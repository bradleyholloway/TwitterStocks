 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Robert Keatley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1997  Following weak Democratic support in a major Ways and Means Committee vote, the White House warns legislators to shape up or face the line-item veto. As new appropriation bills land on Clinton's desk, he could block pet spending of opponents and spare that of supporters. Stunned by last week's veto of 38 pork projects, Democrats listen.  Clinton is upset by organized labor's hardball opposition to fast-track. He tells congressmen in private meetings that "we can't let one interest group hold our party hostage." His heavy-hitters now call the shots. Staff chief Bowles heads daily progress meetings, legislative boss Hilley sets political strategy. So-called fast-track czar Berman, who left a $1 million-a-year job to help, is shoved gently from center stage to deal with businessmen and spin the media.  Republicans say Vito Fossella can win the office that Molinari and her father have held since 1980. He links himself to popular New York Mayor Giuliani. Fossella calls Democrat Eric Vitaliano a tax-raising liberal. Will the race foretell the 1998 House future? "If we win, sure," says GOP strategist Ed Brookover.
