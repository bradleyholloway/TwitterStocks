 Ask Dow Jones / By Tom Herman   By ghtpoint Will Benefit, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  Q: Suppose an American lives abroad and has income generated only from non-U.S. companies. Is he or she required to file a U.S. tax return, and is that person still subject to U.S. income taxes?  A: If you're an American citizen, your world-wide income generally is subject to U.S. taxes, no matter where you live or work. You're also subject to the same tax-filing rules that apply to Americans living in the U.S. Many Americans living and working abroad, however, wind up owing little or no U.S. income tax because a certain amount of pay may be excluded.
