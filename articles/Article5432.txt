 Mercedes Attempts to Change Its Image As It Nears Rollout of Smaller A-Class   By By Brandon Mitchener, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1996  STUTTGART, Germany -- Its smallest cars yet won't hit the streets for a year, but Mercedes-Benz AG is in high gear with a public-relations drive for them. Mercedes is the first to admit the cars need it.  At 11.9 feet long, the new A-class isn't what you normally think of when you think of a Mercedes. Four inches shorter than a Volkswagen Polo, the new "mini-Mercedes" is a full 35.2 inches shorter than the next largest Mercedes, the C-class. It even looks more like a VW Golf than a Mercedes, except for the star in front.  Amid so much change, Mercedes, the main breadwinner for parent Daimler-Benz AG, is pulling out all the stops to persuade people that the Mercedes star still stands for something special. Starting in Italy, it will test a new approach to metropolitan sales with the A-class by taking its case to the people. Shoppers in some 20 downtown outlets will be able to see the cars and talk with a salesman without having to trek to a big dealer.
