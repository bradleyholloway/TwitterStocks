 Blame America First   By Rademaker, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2007  Two groups with diametrically opposed agendas have for years argued that the likes of Iran and North Korea will not be deterred in their quest for nuclear weapons so long as the U.S. and the other nuclear powers are ignoring their obligation under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to give up their nuclear arsenals. Apologists for the proliferators, who care not at all about nuclear disarmament, and arms control activists, to whom there is no higher priority than nuclear disarmament, have long agreed about this and little else.  Those who argue that the U.S. has disregarded its nuclear disarmament obligations under the NPT are quick to make categorical assertions about the treaty's requirements, but almost never quote the pertinent language of the NPT, for the simple reason that it provides no support for their claims. The key provision, Article VI of the treaty, consists of only one sentence: "Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control."  Few serious students of nuclear strategy believe that the stockpiles of the nuclear weapon states can be reduced to zero in the foreseeable future. Fortunately our reliance on nuclear weapons has been declining, and the U.S. should continue to eliminate unnecessary nuclear weapons based on considered judgments about our national security requirements. But we should not base such decisions about our nuclear force structure on wishful thinking that we can earn the goodwill of nuclear proliferators and other critics whose agendas are advanced by blaming America for nuclear proliferation.
