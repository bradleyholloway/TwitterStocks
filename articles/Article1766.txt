 Racial Divide: A Slice of Louisiana Is Site of Next Battle Over Minority Districts --- Bizarre Shape Assures Blacks Get Congressional Seat; Will It Hold Up in Court? --- Cleo Fields Makes Converts   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and James M. Perry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1993  The 30-year-old Mr. Fields, Louisiana's second black congressman since Reconstruction, represents a district that looks as if it was designed by Johnny Appleseed. It begins life north of Shreveport on the Arkansas border, wanders east all the way to the Mississippi River and then heads south, helter-skelter, toward the Gulf of Mexico. At some points, it is only 80 feet wide.  There is no evidence that either national party has played any role in filing the Louisiana suit. National Democrats defend minority districts; national Republican leaders aren't sure they really want to revisit the painful redistricting process in a significant way. This is a local operation, perhaps the first of many to follow. The plaintiffs are Ray Hays, a white member of the state's Democratic Central Committee; Edward Adams, a black city councilman in Grambling; Susan Singleton, an Asian-American who processes claims at Lincoln General Hospital in Monroe; and Gary Stokley, a white sociology professor at Louisiana Tech.  Mr. Hays argues that the redistricting plan wasn't necessary because crossover voting by whites for black candidates was already occurring. (Louisiana's other black congressman, William Jefferson, from New Orleans, was elected in 1990; the state's other five members of Congress are white.) Indeed, Mr. Hays contends that the creation of a "super-black" district might actually be harmful to race relations in the long run.
