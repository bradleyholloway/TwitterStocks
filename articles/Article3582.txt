 Private-Equity Firms in U.S. Raise Funds at a Record Pace   By Tracy, Tennille, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  Fund raising was up 43% from the $67.5 billion collected by 138 funds a year earlier, surpassing any first-half period tracked by Private Equity Analyst. Private Equity Analyst is a newsletter owned by Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal.  The pace is due to a handful of the most respected and biggest buyout firms. A half-dozen buyout firms were responsible for 61% of buyout fund-raising and 40% of total private-equity fund-raising, as they set up funds of $10 billion to $15 billion, by far the biggest private-equity funds yet raised.
