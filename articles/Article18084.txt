 Trading in Stock Of Genentech Is Focus of Inquiry --- SEC Investigating Possible Leak of Inside Data Prior To Merger With Roche   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1990  In a move related to the merger, Genentech said its top six officers were granted "golden parachute" agreements awarding each a sum totaling five times their annual pay if they lose their jobs in the merger. Mr. Raab's severance package, should he leave Genentech, would equal $6.6 million. His merger-related stock options, valued at $7.9 million, would further enhance his windfall. The disclosures come at a time when Genentech has said it will assume more of the merger-related costs than previously thought.  Genentech released the information as part of a detailed merger plan, contained in a proxy statement filed with the SEC and released to shareholders yesterday. The merger pact, which also has been challenged by shareholder class action lawsuits, must be approved by Genentech shareholders at a meeting to be held on June 8. As reported, the plan would leave Roche of Basel, Switzerland, holding 60% of Genentech, with the option to acquire the remaining shares.  The SEC investigation, according to Genentech, has been under way since February. Mrs. Raab learned of the impending merger from her husband before it was made public Feb. 2, and is believed to have told a member of her family about it, Genentech said in the proxy. That communication led to stock trades by persons other than Mrs. Raab, who weren't identified but who are apparently the probe's main targets, Genentech indicated.
