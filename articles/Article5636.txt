 Money Manager, Indicating Bearishness, Makes Big Trades in AT&T, Boeing, Citicorp Options   By By Steven M. Sears, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1998  A major money manager, indicating a nascent bearishness and an attempt to recoup recent losses in long stock positions, made several large option trades in AT&T, Boeing and Citicorp.  The manager, whose identity couldn't be learned, bought and sold thousands of options as he covered short options positions and then sold options that expire in 2000. (Short covering is the purchase of a security to replace securities previously borrowed for a short sale.)
