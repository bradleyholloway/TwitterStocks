 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2006  [Paul Auster]'S "The Brooklyn Follies" begins in the late 1990s when his middle-aged hero, Nathan Glass, sets out to find "a quiet place to die." Actually, "unlikely hero" is closer to the mark, for Nathan is a lovably shambling figure, a failure at fatherhood, marriage and life. His daughter won't speak to him. His ex-wife hates him with the fire of a thousand suns. His only friends are his nephew Tom -- a grad student turned cabbie -- and Harry, an art forger, ex-con and rare- books dealer who is gayer than a tap-dancing dragon on Chinese New Year's.  Mr. Auster has been praised for the clarity of his writing. But in "The Brooklyn Follies," he achieves such clarity by steeping his prose in familiar tropes and phrases. There are "big-boned peasant bodies," "flickers of desire," "jovial spirits," "hushed voices," "heavy hearts" and "futile attempts." This parade of cliche may be in keeping with Nathan's voice, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant for the reader.
