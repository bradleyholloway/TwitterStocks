 Why No. 3 Wendy's Finds Vanilla So Exciting   By Adamy, Janet, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2007  Now, struggling to connect with younger diners, [Wendy]'s is revamping the Frosty, along with the rest of its menu. Inspired by the success of Starbucks Corp.'s Frappuccinos, Wendy's is adding new flavors of Frosty that come with wide straws and bubble-shaped tops, and tinkering with a coffee-flavored Frosty in its test kitchen at headquarters here. The chain also is taking an ambitious stab at relaunching a breakfast menu.  Wendy's executives say they're in the early stages of a turnaround akin to the resurgence that McDonald's Corp. started in 2003 when it stopped building more restaurants and began improving existing locations. But besides facing stiff competition from the reinvigorated McDonald's, Wendy's will have to overcome some self-inflicted wounds. Part of the company's problem is that it has catered to the same generation of customers who began visiting Wendy's after its first location opened in 1969.  Since Wendy's launched the vanilla Frosty in July, Frosty sales have increased 25%, Mr. [Ian Rowden] says. Vanilla now accounts for about 40% of Frosty orders. A Wendy's spokesman said the company doesn't track whether that item is getting repeat purchases from customers but said vanilla Frosty sales have been consistent.
