 Business and Finance [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1986  Congress reacted coolly to Reagan's fiscal 1987 budget, setting the stage for a renewed battle over spending and taxes. The $994 billion package, sent to Congress yesterday, calls for $38.2 billion in deficit cuts and $6.3 billion in extra revenue, mainly from higher fees.  Many lawmakers hope to use the Gramm-Rudman deficit law to force Reagan to slow his defense buildup and raise taxes. But the law, with its automatic cuts, could make Congress less eager to reach a compromise.  Oil prices rebounded on speculation OPEC's president would meet with Britain and Norway's oil ministers. The rumor was denied, but spot and futures markets surged on hopes non-OPEC producers might soften their stance on stabilizing prices.
