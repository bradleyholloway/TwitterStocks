 Georgia Unrest Unites 2 Powers By The Black Sea; U.S., Russia Help to Avert Conflict in Rebel Province; Strongman Is Ushered Out   By Hugh Pope in Istanbul and Guy Chazan in Moscow, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2004  The U.S. also has soothed Russian fears of losing influence in Georgia by keeping a promise that its training of the Georgian army remain a minimal, rotating presence. Although Kremlin hard-liners will see betrayal in Russia's abandonment of Mr. [Abashidze], Russia believes it has enhanced its standing in Georgia and in the West by helping to engineer his exit. "Russia demonstrated wisdom and statesmanship," said Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus expert with the Carnegie Institute in Moscow.  Still, persuading Russia to end its support for Mr. Abashidze may prove to be the easy part. Some diplomats believe that in return for its cooperation, Russia won assurances from the U.S. that it would persuade Mr. [Mikhail Saakashvili] to soft-pedal his declared policy of reasserting control over two other Russian-backed breakaway provinces of Georgia: South Ossetia and Abkhazia. These two situations are harder to resolve because they are on the Russian border and because, unlike Adzharia, their populations aren't ethnically Georgian and are hostile to Mr. Saakashvili.
