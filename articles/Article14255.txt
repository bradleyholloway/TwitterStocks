 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): New Game in Africa   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1986  Some of our more cynical friends might call the words "serious United Nations session" an oxymoron, a phrase that combines contradictory thoughts. But the U.N. has just concluded a truly serious special session on the problems of Africa. The mood change is owed importantly to more self-assured U.S. leadership.  Third World delegates to the special session laid aside, for the most part, their defiant anti-colonial rhetoric. Gone as well was goody-goody First World soft soap. The Communists, short on both cash and ideas, were mainly bystanders. A new realism prevailed.  Africans agreed in a draft report that they must take responsibility for their own development, which is another way of saying that there are no longer any illusions about vast wealth transfers from the industrial world. The document stressed the importance of rebuilding agriculture, which has suffered badly from the stranglehold of price controls and hapless central planning. Most significant of all was a commitment from Africans to rely more on the private sector.
