 Boehringer, Axios Begin to Distribute No-Cost AIDS Drug   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2001  Until this summer, Boehringer-Ingelheim was frustrated that few countries or health programs took advantage of the offer. Under a plan developed this year by Axios International, a Dublin health-consulting firm, the company has set up an application-and-review process to organize the distribution of the supply of the drugs. Boehringer-Ingelheim officials said the new program addresses several major stumbling blocks that have impeded access to Viramune, as well as to other HIV drugs whose costs have dropped sharply in the past year.  John Wecker, Boehringer-Ingelheim's HIV coordinator, said Boehringer-Ingelheim's offer of drugs at no cost is unlimited, and the only restriction is that providers make use of the Axios application process.
