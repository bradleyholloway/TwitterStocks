 Good Greifeld! Nasdaq CEO's Bet Is Paying Off; Cost-Cutting Helps the Stock But Strategy Still Faces Test; Backyard Collection of Turtles   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2006  In his spare time, Mr. [Bob Greifeld], in perhaps an odd choice for someone in the business of speedy trading, is a collector of turtles, which are kept in the yard behind his New Jersey house. A trademark touch: he occasionally wears turtle cufflinks. He has also run four marathons. "He's fiercely competitive," says Mike Bingle, a managing director at Silver Lake Partners, a major Nasdaq investor, "but it's not as well known that he's a world-class technologist."  Mr. Greifeld says he's confident that the stock-trading business has room to grow, but he doesn't rule out getting into new businesses. In recent months, Mr. Greifeld has looked at possibly buying a currency- trading system and the London Stock Exchange PLC. Options exchanges also "are in the sphere of things we'd consider," he says. For the moment, he says Nasdaq is content with its less flashy plan to send options orders to other exchanges starting later this year.  In 1991, he left for Automated Securities Clearing, a small business specializing in software for Wall Street trading desks. The company grew and was later sold to Sungard Data Systems Inc., where Mr. Greifeld served as executive vice president and oversaw divisions with about 3,000 employees, including an electronic-trading firm that competed with Nasdaq. In 2003, Mr. Greifeld told Sungard's president, Cristobal Conde, that a headhunter had approached him about the top post at Nasdaq. "This was his dream job, so I knew if he got the job," he'd take it, Mr. Conde says.
