 Plots & Ploys   By Alex Frangos and Jennifer S. Forsyth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2007  The sale follows a blockbuster deal last week in which Broadway Real Estate Partners LLC bought 10 buildings -- including Boston's tallest, the John Hancock Tower, as well as Citigroup Center in Los Angeles -- from Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners LLC. Broadway said the price was more than $3.3 billion but declined to elaborate. The transaction was reported earlier by the Boston Globe. Broadway turned around and sold three smaller buildings, including two that were part of the Hancock complex, to Manulife Financial Corp. for $454 million.  Related is joining with WestPac, a San Luis Obispo, Calif., developer, to purchase and build a multibillion dollar set of housing, hotels and retail at Snowmass Base Village, part of the Aspen area, according to Jeff Blau, Related's president, and Patrick Smith, Westpac's chief executive. The two struck a tentative deal over the holidays to purchase the already approved development sites from closely held Aspen Skiing Co. and Intrawest. WestPac has separately acquired several other properties in the area.
