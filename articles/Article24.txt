IT is difficult to travel abroad without picking up an idea or two about cooking. Thinking of that, I am reminded that I am often asked whether I can reproduce almost any dish sampled without asking the ingredients and the technique for preparing it.  My answer is yes provided the dish is anything but Indian or Chinese, and that because of complexity of preparation and ingredients that might be unfamiliar (asafetida, to choose something widely used in Indian cookery).  At a handsome, open-air waterside restaurant on Glitter Beach in Barbados, the chef was persuaded to prepare dishes that were not on his menu, including sauteed flying fish and chicken Bajan style, Bajan being a casual term for things Barbadian.  The guests were fascinated by the preparation of the chicken, which actually was simplicity itself. One of them remarked that it was better than Kentucky-style fried chicken, and in a sense it was. That guest mistakenly assumed that the chicken had been deep-fried Southern style, but it had been baked and it was as crisp and crusty as the fare she had in mind.  A small distinguishing characteristic of the dish - it is characteristic of a lot of Bajan foods - was its spiciness, which presumably came from hot ground pepper.  You simply rub the chicken pieces with a little oil, in flour seasoned with a touch of hot red pepper flakes and oregano, and with salt and pepper, and bake for about 40 minutes without turning. The chicken on which we dined was partly boned, as it is best; the recipe includes instructions for this.  Serve with zucchini with cherry tomatoes and garlic and, if desired, a tossed green salad. Baked Chicken Bajan Style 1 chicken, 3 pounds, cut into serving pieces Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/2 teaspoon oregano 2 tablespoons peanut, vegetable or corn oil 3/4 cup flour 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes.  1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. 2. To prepare this dish properly, partly bone chicken, leaving legs and thighs attached. Bone thighs first by place them skin side down on a flat surface. Using small paring or boning knife, scrape meat away from each bone. Sever bone to separate it from leg bone. To bone legs, scrape around the bone almost but not down to the end. Using sharp, heavy knife, cut off major part of bone, leaving about one inch at end. Chop off very bottom of each leg bone.  3. Leave breasts and main wing bones attached. Cut off and discard tip of each wing. Cut off and set aside second wing joints. Bone breasts but leave skin intact. Do not remove main wing bone. Use back bone for soup or discard.  4. Sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper and half of oregano. 5. Put oil in baking dish large enough to hold chicken in one layer when it is added. Add chicken and rub it in oil. 6. Blend flour with remaining oregano, paprika, hot red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. 7. Dredge each piece of chicken on all sides in flour mixture. Shake off excess. 8. Return chicken pieces skin side up to baking dish. 9. Place chicken in oven and bake 40 minutes without turning. Yield: 4 servings. Zucchini and Cherry Tomatoes With Garlic 2 firm, unblemished zucchini, about 3/4 pound. 3 tablespoons olive oil Salt to taste, if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 2 large cloves garlic, unpeeled 16 cherry tomatoes.  1. Trim ends from zucchini. Quarter lengthwise and cut each quarter into half-inch lengths. There should be about three and a half cups. 2. Heat oil and when it is hot add zucchini. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add garlic and cook, shaking skillet and stirring until zucchini starts to brown, about 5 minutes.  3. Add tomatoes and continue to cook, stirring gently so tomatoes cook evenly without breaking skin. Cook about two minutes, just until tomatoes are heated. Do not overcook or tomatoes will break. Remove garlic and serve hot.  Yield: 4 servings.
