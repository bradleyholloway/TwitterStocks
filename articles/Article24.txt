 Newspaper Stocks Again Start to Draw Notice As Bulls Count on Economy to Help Ad Linage   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1986  The stocks were relatively stagnant during the second half of 1985, when the market was climbing, but they still aren't cheap. Some newspaper stocks declined yesterday, after big gains on Friday. There were unconfirmed rumors that a Wall Street analyst thought the stocks were overpriced.  As a group, says Kidder Peabody's Joseph Fuchs, newspaper stocks carry P/Es about 40% higher than the average stock in Standard & Poor's 500 index. But a few months ago, the premium was about 66%, the analyst says. Although consistently bullish on Gannett, last week he upgraded his buy recommendations on New York Times and Knight-Ridder. They stand to benefit most from a pickup in urban advertising, he says. He also likes Tribune and Times Mirror.  Smaller markets still seem sluggish, Mr. Thorp says. January linage rose 3.4% at Gannett, which owns the national USA Today as well as papers in smaller markets. But linage rose only 1% at Media General, which has papers in Richmond, Va.; Tampa, Fla.; and Winston-Salem, N.C., Mr. Thorp notes. Some national business advertising also is weak. January linage fell 3% at The Wall Street Journal, owned by Dow Jones.
