TO THE HOME SECTION: I'd like to offer another view on childbearing versus career in the over-30 female (''Women Reconsider Childbearing Over 30,'' Feb. 25).  I was born in 1933 and after seven years of marriage and a career had my first child at the cusp of 30 on the advice of my gynecologist, who, as an expert in fertility, told me that one's fertility declines dramatically after 30.  At the age of 33 I had my second and last child.  I found my first-born son so exciting, interesting and absorbing that I spontaneously decided not to return to my career since nothing could possibly be so interesting as my son. I felt equally enthralled with my second son. So I stayed home for six years. When the youngest entered nursery school, I started my own business as an artist's and photographer's representative.  I would like to offer a very positive case for making the career climb in your late 30's and 40's, when you know exactly who you are. Had I made the career climb in my 30's I would have probably remained a ''company woman'' and probably be suffering from career burnout at this point.  Those six years home with my children gave me the courage and perspective to do something in my 40's that I didn't have the courage to do in my 30's. There is no special decade for career, and those bright, motivated women who to make it will do so no matter what age they have their children. The many women of my generation who did what I did all verify that a career delayed is sometimes a career strengthened. BARBARA GORDON Manhattan
