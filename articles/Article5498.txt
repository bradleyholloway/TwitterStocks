 Decision Nears On a Nominee For High Court --- Babbitt Is Still in Running But Breyer Is Getting White House Attention   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Paul M. Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1993  President Clinton plans to put the finishing touches on his tortuous search for a Supreme Court justice by meeting with Stephen Breyer, the chief judge of the federal appeals court in Boston.  To be sure, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is still in the running, and White House aides could only guess whom Mr. Clinton would pick. They asserted only one thing firmly: A decision, which has been nearly three months in the making, is finally imminent.  But if Mr. Clinton does choose Judge Breyer, there will be some bruised feelings. Supporters of Mr. Babbitt are enraged over the way Mr. Clinton exposed the highly respected former governor of Arizona to unflattering commentary in the press, and then didn't publicly defend him and may even pass him over for the nomination.
