 Wall Street Warily Watches Main Street   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  "Specialty retailers are particularly sensitive to existing-home activity," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. The retailers' stocks move in the same direction as existing-home sales 68% of the time, according to this firm's data, either because sales are directly related to home-sale activity or because they are affected by people's perception of their wealth.  One stock to be wary of is Sony (which trades in the U.S. as SNE). In November, the big Japanese entertainment and electronics company is planning to unveil its PlayStation 3 videogame console, a key driver of the company's earnings. But the machine will carry a price tag of between $499 and $599, well above the price of competing consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's Wii. The first batch of PS3 consoles likely will sell out, as hard-core gamers scoop up the machines, but the price could limit broader interest, especially if U.S. economic growth slows.  Meanwhile, Britain's WPP Group (WPPGY in the U.S.), the world's second-largest advertising agency, has expanded into 104 countries and has a growing presence in emerging nations such as India and China. WPP now receives about 20% of its revenues from outside the U.S. and Europe, which should help the company if those economies slow.
