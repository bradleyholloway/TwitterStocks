 California Says County Covered Up Cold War Contaminant   By By Peter Waldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2002  Data are still emerging on exactly how much of a public-health threat perchlorate contamination poses. But in laboratory tests on animals, as well as in at least two epidemiological studies of people, the EPA has found a link between perchlorate and thyroid impairment, posing a severe risk to normal development. High levels of perchlorate have been found in the Colorado River in Nevada, Arizona and California, as well as in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Alabama and Cape Cod in Massachusetts, among other places, the EPA says.  In 1997, when perchlorate started showing up in groundwater at other defense sites around the country, it was discovered at and adjacent to the San Bernardino landfill, leading to suspicions that the dump was the source. Two years later, without any concerted investigation and cleanup effort for perchlorate, the county buried nearly the entire site under as much as 100 feet of dirt, dug out of a giant hole nearby to expand the landfill operations. Since the soil was added, perchlorate levels have spiked much higher in nearby wells.  Buried under the dirt are the sites of more than a dozen old explosive bunkers and other munitions operations, including a hazardous-waste facility once operated by a defunct company called Broco Inc. On Monday, California's Department of Toxic Substances Control, a member of the area's perchlorate task force, ordered San Bernardino County to devise a "closure plan" for the buried Broco site within 60 days. The Broco plot, the agency said, was never properly cleaned.
