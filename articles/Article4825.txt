 TV Preview: Prostitution, Murder and Music   By By Martha Bayles, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1987  Sunday, Nov. 15, 9-11 p.m. EST, on CBS: "Mayflower Madam." Buck up, thrill-seekers. Even though the deal is off between ABC and Donna Rice, there are still plenty of tabloid sensations getting dramatized on TV. Remember Sydney Biddle Barrows, the uptown girl who gave new meaning to the phrase "Social Register"? Candice Bergen stars in this spiffy dramatization. But remember, this is TV. Ms. Bergen sort of repents in the end, whereas old Sydney's attitude was, "Prostitution is never having to say you're sorry."  Sunday, Nov. 15, 9-11 p.m. EST, on HBO (repeated on Nov. 18, 21, 26 and 30): "Laguna Heat." You're used to seeing "L.A. Law" heartthrob Harry Hamlin clean-shaven and sharply dressed; now find out if your heart throbs at the sight of him scruffy and chain smoking. There are plenty of intriguing hooks in this film version of T. Jefferson Parker's best-seller about a 1950s murder in Southern California. But the hooks never link up -- maybe because HBO Pictures forgot to give Hamlin a personality to go with the stubble.
