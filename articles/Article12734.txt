 Market Movers: Downtown New York Faces Long Struggle To Lure Firms Back --- Some Trade Center Tenants, Temporarily in Suburbs, Might Just Stay There --- Decade of Detours and Dust   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Jathon Sapsford, Peter Grant, Stefan Fatsis and Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2001  Morgan Stanley, which was the largest tenant in the World Trade Center, may abandon plans for an expansion of its Manhattan office complex, and could even relocate some of its employees outside of New York City. Former Trade Center tenant Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield is planning to spread its staff between midtown Manhattan and the borough of Brooklyn. "We are not considering lower Manhattan," says its chief executive, Michael Stocker.  Logistics are daunting. The area faces years of transportation detours and delays, even though transit officials pledge to add ferries and buses. The highway alongside the World Trade Center could be used as a construction artery, planners say, cutting off the fastest road down Manhattan's West Side and around the tip of the island. A tunnel linking lower Manhattan and Brooklyn will be inaccessible indefinitely.  The prospect of a decade of construction worries the area's residents, who've suffered through much in the past. Into the 1980s, the neighborhood known as Tribeca -- for "triangle below Canal" -- was dominated by warehouses and produce markets. As in SoHo to the north, artists first colonized Tribeca, followed by lawyers, bankers and movie stars. The number of people living in lower Manhattan rose 67% from 1990 to 2000, to 25,000, says the Alliance for Downtown New York. Battery Park City, built on landfill in the Hudson River, brought 9,000 residents.
