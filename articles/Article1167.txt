 Mobile Emailing Without a Smart Phone; New Services Make It Easier To Access User's Accounts On Standard Cellphones   By Vascellaro, Jessica E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2007  The services are starting to catch on among a new group of users interested in staying on top of their email on the go. While checking his email via Teleflip on his phone, Paul Brown, a 34-year-old software engineer, received a message from a friend telling him that NBA playoff tickets had just gone on sale. He called to purchase some instantly. "It's nice to get your emails right when they come up," says Mr. Brown, a software engineer from Austin, Texas, who says he doesn't want to pay for an additional data plan since he is usually near his computer.  Others have begun using them in lieu of higher-priced services geared toward professionals. Paul Adams, a 35-year-old manager for a rock band who lives in New York City, recently bought a BlackJack smart phone from AT&T but chose not to pay for the fancy wireless email service that would have cost him an additional $60 a month. Instead he uses Consilient for $60 a year along with a data plan that's around $30 a month. He says the service stalls every few months or so and forces him to reboot, but he doesn't mind the glitch. "That probably doesn't happen with a BlackBerry," says Mr. Adams who says he's never liked the look -- or the cost -- of the BlackBerry device. "But I don't care."  New approaches are in the works. Txtbl, a start-up, will begin selling a consumer device focused on wireless email early next year. "[Email] applications are hard to set up and people don't know how to type on their phones," says Amol Sarva, chief executive of Txtbl. The company's device, which will have a full keyboard and is currently known as "Mailster," will be sold commercially in two large electronics retailing chains for less than $100.
