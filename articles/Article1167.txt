 American Entrepreneurs: Heinz Knew at Least 57 Ways to Sell a Pickle   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1989  A few years ago, you could walk into Wenceslaus Square, in the heart of Prague, Czechoslovakia, and find a striking tribute to up-by-the-bootstraps capitalisim. There, on a large billboard ringed with electric lights, was a quintessentially American product. A bottle of Heinz ketchup.  Henry John Heinz didn't live to see his name become a household word behind the Iron Curtain, but it wouldn't have surprised him. Before the turn of the century, when the vision of most Americans stopped at the county line, H.J. Heinz saw the world as his market.  In 1886, the young Pittsburgh food merchant sailed to England with dozens of jars of pickles, chili sauce and other condiments. He marched through the front door of Fortnum & Mason Ltd., the toniest of London's grocers, collared the chief buyer, and sold all his samples. Nine years later, he returned to open an office and, eventually, a factory that put Heinz products into every pantry in the United Kingdom.
