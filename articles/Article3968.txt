 House Republicans Circle the Wagons; Party Looks to Heal Leadership Divide During DeLay's Absence to Fight Legal Battles   By Mullins, Brody, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2005  "It makes it more difficult for the leadership to get things passed, because there is a question about [Tom DeLay]'s fate," said Rep. Christopher Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut who has sparred with Mr. DeLay. "Whenever you have uncertainty in a leadership position, it makes it more difficult to move forward."  Republican pollster David Winston, who advises House leaders, said, "At this point everyone is waiting to see what happens with DeLay." Mr. DeLay hopes to end the uncertainty by pushing for a quick trial, but his case isn't expected to be wrapped up before next spring.  The Republican caucus's sense of loyalty to Mr. DeLay won't make Mr. [Roy Blunt]'s job any easier. The party credits the feisty Texan with obtaining the decisive votes on several major accomplishments, such as a new Medicare prescription-drug benefit. If Mr. Blunt falters during the coming votes on spending cuts, his leadership position may be vulnerable during party elections for the new Congress in January.
