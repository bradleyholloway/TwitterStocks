 New 'Matrix' Posts Ticket Sales Below Those of Previous Release   By Orwall, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2003  "It was a six-month intermission," Mr. [Joel Silver] said, calling "Revolutions" "the second half of one movie" that began in May. "At $200 million, I don't know how you can say it's not successful."  Mr. [Dan Fellman] conceded that, heading into the busy holiday movie season, "Revolutions" is likely to fall short of the $281 million domestic gross that "Reloaded" earned. But he said he believes it will play more steadily in theaters than the second film, which dropped off sharply after its big opening. Indeed, if "Revolutions" falls off as quickly as "Reloaded" did, it might have trouble topping the $171 million taken in by "The Matrix," the influential 1999 hit that kicked off the science-fiction trilogy.  "Revolutions" and "Reloaded" each cost more than $175 million to make and tens of millions more to market around the world. In releasing the two sequels within six months of each other, Warner Bros. bet that an aggressive publicity blitz behind "Reloaded" would carry over and help sell "Revolutions." The earlier effort also was aided by four corporate sponsorships, while the new film has none.
