 Investing Overseas: U.S. Institutions Find Buying Foreign Stocks Can Be Very Profitable --- Dollar's Fall, Record Growth Of Markets Explain Gains; Some Warn of Big Risks --- Remember the Mexico Fund?   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1986  Foreign stocks are in vogue among U.S. banks, insurers and other money managers. Lured by record growth in many foreign markets, a declining dollar and a hard sell from brokers, analysts and consultants, U.S. institutional investors are pouring money into stock markets from London to Hong Kong.  Supporters say that investing overseas is both prudent and profitable. Foreign stocks, they say, diversify investment portfolios and reduce money managers' risk. These stocks also offer the possibility of bigger gains than American issues because many foreign economies are expected to grow faster than the U.S. economy.  But others warn of a wide range of risks, including volatile currency movements, lax securities regulation in many countries and questionable trading practices on some major foreign stock markets. They note that U.S. investors have invested abroad before, most notably in the 1960s, and been forced to retreat quickly after losing money in illiquid and overheated markets.
