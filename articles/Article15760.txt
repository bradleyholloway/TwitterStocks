 Screen Play: Breast-Scan Device Gets Nowhere in U.S., Sells in Latin America --- Pad to Detect Tumor's Heat Targets Women Unable To Afford Mammograms --- Plenty of False Negatives   By By Pamela Druckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1999  CASCAVEL, Brazil -- Dorilde Folador, the wife of a farmer, is in the city for a medical procedure she has rarely had in her 53 years: a screening for breast cancer. When the doctor announces that it is negative, she breaks into a smile. "I'm going to tell my friends about BreastCare," she says.  The evidence Dr. (Zsigmond) Sagi cites for BreastCare goes back to the early 1980s. At New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and other hospitals, the product, then called the Breast Cancer Screening Indicator, was tried on 179 women who were scheduled for biopsies. It registered positive for 83% of women whose subsequent biopsies showed they had cancer. For women who had tiny cancers less than 1 centimeter across, it registered positive nearly 90% of the time.  In another early-1980s study, involving women who weren't scheduled for biopsies but simply came to a hospital for screening, BreastCare was used on 2,805 women and the results compared with mammogram and physical-exam results. BreastCare registered positive in 87% of women who also had suspicious mammograms or physical exams, though once again there were many false positives. It registered negative in 99% of women who screened negative using the other methods.
