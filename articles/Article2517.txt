 Promise of Leaner Chaebols Fuels Korean Rally   By By Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1998  Barely a year ago, South Korea was swept up in the Asian financial crisis as investors fled the currency and stock markets in panic over Korea's mountain of debt. The International Monetary Fund rushed to the rescue, leading a $58 billion financial package; in return, Korea promised to implement reforms such as opening its capital markets to foreigners and restructuring industry.  So far, it has opened the door to foreign mergers and acquisitions and closed down some of its troubled banks. But the promised reform of the chaebols proved achingly slow, until last week, when President Kim Dae-Jung succeeded in forcing the five biggest groups -- the Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK groups -- to relent and restructure.  For years, Korea's business groups expanded into a vast array of businesses, focusing primarily on expanding their market share and paying little heed to profitability. While the U.S. had, at least until very recently, three big auto makers, a year ago South Korea had five independent car makers. If last week's pact between the Samsung and Daewoo groups goes ahead, with Samsung handing over its car unit to Daewoo in exchange for Daewoo's electronics business, Korea will be left with two auto makers.
