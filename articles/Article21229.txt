 A Rundown on the Budget's Baseline Blues   By By Timothy J. Muris, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1988  As used in Washington, the word "cut" does not mean a reduction from last year's level; instead, it means a reduction from spending as projected under a "baseline." This baseline includes future spending and receipts under current laws, even though the amounts may be far above the preceding year's. The baseline increases all programs above the previous year's level by varying inflation indexes -- even though many programs do not automatically include increases for inflation.  Thus, over the past several years federal civilian workers have received an average annual pay increase of about 3%. Yet, billions of dollars in deficit reductions have been claimed from "cutting" federal pay. The reason is the rate of increase was smaller than that projected in the baseline. Thus, giving employees a 4% pay increase can be said to "cut" spending by $9 billion over three years, as Congress claimed in its budget resolution for fiscal 1983.  If taxes are enacted, to be implemented five years hence, when the year of the increase arrives the new taxes do not count as tax increases -- because they are already in the baseline. In last year's budget summit, for example, the tax increase was said to be modest, amounting to $17 billion for fiscal 1989 and growing to $19 billion by 1991. The actual tax increase, however, including taxes that were enacted several years before implementation, will total $32 billion in 1989 and $54 billion (about 1% of projected gross national product) in 1991.
