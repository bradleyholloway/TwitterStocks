 Two Bidders Appear to Win Belgian Firm --- De Benedetti, Leysen Group Are Near Joint Control Of Generale de Belgique   By By Mark M. Nelson and Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1988  Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti and a group led by Belgian businessman Andre Leysen appeared headed for shared control of Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., the huge Belgian holding company, following victories for Mr. De Benedetti in two rulings by Belgian authorities.  If an agreement is reached between the two parties, it is likely to mark the beginning of sweeping changes in Generale de Belgique, which controls close to one-third of the Belgian economy and has links to many sectors of the European economy. Both Mr. De Benedetti and Mr. Leysen have leveled sharp criticisms at the company's current management and have pledged to make the venerable giant into a more competitive, Europeanwide force befitting its size and vast holdings.  Mr. De Benedetti started the fight for Generale de Belgique on Jan. 18, when he revealed his 18.6% stake in the company and announced plans to bid for an additional 15%. Mr. Leysen, chairman of Gevaert N.V., another Belgian holding company, emerged as his main rival a week later, at the head of a group of largely Belgian companies that has amassed a 27.5% stake in Generale de Belgique.
