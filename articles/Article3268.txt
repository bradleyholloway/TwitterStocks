 Suits Over Sales Of Life Insurance Are to Proceed   By By Deborah Lohse, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1999  New York's highest court is allowing a class-action lawsuit to proceed that alleges that agents of the company now called MONY Group Inc. acted deceptively when selling life insurance. The ruling partly reverses an earlier dismissal considered a big victory for the company and the life-insurance industry.  In the same opinion, the New York Court of Appeals also ruled that a lawsuit seeking class-action status with similar allegations against Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, also based in New York, could proceed to the next legal stage, but on limited grounds.  In both cases, policyholders allege that insurance agents in the 1980s and part of this decade talked consumers into buying whole-life and universal-life-insurance policies by falsely promising that, in a number of years, dividends earned on the policies would grow rapidly enough to cover future premiums.
