 Brokers' Agenda for Boca Meeting Is to Be Upbeat, Play Some Golf   By Ceron, Gaston F, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2003  Perhaps reflecting the more-upbeat mood, attendance at this year's Securities Industry Association meeting looks likely to top last year's, though it will almost certainly lag behind earlier years.

"A major accomplishment was dealing with the blackout without any significant customer problems," said John Schaefer, the group's 2003 chairman, and the president and chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley's individual-investor group.
