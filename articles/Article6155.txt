 Film / Review: In Stale `Just Married,' Newlywed Battles Newlywed, But the Loser Is the Audience --- Ambitious and Truly Innovative, `Russian Ark' Only Gives Itself One Shot, and It's a Beauty   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2003  NOTHING LIKE "Russian Ark" has ever been attempted, let alone achieved, because nothing like it was possible until the advent of digital cinematography. Alexander Sokurov's hugely ambitious, essentially plotless historical fantasy unspools (except there are no spools, because there's no film, or even tape) in one unbroken, unedited 87-minute shot (except there is a kind of editing at play) as the camera (yes, there is a camera, in a Steadicam mount) wanders through crowds across the centuries in St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum, the metaphorical ark in which Russian culture has been preserved. By turns intriguing, boring, frustrating, amazing and stirring, this is a tour de force that, necessarily, lacks dramatic force, but one that creates a dream state of seemingly limitless dimensions.  Long takes have attracted attention in the past; one thinks of "Rope," which Alfred Hitchcock shot in 10-minute segments (almost the time limit of a 35mm film magazine), or that famous five-minute Steadicam shot through the labyrinthine reaches of a restaurant in Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas." But the requirements of "Russian Ark" exceeded even the 46-minute capacity of high-definition digital tape, so the camera's signal was fed, uncompressed, to a portable hard disc with a 100-minute capacity. (The cinematographer was Tillman Buttner, who was the Steadicam operator on "Run Lola Run.") The technical challenges were matched, at the very least, by the logistics: almost 900 actors, several hundred extras, three live orchestras and 22 assistant directors, all of them given a single chance to get it right after months of rehearsals.
