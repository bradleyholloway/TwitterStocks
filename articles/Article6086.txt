 Boeing, Lockheed Martin Win U.S. Pacts To Secure Airport   By By Stephen Power and J. Lynn Lunsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2002  The automated machines are made by companies such as InVision Technologies Inc. of Newark, Calif., and L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. of New York. Makers of trace devices include Ion Track Instruments of Wilmington, Mass., and Barringer Instruments of Warren, N.J. Both kinds of equipment have been in use at U.S. airports for years, but not in the quantities needed to screen the estimated one billion bags that airlines carry each year.  Rick Stephens, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space & Communications Services of Seal Beach, Calif., said the company should be able to meet the end-of-year deadline. Its plan calls for deploying 1,110 automated machines, similar to medical CAT-scan equipment and taking as much space as minivans, and at least 4,000 of the more-portable devices for detecting traces of explosives.
