 Soviets Term Foreign Debt `Very Grave' --- New Economic Unit's Chief Calls for Rescheduling Of Nation's Payments   By By Elisabeth Rubinfien, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1991  The head of the Soviet Union's new economic management committee described the nation's foreign currency position as "very grave" and called for a rescheduling of debt payments, the official Tass news agency said.  Ivan Silayev, head of the committee, indicated that Soviet foreign debt may be far greater than earlier reported. During a committee meeting on the currency and debt situation, representatives of Soviet financial institutions said foreign debt to Western nations had reached 47.2 billion convertible rubles (about $81 billion at the official exchange rate), according to Tass and the independent Interfax news agency. It isn't clear whether the new figure is computed with the same elements Western analysts have used to come up with a previous estimate of $68 billion for the U.S.S.R.'s foreign debt.  In addition, the U.S.S.R. owes between 17 billion rubles and 18 billion rubles to formerly socialist nations, the reports said. Foreign currency owed to the Soviet Union totals 94.3 billion rubles, or far more than what the nation owes, Mr. Silayev indicated. But much of it is all but uncollectable -- owed by such allies as Cuba and Vietnam or due from arms sales to such nations as Libya and Iraq.
