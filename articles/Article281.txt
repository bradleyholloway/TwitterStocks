EL PASO, Oct. 4â€” An aide to Gov. Bill Clements of Texas says the Government of Mexico is concerned about how illegal aliens are being treated in this country and that the subject will be the main focus of the second international meeting of the border governors of the United States and Mexico, which begins tomorrow.  Eddie Aurispa, administrative aide for Latin American affairs, said the Texas Governor would insist that a ''guest worker'' program be adopted by the two national governments to help solve the illegal alien problem. He also said that Governor Clements wanted a speeding of the precess for gaining American citizenship.  Last year the Governors agreed to study joint problems and to report their recommendations at this year's meeting.
