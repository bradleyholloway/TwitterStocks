 E-Business: IT Spending Is Expected to Rebound in 2003   By By Donna Fuscaldo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  At Internet portal Yahoo Inc., technology spending will be less in 2002, mainly because the company "invested heavily" during 2001, said a spokeswoman. And chemical maker Solutia Inc. said it will decrease IT spending by about 20% this year compared with 2000, partly because the company did many upgrades for year-2000 preparation, said spokeswoman Beth Rusert.  Take Jay Sidhu, president and chief executive of Sovereign Bancorp Inc. in Philadelphia. He noted that now is a good time for companies to invest in productivity-enhancing technology because prices have dropped. For 2002, Mr. Sidhu said the bank's technology budget will be "millions of dollars" higher than in 2001, although he declined to provide exact amounts.  "Whenever you dealt with Cisco in the past, Cisco had a pricing [plan] and was willing to walk away from a deal," said Ulrich Seif, chief information officer at National Semiconductor Inc. "When Cisco negotiates today, they don't walk away." Officials at Cisco Systems Inc. weren't immediately available for comment.
