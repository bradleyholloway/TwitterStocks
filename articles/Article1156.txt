 KB Home Receives Offer For Stake in French Builder   By Goldstein, Steve, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2007  France's third-largest builder behind Bouygues and Nexity has had a strong run over the past five years, with a quadrupling of its share price. KB Home may want to sell, with the view that France is near the top of the market, while a suitor may want to buy given the industry's solid backlogs and K&B's recent expansion into the nursing-home sector. Plus, the country's newly elected president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has proposed making mortgage interest payments tax deductible.
