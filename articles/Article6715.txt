 Dollar Falls Against Key Rivals Ahead of Fed Decision on Rates   By McGeever, Jamie, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2003  Weighed down by renewed selling in the U.S. bond market, market positioning and a general unwillingness to hold a lot of dollars ahead of a U.S. interest-rate decision today, the dollar weakened across the board in light trading.  "After last week's Treasury refunding, people had expected the bond market to stabilize . . . but that hasn't been the case," said Robert Lynch, global head of foreign-exchange strategy in New York, referring to yet another day of Treasury selling yesterday.  The dollar's weakness against the yen was also compounded by talk of Japanese holders of U.S. Treasurys repatriating coupon repayments before the Aug. 15 deadline.
