 Small Business Link -- Online Extras: Highlights from additional coverage at WSJ.com/SmallBusinessLink   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  So I developed the blog. A lesson came when [one of his products] Insta-Snow [a powder that turns to snow when water is added] was featured as one of the month's top stupid products on Good Morning America. I wrote in the blog that in fact it was stupid that someone else hadn't thought of it. People didn't know my blog from anyone else's -- but they happened to pick up the headline: "It's Great to be Stupid." I watched sales skyrocket.  MR. [Steve Spangler]: In 2005, I went on network television to demonstrate the Mentos Diet Coke experiment [where the candy is dropped into the bottle of soda, triggering a geyser]. By accident, the news anchor got soaked. [The local NBC station] streamed the video and it ended up on VH1. Lots of people grabbed the post from my blog. The headline was: News Anchor Gets Soaked; Mentos Experiment Sets New Record. It wasn't misleading, just tantalizing.
