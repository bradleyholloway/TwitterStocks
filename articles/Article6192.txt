 South African Exchange's Top Official Aims to Halt Listing Exodus to London   By By Andi Spicer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1999  JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The recent exodus of some of South Africa's largest companies to the London Stock Exchange has been interpreted by foreign investors as a body blow.  On the corporate scene during the last two years, Mr. [Russell] Loubser has watched mining concern Billiton PLC and brewing concern SAB PLC move their primary listings to London from Johannesburg.  Now South Africa's largest company and the jewel in the crown of the JSE, mining and investment behemoth Anglo American Corp., has joined the migration and will list in London in May. The country's largest insurance and financial group, South African Mutual Life Assurance Society, better known as Old Mutual, will list in London in June.
