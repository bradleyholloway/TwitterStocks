 Defying Forecasts, Tenants Fill Tokyo's New Skyscrapers   By Singer, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2003  It didn't happen. Even as Japan was just starting to emerge from another recession amid its decade-long economic rout, the new towers have almost all been rented out. What had become known in real-estate circles as Tokyo's "2003 Problem" turned into a bonanza of lease- signings and office moves, as companies rented four times as much office space as the previous annual average.  "Rents can't fall much further in new buildings, because if they do, the developers will go bust," says Leslie Chua, an associate director at Jones Lang LaSalle, a real-estate services firm. "I think we'll see rent prices bottom out in 2005 to 2006," says Mr. Chua. "We should see a recovery in 2007 to 2008."  The T-Cube building's apartments are Oakwood's most expensive in Japan and its first venture inside an office building, says spokesman Robert Philips. He says Oakwood has been expanding in Tokyo as it finds Japan's service economy is growing, with more bankers, lawyers and consultants traveling through the city and needing places to stay near the new skyscrapers. Recently, Oakwood has seen a boom in film crews using its apartments, including director Sofia Coppola and the crew that filmed "Lost in Translation," which was set in Tokyo.
