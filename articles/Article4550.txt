 Economic Reports Could Decide Fate Of the U.S. Dollar   By By Stephen Grover, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1985  The data include July retail sales due tomorrow, July industrial production figures due Thursday, and July housing starts and factory capacity utilization, due Friday. "The market has been indifferent to the economic statistics of late," said Jim Bovery, a corporate assistant secretary of Irving Trust Co., New York. "But Henry Kaufman has changed all that and we'll be waiting to see what these statistics have to say."  Mr. Kaufman's remarks sent the dollar sharply lower and the gold price soaring Friday. In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 2.8080 marks from 2.8310 marks the day before, while the British pound rose to $1.37 from $1.3485. Gold rose $6.50 an ounce to settle on the Commodity Exchange in New York at $328.50. Contracts for all deliveries on the Comex amounted to three million ounces, a moderate figure but one well ahead of activity in recent days.
