 Getting Going: How to Become an Investor -- on $20 a Month   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2005  That's also good advice for investors, which is why I often mention Vanguard Group, renowned for its rock-bottom annual expenses and its index funds. Problem is, it's tough for cash-strapped investors to get their foot in the door. Unlike the fund companies mentioned above, Vanguard won't waive its regular $3,000 minimum if you sign up for an automatic investment plan.  True, you can start an IRA or a custodial account with just $1,000. But what if you want to open a regular taxable account? There is one Vanguard fund with a minimum below $3,000, and that's Vanguard STAR (VGSTX), for which you need just $1,000.  Alternatively, try DRIP enrollment services offered by BetterInvesting (www.betterinvesting.org) and Temper Enrollment Service (www.directinvesting.com). For instance, BetterInvesting's low-cost enrollment service covers 130 companies, including Dow Chemical, Kellogg and PepsiCo, and levies a $7 set-up fee for each plan you join. To use the service, you have to be a member of BetterInvesting, which costs $50 a year.
