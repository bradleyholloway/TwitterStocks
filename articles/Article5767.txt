 Conde Nast's Udell Succeeds Penney As Editor of Self   By Reilly, Patrick M, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1995  Ms. [Rochelle Udell] will report to James Truman, editorial director of Conde Nast, who said he interviewed several candidates from outside. Articles about women's physical health and emotional issues are amply covered in other women's magazines, but Mr. Truman said he picked Ms. Udell to "bring a coherent, emotional, resonant voice to these subjects." [Self], he said, "needs to be edited by feel."  Under Ms. Udell, Conde Nast launched two prominent sites on the World Wide Web part of the Internet. Conde Nast Traveler Online is an on-line travel guide derived from the monthly magazine. Epicurious is a fine-dining and cooking site created from Gourmet and Bon Appetit, Conde Nast's magazines for food lovers.
