 Venezuela Proposes to Defer Payments On Most of Its Debt to Foreign Banks   By By Peter Truell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1989  Under pressure from lower oil prices and higher international interest rates, Venezuela proposed suspending principal payments on most of its estimated $26 billion of foreign bank debt and called a meeting with its major creditor banks.  U.S. President-elect George Bush recently pledged a review of Washington's international debt policy. Meanwhile, Mexico and the U.S. are discussing new approaches to that nation's $100 billion foreign debt. Argentina, which is now about $2 billion in arrears on interest payments on its $54 billion foreign debt, is struggling to implement economic reform and reach agreements with its foreign creditors.  Venezuela, which on Feb. 2 inaugurates Carlos Andres Perez as its president, has recently tried to borrow money to avoid suspending bank-debt principal payments. But the international financial markets, particularly banks, still are leery of loans to Latin America. Consequently, Venezuela hasn't been able to raise funds quickly enough to avoid suspending principal payments, bankers and economists said.
