James F. Burke, principal cornet soloist with the Goldman Band for more than 30 years, died last Friday, apparently of a heart attack, while conducting a rehearsal of the Guggenheim Concert Band, successor to the Goldman Band. He was 58 years old and lived in Islip, L.I.  Mr. Burke, who had the use of only one arm, was considered the greatest virtuoso of his time on the instrument, according to Ainslee Cox, conductor of the Guggenheim.  When he joined the Goldman Band, around 1940, it played seven concerts a week, and Mr. Burke, who had a prodigious memory for music, would play a different solo at each performance. He often composed the pieces that he played.  In addition to his work with the Goldman Band he had been a trumpet player in the Philadelphia Orchestra, first trumpet player with the Baltimore Symphony and Radio City Music Hall, trumpet soloist with the Band of America and All American Big Brass Band, and guest soloist with more than 800 professional and school bands and orchestras throughout the country.  Born in Port Jefferson, L.I., Mr. Burke studied with his father, who was a trumpet player, and with Ernest Williams, Del Stagers and Ned Mahoney. He was graduated from the Ernest Williams Music School in Brooklyn.  About 10 years ago, he retired from playing and increasingly devoted his time to teaching. Survivors include three sons, James M., Jeffrey L. and Joel G.; two daughters, Jolynda M. and Joneta L. Soto; a sister, Rita Turso, and seven grandchildren.  Illustrations: photo of James F. Burke
