 Legal Remedies: In China, Courts Find New Muscle as They Take On Medical Cases --- Malpractice Lawsuits Yield Awards as Judges Sidestep Laws Favoring Hospitals --- Why Tong Linxin Can't Walk   By By Leslie Chang, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2002  In a sign that local experimentation is encouraged, the country's Supreme People's Court sometimes issues documents sanctioning rulings made by lower courts. In October 2000, at a meeting to discuss civil judgments, a vice president of the supreme court announced that courts could decide malpractice cases according to civil law, and that appraisals weren't necessary -- echoing precisely the conclusion of the judge in the Wuhan twins case several months before. Last year, the supreme court issued a judicial interpretation supporting the awarding of "spiritual damages" when a person's rights to life and health were violated.  Other families still have hope in the courts. In the damp, sooty mining town of Huangshi, not far from Wuhan, a three-year-old girl named Tong Linxin spends most of her days lying on a sheet of cardboard in her grandparents' house, unable to stand, walk or speak. In March 1999, shortly after her first birthday, her grandparents took her to the hospital with a fever.  Two medical appraisal boards, at the city and provincial level, have ruled that Tong Linxin wasn't the victim of medical malpractice. The Huangshi City Central Hospital says in court filings that her symptoms didn't suggest tubercular meningitis and that an earlier vaccination seemed to rule it out.
