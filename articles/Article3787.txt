 Iogen's Milestone: It's Selling Ethanol Made of Farm Waste   By Chipello, Christopher J, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2004  Iogen is ahead of other firms seeking to commercialize ethanol from farm waste, said John Ashworth, an official of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., which has a pilot plant where companies test cellulose-ethanol concepts. Iogen's much-larger plant in Ottawa is the only demonstration plant for the technology, he said.  Petro-Canada will take delivery today of Iogen's initial 1,300 gallon shipment of ethanol, which will be blended into high-octane gasoline at Petro-Canada's Montreal refinery, said Petro-Canada spokeswoman Michelle Harries.  It is too early to say whether the Calgary, Alberta, oil company will invest in the full-scale plant that Iogen aims to build, Ms. Harries added. "There are a number of market conditions that would need to be worked out before we could commit to being Iogen's partner."
