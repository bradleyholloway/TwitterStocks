 Some Analysts Expect Iowa Resources to Cut Its 9.6% Payout at Late June Board Meeting   By By Kevin G. Salwen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1988  Like an electric-utility version of Murphy's Law, Iowa Resources is proving that everything can go wrong. And now the bad news: Several analysts think the tough times aren't over yet.  This hasn't been the best of springs for the Des Moines, Iowa-based utility. In April, the Iowa Utilities Board set the holding company's return on equity at the lowest level of any U.S. utility -- 10.96% -- a virtual guarantee that operating earnings will drop this year.  Iowa Resources responds that it's waiting for the board's written order before deciding on the next step. The company could file for a new rate case based on more recent rate-of-return figures, or sue the board in a bid to overturn the decision. But several analysts expect the company's directors to cut the payout, a move that could be decided as early as the late June board meeting.
