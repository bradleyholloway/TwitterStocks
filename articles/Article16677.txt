 An Implant to Ease the Pain   By Johannes, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2006  Scientists have found that applying electrical current to the nerves and nerve fibers along the spinal column can sometimes disrupt the transmission of chronic pain signals. How this works isn't fully understood, but animal studies have shown that the electricity appears to inhibit some of the chemicals that transmit chronic pain signals, while leaving the useful pathway for acute pain intact, says Daniel Bennett, medical director of Integrative Treatment Centers in Denver.  Published evidence on the newer devices is scant. Physicians say they reduce pain by 50% to 90% or more -- but not for everyone. The best candidates are people with pain in only one specific spot -- such as the back, chest or limbs. The device is unlikely to help with generalized muscle pain, such as fibromyalgia, or in situations where a problem -- such as a slipped disk -- continues to renew acute pain signals, physicians say. The devices are being tested in headaches and arthritis, but so far those indications are experimental.
