 Time Inc. Entertainment Weekly Scheduled for Launch in February   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1989  Time Inc. said it plans to launch Entertainment Weekly next February, the company's first major new magazine since the ill-fated TV-Cable Week folded six years ago.  Time, which has been quietly testing Entertainment Weekly since last fall, expects to spend about $30 million after taxes to launch the magazine, which probably won't be profitable for about four years. But Reginald K. Brack, chief executive officer of Time's magazine unit, said the editorial idea -- reviews and reporting about television, movies, video, music, and books -- "has been rigorously tested and has received enthusiastic response from consumers and advertisers alike."  Originally conceived as a spinoff of the "Picks & Pans" section of Time's People magazine, Entertainment Weekly fits with the company's strategy of "line extensions" of its current magazines. For example, Time last year started Sports Illustrated for Kids, a spinoff of its highly successful sports magazine and Mr. Brack said the company also is working on other "line extensions" based on People and Time magazines.
