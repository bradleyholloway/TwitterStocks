 Tiger Manager Mauled by Yen, Loses $2 Billion   By By Mitchell Pacelle and Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1998  Hedge-fund manager Julian Robertson Jr.'s Tiger Management suffered a loss of almost $2 billion on Wednesday, one of its largest one-day losses ever, mainly due to the surge in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, according to people familiar with the fund's performance.  Tiger Management, which began the month with about $20 billion under management, has long had one of the biggest bets in the hedge-fund world against the yen and Japanese financial stocks. But as near-panic selling swept through the foreign-exchange market on Wednesday, Tiger lost about 9% of its value, investors said. As of yesterday, it had begun to unwind its bet against the yen, one investor said, which required it to buy yen to cover earlier borrowings, further contributing to the dollar's weakness.  In September, too, Tiger incurred a loss of 9.9%, in part due to strengthening of the yen early in the month. It began October up 19.7% for the year, before fees, and Wednesday's losses leave it with gains of about 10% on the year. A spokesman for Tiger said the fund doesn't discuss its performance or positions.
