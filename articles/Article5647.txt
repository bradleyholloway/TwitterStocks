 Cool Pad, Fab Food, One Catch: Mom Lives There, Too --- Young Men Flock Back Home Where the Living Is Good Even If the Love Life Isn't   By By Christina Duff, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1994  Rob Olis and most of his buddies are launching their adult lives back at the homes where they used to play with Legos. Across the country, this new breed of mama's boys -- confident young men with jobs, college educations and girlfriends -- bonds around refrigerators full of mom's leftovers. And, when they are out partying, they remind each other to call home when it gets late.  And what of their female counterparts? More so than men, they are out on their own. Consider the statistics: Two decades ago, the percentage of men and women who spent at least part of their 20s living at home was equal -- about 40%. Today, some 45% of men in their 20s return to the nest, while only about 35% of women do. And the gap may be widening, say Frances and Calvin Goldscheider, demographers for the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit group in Washington.  Among the twentysomethings of Generation X, the trend is spawning bizarre changes in mating rituals and lifestyles. In the hip bars of Denver, 24-year-old live-at-home Sean McDermott has learned to flirt -- with no hope of inviting over a young woman later. "I evade the issue," he says. Scott Tennery of Bedford, Texas, doesn't necessarily want to invite anyone over, even if he could. His parents turned his bedroom into a guest room when he went away to Southern Methodist University. Now, back at home, he has a floral bedspread. Says Mr. Tennery, also 24: "It's not very manly."
