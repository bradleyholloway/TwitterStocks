 European Banks Could Face Losses Due to Erb's Woes   By Marcus Walker and Martin Gelnar, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2003  Erb's troubles have come into the open after the death of its chief executive and dominant figure, Hugo Erb, last July at the age of 85. Erb's longtime auditor in charge of controlling the company's accounts also died this year. After their deaths, Hans Ziegler, a Swiss manager with a restructuring record, took up the reins.  Erb's largest creditors are Switzerland's two biggest banks, UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group. But together they account for less than half of Erb's total debt, and part of their exposure is secured against Erb's assets.
