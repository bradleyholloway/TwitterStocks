 Foreign Stock and Bond Funds Scored Big in Fourth Quarter   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1989  Mutual funds that invest in foreign stocks and bonds rebounded to score big in the fourth quarter. But U.S. funds posted only measly gains.  The biggest bang for the mutual fund investor's buck came from the international stock funds, which invest primarily outside the U.S. and posted a total return of 9.4% in the quarter. Global stock funds, investing both here and overseas, jumped 6.2%. And world income funds, which target global bond markets, rose 4.9%.  The foreign funds' gains in the fourth quarter eclipsed the average 1.7% rise for all stock and bond funds as a group, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. The mutual fund universe had a total return -- price change plus dividends -- of 11.7% for the year.
