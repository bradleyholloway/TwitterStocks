 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1999  Growing numbers of Americans are paying higher taxes because of several tax-code provisions often referred to as stealth, or backdoor, tax increases. For example, there are limits on how much may be claimed in personal exemptions and itemized deductions by people whose income exceeds certain levels. Congress approved these and other provisions because it was more politically acceptable than raising rates directly.  As taxpayer income has risen, these provisions have taken a much bigger bite. A new IRS report shows nearly 4.5 million upper-income taxpayers were hit by the itemized-deduction limitation for 1997, up 10.5% from 1996. Itemized deductions lost as a result of the provision totaled $22.7 billion, up 20% from 1996, says IRS economist Therese Cruciano. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation issued a report on the subject early last year.  Only about 30% of all individual returns reported itemized deductions, such as charitable gifts or interest payments. The average total for itemized deductions rose 4.3% to $16,615 on returns for 1997, the latest year for which figures are available. Based on new IRS data, Jim Seidel of RIA Group, a New York-based publisher of tax and other business information, has calculated average deductions by categories, based on adjusted gross income.
