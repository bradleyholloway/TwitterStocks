 Getting Going: How Houses Eat Money   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2005  Tote up the cost of all these projects, both large and small, and the tab comes to some $130,000. It's an embarrassingly large number, and I wince whenever I think about it. Add that $130,000 to my home's $165,000 purchase price and my cost is up to $295,000.  To be sure, these sums are tax-deductible. But the tax deduction is a little overrated. Fact is, if I hadn't itemized, I could still have taken the standard deduction. It's only the extra deduction over and above the standard deduction that represents a true tax benefit.  Combine that with my $165,000 purchase price and the $130,000 in home improvements, and I am up to $442,000 -- not much below my home's $500,000 current value. The picture would be even uglier if I counted my initial closing costs, routine maintenance expenses and annual homeowner's insurance, to say nothing of the innumerable hours of my own time that I have sunk into the place. And while I have no intention of selling, that day will come. Imagine I sold today, paying a 5% real-estate commission. After enriching the brokers involved, I would net $475,000, perilously close to my total cost.
