 Northeast Banks Expected to Post Solid Earnings --- Evidence of Deterioration In Asset Quality Stirs Concern About Future   By By Frank Byrt, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1999  Northeast banks are expected to post healthy earnings for the third quarter with few surprises, continuing a string of strong quarterly performances so far this year.  "No one has given any suggestion that they're going to miss their numbers" in the third quarter, so it should continue as a "steady-as-we-go quarter," with the only change a slowdown in brokerdealer revenue growth at some banks, said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull.  Ed Najarian, an analyst for First Union Corp., projects a combined result of between 72 and 73 cents a share in the third quarter. That is about on par with the First Call/Thomson Financial standalone estimates of 74 cents for Fleet and 82 cents for BankBoston.
