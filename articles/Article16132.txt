 Upper Crust: Fast-Food Chains Vie To Carve Out Empire In Pricey Sandwiches --- Mr. Lynch Likes the Bread At Panera, While Zell And Kravis Back Cosi --- Starbucks as a Role Model   By By Shirley Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2002  Panera and some other high-end sandwich chains also sell gourmet coffee, meaning that success on a national scale could steal sales from their role model, Starbucks. But the chains vying to carve out an empire based on sandwiches face a challenge that Starbucks never did -- a field of well-funded competitors. Starbucks, which expanded to roughly 4,100 stores in North America in little more than a decade, was helped by a dearth of big-chain competition. Even today, its largest U.S. competitor, Diedrich Coffee Inc., based in Irvine, Calif., has a total of only 380 outlets.  Starbucks also found that high-quality sandwiches packaged fresh each morning didn't meet customer expectations. After launching a much-publicized effort to sell prepackaged sandwiches in 1999, Mr. [Howard Schultz] says that Starbucks, whose stores aren't equipped to prepare sandwiches on site, doesn't plan to emphasize food. "We recognize more than ever our core competency is roasting and selling the best coffee in the world," he says.  Cosi now has 66 stores. But this year, it plans to add 40 more. Among the privately held chain's investors are Messrs. [Henry Kravis] and [Sam Zell], as well as Terry Diamond, whose Chicago venture-capital firm made a fortune as an early investor in Starbucks. Recalling how Starbucks became "part of the landscape of America," Mr. Diamond says: "I think Cosi can do the same thing."
