 IPOs Are Expected to Match '94 Level --- Analysts Say Pace Will Pick Up in '95 Second Half   By By Scott Reeves, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 13, 1995  In 1994, 608 IPOs raised $28.5 billion, making it the second-most-productive year in the past quarter century. In 1993, 707 new issues raised $41.4 billion. The third-best year for IPOs was 1992, when 517 issues raised $24.1 billion, Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J., reported.  Analysts said reaction to RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s planned 45 million-share IPO of the Nabisco food company is likely to chart the course of the new-issues market in the first half. Price talk is $23 to $26 a share. The IPO will be for about 19% of Nabisco. All proceeds will go to the company and will be used to reduce debt.  Dick Smith, a syndicate manager for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said 1994's IPO market was "nervous" and this year's market will be "picky," but only a "major event" such as a war on the scale of the invasion of Kuwait will dry up demand for new issues.
