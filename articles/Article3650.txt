 When Buying a Stock, Plan Your Goodbye   By Cordeiro, Anjali, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  In hindsight, Mr. [Vince Gallagher] wishes the fund had sold more, because the stock started falling soon after. "You can get carried away with a stock when it does well," he notes. "The lesson we've learned is that you should have a target when you buy a stock, and you should stick to the target."  If the market appears to be trending lower, investors may want to pare their positions slightly, suggests Mr. [Daniel Morgan] of Synovus. But "you don't want to sell out completely," he says. "You want to take some money off the table to preserve capital and then re-examine the market at a later date."  "It wasn't severely overvalued, and we could have held it a little longer," Mr. [Mark Coffelt] now says. "In hindsight, you always know what you should have done."
