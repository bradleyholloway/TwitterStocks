 Iraq's Unlikely Oil Boom --- Iran Shows It Could Be Years Before Iraqi Oil Weighs on Prices   By By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  Yet today, Iran can't pump any more crude than a decade ago. The reason: New production has only offset the rapid decline in the productive capacity of Iran's other giant fields, which have been pumping oil for decades. Attempts to revive the Iraqi industry are likely to face the same knotty problems Iran faces -- the glacial pace of negotiations to clinch contracts and the years it then takes to tap large petroleum reservoirs, even as exhausted fields reduce output.  While TotalFinaElf efforts in Iraq were eventually stymied by the West's standoff with the [Saddam Hussein] regime, it got a break in Iran. After losing out to Conoco Inc. (which has since merged with Phillips Petroleum Co. to form ConocoPhillips) in a bidding war to develop Iran's Sirri oil field, TotalFinaElf found itself a winner when the Clinton administration barred the U.S. company from entering Iran. The U.S. subsequently passed a law that calls for sanctions on companies that invest in Iran's oil industry, sanctions that TotalFinaElf defied by signing up in 1997 to develop part of South Pars.  Some of the gas from South Pars will be reinjected into Iran's older oil fields to increase crude output. Some will be used in Iran to substitute for crude oil, which will add to exports. And the oil from South Pars will be directly available for export. Iran has so far awarded 15 petroleum-development contracts to foreign companies to produce one million barrels a day of oil and large volumes of gas. A clutch of new contracts are in the negotiating stage, including further phases of South Pars.
