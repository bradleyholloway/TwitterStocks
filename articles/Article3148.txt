 Settlement Does Little to Improve Street's Credibility on Research   By By Cheryl Winokur Munk, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2003  Some institutional investors are taking a wait-and-see approach. John Fields, portfolio manager of Delaware Decatur Equity Income Fund, is hoping sell-side analysts are able to provide enhanced industry perspective "because they're not spending all their time chasing deals." On the other hand, the quality of research could diminish if the "best and the brightest" get fed up with the climate and leave, he said. There has been a lot of turnover at major Wall Street firms.  While many buy-siders say they always took sell-side research with a grain of salt, all the negative publicity -- including e-mails that lend credence to the much-publicized contention that some analysts were de facto investment bankers -- has taken a toll. As a result, Wall Street's credibility has been impaired and buy-siders say it will take more than the settlement to polish firms' images.
