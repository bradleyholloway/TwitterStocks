 Selling Entire Stock! Capitalism Is Giddy With Triumph; Is It Possible to Overdo It? --- The Privatization of America, From Roads to Uranium, Begins to Stir a Backlash --- `The Idolatry of the Market'   By By David Wessel and John Harwood, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1998  Profit-making companies are invading areas once thought the exclusive preserve of government. Roughly one in 20 federal inmates is now in a for-profit prison, and more than one in eight community-hospital beds is in an investor-owned hospital. Deregulation is shaking up once-drowsy industries like electric utilities, prompting a frantic scramble for dominance. Skilled people in endeavors from singing to software find that, like baseball's free agents, they can command once-unimaginable salaries if they exploit the market.  The changes are found in unlikely places. In the land of the freeway, a privately owned stretch of Route 91 in Southern California charges a 60-cent toll at night and $3.20 at rush hour to discourage peak-hour travel. In Kansas, the state hires private contractors to find homes for foster children, paying a fixed per-child fee to provide an incentive for prompt placement. Even the U.S. government is learning to play the game: The Federal Aviation Administraton took bids to operate its payroll computers. Interestingly, the Department of Agriculture beat IBM and two other companies.  Because local fire stations are overwhelmed, County Commissioner Richard Swartz suggested that the county hire the same for-profit company that already provides ambulance service to run the fire department. About 30 of the company's 84 paramedics and emergency medical technicians already are trained firefighters, more than the fire department itself deploys. The efficiencies were obvious, Mr. Swartz argued.
