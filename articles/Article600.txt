 SHOP TALK: And They Get Paid To Do This Stuff   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1985  It's definite: Sunshine Mining Co. of Dallas will acquire Woods Petroleum Co. of Oklahoma City for $305 million in cash and stock. Give or take $15 million.  "Don't ask me," said David Jardine, Sunshine Mining's vice president, corporate development, who was instrumental in making the deal. "We're still saying 290. That 305 is Woods's number."  That left the two executives in agreement. "You've got to keep an eye on those lawyers," said Mr. Ussery. "I had a feeling the lawyers had something to do with it," said Mr. Jardine.
