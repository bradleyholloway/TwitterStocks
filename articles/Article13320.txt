 Kodak Revamps Wal-Mart Kiosks; More Than 2,000 Stores To Get Expanded Capacity For Printing Digital Photos   By Bulkeley, William M, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2006  Kodak had a rocky relationship with Wal-Mart in the 1990s when Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan took over the retailer's film photo-processing business. The digital kiosks gave Kodak a new opportunity at Wal-Mart starting in 2005.  Although many companies make digital-photo kiosks, which range in price from $5,000 to $20,000, Kodak is the world leader with 80,000 installed, including 35,000 in the U.S. It makes money both by selling the kiosks and by supplying the units with the chemicals and paper used to make the prints. Kodak says the dye-sublimation technology it uses in kiosks turns out photos that are equivalent in quality to those turned out by in-store "mini-labs" handling one-hour photo processing.  Wal-Mart, of Bentonville, Ark., said it has found use of kiosks, which shutterbugs often use to print just a few shots at a time, has been rising faster than the use of its one-hour mini-labs. Wal-Mart said it has recently raised the price of prints from the one-hour service to 22 cents apiece from 19 cents. That narrowed the price gap with instant prints from kiosks, which cost 28 cents apiece. (For customers who are printing 50 or more shots at a time, the one-hour price remains 19 cents a print.)
