 Masterpiece: American Optimist; Thompson composed when you didn't have to go to the movies to find rousing music   By Medved, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  THE RANDALL THOMPSON "Symphony No. 2" fairly explodes with energetic athleticism -- from its frenetic opening fanfares for horns and trumpets to its heartfelt finale featuring an original hymn for woodwinds cunningly transformed to danceable ragtime, and then back again. Through his four taut, terrific movements, Thompson speaks a compelling musical language that any listener can understand -- and certainly the audience for the November 1933 New York premiere (with the Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter, no less!) responded with appropriate enthusiasm. As Lawrence Gilman reported in the Herald Tribune: "Mr. Thompson was present last evening and after the resounding conclusion of his symphony he was acclaimed by the audience with a fervor that is seldom bestowed upon an American composer -- unless, of course, he happens to be Mr. Gershwin."  The two Thom(p)sons offered instructive contrasts, in fact, in their treatment of Americana: Randall (1899-1984) considered himself an unabashed musical nationalist and devoted patriot. He created one of his best known works, "The Testament of Freedom," to honor the words of Thomas Jefferson and inspire the troops during World War II. It featured a stirring chorus on the phrase: "The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time." From his boyhood summers on a modest farm in northern Maine, Thompson developed a lifelong affection for hymns, folk ballads and biblical texts, but wrote his most enduring composition to a single word: "Alleluia." This exquisite five minutes of unaccompanied, otherworldly choral praise had been commissioned by Serge Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony for the inauguration of the Berkshire Music Festival in 1940 and is still performed at the opening of each summer's festivities at Tanglewood.
