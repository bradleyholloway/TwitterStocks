 Missile Decision to Be Driven by Gore Campaign   By By Carla Anne Robbins and Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2000  The choice now facing Mr. [Clinton] is whether to defer a decision on deployment to the next president or award the contract for initial construction in Alaska to start next spring. Administration lawyers have already ruled that preliminary construction won't require the U.S. to pull out of the 1972 treaty on antiballistic missiles. But whether Russia and the U.S.'s European allies will see it that way still isn't clear.  The White House's enthusiasm for missile defense has flagged noticeably in recent months, especially since it has become clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin can't be easily wooed into revising the ABM treaty. A new National Intelligence Estimate, forwarded to the White House but not formally submitted to the president, warns that the U.S. will have serious problems with its European allies if it goes ahead with missile defense without persuading the Russians to revise the ABM treaty.  A longtime skeptic of missile defense, Mr. Clinton embraced the program after the U.S. intelligence community began warning that Pyongyang could have a missile capable of hitting the U.S. as early as next year.
