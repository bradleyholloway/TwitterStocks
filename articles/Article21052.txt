 Removal of Curbs on Former Bell Firms Is Recommended by Justice Department   By By Andy Pasztor and Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1987  The Justice Department urged a federal judge to lift restrictions on the former Bell regional telephone companies so they could compete in long-distance, computer services and all other businesses.  The regional companies would win a major victory in their longstanding campaign to gain access to every segment of the industry, including long-distance and manufacturing. Such moves, however, would be a serious setback to their former parent, American Telephone & Telegraph Co., which has lobbied hard to confine the regional companies to providing local telephone service.  "Now is the time for us to get out of the way and not impede competition," Mr. Rule told reporters, predicting that consumers' costs aren't likely to rise if the court goes along with the department's recommendations. Federal District Judge Harold Greene is expected to seek public comment and isn't likely to issue a decision on the matter for at least several months.
