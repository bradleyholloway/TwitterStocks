 U.S., Allies Scour Terrain in East Of Afghanistan   By By Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2002  U.S. officials say they have no direct intelligence that suggests that al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden is hiding in the region. Allied forces along the Afghan border have been searching some of the few remaining areas that haven't been combed by U.S. troops. In some cases they are revisiting areas that were recently cleared of al Qaeda to ensure that the fighters don't return and try to re-establish themselves.  U.S. air power and U.S. special operations troops are performing a supporting role to the British-led operation, U.S. military spokesman Maj. Bryan Hilferty said.
