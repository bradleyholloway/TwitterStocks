 Pharmaceuticals Try Bolder Tactics; Pfizer Campaign Includes Rare Swing at Rival Drug In a Competitive Market   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2004  The print and radio advertising rolled out over the weekend. A print ad in People magazine features a meteor falling on a woman. The headline reads: "Not many things knock you out like a migraine." What's unusual is the line that reads: "Clinical studies prove that with Relpax, more people get relief with just one dose than those taking Imitrex." Pfizer sells its migraine medicine in many overseas markets under the Relpax name. In Europe, however, pharmaceuticals makers aren't allowed to advertise their products directly to consumers.  GlaxoSmithKline strongly disputed the ad's claims. "The Pfizer claim is evidently based on a study that used an altered form of our product," spokeswoman Patty Seif said. "GlaxoSmithKline's own studies do not support their claim."  With ad spending by prescription-drug companies continuing to grow -- ad expenditures by pharmaceuticals companies soared 21% last year to $3.43 billion -- drug makers are under pressure to find new ways to stand out. "We're seeing intense competitive pressure in some drug categories, and that is pushing the more-aggressive marketing tactics," says Robert Grammatica, managing partner at WPP Group's Young & Rubicam Advertising. He suggests Pfizer's move may "force other companies to take the gloves off."
