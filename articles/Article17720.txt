 JWT Group Says Financial Chief At Thompson Quit   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1987  Don Johnston, JWT chairman, confirmed reports Friday that Victor F. Gutierrez, Thompson's executive vice president, finance, resigned April 24. In an interview, Mr. Johnston said Mr. Gutierrez left because "he saw himself blocked. I think that was a part of it -- 'What's my future?'" He said Mr. Gutierrez, a 15-year Thompson veteran, will focus on businesses he already operates with his wife, adding that "he has always had an interest in getting out of corporate America."  Mr. Gutierrez, 41 years old, couldn't be reached for comment. However, JWT executives said his career path was blocked when Terence D. Martin, chief financial officer of JWT and the Thompson unit, was given an expanded role in a reorganization of Thompson's J. Walter Thompson USA unit last week.
