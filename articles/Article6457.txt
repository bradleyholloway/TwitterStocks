 GE-Honeywell Deal's Problems Deepen --- Europe's Antitrust Enforcers Push for Aerospace Sale That Undercuts Synergies   By By Philip Shishkin and Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2001  A person close to GE said the commission's Merger Task Force is asking for divestitures totaling $6 billion in annual revenue and including some of Honeywell's most prized products, such as ground-proximity warning systems, airborne collision-avoidance devices and communication and navigation equipment. A detailed economic analysis prepared by European regulators contends that Honeywell already has a commanding presence in a number of these segments, and argues that in some areas none of its existing rivals would be able to compete effectively against the research, production and marketing clout of the proposed GE-Honeywell combination. "They are looking for a megabucket full of avionics and nonavionics," said the person, who is familiar with GE's strategy. "At the moment the parties are a long way apart."  From the beginning, GE has wanted to create a seamless range of aerospace products combining GE jet engines with Honeywell's cockpit instruments and avionics equipment, and then mesh them with maintenance and data-collection services. Honeywell officials in the past have stressed the goal of helping airlines do pre-emptive maintenance and identify emerging safety issues. Some of the Honeywell units that the Merger Task Force wants GE to sell are central to that concept, and are considered by GE to be stepping stones to further market penetration.
