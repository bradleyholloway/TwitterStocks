 First RepublicBank Offers Unusual Plan To Shed Bad Loans and Raise Capital   By By Leonard M. Apcar, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1988  First RepublicBank Corp. said it has come up with a plan for raising capital and shedding bad loans that involves an innovative and controversial concept promoted by the junk bond specialists at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  The concept, known as "securitization" of bad loans, is similar to a financing technique that banks and credit companies increasingly are using to sell mortgages, auto loans and credit card receivables to investors. But what makes First RepublicBank's plan to use the method for nonperforming loans so controversial is that it has never been implemented by a bank, let alone one trying to structure a federal bailout.  Nonetheless, at a news conference yesterday, Albert V. Casey, First RepublicBank's chairman and chief executive officer, said he hopes to have the plan in place sometime this fall. Yet the plan assumes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will favor Mr. Casey's proposal over others from different banks that would involve a takeover of First RepublicBank with government assistance. The FDIC usually selects the least expensive plan for assisting a troubled bank.
