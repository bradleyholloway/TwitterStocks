 World-Wide [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1985  A government official in Malta, where the jet was diverted, said Egyptian commandos apparently killed three hijackers. As many as 50 of the about 80 people on board also were killed as the hijackers detonated hand grenades. A fourth hijacker may have been killed during an in-flight shootout after the plane was hijacked Saturday upon leaving Athens for Cairo.  Earlier reports said the terrorists had killed seven of those aboard and threatened to kill more if the Boeing 737 wasn't refueled in Malta. Egypt believes Libya inspired the hijacking, which has deepened the rift between radical Arabs and moderates searching for Mideast peace.  Israel pledged a thorough investigation and possible dismissals over an alleged spy scandal. The pledge followed Thursday's arrest by the FBI of Jonathan Pollard, a civilian counterintelligence analyst for the Navy, on charges of passing information to Israel. Pollard's wife was arrested Friday on charges of possessing classified data.
