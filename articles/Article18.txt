SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov. 16â€” The California Board of Prison Terms voted unanimously today to consider rescinding a 1984 parole release date for Sirhan B. Sirhan, who assassinated Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York in 1968.  The board's chairman, Raymond Brown, emphasized to those in the packed hearing room that the vote did not constitute a rescission. That could come, he said, only after a hearing on the evidence. To prepare for that, he said, Mr. Sirhan would be given a package of facts so that the ''inmate knows what he has to defend himself against.''  The 37-year-old Mr. Sirhan is an inmate at Soledad Prison near Salinas, about 120 miles south of San Francisco. He was not present at today's hearing, but was represented by his lawyer, Luke McKissack of Los Angeles. He is expected to be present when a hearing panel of two or three members of the nine-member board takes evidence. No date has been set for that hearing or for the board's final decision, Mr. Brown said.  Today's hearing was the result of a petition to the board from District Attorney John K. Van de Kamp of Los Angeles County, where Mr. Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder on April 17, 1969, and sentenced to death May 22, 1969. Sirhan Wrote, 'RFK Must Die'  Senator Kennedy was shot in the head late in the night of June 4, 1968, as he passed through a kitchen service area between public rooms in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The shooting occurred moments after he had been declared the winner of the California Democratic Presidential primary election, which established him as the odds-on favorite for the Democratic Presidential nomination. The Senator died June 6.  Writings by Mr. Sirhan introduced at his trial showed he decided ''RFK must die'' because the Senator favored United States support of Israel. Mr. Sirhan, a Jordanian, opposed that.  The California Supreme Court overturned the state's capital punishment statute in 1972. Three years later, a parole date of Feb. 23, 1986, was established for Mr. Sirhan. Changes in the law have pushed the date to Sept. 1, 1984.  District Attorney Van de Kamp offered multiple grounds in his petition for rescission of that date. Mr. Brown said the board would not accept the argument that the date had been set under an invalid policy. But he indicated that the board was willing to consider rescission on the ground that evidence now available, but not available for the 1975 hearings, might show Mr. Sirhan in a different light. Letters Contained Threats  In his petition Mr. Van de Kamp produced an unsigned letter, which, he said, was written by Mr. Sirhan to a former attorney. It threatened Robert Blair Kaiser, a writer who was an investigator for the Sirhan defense team in 1959. The District Attorney's petition also contained a letter signed by Mr. Sirhan in which he threatened a Department of Corrections officer. The letters were written after the parole date had been set.  Mr. Van de Kamp also quoted two convicts and a former prison volunteer on statements by Mr. Sirhan showing him to be proud of having killed Senator Kennedy and of having said he would kill Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, should he be President in 1984.
