Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Citizens Financial Group agreed to acquire Charter One for $44.50 a share, or $10.5 billion.

Prudential Financial fell 78 cents, or 1.8%, to 43.73. The financial-product provider's first-quarter earnings grew, but some analysts were disappointed that more of a positive surprise wasn't delivered and said group-insurance earnings were a bit lighter than expected.  Sprint Corp. FON Group increased 56 cents, or 3.2%, to 17.95. Shares were upgraded to "buy" from "hold" by Deutsche Bank Securities, which called the local phone-service provider "an attractive asset," with a good mix of defensive and growth properties. Vivendi Universal advanced 40 cents, or 1.6%, to 25.71. The media company sold its Newsworld International channel to an investor group headed by former Vice President Al Gore, who wants to create a cable news network for young adults.
