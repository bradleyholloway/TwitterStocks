 Baseball the Hard Way   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1998  That thought occurred while watching the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres battle through the National League Championship Series that continues tonight in Atlanta. The Padres came into the affair off a worse-than-mediocre September (nine wins in 24 games) and a strenuous divisional series with the Houston Astros. The Braves entered laughing, having captured their last seven regular-season games and a three-game sweep over the Chicago Cubs in their first playoff round.  Atlanta's nonpareil starting pitchers -- John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux -- were rested and ready, always a bad sign for foes. Things got darker for the Pads when Greg Vaughn, their 50-home-run offensive leader, pulled a thigh muscle in the series opener and didn't reappear until he pinch hit late in game five on Monday night.  Then it was the Braves' turn to do the difficult. Facing a sweep before a hepped-up Qualcomm Stadium full house of 65,000 people on Sunday, they went into the seventh inning trailing 3-2 before rallying for six runs and an 8-3 win. The next night their ditch was deeper -- a 4-2 deficit -- and the inning was later -- the eighth. Moreover, their mound foe was Kevin Brown, the Padres' ace who'd surrendered just one run in 23 2/3 previous postseason innings. He'd been brought in in relief the inning before to end the series then and there.
