 McDonald's Puts Some Pricier Items On Sandwich Menu   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 1996  Beginning next week, the chain will replace the three white-meat sandwiches on its menu with more costly versions. The new "deluxe" grilled-chicken sandwich is likely to be priced a quarter or more than the grilled sandwich now being sold. The new fish sandwich could cost 20 cents more than the current Filet-O-Fish.  But raising prices at a time when traffic counts are down in many restaurants will be a delicate process. The Oak Brook, Ill., company is hoping that the new sandwiches, which like the Arch Deluxe hamburger are advertised as bigger and more flavorful, will attract customers willing to pay more.  "Customers expect to pay a premium for white-meat sandwiches. Yet they expect McDonald's to be at or below" competitors, says a McDonald's memo.
