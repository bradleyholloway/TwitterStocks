 Profit Dives at Hong Kong's C&W HKT --- Parent Says Results Unlikely to Derail CyberWorks Merger   By By Peter Wonacott, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2000  The former Hong Kong telephone monopoly said its after-tax profit dropped to HK$1.14 billion ($146.4 million) in the year ended March 31, from HK$11.51 billion a year earlier, partly resulting from write-offs of obsolete equipment. Revenue contracted 13% to HK$28.31 billion, and operating profit fell 29% to HK$8.46 billion. Still, the company recommended a second interim dividend of 45 Hong Kong cents, slightly lower than 46.6 Hong Kong cents paid out in the first half.  Linus Cheung, chief executive officer of HKT, attributed the drop in earnings to the "liberalization of the market and intense price competition." Revenue from international telephone service -- the business in Hong Kong that HKT had long dominated -- declined 38% amid an influx of rivals and new ways to call overseas. Mobile-phone service revenue, meanwhile, fell 15% as the government opened the industry to new operators and tolerated price wars among them.
