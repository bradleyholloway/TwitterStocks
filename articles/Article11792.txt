 Spain's Gonzalez, Clinton Will Focus On Economic Issues Dividing EC, U.S.   By By Carlta Vitzthum, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1993  When Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez meets President Bill Clinton for the first time today, the two leaders are likely to find they have a lot in common.  If an EC-U.S. pact is sealed today, a final accord among GATT's 105 member countries may be "possible, but I can't say it's probable" by a Dec. 15 deadline, the prime minister explained in an interview at the Moncloa Palace, his official residence on the outskirts of Madrid. "Europe shouldn't have a complex about these negotiations because Europe is the most open free-trade zone in the world, the region where the flow of exports and imports is the most fluid."  Mr. Gonzalez, who after 11 years in office is Europe's longest-serving socialist leader, says the U.S. should make an effort to understand Europe's request to protect its entertainment industry from U.S. exports. This "cultural exception" represents one of the last hurdles on the road to an EC-U.S. accord. Similarly, Mr. Gonzalez, 51 years old, advocates the creation of an multinational organization -- which the U.S. oppposes -- to oversee international trade and act as an arbitrator in times of conflict.
