 Italian Banks Seem Ripe for Deals; BNP Paribas Pact for BNL Could Set Off Wave of Merger Activity   By Jason Singer and Gabriel Kahn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2006  BNP aims to bring its cross-selling expertise to Italy with the pending BNL acquisition, Mr. [Baudouin Prot] said. The French bank concentrates on selling multiple products to customers, such as consumer finance and asset management services. Such broad offerings are also part of what is spurring European consolidation, industry observers say. "It's starting already, and I'm glad BNP can be one of the first movers. It's better to be early," Mr. Prot says.  Unipol's board approved the sale of its stake in BNL on Saturday. BBVA, which had been considering another bid for BNL, said it, too, would sell its shares to BNP Paribas. The price BNP Paribas is paying would yield a 600 million euros gain for the Spanish bank, BBVA said. BBVA holds about a 15% stake in 93-year-old BNL.  In contrast with the Unipol bid, which BNL's management had regarded as hostile, Rome-based BNL appeared enthusiastic about the offer from Paris. Luigi Abete, BNL's chairman, said that the BNP Paribas offer was "an opportunity for growth within a large European [banking] group." He also said that he had been asked to remain as chairman.
