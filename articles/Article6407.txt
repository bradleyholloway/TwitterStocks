 Investors Bemoan Dearth of Buzz On Week's IPOs; Most End Above Offer Price, But With Little Excitement; 'Star Quality' Is Missing   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2005  The initial public offerings scheduled for this week range from a robotic massage-chair producer to a chemical manufacturer that hasn't been profitable in years. They aren't generating a lot of buzz, market observers say.  "What's missing is we need one of those star-quality deals to be filed like DreamWorks or Google so people have something to look at on the horizon that they really want. Then you can bring other deals in the wake of it," said Ben Holmes, a managing member of Protege Funds LLC, an investment firm in Boulder, Colo. "There's a bunch of disparate deals, none of which are very exciting."
