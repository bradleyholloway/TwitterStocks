 Is This The Next President Of France?; On 'Sexiest' List and Populist Fast Track, Candidate Reflects New Distaste for Old Guard   By Galloni, Alessandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2007  Mr. [Francois Hollande] says she's simply a strong-willed thinker. "She's not afraid of conflict. She's not afraid of telling you you're wrong or if she doesn't like you, of not shaking your hand," he says. "She doesn't care about protocol."  Ms. Royal's path diverged from Mr. Hollande's. He was promoted to spokesman for two Socialist governments and was elected to the National Assembly. She remained at the Elysee. "Our political lives have always been separate," says Mr. Hollande. "I've always said to her: 'You try your lot without me.'"  Amid the protests, Ms. Royal's promises to listen to people's problems and her call for a "just order" resonated with voters. "She understood the state of the people," says Mr. Hollande. "She portrayed an image that she could protect them from their fear of the future."
