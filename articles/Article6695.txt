 Iran Denies U.N. Inspection Team Access to Nuclear Power Plant   By By David Crawford, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2003  Russia, Iran's main civilian nuclear sponsor, had urged Tehran to cooperate with the IAEA, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, but has given mixed signals about its support for Washington. President Vladimir Putin appeared to line up with the U.S. when he told a Group of Eight meeting earlier this month that Russia would delay delivering fuel to a nuclear-power plant it is building in Iran until the Islamic Republic agreed to tighter IAEA inspections. But Russian officials later said Moscow wasn't making any such demand, claiming bureaucratic delays have held up the deal to ship fuel for the plant. Despite the rhetoric, Russia hasn't finalized the agreement to send the fuel.  Yesterday, a State Department official told reporters in Washington that the U.S. has incontrovertible evidence that Iran is enriching uranium for the production of nuclear weapons, and that the nation could produce two or three nuclear bombs by the end of the decade, or possibly sooner. The official said Iran should submit to inspections without any preconditions and added that the U.S. would oppose Iran's acquisition of advanced technology until it was more open about its nuclear program.
