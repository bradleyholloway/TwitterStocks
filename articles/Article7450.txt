 Montreal Exchange, Pioneering Again, Plans Gold Futures With Cash Delivery   By By Alan Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1985  The Montreal Exchange plans to continue its pioneering ways, seeking trading niches the bigger exchanges have ignored, by opening the first gold futures contract calling for delivery of cash rather than bullion.  The proposed contract is set to start trading next month. The little Canadian exchange also was the first in North America to trade currency options, now one of the world's hottest markets. Its gold options-trading link with Amsterdam, now expanded to include Vancouver and Sydney, was the first international linkage of its kind.  Montreal also won over the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's biggest futures exchange, which selected Montreal's Market Portfolio Index as the basis of its Canadian stock-index futures contract set for introduction this year. A Board of Trade spokesman said the Chicago exchange also had talked with the much-larger Toronto Stock Exchange, but "we chose Montreal because they seemed to be the most interested, the most innovative and the most willing to take the step."
