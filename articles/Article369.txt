19820101
The longest stakes race of the year was dec ided by a few whiskers yesterday as Field Cat nosed out Peat Moss in the last stride to win the $84,900 Display Handicap at Aqueduct.  It took a 16-pound weight advantage and a track record to defeat Peat Moss, a 6-year-old gelding who has six screws holding his right front leg together. Field Cat, a 4-year-old colt owned by C.V. Whitney and trained by Elliott Burch, carried 110 pounds; Peat Moss, the 3-5 favorite, carried top weight of 126.  Field Cat carried Eric Beitia through the 2 1/4 miles in 3:51 4/5, one and four-fifths seconds faster than the previous record, held by Seaney Bear.  Field Cat paid $13.40 for $2 to win as the third choice in the wagering. The winner and Peat Moss are sons of Herbager, a longwinded grass runner. Change the Patch was almost eight lengths back in third.  Peat Moss took the lead at the final turn after two trips around the oval and opened a two-length lead, but Field Cat, last at the break, circled the field and wore him down from the outside. MacBeth Is Leader for Meeting  Yesterday's card concluded the 1981 Aqueduct winter meeting. Donald MacBeth rode three winners to become the leading jockey. MacBeth had trailed Richard Migliore by two winners going into Wednesday's program but won six races in the last two days while Migliore won none.  It was MacBeth's first riding title in New York. He had led the standings at Monmouth, Hialeah and Atlantic City in recent years and began riding full time in New York this fall.  Migliore was the leading jockey of 1981 in New York, with 269 victories to 218 for Angel Cordero. Migliore, who is 18, rode 247 winners while he was an apprentice rider with a five-pound weight allowance. Cordero led with 30 stakes-winning rides.  Frank (Pancho) Martin was the leading trainer for the ninth consecutive year. The title was his 10th in the last 11 years. Working as usual with a stable of patched-up claiming horses, a few of whom he rehabilitated enough to win minor stakes, Martin sent out 132 winners.  His son, Jose Martin, saddled the winners of more stakes races than any other trainer in the state this year, all of them for Flying Zee Stable. Wayward Lass, the champion 3-year-old filly, had five and Noble Nashua had three of the stable's 11 added-money triumphs. Attendance Drops Slightly  Total attendance for 309 days of racing at Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga in 1981 was 5.35 million, a drop of 0.5 percent from 1980. But the daily average of 17,328 was a gain of 0.5 percent because four programs at Aqueduct in 1981 were canceled because of snow.  The end of the calendar year in racing also means, literally, that the runners are a year older. By decree of the Jockey Club, Jan. 1 is every race horse's birthday, regardless of the date of birth.  Pleasant Colony turns 4 and begins his career as a sire; Deputy Minister turns 3 and heads the crop of Kentucky Derby aspirants; Affirmed's and Alydar's first sons and daughters, who were born last winter and spring, become yearlings today and will start going through auctions in a few months and begin racing in 1983.
