 Edwards's Task Is Clear: Convert Iowa Poll Surge Into Caucus Votes   By Schlesinger, Jacob M, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  Mr. [John Edwards]'s poll higher numbers are mirrored in the raucous overflow crowds he has been drawing as he seeks to claim Mr. [Howard Dean]'s populist crown. Mr. Edwards, who first ran for public office in his 1998 Senate bid, likes to say, "I haven't been in politics my whole life," while referring to Mr. Dean as "somebody who has been in politics for 20 years." (Mr. Dean, who did serve in Vermont state government for two decades but has never held national office, has taken to countering: "When you go to Washington, you're a Washington politician, whether you've been there four years or 27.")  He may need to do that for people such as Paul J. Horvath, an 89- year-old postal-service retiree who was there. Mr. Horvath says he buys into Mr. Edwards's message completely. "He came up the hard way, while them other guys are pretty well-heeled," he says of a candidate who repeatedly refers to himself as the "son of a millworker." Mr. Horvath says he probably won't set aside all of Monday evening to vote, as caucus rules require, explaining, "It's my wife's birthday."  "I don't like the media deciding before the polls," says 60-year-old Karen Soike, awaiting Mr. Edwards at a recent rally. "It's arrogant to say Dean has already won -- that's what got me out here."
