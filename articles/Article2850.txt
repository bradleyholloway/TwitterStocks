 Tastings: Fred and Ginger, Lamb and Cabernet --- Tips on How to Find Wine That Brings Out the Best In Food, and Vice Versa   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  Even experts rarely agree on the "perfect" match. We looked at some good Internet sites for advice on matching wine with roast leg of lamb. They suggested Merlot, Chianti, red Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Dolcetto, Beaujolais, Cotes-du-Rhone, Bordeaux, Barolo, Barbaresco, Shiraz, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel. Wow. What's a cook to do? We decided to conduct our own test. As it happened, we were on our way to Atlanta for a family reunion, where Dottie's mother always prepares her famous roast leg of lamb.  A couple of tasters, including Dottie, believed a Merlot from Bogle (1999 "Old Vine Cuvee") was the winner. Before dinner, it was simply soft and pleasant, a nice "glass of Merlot" at a smoky bar. With the lamb, Dottie felt that the creaminess, softness and simple smoothness of the wine created something special -- not just a good taste pairing, but a "warming effect" that made the whole meal seem more homey and delicious. She also felt a little acid kick at the end of the wine -- generally wines with good acids go better with food -- was a nice finish with a bite of lamb.  So next time we have Grandma Dot's lamb, if we don't have access to an older Bordeaux, we'll likely have a Cabernet Sauvignon or a somewhat soft young Bordeaux, like a Margaux. But that's just us. Make your own decisions based on what you like. After all, in that whole list of the experts' recommendations, there's not a single white wine. And while roast lamb seems like a red-wine dish, there are many people who don't like red wine. Does that mean they should give up lamb altogether, or have no wine with lamb? Of course not. They should just think about a "bigger" white wine -- a Viognier, for instance.
