 SmithKline Test Halt Stirs Worry Over Family of Cardiac Medicines   By By Ron Winslow and Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  The latest findings prompted Eric Topol, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the lotrafiban trial, to call for a "moratorium" on further human studies of the medicines, at least until reasons for the higher number of deaths can be discerned. Taking tests of the other drugs into account, Dr. Topol said there is cumulative evidence of at least a 33% higher incidence of mortality in patients getting one of the four experimental drugs, compared with a placebo, in studies involving more than 43,000 patients. "It's hard to imagine that any agent in this class is going to be immune from the problem," Dr. Topol said.  Dr. Topol said that more than 1,000 patients were already enrolled in the lotrafiban trial when studies of the other compounds raised questions about their safety and efficacy. He said he raised the possibility in August 1999 with SmithKline and other researchers of stopping the trial then, over concerns about how well it would work.  Still, Dr. Topol said he and other researchers decided then to increase the number of scheduled safety and efficacy checks of the data to make sure patients weren't put at undue risk for participating in the study. "The hope was that any [lack of benefit] would show up before any excess in mortality," Dr. Topol said. "It all showed up together," in the review that prompted the halt to the study.
