 Apple's New Items Are Made to Back `Digital Hub' View   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  Mr. Jobs, at the opening of the MacWorld trade fair, rejected the notion that personal computers were being replaced by other devices and said Apple's machines "can be the digital hub of our emerging digital lifestyle." To that end, he unveiled two applications: a software jukebox called iTunes, designed to work with MP3 players, and a DVD authoring software dubbed iDVD for use with camcorders and DVD players.  In addition, Mr. Jobs said Apple's next-generation operating system, Mac OS X, will be released officially on March 24. He also introduced an upgraded line of Power Mac G4 desktop computers that boast more megahertz power and are equipped with CD-RW drives -- two elements critics had said Apple's machines lacked. Mr. Jobs capped his presentation with the unveiling of the Titanium PowerBook G4, a line of laptop computers much thinner than other notebooks currently on the market.  Mr. Jobs said the product introductions "will take time" to spread, but said he was optimistic about Apple's strategy as a digital hub. He said iTunes and iDVD are just the latest Apple software applications to take advantage of other devices; iMovie, a video-editing program released about a year ago, already complements the camcorder, said Mr. Jobs. He added that Apple is working on software to accompany other devices, such as cellphones and hand-held computers.
