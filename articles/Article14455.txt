 Western Co.'s Filing for Bankruptcy May Hasten Oil-Service Consolidation   By By Caleb Solomon and Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1988  Western Co. of North America said it could emerge from bankruptcy court proceedings with a merger, accelerating the consolidation of the oil-service industry.  Western said it has held talks with BJ-Titan Services Co., a joint venture between Baker Hughes Inc., Houston, and Dresser Industries Inc., Dallas. The company said, however, it isn't currently holding merger talks.  In fact, one oil industry official said Baker Hughes, itself formed by a merger last year, has indicated it would be more interested in some kind of combination at a later time because BJ-Titan would then be in a stronger position.
