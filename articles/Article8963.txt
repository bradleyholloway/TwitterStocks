 MedPartners Loss For First Quarter Was $25.7 Million   By By Anita Sharpe, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1998  MedPartners Inc. had a first-quarter loss but said its shortfall narrowed substantially from the fourth quarter, when troubles in its western operations led to massive red ink.  The company also said that stringent cost cutting, layoffs, and an aggressive drive to boost revenue should return its operations to profitability this year. Mac Crawford, president and chief executive officer, said he plans a conference call today to lay out expectations for operating earnings of 20 cents to 25 cents a diluted share this year and 70 cents in 1999.  MedPartners, Birmingham, Ala., said it will today report a loss of $25.7 million, or 14 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $44.4 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. MedPartners said its operating loss was $7.4 million, or four cents a share.
