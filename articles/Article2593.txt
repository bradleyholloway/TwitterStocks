 Booked Up: Big Accounting Firms, Striving to Cut Costs, Irritate Small Clients --- Many Companies Say Service Has Slipped Badly, Hurt In Part by Staff Turnover --- `I Got Tired of Being Ignored'   By By Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1994  Six months ago, Mr. Feinstein's Lincoln, R.I., video-rental company, Northeast Management Inc., switched from Ernst & Young, the nation's second-biggest accounting firm, to Kahn, Litwin & Co., a Providence, R.I., firm with one office and a staff of only 17. "I got tired of being ignored," Mr. Feinstein says.  An Ernst & Young partner declines to comment specifically on Mr. Feinstein's complaints. A spokesman for Ernst & Young says it continues to give good service to small companies. But similar complaints across the country go far toward explaining why many big companies in field after field are losing clients to smaller competitors.  In big-time accounting, where mergers and slow revenue growth have intensified cost-cutting, many small clients are so irritated they are leaving, shifting to regional and local firms. In the past two years, the Big Six accounting firms lost 239 public audit clients to local firms, while gaining only 159 such clients, according to a study by Strafford Publications Inc., which publishes the Public Accounting Report newsletter. In the early 1980s, when the accounting business was booming, the Big Six won many more clients away from local firms than they lost, accountants say.
