 Is Jordan's New Heir Fit to Be King?   By By Robert L. Pollock, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1999  Weeks of speculation about the future of the Jordanian monarchy ended last week when King Hussein, who had removed his brother Hassan from the post of crown prince, appointed his eldest son, 36-year-old Abdullah, to take his place. King Hussein, who has suffered from cancer, then left unexpectedly to return to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, leaving Abdullah in charge.  Little is known about Crown Prince Abdullah's fitness for office or political leanings, and even less is known about how the sudden change in succession will affect the country's fragile political situation. But it is hard to regard these events without some regret. King Hussein's 46-year rule may make his Hashemite kingdom look like a bulwark of stability. Yet it is only his unique combination of charisma, intelligence and luck (he has survived at least 12 assassination attempts) that have allowed him to hold together this little country plagued by hostile neighbors, endowed with few natural resources, and where his Bedouin tribesmen are a minority.  Prince Hassan, who served as crown prince for 34 years, seemed to possess those gifts too, as well as an appropriate suspicion of Yasser Arafat's intentions born of 1970 uprisings and assassination attempts backed by the Palestine Liberation Organization. Indeed, Prince Hassan had a notably cold reaction to President Clinton's December speech suggesting U.S. support for a Palestinian state in the West Bank. The king and his brother, while officially supportive of such a state, fear what it might mean for their country.
