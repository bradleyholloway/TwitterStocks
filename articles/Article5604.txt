 Seagram Seeks Levy's Departure From PolyGram   By By Bruce Orwall and Eben Shapiro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1998  Mr. (Alain) Levy's departure would clear the way for Seagram to name Doug Morris, currently chairman of its own Universal Music Group, to head the combined music operations of Seagram and PolyGram. An agreement leading to Mr. Levy's departure, though not yet final, could be reached later this week.  Seagram last month agreed to acquire Philips Electronics NV's 75% stake in PolyGram for approximately $59 a share in cash and stock. The same offer is being made to the holders of PolyGram's publicly traded shares. The deal would instantly transform Seagram's Universal Studios Inc. from a modest player in the music industry into a titan. Its roster of artists would include PolyGram stars U2, Hanson, Elton John and Universal's Beck and George Strait.
