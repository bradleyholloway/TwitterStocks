 Crisis of Political Confidence   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2002  We doubt investors were any more comforted by Mr. [Bush]'s endorsement of SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt's Fortune 1,000 review. In effect, the SEC is responding to WorldCom and Enron by knocking down the doors of companies that have given no evidence of wrongdoing, ripping through their books and looking for things to criticize. An SEC chief is supposed to provide adult supervision, but Mr. Pitt is by now so politically compromised he can save his job only by unleashing every 26-year-old securities examiner out to make a reputation.  At his Monday press conference Mr. Bush committed the gaffe of telling the truth: that not all auditing disputes are black and white. The blue-chip drug company Merck was clobbered this week over a completely spurious accounting scandal that forced the postponement of its long-planned Medco spin-off. Yet had Merck not recorded the controversial co-payments as revenue, somebody would be flaying it now for inflating profit margins.  Listening to the stock market has saved Presidents a lot of grief. JFK was quickly shown the error of his ways when he tried to fake his way around an inflation problem by blasting steel industry CEOs for a price hike. Mr. Bush's father might have earned a second term if he hadn't gone along with a credit-killing reign of terror against bank directors and loan officers sponsored by a Congress trying to live down its connection to the S&L scandal.
