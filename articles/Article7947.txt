 CBS Wooing Team That Produces Nation's 3 Top Network-TV Shows   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1989  The No.3-ranked network is in discussions with Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, whose Carsey-Werner Co. produces "The Cosby Show" and "A Different World" for National Broadcasting Co. and "Roseanne" for Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s network. NBC is a unit of General Electric Co.  One individual with knowledge of the discussions, but who didn't want to be identified, said it was "probable" that CBS would hire Ms. Carsey. Initially, both producers were mentioned to come as a team, but as talks continued, Ms. Carsey's name emerged as the leading candidiate. This source said that hiring only Ms. Carsey, would prevent major complications of how Carsey-Werner Co. would continue to function. The company is developing a new series for NBC, "Grand", about a trailer park.  CBS desperately needs to inject new life into its programming. Last week, it turned in its worst-ever performance for a November ratings period. Moreover, the network hasn't produced a new program that finished among the top 25 network shows since "Murder, She Wrote" in 1984. If a deal could be structured, Ms. Carsey and Mr. Werner would succeed Earle H. "Kim" LeMasters III, who resigned as president of the CBS Entertainment division last Thursday.
