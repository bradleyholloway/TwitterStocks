 Aids Specialists in New York State Struggle With Antique Albany Lab   The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1989  ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Scientists at the world's busiest AIDS testing laboratory face not only blood samples contaminated with a deadly disease, but peeling paint, exploding lightbulbs and a sink with no drain.  New York, a leader in AIDS testing and research in this country largely because it has more AIDS patients than any other state, does most of this key scientific work in a laboratory built in 1917.  "It's kind of ironic," said Colleen Flood, a bacteriologist who runs the program that tests newborns for presence of the AIDS-related human immunovirus (HIV). "We're down here doing work that's at the forefront. When people come in here . . . they say, 'How can you work in such a dilapidated lab?'"
