 British Funeral Firm Says It's Dead Set Against Bid from U.S. --- Service Corp. of Houston Just Doesn't Understand Way We Operate, Officer States   By By Janet Guyon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1994  "We have great reservations about our business in SCI's hands," says Eric Norman Spencer, the U.K. company's deputy chairman and chief executive officer. "I'm sure they'd try, but we don't believe they know enough about our business."  SCI started out with a faux pas, as well. Its officials first showed up on May 30, Bank Holiday Monday, says Mr. Spencer. "They flew into Heathrow in their private jet, made contact with our chairman and said they wanted a response by Friday," says Mr. Spencer, speaking indignantly from his car phone. "You don't turn up on Bank Holiday Monday" in England with a takeover offer, he says. "No one works on a bank holiday."  Second, says Mr. Spencer, SCI doesn't understand the cultural differences between bereaved Britons and Americans. Since World War I, the British generally have burned rather than buried their dead, making funerals cheaper and less garish than American ones. Caskets are much less expensive -- about #100 ($155) for a simple box of veneered wood compared with $2,000 for an 18-gauge metal casket, says Mr. Spencer.
