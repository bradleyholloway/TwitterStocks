 Futures & Options: Operatic Flourishes   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  VERDI'S TAKE ON Shakespeare's tragedy of jealousy and love was his next-to-last opera, and took the opera world by storm when it made its debut in 1887. No one thought the old composer still had it in him to create such a vibrant masterwork. It's a major role for a commanding tenor ([Placido Domingo] has pretty much owned it for years). Here, Mark Lundberg makes his Utah Opera debut as the Moor who falls prey to Iago -- and the green-eyed monster. Evening performances at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $12 to $60.  START 'EM YOUNG. The Boston Lyric Opera is staging Bizet's "Carmen" on Boston Common, the city's first opera production at that location. It will preface Saturday's performance with a family day devoted to opera. Families can meet performers and crew and learn about opera stagecraft from technical staff. Events start at 2 p.m.; "Carmen" itself begins at 7 p.m. Rossini's "The Barber of Seville" opens the company's formal fall season Oct. 2.  "ARIADNE" has a backstage plot: the hurdles of writing and putting on an opera called "Ariadne." Audiences get to sample that opera-within-an-opera, and it's worth a wait. Star soprano Deborah Voigt gets to shine in some music that recalls Wagner at his dreamiest. Coming up here also is a new production of Olivier Messaien's "St. Francis." Messaien, a 20th-century French composer, was deeply religious, and this work examines the saint's ministry. For the truly devoted: It's five hours long. Performances generally at 8 p.m.; "St. Francis" at 6:30 p.m. Tickets $24 to $175.
