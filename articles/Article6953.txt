 Toyota Lobbies to Avoid Blame Amid U.S. Auto Industry Woes   By Shirouzu, Norihiko, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2005  Toyota's concern stems from its continued rapid growth in the U.S. even as General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. struggle to stabilize market share and fight high costs and excess manufacturing capacity. Yuki Funo, a Toyota senior managing director, said that the company is aiming to sell 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. by 2008, which should amount to roughly a 15% share of the U.S. auto market, and that the plan poses a delicate problem for Toyota given Detroit's malaise.  Toyota also has boosted prices of 2006 model-year vehicles by slightly less than 1% on average. Toyota officials have said the price increase reflects higher costs for procuring steel and other materials, but it also follows a comment earlier this year by Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda, who said Japan's auto industry needed to give Detroit "time and room to catch a breath." He even suggested Toyota might raise prices on cars sold in the U.S. to ease competitive pressures on GM and Ford, although a spokesman later denied that was taking place.
