 Politics & Policy; CAPITAL JOURNAL: Iowa Canvassing Shows Labor's Split Among Democrats   By Harwood, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2004  "Our guys . . . are the ones who wake up every morning wondering if their plant's going to shut down and ship their jobs to Mexico," says Chuck Rocha, the United Steelworkers political director, who is on leave to work for Mr. [Dick Gephardt]'s campaign. "We're fighting twice as hard because our future is on the line."  "All politics is personal," notes Chuck Harple, a top Teamsters official who has relocated here to help Mr. Gephardt. "Now it's gone to another level. They think everybody's going to come back together and hold hands [in the fall]. I think it's going to take a bit longer."  Mr. Gephardt's labor forces are larger; some 21 unions with 95,000 Iowa members are behind him. Mr. [Howard Dean]'s union target audience, chiefly from the AFSCME and SEIU, is only one-third that size. Mr. Rocha says the upscale shift in America's employment hemorrhage, sending software jobs to low-wage competitors such as India, expands Mr. Gephardt's reach still further by "helping us dig into that more elite crowd" in the Des Moines suburbs.
