 Instant Message Goes Corporate; `You Can't Hide'   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  IM users typically have a window on one side of their screen that contains a list of their chosen correspondents, each with an icon that indicates whether the "buddy" is available, busy or not logged on. Some IM systems allow users to show they are in the office even if they aren't, but the social conventions that have developed around instant messaging prompt most to be honest. David Marshak, an IM user and analyst at Patricia Seybold Group, a market researcher in Boston, says that in many workplaces, failing to respond quickly to an IM is considered rude, so workers have an incentive to sign out when they leave their office, or show themselves as "busy" when they know they can't reply for a while.  Despite these concerns, IM is taking off in corporations. Initially it was brought in by 20-somethings who simply download free IM software from AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online, Yahoo Inc. or Microsoft Corp.'s MSN to maintain the connections they got used to in college. Sometimes, parents at work use IM to let latchkey teens at home see that they are only an instant message away.  Increasingly, though, companies are installing internal IM systems, using products like International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus SameTime software, or a package called IM and Presence Platform from Bantu Inc. of Washington, D.C. Brokerage firms use systems that archive IMs for regulatory purposes, such as ones made by FaceTime Communications Inc. of San Francisco and Communicator Inc. of White Plains, N.Y. Microsoft's Windows Office XP package includes instant messaging as a free component, which should spread IM rapidly as companies upgrade to the product. Currently, none of these systems can talk to each other, so many people have a company IM system and a separate IM system for family and friends.
