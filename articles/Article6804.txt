 WSJ(5/12)UPDATE:Argentina Creates Energy Co To Ease Gas Woes   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2004  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) By Laurence Norman Dow Jones Newswires BUENOS AIRES -- In Argentina's latest attempt to grapple with a burgeoning energy crisis, President Nestor Kirchner announced the creation of a new state energy company charged with expanding the country's natural-gas transport capacity and undertaking joint investments in oil and gas exploration.  Argentina's energy problems are twofold. First, a 28-month rate freeze precipitated by a national financial crisis has discouraged investment by gas producers and pushed demand sharply higher. That has created shortages, which, along with low water levels, have resulted in power shortages. Second, expansion in gas-transport capacity has stalled.  Analysts say Argentina's gas demand likely will outstrip supply by about 10 million cubic meters (350 million cubic feet) daily this year, representing 8% of transport capacity. Yet if gas output satisfied demand, transport limits still would leave the country short by about 7.5 million cubic meters daily, according to a March report by gas regulator Enargas.
