 Fired Officials Keep Some Health Care   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2007  Four out of five Cobra-eligible workers don't take the benefit, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group pushing to expand coverage of the uninsured. "The problem is that people eligible for Cobra have to pay the full freight -- and they have to do so at a time when they're unemployed and don't have the resources," Mr. Pollack said. "It's simply unrealistic to expect them to buy into that coverage."
