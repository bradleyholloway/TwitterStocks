 House Panel Clears Obstacle To Tax Measure --- Revenue-Neutrality Proviso Ended; Progress on Bill Is Expected to Be Slow   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1985  The House Ways and Means Committee cleared away a major obstacle to tax-overhaul legislation and appears ready to get down to work. But progress is likely to be slow and difficult.  The lack of "revenue neutral" discipline means "you could end up with a package that doesn't do very much," warned Rep. Edgar Jenkins (D., Ga.). The process will be further complicated, because lawmakers chose to make current tax law their base, instead of either the staff alternative or President Reagan's tax-overhaul proposal.  A clear majority of the committee appears ready to vote to raise the top individual tax rate higher than the 35% insisted on by President Reagan. The current top rate is 50%. But Rep. Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) doesn't want to move too quickly to raise the rate, fearing he might push the president to oppose the panel's efforts.
