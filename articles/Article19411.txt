 North Korea Proves To Be a Tough Sell In the Cruise Game   By By Zach Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2001  Since the cruise tours started in November 1998, Hyundai Group affiliates Hyundai Asan and Hyundai Merchant Marine have had losses of more than $240 million on the effort. Although official North Korean media reports blame the losses on U.S. suggestions that fees Hyundai pays to North Korea are funneled to the military, the more serious problem is Hyundai's failure to broaden the tour's appeal.  The cruise tours would benefit from being able to offer more than just views of Mount Kumgang. But the cruise ships Hyundai used for the tour are nearly 30 years old and offer few of the attractions that regional line Star Cruises PLC offers, Mr. [Nigel Summers] says, save for a mixed Russian-Filipino cabaret. Mount Kumgang does feature a spa and a nightly acrobatic show, but Mr. Summers says he found the show disturbing after an injured performer was dragged off the stage. The only souvenir he could find was a tome of "Tourist Recipes of Pyongyang" that he has yet to test.
