 Economists Now Have Hard Proof That U.S. Dollar Isn't Shrinking   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1986  Through a curious mix-up, the coin -- to be made available to the public around Thanksgiving -- will be a bit bigger than the U.S. Mint had planned. In fact, it will be the largest silver coin the government has ever produced.  The confusion started last year, while the bill to create the silver piece was being drafted. Mint officials noticed that the diameter specified -- 40.6 millimeters, or about 1 9/16 inches -- was some 6% larger than that of most U.S. silver dollars.  Some coin dealers are looking on the bright side.
