 Natural Gas Is Likely to Stay Pricey; Demand Surges as Economy Recovers, While Producers Struggle Just to Keep Pace   By Gold, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2004  "What we see currently and what we see over the horizon in the next year or two is at best in North America a flat-supply scenario," says Darryl Smette, a senior vice president at Devon Energy Corp., of Oklahoma City, the largest U.S. independent producer of natural gas. "Over the past three or four years, the wells we are drilling in North America have tended to find fewer reserves with greater declines when those reserves start producing."  By pouring cash into acquisitions, energy producers are merely swapping reserves, not adding new reserves. Bear Stearns analyst Ellen K. Hannan noted in a recent report that in 2001, the last time more than 1,000 rigs were drilling for natural gas in the U.S., companies replaced 97% of the reserves they took out of the ground with new finds, essentially keeping the cupboard stocked for future years. In 2003, companies replaced 84% of the reserves they took out of the ground.  That concern applies to the long term as well as this summer. A warmer-than-usual summer would tax supplies as natural-gas-fueled power plants are started up to keep air conditioners humming. "The terrifying thing is if we have a hot summer," says Robert Esser, a senior consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, "you could have summer [price] spikes." The underlying reason, he says, is growing demand and flat supply. In 2001 and 2003, cold weather led to extraordinary price increases in the winter, when natural gas surged past $10 a million BTUs, but there haven't been such extreme summer price increases before.
