 The Middle Seat: One Reason Airlines Keep Flying Despite Huge Losses: GE; No. 1 Aircraft Lessor Aims To Avoid Grounding Planes; One Side Effect: Low Fares   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2004  No single entity has done more than GE to keep the sickest airlines flying world-wide. GE says it has invested more than $7 billion in airlines around the world since the 2001 terrorist attacks. GE helped prop up America West Airlines and helped finance Air Canada's reorganization. GE is the biggest creditor at bankrupt UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, with $1.6 billion at stake. Ditto for US Airways, where GE has nearly $3 billion at stake, according to financial filings.  Mr. [Henry Hubschman] says GE is standing firm at some U.S. carriers he won't name -- and says GE likely will pull planes out of failing airlines soon. Already, GE has a still-unannounced deal to take 18 airplanes out of the U.S. and lease them abroad. GE also has taken back planes from many foreign airlines, such as Brazil's Varig and Italy's Volare.  At US Airways, GE has hedged its bet. The carrier was in need of cash last month, and GE was willing to help -- but it also wanted to start limiting its exposure by taking some of its airplanes back. US Airways agreed to give up only 25 -- 10 Airbus 319s and 15 Boeing 737- 300s. GE says it already has found new homes for all 25. (These planes are unrelated to the other 18 GE planes soon to leave the U.S.) Foreign airlines will take the 319s; the 737s likely will be converted to cargo carriers.
