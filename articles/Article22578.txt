 Deals & Dealmakers: Buyout Magnates Watch Wyndham Stock Fall Despite Nascent Turnaround Effort   By By Mitchell Pacelle and Neal Templin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  Messrs. (Leon) Black and (Thomas H.) Lee led an investment group that agreed in March to throw the Dallas company, which owns the Wyndham chain, a $1 billion lifeline, in exchange for a controlling ownership stake of between 29% and 41%, depending on the outcome of a pending securities offering. Since then, the two buyout-industry pioneers -- who have racked up impressive long-term investment records -- have watched the stock of Patriot, renamed Wyndham International Inc., plunge more than 50% in value.  The deal highlights the risks faced by buyout firms investing in troubled companies that are publicly traded. When Messrs. Black and Lee negotiated the investment in December -- outbidding a group made up of Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Wall Street's Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- Wyndham's stock had already dropped close to 80%, and some real-estate experts saw a bottom. But since then, Wyndham has been pulled down even further by investors' continued flight from real-estate stocks, with hotel stocks among the hardest hit.  Patriot American was the epitome of the 1990s real-estate company. With former New York lawyer Paul Nussbaum at the helm, the company financed a 450-hotel buying spree with the proceeds from the sale of stock, mountains of short-term debt and unusual securities called "equity forward contracts," which represented bets that the company's stock would rise. When the stock began falling last year, Patriot faced a liquidity crisis that brought it to the brink of insolvency, even though its hotels remained profitable.
