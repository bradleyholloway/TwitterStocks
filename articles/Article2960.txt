 Gov. Davis's California Budget Is Faulted As `Optimistic' by a Nonpartisan Analyst   By By Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2002  SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Gov. Gray Davis's $100 billion budget for 2003 is full of "overly optimistic assumptions" about stock-market-related tax revenues and help from the federal government, the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst said in one of her sharpest critiques ever of a governor's spending plan.  Legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill also said the governor wrongly assumed that the state's current budget shortfall -- estimated to widen to as much as $12.5 billion by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2003 -- is a temporary one, largely the result of of a recession that many believe will be mild and short-lived. Ms. Hill estimated the state will face yet another budget deficit -- an estimated $4 billion -- by the end of the next budget year, on June 30, 2004.
