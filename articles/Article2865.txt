 Breakaway (A Special Report): Surviving a Slowdown --- He's Too Heavy, He's My Brother --- When slowdowns hit family businesses, the resulting cutbacks can leave wounds that never heal   By By Shirley Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2001  There had to be layoffs at the family business. During solitary walks, Mr. Covarrubias considered several of his 12 employees, but he kept returning to his younger brother, who had been at the firm for 30 years. [Bobby Covarrubias], the office manager, oversaw everything from billing to blueprinting. But with no wife, no kids and no mortgage to pay, Bobby could manage without a paycheck.  Davis Blue Print, being tied to the construction business, has had to contend with tough economic times before. It also wasn't the first time that [Raymond Covarrubias] had to lay off his brother, Bobby. During the recession in the early 1980s, Bobby was laid off for more than six months. Then in a recession 10 years later, Bobby worked just part time for nearly a year. With business still slow in 1996, Raymond had to lay off one of his own twin sons, Tony, for about a year.  Growing up in a poor family with five siblings in a rough neighborhood of Lincoln Heights, just east of downtown Los Angeles, Raymond Covarrubias started working at age seven, shining shoes. When he was 16, a high-school guidance counselor recommended him to Leslie Davis, who ran Davis Blue Print & Equipment Co., and Mr. Covarrubias began delivering blueprints around the city for Mr. Davis. By the time he was 22, Mr. Covarrubias ran the place when Mr. Davis went on vacation. When Mr. Davis decided to retire in 1967, he lent Mr. Covarrubias and his wife $500 to buy the company. He was 26, his wife, 25.
