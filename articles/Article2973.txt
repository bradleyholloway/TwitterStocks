 Two Late Industrialists Provide Weapons in Clean-Air Wars --- Foundations Differ as Capitol Hill Debate Nears Over Pollution Cuts   By By John Fialka, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  In Congress, the media and the courts, the foundations' opinions get cycled and recycled. This year, the debate on Capitol Hill will be over whether to amend the Clean Air Act to require slashing emissions of three major pollutants -- mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides -- or whether to also demand reductions of a fourth -- carbon dioxide -- given a widespread belief that curbing the latter could help slow global warming. President [George W. Bush] today is expected to lay out the framework for a bill that would mandate cuts in the first three pollutants.  The seven [J. Howard Pew] foundations, the first of which he launched in 1948, spread their money among charitable and conservative causes, often anonymously. Then in 1990, a younger generation of the family shifted money toward environmental issues, especially climate change. "We needed to put this on the public's radar screen to make things happen," says Joshua S. Reichert, an anthropologist who directs Pew's environmental programs. Neither he nor Ms. [Rebecca Rimel] are family members, though the family will speak only through Ms. Rimel.  The problem, as Mr. Reichert saw it, was that no environmental group had the money or the capability to do the polling, advertising, grass-roots organizing and media work needed for a national campaign. He drew up the specifications for NET, and Pew was the largest contributor of seven foundations that got it running in 1994. Pew helped shape NET's message, too, while it also continued to fund other environmental groups. The nation's 1,000 coal-fired power plants, which create almost 40% of the nation's carbon-dioxide emissions, were a major target, for their links both to global warming and health risks.
