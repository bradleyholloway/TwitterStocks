 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Middle Eastern Realities   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1989  The Middle East, its problems normally far away, is on America's doorstep this week. Israel's Yitzhak Shamir and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak are both making separate visits to talk with President Bush. With Secretary of State Baker in the lead, Mr. Bush is talking about an international peace conference and the need for "a new atmosphere." Over the years, Washington probably has spent more time sitting in rooms in Washington talking about the Middle East than any other foreign-policy problem. We suspect the quality of that talk would benefit greatly if both George Bush and Jim Baker personally toured those portions of the old Palestine Mandate that sit at the heart of this matter.  We did so recently, particularly the hills of Samaria. The United Nations had allotted these hills to the Jordanians in 1947. They would still have them but for the fact that in 1967 during the Six Day War, when it looked as if Israel would be destroyed by Syria and Egypt, Jordan belatedly joined the fray, only to lose Judea as well as Samaria. Arab attacks in 1973 failed to destroy Israel, and Jordan abandoned its claim to the lands last year.  We entered by car northeast of Tel Aviv, at a point where according to the old lines of 1949, Israel was but nine miles wide. The rocky hills rise sharply (some, but not all, have enough grass to graze goats, and in the valleys there is increasing agriculture by Arabs and Jews). In 1977 in Judea and Samaria there were 25 Jewish settlements and two more under construction; today there are 138. Our guide -- Ariel Sharon, who was a minister involved in the development of this region when much of the expansion was planned -- routed us near or through a dozen of these towns, neat concrete and stucco housing, some with factories, university or agricultural buildings.
