 Renault Alliance Marks a Shift In French Policy   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 2, 1990  The move could give a boost to such other state-controlled companies as electronics and arms giant Thomson S.A., oil giant Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and large banks and insurance companies such as Credit Lyonnais.  The Renault agreement seriously modifies a two-year-old presidential dictum that forbade government companies to accept private-sector investors. If Renault, nationalized since 1945 and a symbol for leftwingers of state control of industry, now can sell a 25% stake to a private-sector foreign competitor, others will want to follow.  Any number of state-owned companies, such as Thomson, Banque Nationale de Paris, aluminum-maker Pechiney S.A. and chemical giant Rhone-Poulenc S.A., would like to boost capital by selling shares to private-sector investors. The money raised would help with foreign acquisitions and with internal investment, both of which are made more difficult by the current ban. In several cases, including that of some state banks, share issues would help boost inadequate capital.
