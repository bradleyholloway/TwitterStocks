 Bush Steps Up Pressure to Pass Intelligence Bill   By Squeo, Anne Marie, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2004  Mr. [Bush], in his weekly radio address Saturday, urged lawmakers to pass the stalled bill, which is intended to improve the flow of intelligence information among government agencies. "We must do everything necessary to confront and defeat the terrorist threat, and that includes intelligence reform," the president said. "I urge members of Congress to act next week so I can sign these needed reforms into law."  Republicans and Democrats vowed to get the legislation to the White House quickly, even if it meant staying in session until the end of the year. "We've been working nonstop through the weekend, yesterday, last night," said Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) on ABC's "This Week" yesterday. "I think -- I think -- and it's just always so dangerous to predict, that by the end of Tuesday or Wednesday, we will have a bill that accomplishes what we want."
