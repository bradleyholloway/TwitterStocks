 Theater: Disarming Dialogue on Broadway   By By Edwin Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1988  New York -- To translate history successfully into drama, to write a two-man play that entertains an audience for two hours, to bring serious theater back to Broadway: Any one of these is a difficult task. To do all three is practically unheard of these days, but that is what Lee Blessing has done in his new play, "A Walk in the Woods," which recently opened at the Booth Theater.  In the summer of 1982, Paul Nitze and Yuli Kvitsinsky, the U.S. and Soviet negotiators for a test ban treaty, met in the woods outside Geneva and developed an off-the-record proposal for an agreement that was subsequently disavowed by both governments. Though their mission failed, the Nitze-Kvitsinsky affair fired the imaginations of a number of people, including Mr. Blessing. As a playwright he was not interested in duplicating the conversations that took place but in conjuring the conversations of two imaginary negotiators.  Mr. Blessing's diplomats are Andrey Botvinnik, a sage, good-humored Soviet, and John Honeyman, a stolid, serious-minded young American who has just taken over as head of the U.S. mission. Andrey has been in Geneva for years and has lived through one round of talks after another, and upon meeting John, he induces his new counterpart to go with him into the woods, away from reporters and aides. John assumes that this is to discuss profoundly secret proposals, but Andrey mainly wants to relax and get to know his new adversary. A puckish man with an ever-present twinkle in his eye, Andrey wants John to "say something frivolous." "What do you mean frivolous?" John asks. "It's your language," Andrey replies, "what's your definition?"
