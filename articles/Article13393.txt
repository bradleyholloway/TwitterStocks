 Deals & Dealmakers: Behind Bond Traders' Abbr. Day; Market's Short Session Set to Handle Job Data; The 11 O'Clock Question   By Norman, Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2007  Sure enough, on Wednesday, Sifma announced a modified recommendation that bond markets remain open until 11 a.m. "in order to harmonize its trading recommendations with" the CBOT and CME.  Still, 2 1/2 hours it is, and that, said Jason Evans, head of Treasurys trading at Deutsche Bank, seemed "the right balance between opening bond markets" to allow clients to trade an important number, "while at the same time making sure the marketplace is going to be usefully employed."  Still, on the whole, trading desks are promising to roll out the guns today. Scott Gewirtz, head of Treasurys trading at Lehman Brothers in New York, said his desk will also be "very well-staffed." Mr. Evans likewise says he expects to be "fairly fully staffed," though perhaps "one or two traders may be missing."
