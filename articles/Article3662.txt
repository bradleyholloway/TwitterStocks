 For Mutual-Fund Investors, a Time to Pull In Their Wings   By By Theo Francis in Baltimore, and Aaron Lucchetti and Bridget O'Brian in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  Currently he has about $35,000 to $40,000 in retirement money invested in three stock funds operated by TIAA-CREF, the giant financial-services group that caters to education workers. In addition, he is also contributing as much as he can to a retirement annuity, as well as $50 a month into an educational individual retirement account with Fidelity Investments for his eight-year-old son.  As general counsel for VISX Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif., company that makes lasers for eye surgery, Mr. [Rick Runkel], 47, is following the recommendations of his investment adviser: keeping a hefty chunk of his portfolio in cash, buying high-dividend preferred shares and stakes in real-estate investment trusts, while maintaining positions in several mutual-fund portfolios.  "Frankly, given the unsettled state of the market, I've been playing it conservatively," said Mr. Runkel, most of whose portfolio is in an individual retirement account he created by rolling over Keogh accounts from a prior job.
