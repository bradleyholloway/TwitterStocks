 New Leadership Puts a Fresh Face on Alberto-Culver --- Company's Makeover Brings Strong Growth in Sales and Net Income   By By Calmetta Y. Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1996  Alberto-Culver, which found success in the well-known Alberto VO5 shampoos and conditioners, has been headed by the Lavin family ever since Leonard Lavin and his wife Bernice bought it in 1955. The 76-year-old Mr. Lavin had run the company as chairman and chief executive until October 1994, when the board gave the CEO reins to son-in-law Howard Bernick.  Before last year, financial results had been lackluster, with sales and net income growing an average of 5.6% and 6.9%, respectively over the previous two years. But under Mr. Bernick's management, sales in the year ended Sept. 30 increased 11.7% to $1.36 billion and net income grew nearly 20% to $52.7 million. Each of the company's three business units -- Alberto-Culver USA, Sally Beauty Co. and Alberto-Culver International -- had double-digit profit growth over fiscal 1994. The Lavin family, including Mr. Bernick, controls more than 40% of voting power and owns about 30% of the equity.  Analysts say Mr. Bernick is just what the 40-year-old company needs now. Mr. Lavin led the business as an entrepreneur with a devotion to individual products. Mr. Bernick -- who joined the Melrose Park, Ill., company in 1977 as director of profit planning and acquisitions -- is employing a keener focus on the bottom line, they say. "He's really been the architect of the strategy that's helped them post the solid earnings growth over the past year," says Amy Lowe, a Goldman Sachs analyst.
