 European Battle Is Taking Shape Over Temp Work --- EU Ministers Will Take Up A Proposal to Expand Rights of Short-Term Labor   By By Paul Hofheinz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2002  Still, the fact that the [Anna Diamantopoulou] proposal is being debated shows how difficult it is to loosen up Europe's rigid labor market, despite many promises to do so. In Italy this year, unions called a general strike when Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi proposed making it easier to lay off workers, and an economist who promoted the reform was killed by an offshoot of the leftist Red Brigade. Spanish workers went on strike when Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar suggested cutting unemployment benefits as a way of creating jobs. France's conservative government, fearing protests, says only that it will "soften" requirements that companies pay overtime to workers who labor more than 35 hours a week.  Few deny the need for labor-market reform in Europe. During the last half of the 1990s, Europe's economic growth averaged 2.6% a year, compared with 4.1% in the U.S. Last year, Europe's jobless rate was 7.6%, or 1.8 percentage points higher than in the U.S., using the same calculation methodology. More than 40% of Europe's jobless have been out of work for more than a year, compared with only 6% in the U.S., says the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based policy agency.
