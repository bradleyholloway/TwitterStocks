 NCNB's Stock Rises For a Second Day On Firm's Remarks   By By Rick Christie, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1989  The Charlotte, N.C., company's stock jumped $1.125 yesterday to $40 a share in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On Wednesday, NCNB's shares gained $2. The stock benefited mainly from a two-day road show featuring the company's chairman and chief executive officer, Hugh L. McColl Jr., and its chief financial officer, James H. Hance Jr. The two spoke to institutional investors in New York and Boston as the guests of Bear, Stearns & Co.  An NCNB spokesman said the luncheons allowed the company to clarify its position with respect to Atlanta-based Citizens & Southern Corp. and NCNB's interest in other mergers. Last week, NCNB abruptly withdrew its unsolicited $2.4 billion takeover bid for Citizens.
