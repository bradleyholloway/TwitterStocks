 Tokyo Remark On Fed Actions Boosts Dollar --- Japan's Central Bank Chief Says U.S. Has Moved To Support Currency   By By Charles W. Stevens and Peter Norman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1987  A remark by Japan's central bank chief that the U.S. Federal Reserve has acted to avert a further drop in the dollar pushed the currency to the top of its recent trading range against the Japanese yen.  Separately, officials in London said the Bank of England's underlying reserves fell $230 million in June. The drop, which private analysts hadn't been expecting, apparently reflected intervention by the British central bank to support the pound after the Conservative Party government's election victory June 11.  Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's gains yesterday resulted in part from comments by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that he believes the U.S. Federal Reserve has been actively trying to prevent a further dollar decline and that the Bank of Japan will stay in close touch with other central banks to secure exchange-rate stability. Mr. Sumita didn't elaborate on his remarks about the Fed's actions.
