 Oregon Ruling Could Hurt AT&T Plan To Offer Internet Access on Cable Lines   By By Kathy Chen and Leslie Cauley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  A federal court ruling against AT&T Corp. could throw a wrench into the company's plan to offer speedy Internet access via cable-television lines.  In a closely watched case, the U.S. District Court for Oregon ruled Friday that the city of Portland can require AT&T to open to competing Internet-service providers the high-speed lines it acquired in its takeover of cable company Tele-Communications Inc. The court said that the city has the right to link the condition to its approval of the deal, to protect competition. AT&T argued, among other things, that the city doesn't have such jurisdiction.  Although AT&T said it would appeal, the ruling could spur other local governments to take similar action, generating headaches for AT&T and other cable TV companies. The decision also is expected to force the Federal Communications Commission to implement a uniform national policy to head off a hodgepodge of local regulations. With most FCC members leery of regulating the Internet, that policy most likely would consist of the agency preempting local governments and restating its intent not to require cable companies to open their pipes.
