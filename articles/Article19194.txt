 Counting Region's Rich Challenges Census Takers   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1999  Ironically, many of those same people could also be a drag on the region's economy if they are as hard to count up as U.S. Census Bureau officials think they might be when the once-a-decade tally occurs next summer. "A lot of seniors are afraid to answer the door if it's a face they don't know," says James Holmes, the Census Bureau's regional director for Florida, Georgia and Alabama. "And a lot of people in gated communities refuse to be bothered."  Until now, the most-publicized incidence of undercounting by census officials has been in urban areas among racial minorities, especially Hispanics who are recent immigrants and may have concerns about citizenship or other legality issues. But at a conference last week of the nation's 12 regional census directors in tiny Howey in the Hills, Fla., about 30 miles north of Orlando, strategies to identify and interview affluent and older whites became a significant part of the buzz.  "Counting them is becoming more important all the time because the entire Southeast is getting a bigger and bigger share of them," says Susan Hardy, Charlotte-based Census Bureau director for the Carolinas and Tennessee. "If we miss seniors, it impacts the federal money being appropriated for children, the poor, minorities and the rest of the population."
