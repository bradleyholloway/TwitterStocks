The Standard Oil Company of California yesterday reported a 15.5 percent decline in its third quarter earnings, to $527 million, or $1.54 a share, from $624 million, or $1.82 a share.  Net income from its United States petroleum activities rose 4.1 percent, to $332 million, from $319 million a year earlier, but its foreign earnings dropped 35.7 percent, to $160 million, from $249 million.  The company attributed the overseas earnings decline to higher taxes on oil production in Britain and Canada, lower refining and marketing profits in Europe and the Bahamas, and the ''significant cost'' of in carrying a high level of inventories.  Total revenues for the quarter amounted to $11.5 billion, up from $10.5 billion in the third quarter of 1980. Socal's return on each $100 of revenue amounted to $4.58 in the third quarter of 1981, compared with $5.94 in the year-earlier period. Its annual rate of return on each $100 of equity, the investment of its shareholders, amounted to $17.09, down from $21.21. Shell Oil  The Shell Oil Company reported yesterday that its third-quarter earnings increased by 33.4 percent, to $471 million in the latest quarter, or $1.52 a share, from $353 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier.  Revenues rose to $5.6 billion, from $5.1 billion, and the return on each $100 of revenues increased to $8.40, from $6.90. Shell's annual rate of return on each $100 of equity rose to $21.90, from $18.60.  John F. Bookout, Shell's president, attributed the rise in earnings to increased production at fields in California and the Gulf of Mexico and to higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.  Shell's oil products segment, which includes refining, transportation and marketing, earned a record $121 million, up $40 million from the previous year's level, Mr. Bookout said. But refined product sales volume declined 13 percent. Atlantic Richfield  The Atlantic Richfield Company reported an 11.2 percent increase in third-quarter net income to $433.5 million, or $1.73 a share, from the $389.7 million, or $1.57 a share.  Revenues rose to $7 billion, from $5.6 billion. The return on each $100 of revenues amounted to $6.22, down from $6.91 in the comparable period of 1981.  Atlantic Richfield's annual rate of return on each $100 of equity amounted to $21.30, down from $22.30 a year earlier. Murphy Oil  The Murphy Oil Corporation reported third-quarter net income of $41.1 million, or $1.11 a share, up only slightly from the $40.9 million, or $1.10 a share, earned in the comparable period of 1980.  Sharply higher profits from domestic activites offset a decline in earnings from its overseas operations, mainly in Britain. Domestic earnings increased by more than 43 percent, to $17.2 million, from $12 million. The company attributed the rise to a decline in crude oil costs during a period when prices held steady and volume increased.  Total revenues rose to $531 million, from $455.6 million in the third quarter of 1980. The company said the return on each $100 of revenues amounted to $7.72, against $8.97. Its annual rate of return on each $100 of equity amounted to $24 in the third quarter of 1981, down from $29.40 in 1980. Mesa Petroleum  The Mesa Petroleum Company reported that its net income rose 63.5 percent to $27.3 million, or 35 cents a share, from the $16.7 million, or 24 cents a share, earned in the third quarter of 1980.
