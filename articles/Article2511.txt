 Mexican Congress Clears Bank Rescue --- Now National Stage Is Set For a Quicker Recovery By the Financial Sector   By By Jonathan Friedland, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1998  The Mexican Congress approved laws to restructure a multibillion-dollar bank-rescue program, setting the stage for a more rapid recovery of the country's troubled financial sector and ushering in a new era in Mexican history in which Congress has a major say in the design and conduct of economic policy.  The plan, which still requires Senate approval, concludes nine months of fierce clashes between the executive and the opposition-controlled Congress that paralyzed legislative activity and spooked investors. In the end, though, lawmakers and President Ernesto Zedillo's economic team crafted a compromise that analysts say should limit the burden of the bailout on taxpayers without further undermining the banking system.  The laws, approved by Congress late Saturday with 325 votes in favor, 159 against and one abstention, also drop longstanding restrictions on the foreign ownership of Mexican banks. This opens the door to much-needed capital injections for Mexico's three largest lenders, Banco Nacional de Mexico SA, or Banamex, Bancomer SA, and Banca Serfin SA. Foreign banks with stakes in those institutions had been limited to minority shareholding.
