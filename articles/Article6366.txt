 A Special News Report About Life On the Job -- and Trends Taking Shape There   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2000  Two years ago, Carlos Harris unleashed a string of profane words at the United Parcel Service Inc. office where he worked. Mr. Harris, who had been disciplined twice before for profanity, was fired without warning. He protested the decision, claiming that none of the seven reasons for a firing without notice listed in UPS's contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters involves swearing.  With consumer credit reaching $1.47 trillion in July, experts worry that debt keeps employees from contributing to their 401(k) plans. In a Strong Investments Inc. survey last year of 1,000 plan participants, 11% said they weren't saving because of debt, while 35% said they saved less than they liked. "We're competing for disposable income with everybody else on Madison Ave.," says Ron Hurt, a vice president at the 401(k) business of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Some companies now start employees off with a set contribution level unless the employees say otherwise.  Among other causes, the report points to the geographic spreading of today's offices as technology improves. For those workers, plus those at smaller businesses, America's Charities is working with an online donation concern and is testing "Charities in a Box," a small kit on how to start office-giving programs. United Way, meanwhile, plans to connect all of its members to an intranet with which its biggest member companies exchange giving tips.
