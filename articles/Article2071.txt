 Continuing Boom: Despite Stock Jitters, Tech Industry Shows Long-Term Strength --- Miniaturization, Price Drops, Firms' Need to Compete All Feed Global Growth --- Potential for a Chip Shortage   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters G. Pascal Zachary and Don Clark in San Francisco And Michael Gonzalez in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 1995  Looking at the roller-coaster ride of technology stocks in the past three months, money manager Neil Hokanson is cautiously dumping shares of Cisco Systems Inc., one of the most successful technology start-ups in business history.  No doubt about it, there is a lot of confusion about the direction of high-tech these days. A world-wide technology boom is now a decade old, and the magnitude of that boom and the wealth it has created are difficult to comprehend. Cisco, which went public just over five years ago, now has one of the highest market capitalizations on the Nasdaq Stock Market, at $18 billion. Intel Corp., the world's biggest chip maker, could well be raking in the highest corporate profits in the world within several years, outstripping Exxon Corp. Hewlett-Packard Co. and Motorola Inc., already big, are among the fastest-growing companies of any size on the planet.  But some technology investors fear that this just can't keep up. Technology stocks were clobbered in U.S. markets in July, rebounded, and then were hit again in the past week. Technology mutual funds, after a long 1995 surge, have fallen about 11% in the past month, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq market has dropped about 10%. Among the biggest losers: Motorola, Intel and Microsoft.
