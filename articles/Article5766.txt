 Time Warner Is Closer to Agreement To Buy Turner Broadcasting System   By Eben Shapiro and Anita Sharpe, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1995  Last month, Time Warner offered to buy the 82% of Turner that it doesn't already own for about $8 billion in stock. Turner Broadcasting Chairman Ted Turner is keen to see the deal done and has come to terms with Time Warner. But Tele-Communications, which owns 21% of Turner Broadcasting, has veto power over the plan, leverage that Mr. [John Malone] is using to extract a valuable package of concessions from Time Warner.  Lawyers are preparing a formal agreement as the talks progress, a process that is highlighting out the remaining open issues in the complex three-party agreement. For example, TCI's Mr. Malone is seeking the right of first refusal to acquire Mr. Turner's shares in Time Warner in the event Mr. Turner decides to sell his holdings after a merger. He also demanded the right to acquire Mr. Turner's stake in Time Warner without triggering Time Warner's poison pill that prevents a single investor from acquiring more than 15% of Time Warner's stock. But people familiar with the situation said as a public company, Time Warner wasn't likely to suspend the poison pill for a single shareholder.
