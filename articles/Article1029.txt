 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Dartmouth's Vexations   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1988  Caspar Weinberger, then Secretary of Defense, was prevented by a crowd from speaking at Harvard Law School. Jeane Kirkpatrick, when ambassador to the U.N., was silenced by Berkeley, Smith, Barnard and the University of Minnesota. Others include Alexander Haig (Tufts) and Contra leaders Eden Pastora (Columbia) and Adolfo Calero (Harvard again). Radical professors drove the proposed Reagan library off Stanford's campus. Last month the editors of the Yale Law Journal canceled the results of a secret staff vote that nominated first Richard Nixon, then Robert Bork as their annual-banquet speaker. Conservatives on many campuses not only get no respect, they can't even get a decent hearing.
