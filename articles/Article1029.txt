 Markets Lose Steam as Investors Fret Over Commodities, Treasury Yields   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2006  "Low [trading] volume, commodity inflation and geopolitical issues -- a lot of little things today," said Larry Peruzzi, a stock trader at Boston Company Asset Management in Boston. "There wasn't a knockout blow, but the damage was done through a lot of jabs to the midsection."  Gold, usually a "haven" for investors worried about inflation and financial uncertainty, fell $2.40 an ounce to $595.20 from Monday's 25-year high. Silver closed at $12.57 a troy ounce, the highest close since August 1983.
