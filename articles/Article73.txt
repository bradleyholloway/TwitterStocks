 Rally Sends Industrials Up 37.34 But Trading Pace Is Still Anemic   By By David Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1988  An early rally, fueled largely by futures-related buying, propelled stock prices to sharply higher levels yesterday but failed to shake the market out of its recent lethargy.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed back over the 2000 level by surging 37.34 points to 2026.67. The average rose nearly 18 points during the initial rally, preserved most of its gains through midday, and then added to them gradually through the afternoon to close at session highs.  Broader market measures surged as well. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.04 to 261.13, while the Big Board composite index jumped 1.99 to 147.93. Also, 1,089 issues advanced in price on the Big Board and only 376 declined.
