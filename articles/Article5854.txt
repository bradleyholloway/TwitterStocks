 Wholesale Prices Decline Unexpectedly --- May's Producer Price Index Fell 0.1%, After Rising In Previous Two Months   By By John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1996  The Labor Department said producer prices -- from raw materials to finished goods -- declined 0.1% in May, partly because of a drop in energy prices. That decline followed increases of 0.4% in April and 0.5% in March. The seasonally adjusted index tracks manufacturers' material costs, making it a good measure of price changes in the pipeline. The consumer price index, which tracks final prices to consumers, is due out today.  Federal Reserve officials welcomed the news, which is likely to help dissuade them from raising interest rates at their meeting July 3. But they said they're still watching closely for any signs that an overheating economy might trigger higher inflation in wages or prices. Bond and stock prices rose following the producer price report. But bond bears looking to unload some of their holdings began selling, and the retreat in bond prices took stocks lower.  The Labor Department report showed that overall energy prices fell 0.6% last month after jumping 2.8% in April and 2.4% in March; heating oil was down but gasoline prices were unchanged, following big jumps in recent months. Food prices were unchanged in May, after falling 0.3% in April. Vegetable prices tumbled 19.5% and fish prices fell 4.3%, while pork was up 8.6%.
