 Questions of Security: Hart Senate Building May Never Be Rid of Anthrax   By By John J. Fialka, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 2001  Traces of anthrax have been found on three floors of the Hart Building since a letter containing a deadly, floating form of the bacterium was opened there on Oct. 15. The EPA, which is managing the cleanup effort, had proposed to fumigate the building with a gas, chlorine dioxide. Now, however, it is planning a more cautious approach, using a variety of technologies including a liquid form of chlorine dioxide to clean surfaces.  Dr. [James R. Baker Jr.], who has founded a small company to develop a new emulsion that kills anthrax and other bacteria, said the EPA has asked for it but won't waive its regulatory process so the emulsion can be used without the testing required for commercial products.  EPA spokeswoman Tina Kreisher said the agency is still evaluating Dr. Baker's emulsion and could grant him a "crisis exemption" under U.S. pesticide laws if it was needed for the Hart cleanup.
