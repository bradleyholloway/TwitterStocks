 DuPont's Choice of Holliday as Chief Catalyzes Chain of Curious Phone Calls   By By Susan Warren, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1997  Charles O. "Chad" Holliday, the 49-year-old career DuPonter chosen to lead one of the world's biggest companies into the next century, isn't well-known outside the palace walls. "He's probably the least-known of our senior management," says John Himes, vice president of investor relations, who has fielded nonstop calls since Mr. Holliday's selection.  Taking over immediately as president of the Wilmington, Del., maker of nylon, Dacron, Teflon and Lycra, Mr. Holliday says his first priority will be to assure investors that he is committed to producing double-digit annual earnings growth to go along with DuPont's $44 billion in annual sales. That standard was set by his predecessor, John Krol, who will turn over to Mr. Holliday the additional title of chief executive on Feb. 1. Mr. Holliday is slated to become chairman at the end of next year, when Mr. Krol, now 61, retires.  Some who know him say it will be interesting to see what changes Mr. Holliday makes within DuPont. In Asia, "we always had to figure out how to do things nontraditionally," says Mr. Himes, who worked with Mr. Holliday in Japan.
