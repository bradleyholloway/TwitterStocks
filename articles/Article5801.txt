 Oakford Principals Get Stiffest Sentences Among Those in Floor-Trading Scheme   By By Frances A. McMorris, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2000  A federal judge here sentenced four floor brokers and the two principals of a now-defunct brokerage firm for profiting illegally from information the brokers obtained on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  In a prior ruling, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he would probably mete out prison terms ranging from six months to a year. At a hearing on Friday, he gave stiffer sentences to the two principals of the brokerage firm, Oakford Corp., while giving no prison time to one of the moreminor players in the scheme.  The charges stemmed from an agreement several floor brokers had with Oakford to trade under accounts in Oakford's name, using information they obtained in their privileged status as brokers who carried out trades for large customers on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Under their agreement with Oakford, the brokers kept 70% or 90% of profits for themselves. From 1993 to 1997, the brokers made more than $15 million from the illegal trading, the court found, and they acted to conceal their partnership with Oakford by falsifying ticket orders to make it appear as though they had been trading on customer orders.
