 Home & Family -- Cranky Consumer: Putting Carpet Cleaners to the Test   By Curry, Sheree R, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2006  A subcontractor for USA Clean Master came and said based on the need to "pretreat" two particularly dirty areas, and the need to "hand scrub" the 10 steps we wanted cleaned, the total, with tax, would come to $252. He took about an hour to clean these areas in our basement. We noticed the cleaner hadn't moved furniture or vacuumed under it, even though the phone dispatcher had told us he would. When we asked the worker about this he said, 'Oh, I don't move furniture.'"  In the Minneapolis area, we tried to set up an appointment by calling Sears, but we were told Sears didn't clean carpets. We called a toll-free Sears number and left our information but never got a callback. We went to the SearsClean.com Web site and found a local number and then got a quote of $129 to clean five areas and $55 for our 13 steps. With a $7 fuel charge plus tax, the total came to $203. Two men in a Sears truck arrived on time and pretreated some ugly stains and worried about getting out a nasty pink stain. The method worked. Our crew offered to remove a stain in a Persian rug we weren't having cleaned, and threw in a hallway cleaning.  The operator at ServiceMaster's main 888-We Serve phone number was unable to connect us with the franchisee in our area, but gave us the number to call directly. The owner of the local franchise quoted us $139 for three average-size rooms plus a small hallway and a flight of stairs leading up to our condo, but then was nice enough to credit us its $10 off coupon, although we didn't have one. Once on site, he didn't pressure us to buy more services, and almost seemed to talk us out of getting Scotchgard by saying that since we rent our condo any stains are really our landlord's problem. But we did get the Scotchgard, which he offered for $34.
