 New Inspectors Face Old Restrictions   By By David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  A: Despite Iraqi evasions, UNSCOM uncovered and destroyed large quantities of chemical agents and production facilities. But when Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamel, defected in 1995, he revealed new details about Iraq's weapons programs. As UNSCOM stepped up its work, Iraq began denying or delaying inspectors' access to "sensitive sites."  Mr. [Rolf Ekeus] negotiated an agreement in June 1996 under which Iraq committed to provide immediate access to any site in return for a pledge that the U.N. would respect Iraqi sovereignty. Mr. Ekeus appeared to have given away little, but his implicit concession that some Iraqi sites were different created problems for UNSCOM. Baghdad began violating the agreement almost immediately, and the following year declared off limits Mr. Hussein's presidential palaces, which are large compounds around the country that include more than 1,000 buildings and cover hundreds of acres.  In February 1998, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan negotiated special procedures for inspecting eight so-called presidential sites. The deal included giving Iraq advance notice of about a week when UNSCOM wanted access to these sites. Although inspectors eventually were admitted to all the sites, Iraq later stopped cooperating again. Fed up, the U.S. and Britain carried out air strikes, and inspectors haven't been back since.
