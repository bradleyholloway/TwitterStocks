 Deere Net Fell 28% In Its 4th Quarter As Sales Rose 3%   By By Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1990  Deere & Co. posted a 28% decline in fiscal fourth-quarter net income and braced for a continued slowdown in sales of farm and construction equipment.  Deere said it plans to cut overall production tonnage 12% for fiscal 1991, and it expects operating profit from its equipment businesses to "decline significantly" from the year just ended.  The projections indicate that the abrupt downturn in the farm and industrial equipment industries is likely to continue well into next year. Indeed, Deere and other equipment makers say they see no signs of an early rebound.
