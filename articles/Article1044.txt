 Golf (A Special Report); Breaking the Rules: A look at some of the illegal equipment that's out there -- and how it promises to help your game   By Schroeder, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2006  There is a subculture of small manufacturers of illegal golf balls who use their outlaw status as a selling point. Bandit Golf Co. of Orange, Calif., for instance, trumpets in tongue-in-cheek advertisements that its Bandit ball "exceeds USGA distance limits" and is "illegally long." Cayman Golf Co. of Albany, Ga., markets banned balls with such provocatively named brands as Desperado and Pirate, while FlGolf Inc.-Volvikof Summerfield, Fla., claims its Raiders add an extra 30 yards off the tee. NGC Golf Inc. of Yalesville, Conn., has been marketing the banned Condor S ball for years.  Polara was a footnote in USGA lore until 18 months ago, when a group of investors in the Philadelphia area bought the rights to the ball and reintroduced it with the original design. Advertisements maintain the ball "reduces hooks and slices by 50%." Andy Gesek, general manager of Pounce Sports LLC, of Collegeville, Pa., says the firm has no intention of submitting the ball to the USGA for its approval. He says the Polara is aimed at golfers with high handicaps "who spend too much time in the woods."  Bang Golf Inc. of El Monte, Calif., makes some of the best-known disallowed drivers, which have club heads measuring 525 cubic centimeters and a monstrous 600 cubic centimeters. Kenneth Lawson, the company's vice president, says Bang has sold a total of 40,000 to 60,000 of its nonconforming drivers. "Seniors don't care about the USGA," he says. "They just want to beat their buddy out of $5 on the golf course."
