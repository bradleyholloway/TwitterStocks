 Bolivar Takes Dive on Day 1 Of Free Float --- Venezuelan Currency Faces Pressure Ahead In New Chavez Tactic   By By Marc Lifsher, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  CARACAS, Venezuela -- The Venezuelan bolivar plunged 19% against the U.S. dollar yesterday as the government of President Hugo Chavez countered an economic and political crisis by letting the local currency float freely for the first time since 1996.  Demand for greenbacks, stimulated by declining government oil revenues and rising political opposition to Mr. Chavez's increasingly authoritarian regime, pushed the bolivar to a close of 980.50 to the dollar, compared with 792.50 to the dollar on Feb. 8, the last day of trading before the pre-Lenten holiday. Many economists have for years contended that the bolivar is overvalued. They predict that the Venezuelan currency could drop from its pre-float value by as much as 60% over the next few months and fuel an increase in inflation, which has been running at about 12% annually.
