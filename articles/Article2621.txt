 Bank Stocks Are Facing Added Pressure From Worry Over Loans, Portfolio Losses   By By Rick Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  Bank stocks have plummeted 11% since the rate increase as investors fret that banks are about to get bruised by rising rates even while they already are coping with slower loan growth and other revenue challenges. On top of all that, though, some analysts and investors are growing more concerned about two gathering storm clouds that could darken in a hurry, especially if interest rates inch any higher.  At the same time, rising interest rates are starting to hammer bank securities portfolios, causing unrealized trading losses to balloon at some of the nation's largest banks. Some experts fear a portion of those as-yet-unrealized losses soon might turn into real losses if rates keep climbing.  Of the two approaching clouds, Wall Street is more nervous about mounting damage in the commercial-loan portfolios of some banks. It's easy to see why: At the 25 largest U.S. banks with at least a third of their assets in the form of loans, nonperforming commercial loans reached a combined $6.58 billion in the second quarter, according to securities filings and bank officials. (Nonperforming loans are loans for which a bank isn't receiving principal and interest payments, as well as restructured loans and foreclosed real estate.) The total, excluding data from five banks that declined to disclose the information, is up 19% since the end of 1998 and has surged 30% from $5.05 billion in June 1998.
