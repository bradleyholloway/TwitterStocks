 Tiger Airways Licks Chops At Australia   By Lindsay, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2007  In Sydney to announce the plans, Mr. [Tony Davis] said that "unlike others in this market, we won't be a low-cost airline selling high fares. We'll be low-cost and very low-fare." He said Tiger services between northern Australia's Darwin and Singapore, which commenced in 2005, had illustrated the airline could compete "down under" with Qantas and Virgin Blue.  Tiger's route network will be established in coming weeks as the airline talks to local airports and polls customers for their preferred destinations on its Web site, Mr. Davis said, but that "we will be looking at some smaller airports, some regional airports . . . to see if we can't help develop some of the smaller and secondary airports as alternatives to the existing infrastructure," Mr. Davis said.  Mr. [Peter Harbison] said despite Singapore Airlines' stake in Tiger, the new entrant would probably focus more on a "direct attack" on the local market, rather than supporting the Singapore flag carrier. But Singapore Airlines "wouldn't weep over any adverse economic impact on one of its major rivals," Mr. Harbison said.
