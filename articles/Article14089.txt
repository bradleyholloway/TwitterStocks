 Inco Ltd. Reports Fourth-Period Profit, First in 14 Quarters   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1985  Inco Ltd. reported a sharply narrower yearly loss of $77.3 million (U.S.), compared with a 1983 deficit of $234.9 million, and posted its first quarterly profit in 14 quarters.  Inco is the Western World's largest nickel producer and also produces copper, gold, platinum, silver and cobalt.  The company said the improved results were "largely attributable" to reduced production costs. A spokesman said Inco's cost of producing a pound of nickel dropped about 16% from 1983. He declined to disclose the actual cost.
