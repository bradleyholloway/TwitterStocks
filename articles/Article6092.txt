 Art & Money   By By Alexandra Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1998  There's new money around, made by relatively young people, and clothing is seen by auction houses as an entry-level collectible that might bring this group of potential new art collectors in the door.  How much will people pay for used clothing? Christian Dior dresses from the late 1950s sell for a few thousand dollars, a 1960s Pierre Cardin suit perhaps half of that and Gucci leather bell-bottoms have brought $575 on the auction block.  Couture has long been collectible but now, "70% of buyers are looking to wear, and that's very new," says Tiffany Dubin, head of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s fashion department. Buyers, she says, are mostly either from Los Angeles or are "young upper East Siders" who wouldn't have worn used clothes five years ago but now seek unique vintage items.
