 Politics & Economics: In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  The chief U.S. nuclear envoy said he and his North Korean counterpart reached a limited agreement on the next steps toward Pyongyang's nuclear disarmament. Christopher Hill said the two sides "have an agreement that we're going to try to identify types of disablement and how we can approach it." However, he said they have not reached any kind of agreement on the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear facilities. Mr. Hill also said he and the North Korean envoy, Kim Kye Gwan, tentatively agreed to meet later this month to discuss the possibility of normalizing relations between their countries.
