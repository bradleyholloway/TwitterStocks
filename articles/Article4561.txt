 Phone Firms, FCC Testify on Regulation Before Senate Panel   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1985  At a hearing of the Senate Commerce Communications subcommittee, an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. official argued that small companies are unfairly protected. But smaller carriers said their survival might be endangered if the FCC follows the path of quick deregulation.  Also at the hearing were members of the FCC, who discounted criticisms that the commission unduly favors AT&T in its desire to deregulate the industry. "We are trying our best at the FCC to foster and to guarantee a competitive marketplace process," said Mark Fowler, FCC chairman.
