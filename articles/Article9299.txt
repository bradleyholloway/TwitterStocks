 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2001  (See: "Politics & Policy: Minnesota's Gov. [JESSE VENTURA] Takes On Challenge of Tax Overhaul" -- WSJ March 5, 2001)  ASIA PULP & PAPER Co. bonds are rated triple-C-minus by Standard & Poor's. Two International page articles in some editions, one on Feb. 15 and one on March 2, incorrectly said the triple-C-minus rating is the lowest notch above a default. The lowest notch above a default is single-C-minus.
