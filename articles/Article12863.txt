 Drugstore Chain Weighs Options On Fund-Raising --- Analysts Believe Best Way To Maximize Value of 36.6 Is to Invest in Its Property   By By Anna Ivanova-Galitsina, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2002  The company -- whose name refers to human body temperature in Celsius -- operates 46 Western-style pharmacy stores in Moscow and plans to open another seven stores by year end, aiming for a total of 150 to 180 stores across Russia by 2006. It reported $50 million net sales in the first half of this year and plans to double sales in 2003.  Then there is the administrative difficulty of a share offering. "A local IPO isn't necessarily a good idea . . . an IPO is slower and more difficult [as a way of raising money] than bank loans or a private placement," said Nikolai Lukashevich, senior equity analyst at Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich in Moscow.  "Foreign strategic investors are bound to be interested in 36.6," said Elena Slezkina, head of over-the-counter sales at Croatian drug maker Pliva D.D. in Russia. "It is a very well-developed name, with high-street presence and recognition, and is the only non-Soviet-style pharmacy in Russia."
