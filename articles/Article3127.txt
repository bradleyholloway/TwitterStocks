 By the Numbers: Anatomy of an Upset   By By Allen St. John, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2003  THE THREE, NOT THE FREE: Compare these Davids, the lower-ranked team that pulled off the upsets, to the Goliaths, the upset victims, and there's an interesting pattern. The Davids have a significant edge in three-point shooting. In 56.5% of these upsets, the underdogs were better long-range shooters during the regular season. The small margins of victory in these upsets show how a few extra three-pointers can make the difference between going on and going home. Consider an underdog like the 2001 Gonzaga Bulldogs (40.4% from three), which made nine of 16 three-pointers in their one-point upset of fifth-seeded Virginia (36.9%). And for all the emphasis on free-throw shooting, there's an inverse correlation: In 63.6% of the upsets, the Goliaths outshot the Davids from the charity stripe.  FROM THE CLIPBOARDS OF BABES: The classic upset scenario is a spin on "Hoosiers" -- wily old underdog coach gets his last hurrah. Sorry, Hollywood: In 60.8% of upsets, the David coach has less experience than the Goliath coach. No fewer than 13 of the victorious David coaches entered the game with less than five years of head-coaching experience, four of which -- Gonzaga's Mark Few, Butler's Thad Matta, Kent State's Stan Heath and Tulsa's John Phillips -- pulled off upsets in their rookie seasons.
