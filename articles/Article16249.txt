 Paid Praise By Morningstar Raises Concerns --- Mutual-Fund Ratings Service Cuts Deal to Endorse Fidelity Offerings, Stirring Questions About Conflicts   By By Ian Mcdonald The Wall Street Journal Online, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2003  Fidelity is paying Morningstar an undisclosed fee to compile and maintain a list of "Fidelity Fund Favorites" over the next three years. As part of the deal, the Morningstar imprimatur will be used to highlight particular Fidelity funds that the rating service deems strongest. Fidelity has already begun touting the list in its print advertisements and on its Web site.  Morningstar rates thousands of funds, and it has long collected fees from mutual funds that use those ratings in ads. But this is the first time the 19-year-old firm has picked funds solely from one fund company to be pitched as its favorites to Main Street investors. Many of Morningstar's recommendations for Fidelity are quite enthusiastic. For example, the manager of the Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund has "a stellar record," while the Fidelity Diversified International Funds has "one of the best return/risk profiles."  Morningstar's Mr. [Patrick Reinkemeyer] and his analyst team are part of Morningstar Associates LLC, a wholly owned investment adviser and investment consulting subsidiary formed to serve institutional clients like Fidelity in 1999. Mr. Reinkemeyer says the subsidiary plays no role in determining how many stars Morningstar awards to various mutual funds. The highly influential star ratings are driven by statistics compiled by other Morningstar groups.
