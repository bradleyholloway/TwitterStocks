 Letters to the Editor: Terrorist Charge Used As Political Suppression   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1991  The Immigration and Naturalization Service's recent actions in the case underscore the lack of evidence that the LA Eight have committed or assisted in any terrorist acts. In October, an immigration judge ordered the INS to choose whether to proceed under the new immigration law's "terrorism" provisions, or under the old McCarran-Walter Act provisions, which base deportation not on terrorist acts but on advocacy of ideas. (Although Congress repealed the McCarran-Walter Act last year, it let pending cases proceed under the repealed act.) Notwithstanding the INS's loose charges of "terrorism," the agency chose to proceed under the advocacy charges.
