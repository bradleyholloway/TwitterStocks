 Two Kinds of American Hero   By By Stephen T. Banko III, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1989  And when he died of a drug overdose earlier this year, he was recalled by Mike Royko of the Chicago Tribune as a loveable guy, something akin to the playful puppy who is nice to pet but still does dirt on your best oriental rug. Mr. Royko said that Mr. Hoffman was just having a little fun with America, just joshing and tweaking the country's collective nose with his outrageous behavior. Mr. Royko said the nation would sorely miss Abbie.  One of them was Col. Rowe. In pre-'60s America, Col. Rowe might have been considered a hero. He graduated from West Point, became one of the nation's elite Special Forces and went to Vietnam as an adviser in 1963. He was in Vietnam for three months when he was captured by the Viet Cong after a ferocious firefight. He spent the next five years in prison camps, coping with starvation, disease, torture and thirst -- 23 of those months in complete isolation. While Mr. Hoffman was immortalized in a box with a 21-inch screen, Col. Rowe was confined in a bamboo cage, three feet by four feet by six feet. Delicacies were the meat he could capture in the form of rats and snakes that ventured too close to his cage. Three of his comrades died of starvation while in captivity.
