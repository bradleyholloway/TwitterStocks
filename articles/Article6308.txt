 Death of a Latino Idol Wakes Up Marketers   By Jordan, Miriam, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 2004  Like Mexican-American singer Selena, who died in 1995, Mr. Sanchez spotlights a demographic group hungry for icons that reflect their blue-collar immigrant reality. "These kids grow up in the U.S. and don't have any local heroes," says Abel de Luna, whose label recorded four of Mr. Sanchez's nine albums. "They could identify with [Adan Sanchez]."  Indeed, fans such as Cesar Escamilla saw Mr. Sanchez as one of their own. "Adan wasn't like [Ricky Martin]," says the 20-year-old from Artesia, Calif. "Adan sang traditional music that distinguishes us Mexicans. . . . He sang of the Mexican heart."  Adan Sanchez was hardly in the antiestablishment vein of his gun- toting father. He performed in ties and pinstripe suits, sang mainly of love and cultivated a clean-cut, good-boy image that earned him the nickname "El Compita" or Little Buddy. "Teenage girls dreamed of marrying him," says Pepe Garza, program director of KBUE-FM, a Los Angeles radio station that caters to Hispanic youth. "Girls screamed when they saw him."
