 American Women Aren't Really So Cheap   By Diana Furchtgott-Roth and Christine Stolba, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1998  The Catalyst study (not yet released in full, perhaps to discourage closer analysis) is the latest in a series allegedly showing that women are underpaid. Catalyst examined salaries of officers in Fortune 500 companies and concluded that "women are facing another formidable obstacle: a wage gap at the top of corporate America," earning only $518,596 annually compared to $765,000 for their male counterparts, or 68 cents on the dollar. When chief executives are excluded, women earn a slightly higher 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man.  The Institute for Women's Policy Research publishes annual wage-gap studies; its latest report, released last month, produced state-by-state comparisons for women's pay. According to the report, women fare worst in Oklahoma and Alabama, earning approximately 63 cents on a man's dollar, and best in the District of Columbia and Maryland, where they earn 87 and 75 cents, respectively. "In the worst states, it's really socked to women every payday," said Heidi Hartmann, executive director and president of the Institute.  The crucial question is not how much women make vs. how much men make, but how much equally qualified women and men make. In fact, they make about the same, according to economists June O'Neill and Sol Polachek. The adjusted wage gap between men and women -- the difference in wages after accounting for differences in occupation, age, experience, education and time in the work force -- is far smaller than the average wage gap, which is the difference in wages found by comparing averages of all men's and all women's wages. The former is a more accurate description of earnings differentials.
