 Drug Rally Wears Off as Medicare Bill Sinks In   By Scott Hensley, Leila Abboud and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2003  Matt Stephani, portfolio manager for Idex's Great Companies America mutual fund, owns drug stocks such as Wyeth, Abbott Laboratories, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, and says he is worried. While the drug benefit will provide a short-term boost to the industry in terms of a bump in profits, "It will lead to more uncertainty in the long term because of the purchasing power of the federal government," Mr. Stephani says. "When you have half of the prescriptions being paid for by the government, you run the risk of your industry becoming very subject to the whims of Congress."  Critics of the legislation aren't buying the industry's view. "This is a Medicare with no brain and no heart -- just a checkbook," says Alan Sager, a Boston University health-policy professor and critic of the privatization plan. He predicts the drug benefit will be a windfall for pharmaceutical companies, swelling their profits as more people get drug coverage but at a high price to the government.  Among the big pharmaceutical companies, "those with more exposure to chronic illness will be helped more" than others because they are favored by seniors, says Heather Brilliant, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Ms. Brilliant advises investors to shift into shares of Pfizer, which makes Lipitor, the world's biggest-selling drug. Lipitor treats high cholesterol and is taken on a continuing basis, so the drug benefit for seniors could be a boost to sales.
