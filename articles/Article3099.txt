 Toyota Creates Nontraditional Team To Lure Disaffected Young Buyers   By By Lisa Shuchman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1998  Toyota Motor Corp. has a problem: Young Japanese drivers are increasingly spurning its cars. So President Hiroshi Okuda has created a team of young employees, set them up in offices far from headquarters and ordered them to find ways to win young buyers back.  Toyota's problem is that many young Japanese consider its cars to be boring transportation for the middle-aged. Japanese in their 20s and 30s prefer Hondas, Mazdas and foreign imports, according to Toyota's own research. Unless Toyota changes that, it risks losing a generation of customers in its biggest market, Mr. Okuda says. "It's true: Our image is conservative," he says.  At least one rival is skeptical that Toyota can produce a free-thinking unit capable of what Mr. Okuda wants it to do. "If it's managed by Toyota and comes from Toyota culture, then it's still Toyota," says Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who recently stepped down as Honda Motor Co.'s president, but remains a director. Honda has been successful with Japan's youth market because it has a young mind-set, says the 62-year-old Mr. Kawamoto, who boasts that he still rides motorcycles and drives racing cars. "Customers are very smart," he says. "They know when someone's faking it."
