 Airbus Revenue Declines 4.9% As Deliveries Fall   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2003  Airbus posted earnings before interest and taxes of almost 1.4 billion euros in 2002, down roughly 15%, for an Ebit margin of around 7%. Airbus is 80%-owned by European Aeronautic Defense & Space Co., which consolidates Airbus's results and will announce its own 2002 results and precise Airbus figures on March 10.  Despite tougher market conditions, Mr. [Noel Forgeard] said Airbus held its cash position more or less steady in 2002, before disbursements for customer financing and a dividend to EADS and Britain's BAE Systems PLC, which owns 20% of Airbus. He said Airbus provided almost 600 million euros in new customer financing in 2002, but gave no figure for the shareholder dividend.
