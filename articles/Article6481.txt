 Gulf Coast Financial Procedures Step Back in Time After Katrina   By Bauerlein, Valerie, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 9, 2005  Some have no identification, since they lost wallets and purses when they left their homes, said E. Graham Thompson, Whitney's Baton Rouge city executive. "We say, who in the Whitney [bank] knows you, and they say 'X.' We call 'X' and say we've got customer 'Y,' and if that banker can identify them, we give them money."  To access her account, Linnet Dixon needs the signature of her mother, who is her trustee, but her mother can't be found. "My mama is gone," said Ms. Dixon, 42 years old, an evacuee staying at the River Center coliseum in Baton Rouge. A neighbor and fellow evacuee from New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward district walked with Ms. Dixon to Whitney's downtown office to vouch for her.  Some customers with identification and account information tried to withdraw $10,000 in cash or more, Mr. Thompson said, as they worried about future access to their money and a potential bank failure on the scale of the Great Depression. Whitney stepped up deliveries of cash, but most customers could be talked out of taking extremely large sums. "We'd say, 'We're not going anywhere. Just take what you need,' " Mr. Thompson said.
