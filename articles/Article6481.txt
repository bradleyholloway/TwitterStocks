 A Day of Terror: Attack Brings Closings Across the Nation and Overseas   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  U.S. reaction to the mass terrorist attacks went far beyond the target locations. Across the nation, companies shut offices, stores and factories, sent workers home and tightened security. Local officials in major cities put police on alert, as federal and state government offices closed. Schools in some cities closed, and major-league baseball canceled all games for the first time since the 1945 death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Walt Disney Co. closed its theme parks in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif.  In New York, companies with offices in the World Trade Center towers scrambled to account for employees amid the devastation. Because of the centrality of the city -- and the now-destroyed World Trade Center itself -- to the global financial industry, the attacks will have broad impact on banks, brokerage firms and other businesses around the world. Japanese banks have extended billions of dollars in loans to U.S. borrowers; U.S. investors have emerged as the dominant buyers of Japanese stocks at a time when Japan's stock market is at 17-year lows and Japanese corporations and banks have been selling huge amounts of shares to book profits and shore up their bottom lines.  Retailer Gap Inc. -- regarded around the world as an American icon -- closed all 3,800 of its Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores in the U.S. as a precaution, a company spokeswoman said. They plan to reopen the stores tomorrow. Gap, the nation's top apparel retailer, also shut its product-development offices in New York and its San Francisco headquarters.
