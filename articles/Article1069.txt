 China's Money Supply Continues Strong Growth   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  China's M2, the broadest measure of money supply, rose 18.4% at the end of July from a year earlier to 32.4 trillion yuan ($4.065 trillion), the People's Bank of China said. This pace matched growth at the end of June and was faster than a 17.9% gain forecast by economists in a Dow Jones survey.  New yuan-denominated loans grew by 171.8 billion yuan in July alone, bringing the January-July total to 2.35 trillion yuan. The total already matches the size of all new yuan loans in 2005 and reaches 94% of the PBOC's target of 2.5 trillion yuan for this whole year.  After the PBOC announced in mid-June it would raise banks' reserve- requirement ratio half a percentage point effective July 5, China's M2 growth at the end of June slowed from May's 19.1% year-on-year gain. In mid-July, the PBOC said it would again raise the ratio by the same degree; that move takes effect Tuesday.
