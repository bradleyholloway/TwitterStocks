 Bernie Ebbers Bet the Ranch -- Really -- on WorldCom Stock   By By Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2002  Among other assets that Mr. [Bernard Ebbers] could sell to pay off the loans are a yacht-building business in Savannah, Ga., and a 164,000-acre ranch in British Columbia, according to people familiar with his holdings. He also owns a soybean farm in Louisiana and a stake in a refrigerated trucking company, in addition to a Mississippi mansion, eight million largely worthless WorldCom options and about 17 million shares in the company with a current value of about $81 million. Mr. Ebbers has already sold his yacht, the "Aquasition," named for the more than 60 companies the deal-addicted executive purchased to build WorldCom.  In an era when executives are lining their pockets by dumping their companies' shares before the price plunges, Mr. Ebbers, for better or worse, held on to his stock. In his entire career as the head of WorldCom and its predecessors, Mr. Ebbers sold company shares only half a dozen times. Detractors may find him irascible and arrogant, but defenders describe him as a principled man.  The company's loans have provoked outrage from compensation experts and shareholders who resent that Mr. Ebbers's personal financial pickle has become their problem. Adding to their frustration, the loans, which are increasingly common among public companies, are an especially sweet deal for Mr. Ebbers. Their roughly 2.15% interest rate saves him millions of dollars annually over the going rate of other forms of borrowing, and it isn't clear when he is going to pay them back as WorldCom hasn't set up a repayment schedule.
