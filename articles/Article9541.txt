 Wonder Land -- U.S. to World: Take This Job And Shove It   By By Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2003  Really? The last time I recall the streets of Europe teeming with anti-American sentiment was 20 years ago, over the successful installation in Germany of the Pershing missiles, which began the final chapter in the Cold War. That famous spasm of anti-Americanism was not shared in 1983 by the citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Albania, Macedonia and Croatia -- the formerly unfree nations that today call themselves the Vilnius Group and whose leaders last month signed a statement in support of the American position on the [Saddam Hussein] government. What do they know that [Salman Rushdie] doesn't know?  I believe most Americans couldn't care less how Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Mexico or anywhere else chooses to organize itself, were it not for the fact that U.S. citizens inevitably have to die or pay to clean up the mess their dysfunctional economics and politics so often create. Europeans elites don't like having World War II or the cemetery at Normandy thrown back in their faces, but why not? Hitler didn't rise to power on America's watch. The Serbs by now would have slaughtered every non-Serb in the Balkans if the Americans hadn't gone over. The men of France didn't volunteer to die so that South Korea could thrive free of the crazy North. And most of the billions of dollars that the IMF poured into helping Russia stagger through its post-Soviet corruption came out of the pockets of American taxpayers.
