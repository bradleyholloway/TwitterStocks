 Dollar Hits Highest Levels Since August On Inflation Comments, Panama News   By By Pascal Privat, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1989  The dollar traded at its highest levels since last August against the mark and the yen in moderately active trading as several news developments combined to enhance bullishness about the U.S. currency in all major trading centers.  The market found reasons to buy dollars in such diverse developments as White House comments that U.S. inflation wouldn't abate before 1990 and an aggravation of political tensions over Panama. Central banks stayed out of the market, allowing the dollar to flirt briefly with the 1.92-mark level during the New York morning.  Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.9163 marks, up sharply from 1.9022 marks late Wednesday in New York. The U.S. unit also was at 135.38 yen, well above 134.45 yen. Sterling traded at $1.6645, down from $1.6738 late Wednesday.
