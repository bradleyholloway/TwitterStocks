 World Wire [2]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1991  Between 1985 and 1990, foreign construction firms participated in only 212 projects, Japan's Construction Ministry said. Tokyo expects steady growth in the foreign share of Japan's construction market, an agency official said.  The latest report excludes public-sector contract awards and thus "shows how foreign construction companies are doing in Japan without the help of the Japanese government," he added. Tokyo has been under pressure to open public projects to non-Japanese firms.  Israel will open phone lines to 11 Arab nations next Tuesday. Though more than two million of its residents have family and business ties to Arab states, Israel is technically at war with these countries -- except Egypt -- and has barred government-sponsored phone links. Jordan protested the direct-dial plan, saying it needs mutual consent. But the calls through a U.S. switchboard, tested last week, can't be blocked. The system allows calls to Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. It excludes Syria. The decision was viewed as a confidence builder on the eve of resumed peace talks.
