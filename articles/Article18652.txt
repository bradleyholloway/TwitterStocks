 Argentaria of Spain plots its recovery   By Vitzthum, Carlta, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1995  For Spain's Argentaria Corp Bancaria de Espana, 1994 was particularly tough. The bank had wagered on a sharp drop in interest rates in 1994. However, rates dropped from February on, boosting the bank's financing costs and provoking big losses on its bond portfolio. Chairman Francisco Luzon says that thanks to Spain's economic recovery, 1995 should be better but not a banner year.
