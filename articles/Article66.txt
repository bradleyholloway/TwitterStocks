Theatrical excess is built into the music of Yes, the British band that played Monday in Madison Square Garden. In a typical Yes song, the band will burble along gently while its leader, Jon Anderson, sings of mystical notions in his piping countertenor.  Then, wham! There is a sudden, grandiloquent surge of deep organ tones or a sharp guitar chord, and Yes starts to bash away at a brutal volume. Its adolescent audience is invariably impressed.  When Yes got started in the late 1960's, it balanced a stomping rhythm section against the ethereality of Mr. Anderson's voice and Steve Howe's high guitar lines. Mr. Howe joined the group Asia when Yes broke up in 1980; his replacement, Trevor Rabin, copies Mr. Howe's parts well, but his own hard-rock guitar chords make Yes a more ponderous band.  Yes played newer tunes, which are close to pop songs, back to back with extended suitelike pieces from a decade ago and empty show-offy solos. Where a new song like ''Owner of a Lonely Heart'' comes across on record as a sprightly Police imitation, Yes flattened it in concert.
