 Former Hancock Salesman Wins Lawsuit   By By Milo Geyelin and James S. Hirsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1989  Although ranked in the top 2% of Hancock sales people, Mr. Zalay was fired in January 1979 in a falling out with company officials over his work style and business practices. Mr. Zalay fought back with a wrongful-discharge suit that also alleged libel and slander.  The wrongful-discharge count was dismissed, but Mr. Zalay's Clearwater, Fla., attorney, Elihu Berman, successfully argued that Hancock officials damaged his client's reputation by distributing a copy of a company letter reprimanding Mr. Zalay for giving a policyholder bad advice. Mr. Zalay, according to Mr. Berman, never gave the policyholder any advice.  Mr. Zalay also maintained that Hancock officials crippled his job performance by sending investigators to Florida to interview his clients. The investigators told several policyholders he was under investigation for "shady dealings" in Chicago, though none was ever substantiated.
