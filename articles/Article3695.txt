 Ask Encore / Focus on Retirement   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  You can take the first required minimum distribution (or "RMD" for short) at any point during the calendar year in which you turn 70 1/2. For your first distribution year, there is also a three-month grace period that ends on April 1 of the following year. So, if you turn 70 1/2 in 2008, you would have to take your first required minimum distribution by April 1, 2009, says Twila Slesnick, an accountant in Loveland, Colo., and co-author of "IRAs, 401(k)s & Other Retirement Plans."  You can find the appropriate life-expectancy factor in the Internal Revenue Service's Publication 590 at www.irs.gov, under "Forms and Publications." Most people use Table III, the "Uniform Lifetime" table, on page 102. But if you have named your spouse as the sole beneficiary of your IRA, and he or she is more than 10 years younger than you are, use the IRS's Table II, the "Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy" table, on page 88.
