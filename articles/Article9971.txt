 PURSUITS; Books: Five Best   By Cramer, James J, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  [Ernst Junger]'s "Storm of Steel" captures the sense of pointlessness felt by soldiers on both sides in World War I -- and the lack of animus they held for one another. His profoundly evocative memoir (definitively translated by Michael Hofmann in 2003) is infused with its own steely, poetic force. Junger has been fighting for Germany for months without having seen an enemy soldier. Then he comes face to face with one; Junger holds a gun to the wounded man's temple, about to shoot, but then his quarry pulls out a photograph -- a picture of himself with his family. "It was a plea from another world," Junger writes. "Later I thought it was blind chance that I let him go and plunged onward." Tell me you aren't rejoicing that our author-soldier spared him and that he, too, was spared to give us "Storm of Steel."
