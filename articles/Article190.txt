JOHN BUNCH organized his jazz festival piano recital at Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday as a series of medleys, several of which applied extroverted rhythmic treatments to familiar tunes by the likes of George Gershwin and Jerome Kern. A Gershwin medley that concentrated on material from ''Porgy and Bess'' exploded into a stomping shuffle on ''There's a Boat That's Leaving Soon for New York,'' and Mr. Bunch transformed Kern's ''Who Cares'' into an eightto-the-bar boogie-woogie.  The pianist balanced his more outgoing passages with some sweet, modest ballad expositions. His concert would have benefited from a few more changes of pace on the order of his opening piece, Randy Weston's ''Hi Fly,'' which sported Thelonious Monkish right-hand runs as well as robust stride playing. After a while, Mr. Bunch's alternation of ballads and stomps became predictable. His playing would have been enlivening in a band context, but it was not quite varied enough to sustain an hour of solos, despite his admirable organization of materials and some wonderfully smooth transitional passages.
