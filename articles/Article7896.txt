 Light Stock Trading Helps Exaggerate Gains as Traders Sit Out Holiday Week   By By Sonja Steptoe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1989  The Nasdaq over-the-counter market rose sharply, partly because many stock-price moves are exaggerated in this week's light trading volume, traders and analysts said.  Meanwhile, Apple Computer's decision to divest itself of its Adobe Systems holdings helped its shares but hurt Adobe's.  Cellular communications stock Millicom jumped 5 1/2 to 40 1/2. Kenneth Leon, a Bear Stearns analyst, said the stock fell from its recent high of 48, but appears to be bouncing back. He said Millicom may be attracting interest because it plans to split the stock next week. But, "the stock has a small market capitalization and is thinly traded, which means there's going to be volatility anyway," Mr. Leon said.
