 Chip Maker Cuts Output Target On Weak Demand   By By Terho Uimonen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2002  Analysts said TSMC's decision to slow investment in 300-millimeter-wafer plants signals the company's customers are in no rush to move production to the larger wafers, which promise to eventually lower production costs by 30% per unit. At the same time, a capacity glut has forced contract chip makers to lower prices of older 200-millimeter wafers.  Some chip makers remain committed to the larger wafers. United Microelectronics Corp., the second-largest contract chip maker, expects to ramp up its 300-millimeter-wafer-production capacity to 10,000 wafers a month by year- end from about 5,000 now, said Liu Chitung, investor-relations director.
