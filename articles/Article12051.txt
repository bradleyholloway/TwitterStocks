 World Wire   By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1996  The U.S. once again was the world's biggest maker of motor vehicles, increasing output 5.9% last year to 12,985,000 including 6,350,000 autos. Japan made more cars, 7,612,000, but placed second with a vehicle total of 10,197,000, down 3.4% from 1994. World-wide, production in 1995 grew 3.4% to 52.1 million vehicles, including 36.1 million autos, the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers in Paris said.  Philips Electronics NV unveiled a last-ditch survival plan for its Grundig AG unit in Germany. The Dutch electronics giant said it would lay off 3,031 workers, or more than 25% of Grundig's work force, and move much of its production out of Germany. To cover the revamp, Philips will take a charge of 270 million marks ($182 million) against 1995 results. But Philips also warned that starting next year, it would stop funding the unit's losses. Grundig, a high-cost maker of television sets and videocassette recorders, said it could be difficult to transform into a profitable, high-tech consumer-electronics concern.
