 Drop in Retail Sales Chills Holiday Season's Outlook --- Inventory Backlogs Suggest Markdowns May Exceed Businesses' Expectations   By By Ann Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2000  Wal-Mart's warnings were met with a shrug by Wall Street, where its shares climbed $1.75 to $49.44 each at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. "When you are as big as Wal-Mart, you are the economy," says Wayne Hood, retail analyst with Prudential Securities Research Inc. "Investors are looking beyond the current quarter and seeing good news. Sluggish sales mean the interest rate will probably go down, oil rates have probably peaked, and the incoming president will probably cut taxes."  Zale Corp., the Irving, Texas, jewelry-store chain, also lowered its sales expectations for the quarter, but Wall Street's reaction was far less charitable. Zale posted a 3.3% increase in same-store sales for the month, compared with 10% a year earlier, and projected holiday sales to increase 3% to 4% instead of 5% to 6% as it previously expected. Last Christmas, Zale posted a sparkling 14% leap in same-store sales.  Light mall traffic, which analysts blamed for Zale's weaker sales, is reflected in the soft numbers posted by national department-store chains. Federated Department Stores Inc., the Cincinnati-based chain whose stores include Bloomingdale's, Macy's and the Bon Marche, saw same-store sales increase just 1.6%. May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis posted a sales increase of 2.6% at stores open at least a year.
