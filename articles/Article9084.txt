 Television: No Sitcoms for Seniors   By By Dorothy Rabinowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  Thanks to NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa, we now know -- not that its programming hasn't already made matters obvious -- his network's guiding principles and reason for being. "What we try to do is get the audience that will provide us with the best opportunity to get ad revenue," explained Mr. Sassa a few days back. He spoke at the close of a television season that saw NBC's viewership drop precipitously, while CBS moved into first place with the largest number of viewers. Sniffing at the fact that CBS won by attracting the largest number of households, Mr. Sassa made it clear that as far as NBC was concerned the only viewers worth winning were those in the age group for which advertisers paid the most -- the 18-to-49 year olds, that is. And here he and other NBC executives argue, since it was the victor in the only contest that matters, NBC had actually won the season. Indeed, for targeting its programming to the young and the restless, and dismissing everyone else, NBC reportedly earns twice as much as CBS for a 30-second prime time ad. Which brings us back to that first principle which Mr. Sassa set forth with such ringing clarity.
