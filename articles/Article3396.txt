 Integrated Circuit, Amkor Technology Post Gains   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2005  "Quality has done very well, but 'high beta' was the preference," on Friday, said John Kvantas, portfolio manager of BB&T Small Company Value Fund. "There appeared to be a sense that there was some opportunity out there."  Biotechnology, which includes a lot of developmental companies, was also a favorite Friday. Trimeris rose 86 cents, or 6.8%, to 13.60, Lexicon Genetics gained 21 cents, or 3.3%, to 6.51, and Ligand Pharmaceuticals advanced 13 cents, or 1.2%, to 10.80. InterMune rose 1.02, or 10%, to 11.09 after regulatory filings showed some big buying was done by company insiders and an institutional investor.  Taser International fell 94 cents, or 6.5%, to 13.48. The Chicago Police Department won't distribute more of the Scottsdale, Ariz., company's stun guns to its officers while it investigates the device's use on a man who died and a teen who was injured.
