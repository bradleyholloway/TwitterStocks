 People Express, Rejecting Takeover Bid By Texas Air, to Sell Frontier to United   By This article was prepared by James B. Stewart And Teri Agins in New York, and John Koten in Chicago, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1986  People Express Inc. said it will sell its Frontier Airlines unit to UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, for $146 million, and will continue to operate People Express Airlines as an independent carrier.  For Chicago-based United, the acquisition of Frontier promises to ease competition at its Denver hub, where a fierce three-way fare war among United, Frontier and Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines unit has depressed earnings. Nonetheless, a number of industry analysts and antitrust attorneys said they doubted there would be any antitrust challenge to the combination.  In agreeing to sell Frontier to United, People Express rejected a $9-a-share, or about $235.8 million, bid from Houston-based Texas Air for the entire airline. According to sources close to the negotiations, People Express directors met through the night in New York, studying the two alternatives. At about 6:30 a.m., the sources said, People Express representatives placed a phone call to Texas Air, asking that it raise its bid to $9.50 a share and inject at least $30 million in cash.
