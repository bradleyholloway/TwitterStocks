 Republic Industries Sets Pact With GM To Acquire U.S. Car, Truck Franchises   By By Oscar Suris and Rebecca Blumenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1997  Republic Industries Inc., the conglomerate led by Wayne Huizenga, said it has secured a formal agreement from General Motors Corp. that will allow it to acquire GM car and truck franchises throughout the U.S.  Grubb operates six dealerships in the Phoenix area, including franchises from GM, Ford Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. The new-car franchises will be used to support Mr. Huizenga's plans for AutoNation, Republic's vision for a multibillion dollar chain of used-car superstores.  Republic's pact with GM -- secured just weeks after a similar agreement with Ford -- suggests Mr. Huizenga and his co-chief executive officer at Republic, Steven R. Berrard, have made great progress in getting Detroit to see value in Mr. Huizenga's concept for AutoNation.
