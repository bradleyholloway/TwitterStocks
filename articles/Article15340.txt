 `All Aboard': German Groups Rail Against New Citibank Offer --- Train Discount-Credit Cards Sound Like a Good Idea, But Try Not Getting One   By By Greg Steinmetz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1995  The German unit of Citicorp hoped to win new customers by linking its Visa card to a popular discount card offered by the German railroad. But it is facing a public-relations fiasco instead.  The new "Bahncard," launched July 1, has run into a barrage of criticism. Consumer groups say Citibank is using underhanded methods to force credit cards on consumers. Customers are confused. And Citibank and the railroad are providing conflicting information on the program.  Credit cards are less popular in Germany than in the U.S., but the market is growing. Citibank, a leader in consumer banking in Germany, thought it could pick up a bunch of customers by tying a Citibank/Visa card to the railroad's Bahncard, which entitles its 3.1 million holders to a 50% discount on train tickets.
