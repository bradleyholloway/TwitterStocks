 Divisions Emerge Among Bankers Over Korea --- U.S. Lenders Vie for Profit, Possibly Adding Options For Cash-Strapped Seoul   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters Stephen E. Frank and Matt Murray in New York, Michael Schuman and Namju Cho in Seoul And Christopher Rhoads in Frankfurt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1998  Following this week's remarkably unified effort to roll over short-term loans to South Korean banks, divisions are beginning to emerge among international bankers over what to do next for the dollar-starved Korean economy.  The rollovers that were agreed upon this week have bought U.S., Japanese and European banks a few weeks' time to deal with Korea's cash crunch. The international bankers now all agree on what their long-term objectives are, though not on how to obtain them. The goals include replenishing the South Korean government's depleted foreign-exchange reserves and converting the short-term debt owed by the country's banks into debt with longer maturities.  The last possibility is at the heart of a proposal being advocated by bankers at J.P. Morgan & Co. Their plan calls for the exchange of at least part of the short-term Korean bank debt for government-issued bonds with maturities of one, five and 10 years; this would remove the debt from the Korean banks' books, while offering investors the security of a government guarantee. Bankers familiar with the plan say the bond offering would have a value of at least $15 billion, and possibly as much as $20 billion. As much as half would consist of a debt exchange, in which debts Korean banks owe foreign banks are converted into Korean government bonds. The remaining bonds would be sold for cash that would be injected into the government's coffers.
