 NextWave Nears Deal to Sell Wireless Licenses   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2001  People familiar with the negotiations said that under terms of the emerging settlement, NextWave would pay the government the $4.2 billion it owes for the licenses and perhaps several hundred million dollars of interest, while the government would drop its legal challenges to NextWave taking full possession of the spectrum. NextWave then would sell the licenses to Verizon Wireless and other companies that bought the rights to the spectrum at a January auction that later was annulled by a federal appeals court here.  The dispute over the spectrum licenses, arguably the New Economy's most precious resource, has raged for more than five years. In 1996, NextWave submitted $4.7 billion in winning bids for dozens of communications-spectrum licenses. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 after having paid only $500 million of its debt to the government. Federal regulators repossessed the licenses for nonpayment and auctioned them to other wireless companies for nearly $16 billion. This year, an appeals court ruled that regulators broke the law when they reclaimed the licenses and ordered them returned to NextWave.
