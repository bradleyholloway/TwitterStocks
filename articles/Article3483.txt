 XM Aims to Neutralize Sirius, Stern; Fight for Listeners Heats Up With New Ad Campaign Featuring DeGeneres, Bowie   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2005  In a TV ad campaign that starts today, XM will focus attention on its broad range of programming, including shows and music featuring Ellen DeGeneres, David Bowie and Snoop Dogg. In the ads, Ms. DeGeneres and Mr. Bowie, among others, appear in front of microphones as Snoop Dogg walks through what appears to be XM's broadcasting headquarters. XM's studios will play a role in Thursday's episode of reality show "The Apprentice" on General Electric's NBC. XM is putting more than $25 million behind the new effort, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Mr. [Craig Moffett] estimates that the satellite-radio market could be worth about $6 billion by 2010, with 40 million subscribers overall. XM's goal is to reach six million subscribers by the end of the year, says Tricia Kesling, XM's senior vice president of marketing and operations. At the end of the third quarter, XM had 5.03 million subscribers, while Sirius reported 2.17 million. Sirius has said it expects to have more than three million subscribers by year end.
