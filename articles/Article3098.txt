 Canada's Natural-Gas Exports To U.S. Will Decline in 2003   By By Dina O'Meara, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2003  CALGARY, Alberta -- Canadian natural-gas exports to the U.S. this year will decline by as much as 700 million cubic feet per day, about 1% of total U.S. consumption, because of falling production and increased Canadian demand, analysts say.  Canadian natural-gas exports to the U.S. fell 0.5% during 2002, compared with the previous year, the first such decline since 1986. The shipments, representing about three-fourths of Canada's natural-gas sales and 18% of U.S. consumption, are forecast to fall 2% this year, compared with a 3% rise in domestic consumption.  Demand for natural gas in Alberta's energy-intensive oil-sands region will be a major driver of that increase, as will a strong national economy, economists say. "That takes away gas from the U.S. and taking away gas from the U.S. obviously further exacerbates the supply-demand imbalance," said Brian Prokop of investment brokerage Peters & Co. "Probably look for stronger pricing in the later half of 2003 and certainly into 2004."
