 FCC to Unveil Contentious Phone-Network Rules   By Dreazen, Yochi J, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2003  The first concerns the role of state regulators in deciding which elements of the Bell phone networks are available to competitors at wholesale rates. Companies such as AT&T Corp. and MCI have taken a growing portion of the Bells' local-phone business by relying on these discounts and have warned that such competition will disappear if state regulators are no longer able to ensure them access to the Bell networks at low cost. The Bells, by contrast, have demanded that the FCC largely pre-empt the state officials' role and shift oversight authority to Washington.  The final version of the rule change appears to go further in satisfying the Bells' demands, according to people familiar with it. State officials retain the authority to decide whether switching equipment, a crucial piece of the Bells' networks, remains available to Bell competitors at cheap rates. But the FCC will lay out a national standard that will make it nearly impossible for the states to offer the rates in markets with at least three Bell competitors offering residential-phone service using their own switches or at least two wholesale companies providing switching services to other competitors with their own switches, these people said.
