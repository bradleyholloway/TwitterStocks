 Consumer Technology; Storage Strategies: Need more room for your files? Here are your options   By Vascellaro, Jessica E, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2007  Manufacturers are trying to differentiate their products by selling drives that are more compact and stylish and that integrate with increasingly popular Internet storage services. Last month, for example, Fabrik Inc. launched a new line of SimpleTech drives designed by Pininfarina SpA, an Italian company that helps design Ferrari sports cars. The devices, which start at $99 for 160 gigabytes of space, come bundled with two gigabytes of free online storage through Fabrik's Internet data-storage service, MyFabrik.com. The product allows users to upload files to an online account, where they can share data with friends and create slide shows. Fabrik, of San Mateo, Calif., purchased the consumer-product business of SimpleTech Inc. in February.  Seagate Technology Inc.'s new FreeAgent Go, which starts at around $100 for 80 gigabytes of space, comes in an espresso color with a glowing amber strip. In addition to storing files, the lightweight device can carry passwords, contacts and settings between machines as well. FreeAgent Pro, a more robust device that starts at around $150 for 320 gigabytes, sits on the desktop but comes with an additional 500 megabytes of storage through Seagate's online-storage service.  Mike Sweeney of Orange, Calif., recently set up a $250 SimpleTech network-storage device in order to more easily share files, photos and documents across some half a dozen home computers. To date, he has stored some 200 gigabytes of files on the device for easy access and safekeeping. "It is very cheap insurance," says Mr. Sweeney, a 46- year-old network-security administrator.
