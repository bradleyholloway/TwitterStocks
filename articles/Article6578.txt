 Prisoner Helped U.S. to Identify Bomb-Plot Suspect   By By Jess Bravin and Jerry Markon in New York and David S. Cloud in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2002  The day after U.S. officials transferred Mr. [Jose Padilla] as an "enemy combatant" to a Navy brig in Charleston, S.C., they provided new details on the monthlong manhunt that led to his arrest as he got off a flight in Chicago May 8. Officials say Mr. Padilla, a former Chicago gang member also known as Abdullah al Muhajir, was involved in a plot to build and detonate in the U.S. a so-called dirty bomb, which would use conventional explosives to spew radioactive material.  Authorities became suspicious of Mr. Padilla in February when he applied for a replacement passport at the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi, Pakistan. The breakthrough came in late April, officials said, when Abu Zubaydah, the al Qaeda lieutenant, identified Mr. Padilla from his photos. U.S. officials also now say that before they were able to find Mr. Padilla, he had traveled in Europe and the Middle East in the weeks before coming to the U.S.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters in Qatar, where he is visiting U.S. troops, that the U.S. priority was to interrogate Mr. Padilla for more intelligence about possible terrorist acts, rather than to prosecute him. Enemy combatants, unlike criminal defendants, have no right to a lawyer during questioning.
