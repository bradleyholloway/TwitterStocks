 Follow the Money: `Prospective Care' Is Emerging As Possible Health-Care Method   By By Scott Hensley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  Money is a problem. The diabetes effort costs several hundred thousand dollars a year to run, Dr. [Ralph Snyderman] says, and by its success could imperil Duke's profits by reducing acute treatments that make money for the hospital system. He says that Duke has been looking for partners, such as foundations or the federal government, to help with funding.  He is hopeful that a systematic approach will work well enough to compel insurers to change the way they compensate health-care providers. "It's going to take some innovative thinking," Dr. Snyderman says. The simplest solution may be an adaptation of a system that pays providers a fixed fee per year for each patient regardless of how much or little they consume. Under such a scenario, providers have an incentive to offer preventive care and education to avoid the need for costlier acute services down the line.
