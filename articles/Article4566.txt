 Commercial Shearing Expects Drop in Net For Its Current Year   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1985  YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- Commercial Shearing Inc. expects to post about a 40% drop in net income for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31.  The company says it will post profit of about $7.6 million, or 70 cents a share, down from $12.7 million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. The decline chiefly reflects flat machinery sales and restructuring costs, John Nelson, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
