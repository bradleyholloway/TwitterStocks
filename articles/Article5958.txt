 Green Groups, Native Tribes Want U.S. To Levy Duties on Canadian Lumber   By By Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2001  In the latest twist to the long-running U.S.-Canada trade dispute over lumber, a coalition of U.S. environmental groups and Canadian native tribes plans to ask the Commerce Department today to increase a possible duty against Canadian imports because of damage allegedly caused to the environment and native lands.  The coalition's filing shows how the U.S.-Canada lumber dispute, which has persisted for 20 years, has created some unlikely bedfellows, joining environmentalists with U.S. timber interests, for instance. It also shows how environmental and native groups increasingly are seeking to link their causes to trade issues.  Romeo Saganash, an official with Quebec's Grand Council of the Crees, says the Crees rejected a proposal by the Quebec government in December to settle the Crees forestry claims. He said the proposal fell far short of the 500 million Canadian dollars (US$324.2 million) in damages the Crees have been seeking in a lawsuit against the province and 28 forestry companies. In their filing, the Crees contend that Quebec effectively subsidizes timber companies operating on Cree traditional lands.
