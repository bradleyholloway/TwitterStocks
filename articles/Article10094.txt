 After Being Overhyped, RFID Starts to Deliver   By Denne, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2007  "The fact that there is an RFID tag on a box of diapers doesn't really add any value because they already know how to receive diapers [from a supplier] in a Wal-Mart. As we looked further we started to see tremendous demand to use RFID for finding stuff," he added.  Wal-Mart quietly dropped its mandate earlier this year after a tepid response from its suppliers, and the FDA's rule was shot down by a federal court in 2006. Analysts' current estimates of last year's RFID market hover around a sobering $2.5 billion in sales.  Supply chain software companies, such as T3Ci and TrueDemand Software Inc., have begun to play down their reliance on RFID. TrueDemand, which less than two years ago described itself as "a pioneer in the development of RFID-enabled enterprise applications," has removed all mention of RFID from its Web site. The company focuses on using information from bar codes to help customers improve supply- chain efficiency.
