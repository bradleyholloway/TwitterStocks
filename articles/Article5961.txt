 Expectant Mothers Memorialize the Shape Of Things to Come --- Belly Casting Is the Big Event Sweeping Baby Showers; A `Full Frontal' Surprise   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2001  Belly casting is the latest fad at baby showers, at least the edgier ones. While belly casters say their ritual dates back to ancient African cultures, they trace its American revival to California in the 1980s. Since then, belly casting has spread across the nation. Web sites now sell do-it-yourself kits for making belly casts -- sometimes called belly masks or belly bowls (the breasts are included because without them, the object might be hard to identify). Some artists specialize in advising women on painting and decorating the "birth art" for display.  Some women put their belly casts to more unusual uses. One lined her cast with sheepskin to use as a cradle. Others have shellacked their belly casts to create centerpieces for the dinner table or planted them in gardens as scarecrows. Kara McRae, who works part-time at a card-and-gift store in Georgetown, Del., brought her cast to work recently to show it off. Ms. McRae's boss, Jean Leonard, dumped a few bags of chocolates and other sweets into the cast and placed it in the middle of the shop as a candy bowl.  Belly casting doesn't always go over well with the family. In December, Jolie Gordon, a Philadelphia social worker, decided with her two sisters to get a cast made of her pregnant belly. But their mother, Harriet Davis, objected with a barrage of questions. "Will it be safe?" she asked. (It is.) "What will the plaster do to the body?" Ms. Davis was also worried about how immodestly clothed her daughter would be during the casting. "She isn't one of those actresses who models while pregnant, you know," Ms. Davis says.
