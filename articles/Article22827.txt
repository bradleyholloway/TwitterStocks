 Fall of a Power Giant: Enron Customers Seek Backup Suppliers --- Corporate Clients Check Contracts for Conditions On Voiding Agreement   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2001  California's universities and state colleges, which signed a high-profile agreement with Enron in 1998, are in negotiations to extend that contract beyond its expiration in March. But as Enron's financial picture has worsened, the talks have lagged, said Pat Drohan, an assistant vice chancellor at the state college system. "We are looking at alternatives to try and counteract any unfortunate collapse at Enron," he said. In addition to providing electricity, Enron is the prime contractor on construction of a new heating system at a facility in Stockton, Calif., he said.  One complication for Enron's California customers is that the state passed a law this summer that prohibits new "direct access" contracts between power companies and commercial users. And in the time since Enron signed many of its contracts in the state, power prices have risen by 40% to 80%, raising the prospect that if Enron customers are forced to rely anew on the state's utilities, they suddenly will be paying much higher prices. In other states, the situation is almost the opposite: Customers abandoned by Enron might now find they can buy power more cheaply given the drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many U.S. power plants.
