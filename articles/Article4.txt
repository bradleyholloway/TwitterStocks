NASSAU, Bahamas, Dec. 31â€” Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive American financier, has left his home here and his whereabouts is unknown, officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs said today.  Officers who arrived at Mr. Vesco's home on Providence Island this afternoon to serve him with a deportation order were told that he and his family left Nassau yesterday, according to Ken Heinrich of the Bahamas News Bureau.  It was not immediately known whether Mr. Vesco had gone elsewhere in the Bahamas or had left the country. Mr. Vesco's boat, the Patricia, was tied up at his dock.  A Government spokesman said the deportation order gave Mr. Vesco 14 days ''to wind up his affairs in the country, but since it wasn't served it isn't in effect.'' The spokesman, who declined to be identified, would not speculate on whether Mr. Vesco had left the Bahamas.  (In Washington, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that bureau officials believed that Mr. Vesco was somewhere in the Bahamas.) Faces Swindle Charges  The United States Government has tried to have Mr. Vesco returned to the United States for trial on fraud and embezzlement charges in an alleged multi million-dollar international swindle of investors.  The Bahamian Government refused to renew Mr. Vesco's one-year residency permit last month but later extended to Dec. 31 the November deadline for him to leave the country.  In a letter this week to Clement Maynard, Minister of Home Affairs, Mr. Vesco requested political asylum in the Bahamas, where he has spent the last two years.  Mr. Vesco told the minister that he met criteria for political asylum ''under the accepted doctrines of international law and treaties.'' He said that if he was returned to the United States, ''I would be persecuted for political motives, de facto tried for political crimes and offenses and would in fact be punished for my politicial opinions.'' Fear of Abduction Asserted  In addition, he said he feared ''the ever-present risk of being clandestinely spirited away or even kidnapped to the United States to be punished for political motives.''  Mr. Vesco further asserted that the F.B.I. and other governmental agencies had tried to ''kidnap'' him twice and ''eliminate'' him once since he fled the United States.  The United States Government contends that Mr. Vesco, 45 years old, looted Investors Overseas Services of $224 million while he was head of the company and that he illegally contributed $200,000 to Richard M. Nixon's 1972 Presidential campaign in an attempt to get the case dropped.  Mr. Vesco left the United States in 1972, renounced his United States citizenship and stayed in Costa Rica until a change in government forced him to leave. He has been living with his family in a rented house on Providence Island, outside Nassau, since 1978.
