 Times Mirror Shrinks Operations in Major Shift --- But Media Concern's Restructuring Poses Special Problems   By By Stephen J. Sansweet, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1986  When Times Mirror Co. announced last March that its president and chief executive officer, Robert F. Erburu, would add the title of chairman on Jan. 2, neither the company nor the 55-year-old executive could know what a checkup that day would reveal: Mr. Erburu had cancer of the colon.  For most of the past two decades, the watchword at Times Mirror Square -- also headquarters of the company's flagship newspaper, the Los Angeles Times -- was diversification. But much of the expansion, especially since the late 1970s, either hurt profit margins or took too much attention from a small corporate staff that was used to delegating operating authority.  Times Mirror's 1985 net income rose 1.9% to a record $237.1 million, or $3.49 a share, on a 5.7% increase in revenue to $2.96 billion. However, fourth-quarter net dropped 30% because of a charge related to the sale of assets, after a year-earlier gain. Such charges and special gains have added a confusion factor to Times Mirror earnings for the past few years, and Mr. Erburu says the bottom line probably won't be free of footnotes until 1987.
