 Colgate Plans To Buy Mennen For $670 Million --- Transaction Is Mostly Stock; Buyer Also Posts Rise Of 18% in 4th-Period Net   By By Kathleen Deveny, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1992  Colgate-Palmolive Co. said it will acquire the family-owned Mennen Co. toiletries firm for $670 million in stock and cash.  The acquisition would give Colgate the leading brand name in the $1.7 billion retail U.S. deodorant market and significantly broaden its presence in the U.S. personal care market. Mennen's toiletries operation, which includes such brands as Speed Stick deodorant and Baby Magic lotion, had total 1991 sales of about $450 million, with U.S. operations accounting for $275 million.  The transaction, payable 80% in stock and 20% in cash, is expected to dilute Colgate's 1992 annual earnings by three to five cents a share. Prior to the announcement, analysts had predicted Colgate would earn $2.89 a share this year. Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed Colgate's single-A-2 long-term debt rating and the Prime-1 short-term rating of the company for commercial paper.
