 Viag's Absence in Aluminum Mergers Raises Questions on VAW Unit's Future   By By William Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1999  Just a few months ago, the German industrial group was standing at the altar with Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland. But that deal collapsed in a dispute over price, and Tuesday Alusuisse agreed to merge with Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of Canada and Pechiney SA of France. Yesterday, the world's biggest aluminum producer, Alcoa Inc. of the U.S., made an unsolicited bid for Reynolds Metals Co.  Analysts said the battle for position in the global aluminum industry has caught Viag off balance. Chris Rogers, utilities analyst at Commerzbank Global Equities in London, said this week's deals probably will be perceived as a bad thing for Viag in the short term.  Indeed, industry watchers are beginning to think Viag may be ready to do just that. A sale or spinoff of VAW, some analysts say, would be a welcome sign to investors, who are wondering how Viag can balance a portfolio of businesses -- including aluminum, packaging, chemicals and glass making -- when its core electricity business is under pressure.
