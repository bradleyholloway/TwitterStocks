 Legal beat: Fired lawyer loses suit charging bias   By Moses, Jonathan M; Geyelin, Milo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1993  In a 3-2 decision, a New York appeals court threw out a case filed by Joseph Giaimo, an attorney who claimed rap musician LL Cool J, who is black, fired him because he is white. The court said the attorney-client relationship is a special one that is not subject to the same rules as those that prohibit discrimination against employees.
