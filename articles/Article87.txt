DUBLIN, March 24â€” Gunmen went to Trinity College here today and fired three shots into the legs of a British Leyland executive who was addressing local businessmen, the police said.  Geoffrey J. Armstrong, director of employee relations at the state-owned British car producer's Coventry plant, was hit in both legs and taken to a hospital. The police said his condition was not serious.  ''The gunmen appeared to be young men and shouted something about the H-block protest,'' said Ross McMahon, a businessman. Four men are on a hunger strike in the H-block of the Maze Prison as part of a campaign by prisoners demanding the restoration of political status for I.R.A. guerrillas in jails in Northern Ireland.
