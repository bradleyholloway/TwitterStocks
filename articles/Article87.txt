 Even Die-Hard Barbers Restyle Themselves to Survive --- Surrender of Holdouts Proves Profit Is Really the Oldest Tradition   By By Mark Robichaux, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1989  A quarter of a century ago, Mario Garofalo snipped the hair of hundreds alongside his father and brother. As they might in a Norman Rockwell illustration, customers at the Patsy & Sons Barber Shop sank deep into the brown barber chairs for a cut, straight-razor shave and dose of male-bonding.  Today, a barber's pole still twirls out front in the aging North Bronx residential neighborhood. And Mr. Garofalo still gives a straight-razor shave to old-timers. But the shop isn't the same. Now women get their hair frosted and permed here. Blow-dryers hang ready from the mirrored walls. And a new placard reads: "We do hair pieces and coloring."  Indeed, pressures on traditional barber shops have been rising for years, and they're getting tougher. Ever since the Beatles led a generation of teen-agers to wear their locks long, barbers accustomed to cutting men's hair short have complained of lost customers. Nationally, the number of traditional men-only sole-proprietor barber shops has fallen to half the 126,000 in 1967.
