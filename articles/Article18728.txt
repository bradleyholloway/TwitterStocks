 P&G Can Add Racketeering To Its Claims --- Pressure on Bankers Trust To Settle Case Is Raised By U.S. Judge's Ruling   By By G. Bruce Knecht, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1995  A U.S. judge allowed Procter & Gamble Co. to add civil-racketeering charges to its $196 million lawsuit against Bankers Trust New York Corp. over derivatives sales, stepping up pressure on the bank to settle the long-running legal battle.  The documents include transcripts of telephone conversations among Bankers Trust employees that appear to support P&G's assertion that the bank was attempting to defraud its customers. In one example, a Bankers Trust salesman responded to another employee's question as to how the salesman had obtained a derivative customer's confidence: "Funny business, you know? Lure people into that calm and then just totally f--- 'em."  The unsealed documents included the names of eight companies other than P&G that apparently had losses from derivatives that were created by Bankers Trust. The losses of three of the eight had not been previously disclosed. They include: Sandoz AG, which the filing says had a $78.5 million loss; Sequa Corp., which was said to have had a $7.5 million loss; and Jefferson Smurfit Corp., which had a loss of more than $2.4 million, according to P&G's filing. A derivative is a financial contract whose value is linked to, or derived from, some underlying asset such as a stock or bond.
