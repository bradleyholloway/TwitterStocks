 The Great Poem That Came Out of Persia   By Hakakian, Roya, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2006  A poet himself, [Dick Davis] has boldly executed an abridged translation of the Shahnameh in prose. Mr. Davis, who has dedicated himself to the study of the Shahnameh for many years, retells the majority of its stories -- but instead of working in verse, Mr. Davis gives us a Shahnameh in prose, dotted with poetic interludes. Those readers who know the Shahnameh in its original form will surely miss the stunning beauty of its language and the intoxicating poetic rhythms that, for generations, have enabled even the uneducated to commit its verse to memory.  This largely prose version of the Shahnameh is daring -- and not entirely successful. Now [Ferdowsi] appears as a rushed narrator who has little control over the pace of his story. Another problem: The repetitions that, in verse, appear to be an element of Ferdowsi's rhetorical style seem, in prose, like simple redundancies. But the most noticeable change in this rendering of the Shahnameh is the absence of Ferdowsi himself. His asides and comments on the story he is telling serve as the unifying backbone of the entire work, yet his voice is much reduced here.  These shortcomings stem not from heedlessness but from hard choices that Mr. Davis has had to make. In a luminous earlier work on the Shahnameh, "Epic and Sedition," Mr. Davis proved himself keenly aware of the book's inner workings, assessing previously neglected themes within the Shahnameh in a way that has earned him a place among the leading scholars of Ferdowsi in the Western world. Clearly, Mr. Davis decided that, even though it meant taking liberties with the classic form of the Shahnameh, shortening it and rendering the story in prose would bring Ferdowsi's work to a wider English-speaking audience than it has ever previously enjoyed in more literal translations.
