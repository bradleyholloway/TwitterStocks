 Junk-Bond Losses Hit American Express --- Profit Is Expected to Drop About 18% in 1st Period; Advisors Unit Stumbles   By By Jathon Sapsford and Paul M. Sherer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2001  The earnings guidance in part reflects a slower economy and its impact on American Express's corporate credit-card business. But the spotlight is now on the company's American Express Financial Advisors unit, an asset-management and insurance arm accounting for roughly a third of the company's overall revenue.  American Express's junk-bond write-off contrasts with a junk-bond market that has been doing far better this year than it did last. While American Express wrote off about 5% of its junk-bond portfolio for the first quarter, the average junk-bond mutual fund had a total return of 3.96% during that period, according to Lipper Inc., after a loss of 8.42% last year.  In one area, however, American Express is being forced to recognize losses more quickly. It will take a $34 million loss on its holdings of "collateralized debt obligations," sold by fund managers who raise money by issuing bonds and equity to investors such as American Express, and then invest the money in junk bonds and loans of other companies. New accounting rules being enforced this year by the Financial Accounting Standards Board require that these investments be marked down quickly if they become troubled.
