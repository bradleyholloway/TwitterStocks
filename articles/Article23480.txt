 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2007  A: That depends on what you'd consider "good" email capability, or what price would be "comfortable" for you. It also depends on what countries you're heading for. But, in general, any BlackBerry or Treo that works with the AT&T (formerly Cingular) or T-Mobile networks here in the U.S. will work in Europe and in many other regions. And both have what I consider good email capabilities for the price, which can vary, depending on model, and be as low as $99.
