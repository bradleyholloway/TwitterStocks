 Appointments of Eugene Scalia, Otto Reich Draw Ire of Senate Democrats and Labor   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  Sen. Chris Dodd (D., Conn.), an outspoken opponent of Mr. [Otto Reich]'s nomination, said he regretted the president's action and said Mr. Reich would be a "lame duck." He and other Democrats had said Mr. Reich was unqualified.  When Mr. Reich headed the State Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean between 1983 and 1986, it was alleged to have engaged in illegal, covert propaganda against Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista government and in favor of the Contra rebels. Mr. Reich has denied any wrongdoing.
