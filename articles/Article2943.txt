 Dean Witter May Sell or Spin Off Futures Unit   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1997  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. is considering selling or spinning off its futures division as part of its proposed merger later this year with Morgan Stanley & Co., officials close to the discussions said.  Although talks are still in preliminary stages, traders and officials within Dean Witter yesterday said a memo had been sent to employees in the futures department earlier this week outlining possible plans to create a separate entity for the brokerage and clearing operations of the futures department of Dean Witter Reynolds, a unit of Dean Witter, Discover & Co.  The move to spin off Dean Witter's huge operation in futures would potentially break up a combined futures brokerage entity that would boast about $2.48 billion in customer equity invested in commodities and futures exchanges, according to data compiled last year by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That would put the merged company ahead of Merrill Lynch & Co., which, at $2.18 billion, had the most customer money invested at futures exchanges last year.
