 Leading the News: AOL, Bertelsmann Discuss Merging Music Arms --- Though Deal Is Uncertain, Any New Entity Would Be Rival to Vivendi Universal   By By Martin Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  It isn't the first time either company has had merger talks with another music company, as both AOL and Bertelsmann contemplated merging their music divisions with Britain's EMI Group PLC on different occasions in the past few years. But these latest talks are further advanced than other discussions, according to one person familiar with the situation. The discussions have heated up over the past month, this person said, including talks at the highest levels of AOL and Bertelsmann.  AOL Chief Executive Richard Parsons has been weighing various options for the company's music group over the past few months. He has committed to reduce the company's $26 billion debt to $20 billion by the end of next year. Aside from the company's beleaguered America Online division, Warner Music has been AOL's biggest trouble spot in recent years. As a result, AOL has considered selling its entire music company, and earlier this year had preliminary talks about selling a majority stake in Warner Music to EMI. Those talks haven't advanced very far amid skepticism from AOL about EMI's ability to finance a deal and get regulatory approval.  The exclusion of AOL's and Bertelsmann's music-publishing businesses from the proposed merger could make it easier for the deal to get regulatory approval. Attempts to merge music companies in recent years have been stymied by fierce regulatory opposition. Warner is particularly big in music publishing, as is EMI, which was a big issue for regulators reviewing a proposed Warner-EMI merger in 2000. As a result, if a deal is struck with Bertelsmann, AOL likely would sell Warner Chappell, raising at least $1.2 billion. BMG also would have the ability to sell its smaller music-publishing business, although its intentions are unclear.
