 Univision Gives Citizenship Drive An Unusual Lift; Broadcaster Uses Clout To Mobilize Latino Vote; Bloc May Alter '08 Race   By Jordan, Miriam, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  During news shows, anchors pop questions from the civics test that applicants for citizenship are required to pass, such as "How many stars are on the U.S. flag?" Against a backdrop of stars soaring through the U.S. flag and the Statue of Liberty, a ticker counts down, from a goal of one million for the L.A. area, the number of persons who have applied for citizenship since the campaign started in Southern California. On Saturday mornings, a 30-minute program is devoted to teaching viewers the ABCs of becoming a U.S. citizen.  The result is the largest campaign ever to convert eligible Hispanics into citizens and, ultimately, voters. "This is about increasing the participation of Latino immigrants in U.S. civic life," says Marcelo Gaete, a senior director of Naleo. "They can change the political landscape."  "Univision is waking us up," said Clementina Bonillo, 60 years old, standing in a line that snaked around the block at La Placita Square. "We kept saying 'manana, manana' about our citizenship. It's time for Latinos to have a voice."
