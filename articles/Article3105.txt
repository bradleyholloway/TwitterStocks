 Power Regulators Aim to Lift Profits In Transmission   By By Rebecca Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  The FERC order is part of a seven-year effort to reduce the sway held by utilities over the grid. FERC investigations have shown that utilities often have turned away transmission customers -- even though space was available on utility lines -- in order to eliminate competition for power sales by their own affiliated generators. This favoritism deprived consumers of access to lower-cost power.  The latest order shows that FERC is no longer content just to push utilities to join grid-running organizations. "We're sending a strong signal that we want full divestiture and are willing to reward those who do so," said FERC Commissioner Bill Massey.
