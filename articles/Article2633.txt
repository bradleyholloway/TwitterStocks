 Priceline.com Names Microsoft in Suit, Alleging Violation of One of Its Patents   By By Nick Wingfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1999  Priceline.com Inc. sued Microsoft Corp. and its Expedia Internet travel-service subsidiary in federal court, claiming the software company's name-your-own-price hotel-reservation service violates a Priceline patent.  In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, Priceline also accused Microsoft of violating the state's unfair-trade-practices law by obtaining from Priceline confidential information regarding its Internet service. Priceline, based in Stamford, Conn., said Microsoft allegedly received the material under the guise of cooperating with the company on an Internet venture.  Priceline's complaint is filled with allegations about the behavior of Microsoft executives. In one example, Priceline claims Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, Bill Gates, had a conversation with Mr. (Jay) Walker earlier this year at a conference for media and high-tech moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho. According to the complaint, Mr. Walker suggested that Priceline and Microsoft work together, but Mr. Gates allegedly scoffed at Priceline's patent claims.
