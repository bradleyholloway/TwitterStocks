 State Sues Sears, Alleging Fraud On Auto Repairs   By By Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  In December, Sears agreed to pay $63 million to end a federal investigation into whether it advertised and sold batteries it knew might be defective. In 1992, Sears agreed to refund $50 each to nearly one million customers for auto-repair work that may have been unnecessary. The agreement, in which Sears denied any intentional wrongdoing, settled claims by state officials across the country alleging that the auto shops schemed to recommend unneeded repairs.
