 On the Air: Tennessee vs. Rutgers   By By Steve McKee, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 20, 1998  -- Who's playing? The Lady Volunteers of Tennessee vs. the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers in the women's NCAA Mideast semifinal. ESPN, Saturday, 8 p.m. EST.  -- Give me one good reason. We'll give you three. At 35-0 the Lady Vols are the best team in the country. Period. Their coach, Pat Head Summitt, is as good as they get. Period. And Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw (pictured at right) is the best player in the country. Period.  -- All right, so what's the deal? The Lady Vols have won five national titles in 11 years (including the last two). They crushed opponents this year by an average of 31.2 points a game. They should win another title this year. The iron-willed Ms. Summitt will make sure of that.
