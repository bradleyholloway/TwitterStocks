 Off the Beaten Track / Cologne, Germany   By Chai, Barbara, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2006  Where to shop: Every December, Cologne hosts six different Christmas markets: This city takes the holiday seriously. The most eye-catching market is at the Dom, the cathedral, where Gothic towers overlook 160 half-timbered huts. From there, walk south through the Old Town to the Alter Markt, a market with an ice-skating rink.
