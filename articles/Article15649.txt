 Seagram Net Drops 83% as Asian Sales Of Liquor Plunge   By By Tara Parker-Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1998  Seagram Co. reported an 83% drop in fiscal second-quarter earnings, blaming a plunge in Asian liquor sales triggered by the region's economic crisis.  The Montreal beverage and entertainment company, which owns Universal Studios, Tropicana juice, Chivas Regal Scotch whisky and Martell cognac, said net income fell to $28 million in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from $161 million a year earlier.  The weak quarter includes a $60 million charge for severance, bad debt and inventory costs related to the decline in liquor sales in the Asia Pacific region, where wine and spirits revenue fell 50%. The year-earlier quarter included a $64 million gain from the sale of Putnam Berkley Group publishing operations. Per-share earnings were eight cents, down from 43 cents in the year-earlier quarter.
