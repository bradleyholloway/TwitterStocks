 In a Strange Universe, We Stick to Search For Familiar Life   By Robert Lee Hotz, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2007  "Our discovery shows that water might be more common out there than previously thought," said Dr. [Giovanna Tinetti]. "I hope we can find water on planets less hostile."  These extrasolar explorations tax the ingenuity of astronomers. "You can't actually see the planet," said Harvard University astronomer Heather Knutson, who published the first temperature map of an extrasolar planet in Nature in May. "You can only measure the light from the system."  To detect water 64 light years away, Dr. Tinetti and her team used the Spitzer Telescope to measure tiny variations in wavelengths of infrared light as the planet orbited in front of its star and eclipsed it. "You stare at the planet, watch the dip in light and measure it," said Sean Casey at Caltech's Spitzer Science Center in Pasadena, Calif. They saw that for each wavelength, a different amount of light was absorbed by the planet. The pattern matches that of water molecules.
