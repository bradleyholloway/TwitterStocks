 A Falling Yen Is Nothing to Fear   By By Haruhiko Kuroda, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  The Japanese yen has depreciated by about 10% since the beginning of the year. The depreciation broadly coincided with bad news about the prospects for Japan's economic recovery, together with monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. But the depreciation has not been induced or manipulated by actions of the government. So long as yen exchange rates are stable and in line with fundamentals, policy intervention is unwarranted. Of course, in the event the market becomes disorderly and moves against fundamentals, the government will take appropriate actions. We have maintained, and will maintain, this position in the coming months.  Some observers think Japan needs further yen depreciation to push the stagnant economy toward economic recovery. They point out that there is little room for monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the sagging economy. The public debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio is estimated to have been about 125% by the end of fiscal year 2000, and public spending with large deficit financing may be detrimental rather than helpful to a recovery. Monetary policy is once again a zero interest-rate policy, and there is no more room to lower the interest rate. Yen depreciation, and the resulting promotion of exports, is the only option to stimulate the economy, some argue.  Over the past three months, the yen has depreciated about 10% vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. In fact most Asian countries with a floating exchange-rate system have seen their currencies depreciate by several percentage points against the dollar. Such depreciation is natural considering Asian countries have an extensive trading relationship with Japan as well as with the U.S. So long as the Asian currencies move in a direction that maintains the trade-weighted effective exchange rate, overvaluation is less likely.
