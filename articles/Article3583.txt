 Dow Jones Initiates a Project To Evaluate Its News Strategy   By Ellison, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  In an accompanying outline detailing the project's mission statement and goals, the company said it wanted to focus on content that differentiated Dow Jones's properties from their competitors and reduce "commoditized" content. "We should take advantage of shared content and reduce duplicated effort across Dow Jones." The outline added, however, that, "while closer collaboration is essential, moving to a single, unified news department is not a goal."
