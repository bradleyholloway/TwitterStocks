 China's Silence on WTO Terms Cuts Off Critics' Ammunition   By By Peter Wonacott and Karby Leggett, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2001  China's "protocol of accession" outlines a road map of requirements once the nation enters the WTO. It sets forth a schedule for reducing import tariffs, eliminating sales licenses and opening to foreign investment tightly guarded sectors such as banking, telecommunications and distribution. Implementation of the pact will ripple through the economy.  "There must be 300 of these titles," marveled a man who would only give his name as Qian and who stood at the entrance of a Beijing bookshop with two display shelves stacked with WTO books. The 31-year-old Internet-company manager said he is curious about the WTO's impact on China but wondered about the worth of such books before an official agreement is publicly available in Chinese. "What's the value of writing a book before we know what's in the agreement?"  Meanwhile, during a visit to Shanghai, EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy urged patience among China's trade partners as Beijing rewrites dozens of laws and local regulations to comply with the terms of its WTO commitments.
