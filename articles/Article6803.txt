 Prisoner Scandal Reverberates on Wall Street   By Gregory Zuckerman and Jonathan Karp, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2004  Jack London, CACI's chairman and chief executive, declined to specify how many CACI interrogators are in Iraq or other countries, such as Afghanistan. The company's interrogation business -- inherited from an acquisition of Pioneer Technology Group -- is part of a larger CACI business providing intelligence analysis, ranging from sending employees to areas of conflict to interrogate prisoners and install communications systems to bigger projects in the U.S., such as designing and maintaining intelligence databases.  CACI's revenue has been growing at more than 20% annually in recent years thanks in part to other kinds of business, such as information-technology work for the Justice Department and new clients such as the Social Security Administration. The recent acquisitions of financial-technology company CMS Information Services Inc. and the intelligence operations of American Management Systems also should spur growth. "Overall Iraq activity as relates to CACI isn't that significant," says Joseph Vafi, a managing director at Jefferies & Co. in San Francisco. Mr. Vafi doesn't own shares of CACI and his firm hasn't done banking for the company.  Under procurement rules, if the Pentagon, or any individual military branch, suspends CACI, the company would become ineligible for all government contracts. For now at least, Pentagon officials say such a suspension of CACI isn't likely. While the Pentagon frequently suspends small contractors for faulty manufacturing or billing irregularities, CACI's relatively large role in information-technology services, and the sensitive nature of its classified intelligence work, make it unlikely that a blanket suspension would be issued, some say.
