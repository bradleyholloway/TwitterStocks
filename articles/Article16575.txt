 Funds Increase Year-End Payments; Capital-Gains Distributions Expected to Be Highest Since 2000; Avoiding the Tax Trap   By Tom Herman and Diya Gullapalli, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2005  "More Fidelity funds will pay capital-gains distributions this year," says John Brockelman, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments.

This issue highlights a drawback to mutual fund investing for regular accounts that aren't tax-deferred, says Robert N. Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp., a brokerage and investment concern, and co-author of the 2001 book "Wall Street Secrets for Tax- Efficient Investing." He urges investors to do their homework carefully. "There could still be a big surprise even in a flat stock market," since a fund manager could suddenly sell a stock he's held on to for 20 years, Mr. Gordon says. Thus, "you owe it to yourself to call the funds and see what the distributions are this year."
