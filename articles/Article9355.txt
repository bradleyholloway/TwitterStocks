 Prices in China Expected To Rise 1% to 2% This Year --- Nation Makes Headway Against Ills of Deflation; Not Out of Woods Yet   By By Peter Wonacott, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2001  The price environment, which is tied directly to China's state enterprise earnings, is still vulnerable to shocks, Mr. [Wang Xiaoqing] said in an interview. These could be delivered in the form of a major downturn in demand from China's biggest overseas markets: the U.S., Japan and Europe. Likewise, a bumper harvest would aggravate grain gluts, further driving down depressed food prices. Conversely, a grain shortfall caused by an already-pervasive drought in the North could spur a rise in prices.  The policies were meant to counter other moves that had unleashed deflationary pressure. Battles among China's makers of televisions, air conditioners and many other consumer items showed off increasing market competition, but the price wars weighed on corporate profits. Meanwhile, the government's hand in boosting grain supplies has kept food prices low, stunting farmer incomes and forcing many to seek work in China's crowded cities.
