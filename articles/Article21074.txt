 Canada Demands Exemption From U.S. Trade Law   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1987  Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney demanded that Canada be exempted from U.S. trade remedy laws as part of a proposed free trade agreement between the two countries.  "Trade remedy laws can't apply to Canada. Period," he told a group of reporters. Mr. Mulroney intends to take up the trade issue when President Reagan comes here Sunday for his annual summit meeting with the Canadian leader.  Canada has long complained that U.S. trade remedy laws, particularly the countervailing duty law, have been used by various U.S. interests to harass Canadian exporters to the U.S. Trade remedy laws provide protection from imports of subsidized and dumped products.
