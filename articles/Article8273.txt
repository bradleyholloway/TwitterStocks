 Self-Regulation On Wall Street Seems Tougher --- Lawyers Association Studies 4 Organizations, Finds 70% More Cases in 1991   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1992  Four major self-regulatory organizations brought a record 1,041 disciplinary cases against brokerage firms and employees in 1991 -- a 70% jump from the 614 brought in 1990, according to a study by the American Bar Association. The sanctions included the steepest fine -- $900,000 -- ever imposed against a brokerage firm by a so-called SRO.  Since 1988, when the ABA started studying securities industry self-regulation, the number of SRO decisions has jumped fourfold. As important, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the industry watchdog, affirmed nearly every case that brokerage firms appealed, the study said.  "It is clear from the sheer number and severity of SRO actions and the SEC's willingness to affirm virtually every case brought to it on appeal, that the SROs have become a major force in the regulatory framework governing the conduct of securities professionals," said Anne C. Flannery, chairwoman of the ABA's Litigation Section Subcommittee on SRO Matters, which did the study.
