 As thrift industry's troubles and losses mounted, its PACs' donations to key congressmen surged   By Jackson, Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1989  While the savings and loan industry increased the amount of money for funding the activities of political action committees (PACs) by 42% between the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections, the industry suffered over $17 billion in losses in 1987-88 that could cost the FSLIC $100 billion to clear up. Fernand St Germain, former chairman of the House Banking Committee and a staunch friend of the thrift industry, received the most money, $149,200, from PACs between 1983 and 1988. Don Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, received $66,000 for his campaigns, and admits that some "basic structural changes" are needed in the industry because of the federal bailout.
