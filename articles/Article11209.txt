 Business and Finance [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1989  A THRIFT INDUSTRY PLAN is being readied by Bush officials that includes higher deposit-insurance premiums for banks and S&Ls. Also, the administration apparently plans to help fund thrift bail-outs by selling about $50 billion of long-term bonds, which could cost as much as $7 billion a year and be borne primarily by taxpayers. A proposed fee on thrift deposits has now been rejected.  Pennzoil has acquired 8% of Burlington Resources, indicating how it may use its $2.6 billion war chest for takeovers. Pennzoil said its plans aren't certain, but the move could portend a contest for Burlington, whose value is nearly $6 billion.  McDonnell Douglas has won an estimated $7.5 billion order from American Airlines for the new MD-11 trijet and twin-engine MD-80, sources said. Analysts said it will be the largest airline order ever for a single maker.
