 Birds of a Feather Fly Together   By Callis, David M, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1990  David M. Callis responds to an article on the degeneration of first-class flying in an Oct 11, 1990 article, by sarcastically saying that it is vulgar of the common folk to ask the passengers who fly full-fare first-class to think about those who have no food to eat, not even miscarved roast beef.
