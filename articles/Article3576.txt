 Goldman's Earnings Surge but Shares Drop 4%   By Craig, Susanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  "The stock market has continued to weaken, and while corporate activity levels are still high, if weakness persists, investor confidence could be affected," Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said. He wouldn't give any guidance on how the stock-market drop has affected the firm's June profit picture but added that "it is no secret" the markets went south in mid-May and haven't improved.  "Brokers trade with the market and when you love the market you love these stocks but right now the market is falling off," said Mark Bronzo, managing director at Gartmore Separate Accounts in Irvington, N.Y., which manages about $700 million in assets and owns shares in Lehman and Goldman.
