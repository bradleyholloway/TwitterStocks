 Bush Adviser's Dollar Outlook Sends Bond Prices Lower Despite Vice President's Election Triumph   By By Matthew Winkler and Sam Alcorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1988  Prices of some actively traded 30-year government bonds fell about 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought the yield on benchmark long-term issues to 9% from 8.94% Tuesday. Corporate and municipal bonds also slipped in subdued trading, while foreign bond prices were mixed.  While they hardly represented a departure from his previous position on the dollar, Mr. Feldstein's comments apparently unsettled traders and investors on the heels of Mr. Bush's election. "The bond market was sabotaged by Feldstein and now it's testing Bush's leadership," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. Mr. Bush "must issue a clear statement underscoring the new administration's commitment to a steady and reliable dollar. Until it's made there's a substantial risk the bond market could get much worse."  Other analysts said Mr. Bush might not even get the benefit of a honeymoon in the credit markets. "Both the outlook for the budget deficit and inflation is deteriorating," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at CM&M Group. "The election, rather than resolve things, made solutions more difficult because Mr. Bush faces a bigger and potentially more hostile Democratic Congress. I think the dollar is going to fall to a new low," dragging bond prices down in the process, Mr. Hunt said.
