 On Sports: Pool Goes Straight   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1989  Chicago -- "Machine Gun" Lou Butera, short and gray haired, eyed the schedule for the U.S. Open Pocket Billiards Championships here last week. "They got us playing at 11:30 a.m.," groused the man who lived up to his nickname by once sinking 150 consecutive balls in a world-record 21 minutes during tournament play. "The only time I ever used to play at 11:30 a.m. was if I started at midnight."  Relatedly, talk about betting on the outcome of contests involving the game with the 15 balls, a/k/a hustling, was discouraged. No sooner had Loree Jon Jones, a slim brunette from Hillsboro, N.J., captured the women's title Friday night than Sam Jones, her bearded husband, coach and manager, approached me with a request.  And in the main event, the Paul Newman type, 22-year-old Oliver Ortmann of Munich, defeated the Jackie Gleason type, old pro and beer-commercial star Steve Mizerak, 200-186, in a three-hour match, ending after midnight. Aficionados ranked it among the most closely contested in memory. "If this match would have been on live TV, I would have made millions of new fans," said Charles Corley, the event's organizer. "As it is, we were lucky to get five minutes on the late news."
