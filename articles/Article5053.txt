 Money Fund Yields Decline to 8.60% Due to Rate Retreat   By By James T. Areddy, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1989  For the week ended Tuesday, the average seven-day compounded yield declined to 8.60% from 8.62% the prior week, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said. The seven-day yield was unchanged at 8.60% during the last two weeks of September.  Assets of the 395 funds tracked by Donoghue's jumped about $2.1 billion to a record of $343.8 billion after declining the previous week. Money was added to each category of funds, Donoghue's said.  After three weeks of stagnation, the 30-day compounded yield on money funds increased slightly to 8.61% in the week ended Tuesday. That rise, from 8.60%, was a result of higher short-term interest rates in the previous reporting week, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. "The yields went up a little bit last week and the 30-day figures are reflecting that," she said.
