 Ailing Pan Am Still Relying on Asset Sales --- But the Strategy Hasn't Improved The Airline's Prospects   By By Asra Q. Nomani, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1990  Pan Am Corp. executives have kept the fabled airline alive during the past decade by selling its heirlooms: the Manhattan headquarters building, the Pacific division, Intercontinental Hotels and, most recently, the Pan Am World Services unit.  On Friday, Pan Am reported a worse-than-expected $178.3 million net loss for the fourth quarter and a $336.6 million loss for the year. The full-year loss was nearly four times Pan Am's 1988 deficit of $72.7 million and partly reflected the effects the terrorist bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in late 1988 that killed all on board. The 1989 results included a gain of $110.5 million from the sale of Pan Am World Services, a contract-services subsidiary.  Although some shareholders must wonder at the point of it all, Pan Am probably can keep going this way for a little while longer, holding fast to its professed hope of finding a merger partner. Pan Am still has a number of valuable assets it can sell, such as its East Coast shuttle, worth as much as $400 million.
