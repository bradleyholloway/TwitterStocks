 Mortgage Rates Jumped Sharply During Week --- Analysts Say Rise, Blamed On Prime Rate, Dollar, Is Unlikely to Continue   By By Michel McQueen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1987  Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 9.27% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, a 0.2 percentage point increase over the previous week, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  The rate is higher than the 9.08% average rate lenders were seeking a month earlier, but still lower than the 9.99% rate of a year ago. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.  A separate survey by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board showed that the average effective interest rate for conventional fixed-rate mortgages early last month was 9.48%, a slight drop from the 9.52% rate in early February and the lowest level recorded by the Bank Board in nine years. Those figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 25 years or more.
