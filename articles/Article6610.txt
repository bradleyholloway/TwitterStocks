 The Middle Seat: More Fliers Forced To Give Up Seats; Overbookings Surge as Airlines Trim Schedules; Passenger Compensation Unchanged Since 1978   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2006  With more tickets being nonrefundable or carrying $100 penalties for changes, some travelers question whether airlines should be allowed to overbook as much as they do. Perhaps airlines should only be allowed to bump passenger with refundable tickets. If the ticket -- essentially a contract for service -- can't be broken by the customer, why should the vendor be allowed to break it? Consumers on restricted fares can't change their minds without penalty, but airlines can, complains John Reece, a frequent traveler from Truckee, Calif. "It seems to me the airlines have no excuse to overbook at all," he says.  Thatcher Stone and his teenage daughter got bumped by Continental Airlines in Newark, N.J., as they were trying to get to a Christmas skiing vacation in Colorado. The gate agent didn't ask for volunteers to give up seats, and Continental didn't unload his baggage -- it went to Colorado, preventing the Stones from finding someplace else to ski. The airline couldn't get him to Colorado for six days, rendering his vacation useless.  Continental says when someone is bumped, the carrier tries to offer alternative flights, refund the ticket, help make other arrangements, or offer some form of denied boarding compensation. "But that is not always acceptable to the customer," a spokesman says. "We are always sorry when a customer is denied boarding involuntarily."
