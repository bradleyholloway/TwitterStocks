 Telephone Firms Seek to Revise Subsidy System   By By Kathy Chen and Stephanie N. Mehta, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1999  WASHINGTON -- A telecommunications-industry proposal to overhaul a complex system of phone-service subsidies would simplify telephone bills and could reduce long-distance rates, proponents of the measure said.  The wide-ranging proposal calls for local telephone companies such as the Bells and GTE Corp. to bill for certain charges that long-distance carriers currently collect each month. The proposal would let local carriers increase this "new" combined charge to a maximum of $7 a month by July 2003 from $5.50 a month.  And while the proposal also calls for local telephone companies to reduce fees they charge long-distance companies, consumer advocates questioned whether the long-distance carriers would pass along those savings to customers.
