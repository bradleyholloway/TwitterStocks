A 37-year-old Bronx man was dragged to his death yesterday when he lost his gold necklace to a chain-snatcher and clung to a door handle as the robber sped away in a stolen car with an accomplice at the wheel, the police reported. A 17-year-old bystander also was injured in the incident.  A spokesman, Lieut. Edwin Le Schack, said the robbery took place at 3:10 P.M. on Southern Boulevard, just south of Leggett Avenue, in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx.  The victim, identified as Jose Carronero of 970 Prospect Avenue, was standing by the avenue when a black car stopped beside him, a man jumped out, grabbed the victim's chain and jumped back into the car, which was driven by a woman, the lieutenant said.  As the car drove off, Mr. Carronero held on to the door handle on the passenger side, lost his balance and was dragged along as the car gathered speed going north. The driver swerved violently to shake the victim loose, sideswiping first a parked truck and then hitting a station wagon, Lieutenant LeSchack said.  He said the injured youth, Louis Ponce of 374 East 159th Street, also of the Bronx, was struck as he was entering the station wagon and suffered a shattered pelvis. He was later reported in serious condition at Lincoln Hospital.  Mr. Carronero fell free more than a block from the scene of the chain-snatching, at East 156th Street, where he was pronounced dead.  Lieutenant LeSchack added that some neighborhood residents chased but were unable to catch up with it.  The car, with New Jersey license plates, had been reported stolen before the incident. It was found abandoned last night on Kelly Street in the South Bronx, about five hours after Mr. Carronero's death, the lieutenant said.  He said that as of last night, the police were still trying to get descriptions of the chain-snatcher and the driver of the car.
