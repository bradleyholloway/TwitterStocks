 Prices Surge in Frankfurt and London, Aided by Hopes of Lower Interest Rates --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1987  Stock prices were broadly higher in Frankfurt and rose to record levels in London, sparked by hopes of lower interest rates and the dollar's rebound in Europe. Share prices throughout Europe rose on those factors, as well as Wall Street's surge Tuesday.  There was widespread speculation in the financial markets that the West German central bank will decide on steps to push domestic interest rates lower at a Thursday meeting. Such speculation sparked gains in bond prices and the dollar. That, in turn, boosted stock prices.  Investors didn't react much to mixed West German economic indicators, brokers said. The government reported that the unemployment rate fell to 8.8% in April from 9.6% in March, but also announced that March industrial production fell an inflation-adjusted 3%.
