 Societe Generale Plans To Take Cowen Public; French Firm Aims to Expand In Investment-Bank Sector; IPO May Raise $500 Million   By Craig Karmin and Karen Richardson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2005  SG Cowen, a boutique investment-banking firm owned by France's Societe Generale SA, will announce today that it plans an initial public offering, according to a person familiar with the situation.  As an independent firm, SG Cowen would be able to restructure and expand its breadth, such as adding an asset-management business, in ways it can't as part of Societe Generale.  This isn't the first time that Societe Generale scaled back its exposure to SG Cowen. In 2000, as investment banks started looking to expand their lucrative private-client operations, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bought SG Cowen's high net-worth brokerage business for an undisclosed amount. At the time, the unit had about 60,000 accounts and increased Lehman's assets under management by $10 billion.
