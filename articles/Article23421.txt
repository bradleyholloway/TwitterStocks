 'Bipartisan' Plan for Iraq Has a Familiar Ring   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2006  Messrs. [Joseph R. Biden Jr.] and [Leslie H. Gelb] offer some good ideas about ways to decrease our exposure to continuing Iraqi conflict. The large American and British presence in Iraq gives the extremists and terrorists the ability to blame us for everything going wrong and a convenient excuse to sow chaos and mayhem. The extremists' logic: If the U.S. trains police, kill all the police; if the U.S. trains firefighters, set as many fires as possible; if the U.S. builds schools, bomb all the schools. The Coalition Forces accomplished the mission of removing Saddam Hussein (an undeniable menace to the region and the world) from power. Now, it is simply not fair for the U.S. to face the bulk of the burden of stabilizing Iraq simply because other key players refuse to step up and help. Let the Iraqis and the "international community" assume more of the responsibility.
