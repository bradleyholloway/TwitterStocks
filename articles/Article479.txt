To the Editor:  The insistence in your April 5 editorial that our military attache in Washington (Gen. Christian Ackerknecht) was ''compelled to resign the same job in Bonn because of charges that he was a notorious torturer of political prisoners'' is absolutely false. The attache was not compelled to resign, nor was he responsible for torture.  his rancid story, repeated - first in your news columns (March 28) and then in the editorial - seven years after its fabrication by a Chilean exile, is nothing more than that: a story with no other objective than the character assassination of a person associated with our Government in order to blacken the image of the Government of Chile.  In regard to the so-called Letelier case, the Government of Chile, with due consideration for the total, constitutional independence exercised by the Chilean court system, cooperated to the maximum extent possible in the clarification of that deplorable crime. That cooperation, by the way, was fully recognized by the lawyer representing U.S. interests in extradition proceedings before the Supreme Court of Chile.  In a plebiscite held Sept. 11, 1980, two-thirds of the people of Chile approved a new Constitution and the timetable for the attainment of complete representative democratic normality. We therefore could not care less about the fact that a sovereign decision of the Chilean nation has not been blessed by The Times.  Finally, the insinuation that my Government should have been involved in the repugnant murder of an outstanding labor leader some weeks ago is completely unacceptable. It would be very difficult to sustain such a conclusion about a crime that is still under investigation and whose particulars are still largely unknown. ENRIQUE VALENZUELA Ambassador of Chile Washington, April 6, 1982
