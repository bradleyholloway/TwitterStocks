 Group Says U.S. Antitrust Policy Hinders Mergers Among Hospitals   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1992  The American Hospital Association said federal antitrust policies are thwarting mergers and collaborative ventures between hospitals that could help contain soaring health costs.  The industry group, representing mostly nonprofit hospitals, urged that antitrust enforcement be relaxed so that hospitals can reduce overcapacity and redundant investments in costly medical technology.  In a report to be issued today, the AHA says the Justice Department has challenged at least eight hospital combinations in the past few years, and it says the prospect of a Federal Trade Commission investigation has prompted other hospitals to abandon merger proposals. Since two highly publicized cases in 1988 and 1989 involving hospitals in Roanoke, Va., and Rockford, Ill., hospital merger activity has been damped, the report says.
