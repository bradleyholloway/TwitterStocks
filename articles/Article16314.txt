 Career Journal: Grads Seeking Public Service Find Few Jobs   By Chung, Juliet, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2003  "I made the mistake of thinking that because I want to do something that's public service-oriented, which . . . I thought was somewhat noble, it wouldn't be so competitive," says Mr. [SHAN PATEL], a Bedford, Mass., native who taught English to Somali refugees as a high-school volunteer outside Boston. "I thought I could pick and choose, but it didn't really pan out that way."  "There aren't 40 dot-coms saying, 'Come and play with us for a couple of years, and you'll be with a group of extremely smart people, and, if we do extremely well, the world will be your oyster,' " says Bill Wright-Swadel, the director of career services at Harvard. Recalling a time when seniors got signing bonuses to work in business, he says: "That kind of market doesn't exist at this point in time, so students have to be much more assertive."  "I'm not hearing either way, and I don't blame City Year for it at all because it's out of their control, but I need to pay off my loans and not let other opportunities pass me by," she says. "In this economy, they're few and far between."
