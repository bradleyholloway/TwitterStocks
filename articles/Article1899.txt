 World-Wide [5]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1988  The party's national convention in Atlanta overwhelmingly endorsed the Massachusetts governor, with California's votes putting him in excess of the 2,082 delegates needed to win the nomination. Dukakis is to deliver his acceptance speech tonight. Hours before the traditional roll call of states, Dukakis and his designated running mate, Sen. Bentsen of Texas, held private talks with Jackson. The discussions were described by aides as part of a promised effort to meld the campaigns.  The Iranian leader, in a statement on Tehran Radio, for the first time publicly accepted a U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire with Iraq, a move some U.S. officials said would lessen suspicion about Tehran's agreement to the plan this week. As the U.N. secretary-general announced plans to send a team to the Persian Gulf nations to work out details of the truce, Baghdad's foreign minister proposed "formal and direct" talks "as soon as possible" between the two nations.  The governments of South Africa, Angola and Cuba agreed to adopt a set of broad principles calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Angola and the implementation of a U.N. resolution assuring Namibia's independence from South Africa. A timetable hasn't been set for either action. Pretoria said negotiations, which are to continue next month, will focus on achieving a series of agreements filling in the details of the principles. The talks, mediated by the U.S., began in May.
