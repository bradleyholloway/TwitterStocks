 Newly Aggressive Labor Groups Pressure Companies in Indonesia   By By Timothy Mapes, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2002  Indonesia's non-oil exports fell 6.7% in the first half of this year, as businesses such as garment- and shoe-manufacturing lost billions of dollars in orders to competitors in China and Vietnam, where wages are lower and strikes fewer. Citing concerns over quality and disrupted delivery schedules, U.S. shoe companies Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd. have canceled orders with Indonesian suppliers, throwing roughly 12,000 workers out of jobs.  Executives say labor leaders are jeopardizing jobs because they don't understand the competitive conditions Indonesian companies face. Indonesia's garment business "is being lost to Vietnam," says Sunjoto Tanudjaja, who runs PT Great River International, one of the country's largest garment makers. Great River has shed about 5,000 jobs -- one-third of its work force -- over the past two years. Anton Supit, chairman of the Indonesian Footware Manufacturers' Association, estimates that his industry has lost 200,000 jobs over the past three years.
