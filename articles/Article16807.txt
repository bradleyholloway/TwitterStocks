 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Wealth Report: The Billionaire and the Bookstore; Sam Wyly Buys Left-Leaning Aspen Landmark -- and Some Locals Fret   By Frank, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2007  "You can't have [Sam Wyly]'s history and claim to want to continue [Katherine Thalberg]'s legacy at Explore," says Phyllis Bronson, a biochemist in Aspen who was one of Ms. Thalberg's closest friends. "The history of Explore is politically rich. Her politics and the store were closely intertwined."  Earlier this year, Ms. Bronson wrote a letter to the Aspen Times arguing that the sale violated all that Ms. Thalberg stood for. Ms. Thalberg, she said, "would not be happy seeing Explore sold to someone who opposed her every value." Another local resident, Jay Cowan, criticized plans to honor Mr. [Hunter S. Thompson]'s book "Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72" with an event this past summer at the Wyly- owned store.  The 73-year-old Mr. Wyly, who made his money from oil refining, computers, insurance, retailing, real estate and other investments, says he is especially attached to independent bookstores. He had two favorite stores near his main home in Highland Park, Texas, but both closed. "I didn't want that to happen to Explore." He adds that calling him a "conservative" and Mrs. Thalberg a "liberal" is oversimplifying. "I'm interested in personalities, not political parties," he says. What's more, he says, it's irrelevant to the bookstore. "People go to a bookstore because they love books, not because of politics."
