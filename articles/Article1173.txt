 Car Sales, Fueled by Incentives, Jumped In Early April but Pace Is Unimpressive   By By Bradley A. Stertz, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1989  U.S. auto makers showed in early April that they can still entice buyers back into showrooms with generous incentives, but it seems the old trick is losing some of its appeal.  Sales of North American-built cars and trucks jumped 28.3% in the first 10 days of April -- the first reporting period since the Big Three introduced sweeping new incentive programs. The increase isn't as impressive as it seems, however, because the year-earlier period was one of the weakest in 1988.  What's more, the seasonally adjusted sales pace for the latest period was just 7.6 million domestic cars. While that's well above the anemic 6.6 million annual rate during March, it's also far below the pace generated by sweeping low-interest financing programs in recent years. When the Big Three offered 2.9% financing in August 1986, for example, sales immediately surged to an annual pace of 11.5 million domestic cars.
