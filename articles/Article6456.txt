 Getting Going: How Math Fattens Your Wallet   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2005  Indeed, to get a decent handle on investing, you really need to grasp some basic mathematical concepts. Sound scary? Don't worry, you aren't about to get dragged into some mind-numbing numerical quagmire. Instead, what follows is a gentle stroll though a few key investment ideas and the math that backs them up.  To understand why, let's assume your $100,000 portfolio earns 8% this year and 8% next year. The first year's 8% gain will boost your portfolio's value to $108,000. That means you start the second year with more money and so get more benefit from the second year's 8% return. Result: Your wealth climbs to $116,640 by the end of the second year, giving you a cumulative two-year gain of 16.64%.  No, I can't tell you how to live 10 or 15 years beyond your life expectancy. But you can get those extra years of investment compounding at the other end, by starting to save as soon as you get out of school, rather than waiting until your 30s or 40s. If you do that, you will have a 10-year or 20-year head start on your neighbors. And there's a good chance you will retire with a seven-figure portfolio.
