 Accounting Oversight Board Proposes Sliding-Fee Structure   By By Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2003  Operating companies that are listed in the U.S. are expected to contribute about 95% of the fees, while 5% would come from investment companies, including mutual funds, with assets of more than $250 million, under the proposed rule. Accounting-board staff said investment companies will be assessed at a lower rate because of the less complex nature of investment-company audits. Foreign companies whose shares are listed in the U.S. would also be assessed a fee.
