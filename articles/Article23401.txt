 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  It's true that a law which expired at the end of last year did allow taxpayers who itemize deductions to choose to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their sales taxes. It's also true that they couldn't deduct both.  If you chose the IRS tables, you could add to those tables the amount of sales taxes you paid for certain items, such as a car or a boat. But if you chose to deduct your state and local income taxes instead of your sales taxes, you couldn't deduct any sales taxes at all, including those you paid to buy a car.
