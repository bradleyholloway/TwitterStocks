 Miffed at Washington, Police Develop Own Antiterror Plans   By Block, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  Homeland Security is playing down the police departments' moves, saying that it has already started to improve its communications with local authorities, reducing the urgency for independent networks. "We give local authorities intel [intelligence] data and they do what they think is right," says Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke. "They need to have the right information to do what they deem appropriate to protect their communities."  Many police chiefs say local forces need independent means to verify intelligence and share advice about threat responses. The aim, Mr. [William Bratton] says, is not to sever or supplant information from Homeland Security and the Department of Justice but to have a "multiplicity of channels of information that will allow chiefs of police to make decisions," he said.  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged the problem last month in Miami Beach, Fla., at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference, where he announced that his department, in response to police pressure, would soon start to send email "alerts" to some police chiefs at the same time that federal officials receive them. "I want to assure you that as a department we will continue to listen, continue to work with you," he said.
