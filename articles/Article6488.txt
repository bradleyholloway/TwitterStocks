 Attack Shuts Down U.S. Markets and Causes Global Declines --- Markets Will Remain Closed Again Today; Officials Assess Damage   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Michael Schroeder in Washington, and Kate Kelly and Antonio Regalado in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  Past history suggests the stock market will likely tumble when it finally opens again for trading, but a rebound could follow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.9% the day after the Pearl Harbor bombing, perhaps the most comparable tragedy in U.S. history, according to brokerage firm A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. The U.S. stock market was in a bear market and the economy struggling at the time of Pearl Harbor, similar to its state before yesterday's surprise attack. The Dow average was down a full 9.7% three months after the Pearl Harbor attack.  The market has generally shrugged off terrorist attacks such as the one against the federal office building in Oklahoma City or the first bombing of the Trade Center, though those attacks were less severe than this one. "In terms of magnitude, this is so much greater, I don't think it's comparable," said Steve Leuthold, head of Leuthold Group, a money-management and research firm in Minneapolis. He added that the Kennedy assassination was a reasonable comparison because people believed it was part of a broader attack on the U.S. government.  Some analysts feared a prolonged shutdown of U.S. markets could only further erode investor faith in workings of the financial markets. "Keeping the markets closed shows that terrorists brought you to bay, and it also creates more uncertainty," said Gary Gensler, the top Treasury official overseeing financial markets for the Clinton administration. Open markets would "allow for a lot of economic pressures to be relieved in an orderly way," he added.
