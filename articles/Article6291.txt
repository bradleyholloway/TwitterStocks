 `Mom, the Airlines Don't Like Me!'   By By Wendy Bounds and Lauren Lipton, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2000  For starters, she wasn't allowed to board ahead of anyone else. Then the family was denied roomier bulkhead seats in favor of passengers with special needs -- one of whom turned out to be an able-bodied college student. That left Ms. Band and her husband holding up an aisle of impatient passengers while they struggled to install Adam's child-restraint chair. With the plane so crowded, several passengers knocked young Adam in the head with their suitcases.  What is good about flying with children these days? Today, businesses from Baby Gap to luxury hotels are doing cartwheels to attract kids. But when was the last time you found a youth fare for air travel or saw an airline offering any special assistance to a mother with an infant? And what about saving a few roomier upfront seats for families? These once-popular measures are fading as fast as legroom. And, with the skies only getting more crowded, some airlines are now starting to cut privileges parents have relied on for decades.  It's not that airlines are out to get kids; adult leisure fliers usually get the same level of pared-down service. The truth is, much of the change is about economics -- and the realities of modern jet service. With 71% load factors, planes haven't been this packed since the 1940s, which only makes it harder for carriers to offer families any special attention or better seats. Airlines also argue that most families these days care more about price than amenities. "Don't get the idea that we don't welcome kids," says Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United. "The world has changed. It is mass transportation in the sky. We're trying to provide the highest level of service."
