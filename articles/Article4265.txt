 AmeriTrust Says 1st-Period Profit Met Analysts' Projections   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1987  AmeriTrust Corp. first-quarter results were "strong," and in line with analysts' projections that they would about equal the restated year-earlier $24.5 million, or $1.19 a share, according to Jerry V. Jarrett, chairman and chief executive officer.  Mr. Jarrett said the group led by Cleveland-based investor Alfred Lerner hasn't asked for board seats. The group announced last month that it holds 9.6% of AmeriTrust's 20.6 million shares outstanding. Mr. Jarrett said AmeriTrust executives haven't met with Mr. Lerner, who in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing termed his investment passive.
