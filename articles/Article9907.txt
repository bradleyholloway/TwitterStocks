 Consumer Drive For Hybrid Autos Is Slowing Down   By John D. Stoll and Gina Chon, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2006  Hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid still enjoy strong demand. But the slowdown for some other models comes as more consumers are questioning whether hybrid vehicles deliver sufficient fuel savings in real-world driving to justify the extra cost of the technology. The Accord Hybrid gets slightly less gas mileage than the gas-only version. A Honda Accord Hybrid, with a V-6 engine, gets 25 miles per gallon in the city and 34 miles per gallon on the highway, while the less expensive, conventional four-cylinder Accord gets 26 mpg in the city and 34 on the highway.  General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and BMW AG have formed an alliance to speed introduction of hybrid systems for use in SUVs. Ford has said it will roll out at least seven more hybrid models and that it will have the capacity to build 250,000 such vehicles by the end of the decade. The push to expand hybrid offerings represents substantial investments by the auto makers.
