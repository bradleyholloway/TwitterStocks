 CFTC Boosts Surveillance Of Silver-Futures Market   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  Speculation in the market about a pending CFTC investigation and a possible class-action lawsuit alleging manipulation has sent prices reeling recently. Yesterday, March silver futures bounced back sharply after falling four-consecutive sessions at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The active March contract gained 21 cents, or 3.84%, to $5.685 a troy ounce. But traders and analysts said they are continuing to monitor the possibility of regulatory intervention, keeping in mind that a prolonged investigation would diminish buying interest in the market.  At issue in the CFTC's inquiry is whether economic fundamentals justified the 29% silver price spike over November and December, which drove the metal to an 8 1/2-year high. When prices rose to more than $6 an ounce in December, some market participants attributed buying interest to increased demand from jewelry consumers in India. But others contested that much of the silver purchased and transported out of U.S. Comex warehouses was sent to private warehouses in Europe and was stored there by speculators trying to keep prices rising.  In addition, Martin Armstrong, chairman of the Princeton Economics Institute, said earlier this week that he had been contacted by a New York lawyer, Chris Lovell, for his opinion about whether silver futures prices had been manipulated. While Mr. Armstrong said Mr. Lovell was preparing a suit seeking class-action status alleging price manipulation, Mr. Lovell declined to comment and no suit has been filed. Princeton's trading arm had a short position of about 500 contracts on the Comex that would rise in value as silver futures fell, Mr. Armstrong said, adding that he advised taking the positions Dec. 30 because of patterns in the price behavior of silver relative to gold.
