 Bubbling Crude: As Oil Prices Rise, Investors Pour Into Risky Energy Plays; Hedge Funds, Private Equity Steer Billions to Startups; Bulls Cite Feverish Demand; Exotic Loans, New Managers   By Davis, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2006  Shortly after he left, Allegheny closed its trading desk in the wake of two setbacks: the collapse of Enron Corp., which sparked a downturn for other energy merchants, and an embezzlement scandal involving Daniel Gordon, Allegheny's head trader. Mr. Gordon later pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to stealing from a prior employer, Merrill Lynch & Co., and is now imprisoned. Mr. [Barry Kostiner] says he worked closely with Mr. Gordon on several trading desks, including at Merrill, which sold its energy-trading business to Allegheny. He says he had no knowledge of Mr. Gordon's crimes. Mr. Gordon's lawyer says the scheme didn't involve subordinates.  Mr. Kostiner said his offer for Tandem values its barrels of oil in the ground at under $11. If the price of oil is around $70 a barrel and it costs $15 or less a barrel to extract Tandem's oil and pay overhead, he adds in an interview, his company would bring in more than $40 per barrel before depreciation and taxes. Even if oil prices dip, the strategy will work, he says. "My motive is not to make a directional price bet," says Mr. Kostiner. "It's to capture the gap between the price of oil in the ground and commodities prices."  Others already have made millions. The Platinum IPO's underwriters were paid about $7 million. Mr. Kostiner and other organizers got 20% of Platinum's stock. After nearing $9 this spring, the combined value of each Platinum share and warrant is now about $8.04. Today, Mr. Kostiner's grant of Platinum stock is worth $6.4 million. He hasn't drawn a salary yet, but the company says he will make market rates as chief executive.
