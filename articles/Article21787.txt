 The timber summit: Ecosystem Babbitt-babble   By Sugg, Ike C, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 2, 1993  Ike C. Sugg discusses the Timber Summit being held by President Clinton and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Sugg says that the spotted owl controversy was engineered by environmentalists to stop logging of old-growth forests, and argues that the Endangered Species Act has been ineffective, in part because it has created incentives for people to speed up logging before the law is applied to them.
