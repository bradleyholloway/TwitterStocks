 Disney's Eisner Steps Down From Chairman Post After Protest Garners 43% of Voted Shares; Executive to Remain CEO; Mitchell to Head Board, Amid 24% Opposition; 'Branding' Is for Cows   By Bruce Orwall, Brian Steinberg and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2004  Oddly enough, Comcast's hostile bid affords Mr. [Michael Eisner] some protection. The Disney board has been reluctant to oust Mr. Eisner as chief executive, people close to the board say, out of fear that firing the CEO would be unwise at a time when Disney is being stalked by Comcast. Comcast immediately pounced on Disney's bad news, asking for a meeting with Disney's independent directors. Disney's board last night said it did not believe Comcast's "reiteration" of the previous proposal "would lead to a transaction beneficial to Disney shareholders."  The Disney meeting caps the first chapter of what is likely to be a long-running crisis over the company's future. The drama began late last year, when Roy E. Disney, nephew of the company's founder, and his long-time business partner, Stanley Gold, quit the company's board after learning that Mr. Disney was going to be forced off it by a mandatory retirement policy. They went on to wage a bitter campaign urging shareholders to oppose Mr. Eisner and three other directors as Mr. Eisner's long list of critics, including several big pension funds, used the moment to launch their own broadsides against him.  Mr. Disney then reprised his view that the company has lost its creative heart. "In recent times, there's been a tendency to refer to us as 'the Disney brand,'" he complained. "Branding is something you do to cows. . . . Branding is what you do when there's nothing original about your product."
