A Nov 11, 1997 article incorrectly said that ESC expected the purchase to reduce 1998 earnings. Also, Post Properties Inc hasn't changed its accounting policies following the recent acquisition of Columbus Realty Trust. An article Oct 29 in the Property Report, based on information in an analyst's report, incorrectly stated that Post has changed the way it capitalizes expenses to reduce costs while boosting funds from operations.
