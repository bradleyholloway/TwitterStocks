 Earnings Digest: Barnes & Noble Swings to a Loss; Books Retailer Blames Heavy Discounting, Warns of Weak Profit   By Covert, James, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2007  The discounts helped drive sales, but the company said the quarter received a greater benefit from such hardcover titles as Mohsin Hamid's "The Reluctant Fundamentalist" and Giada De Laurentiis's "Everyday Pasta."  Barnes & Noble expects a second-quarter sales boost from the publication on July 21 of "[Harry Potter] and the Deathly Hallows," the finale to the wildly popular series. In April, Barnes & Noble said it had already received more than 500,000 preorders for the book and expected the number to top the one-million mark by the launch date.
