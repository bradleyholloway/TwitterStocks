 Explaining P/E as a Defense Against Overpaying   By By Sheila Muto, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  Some readers expressed confusion about a graphic that accompanied the column: It gave a P/E index for homes in the Los Angeles area and one for homes in the San Francisco area, not the actual P/E ratios. "That index was simply a guide to indicate whether the P/E ratios in the regions were high compared to where they were historically," says Mr. [Edward Leamer].  A: Ultimately, the market "will value that house as if it had a rental value," Mr. Leamer says, because that is the intrinsic value of the house, and the intrinsic value will assert itself when emotional and psychological factors play themselves out. He draws a comparison to the stock market and the lessons the bubble and subsequent collapse of recent years taught investors: "A high P/E ratio suggests that there's not much room for a stock to keep growing. We've learned in the last year or two that the P/E ratio matters. There may be investors out there that have not gotten the message, but they're feeling a lot of pain."  A: "Tax benefits matter in deciding whether the P/E ratio makes sense" in an area, says Mr. Leamer. "First compute the P/E ratio, and then consider the tax implications," both property taxes and the tax write-offs on mortgage interest. But that doesn't alter the comparison of the P/E ratio of a home to the historical P/E ratios for the area. "The bottom line is, when prices are going up and rental rates are flat or going down," he says, "there's a disconnect and properties are overvalued."
