 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  This search for a turning point also suggests the market could be falling into a "things will get better after" mode, as in "things will get better after investment banks close their books" or "things will get better after the Fed meets next week."  The amount of oil getting pulled from the ground has been declining. World oil production averaged 73.1 million barrels a day in the first eight months of this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, down from an average 73.8 million barrels a day in 2005. Production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets today, averaged 28.4 million barrels a day through August, down from 2005's daily average of 30 million barrels.  Meantime, as evidenced by the Bank of Canada's decision to cut rates yesterday, weakness in the U.S. economy appears to be spreading elsewhere. Maybe there's a reason oil has fallen to $88.32 a barrel in New York from a high of $98.18 two weeks ago.
