 Compaq Deal May Hide Issue In PC Business   By By Susan Pulliam and Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1998  Most of Wall Street hasn't stopped applauding since Compaq Computer announced its record-breaking $9.6 billion merger with Digital Equipment last month.

Merging with DEC will move Compaq into higher-margin, bigger-box computers and networks.  Some Compaq watchers say recent financial transactions, including two transactions involving receivables in the third and fourth quarters, suggest that Compaq is having a tougher time cutting costs out of its PC business than it told Wall Street it would last summer.
