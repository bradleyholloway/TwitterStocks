 Arthur Andersen Copes With Effects of Tax Scandal --- Tensions Rise at Accounting Firm From Actions by Consulting Unit   By By Scott R. Schmedel and Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1992  In a barely noticed Colorado court settlement last October, Andersen publicly admitted to an "inexcusable" failure of its consulting arm to withhold the state's income tax from the pay of 350 nonresident employees working temporarily in the state. Some employees say supervisors at the august firm even showed them how to evade the tax themselves. (If that happened, Andersen says the firm didn't authorize it.)  As part of the civil settlement, Andersen, which is based in Chicago, paid Colorado nearly $1 million, in taxes, penalties and investigation costs, and publicly confessed its wrongdoing. And Andersen says it made similar settlements with more than 30 other states, which it refuses to identify. It says it paid these states only taxes due, and no penalties were imposed.  Douglas Sewell, former managing partner of Andersen Consulting's Dallas office, which sent some employees to Colorado but failed to withhold their Colorado taxes, is currently in a sales management job for the firm in Texas. "I used to have 400 people working for me, and I now have about 10 reporting to me," he says. "I don't see that as a downgrade, but some people might view it that way."
