 USA Networks Says Net Loss Widened In Fourth Quarter   By By Erin White, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 2001  Much of the growth for the fourth quarter came from USA's cable and studios division, which includes its USA and Sci Fi entertainment cable networks and its Studios USA television-production business. The division's cash flow rose 20% to $151.1 million. Its studios business turned in a strong performance, with revenue rising 74% to $144.9 million. The Sci Fi channel also did well, posting a 23% revenue rise to $78.4 million.  Separately, Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc. closed its acquisition of USA's wholly owned subsidiary Ticketmaster Corp. on Wednesday. The new entity, called Ticketmaster and based in Los Angeles, is 68% owned by USA. The new Ticketmaster said it expects to post cash earnings per share of 20 cents for 2001.
