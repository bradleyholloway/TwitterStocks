 How American Banks Suddenly Rushed To Curb Their Lending to South Africa   By This story was prepared by Wall Street Journal staff reporters Steve Mufson in Johannesburg, Michael R. Sesit and Phillip L. Zweig in New York, Lawrence Ingrassia in London And Robert S. Greenberger in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1985  And so did others. Chase, according to financial and business sources in South Africa and in the U.S., told all its South African clients it wouldn't be renewing some $400 million in short-term loans. It even asked for early repayment on some longer-term loans. News of those moves got out -- and South Africa plunged abruptly into the financial soup.  "It was like a 1929 run on a bank," says Thomas Donovan, vice chairman of Marine Midland Bank, New York. "Everybody was trying to get out." A Wall Street Journal reconstruction of the South African crisis shows how events then moved swiftly: to the temporary closing of the stock and currency markets, then to a four-month moratorium on debt principal repayments by South African banks and the reinstitution of a two-tier currency.  Chase declines comment on its role. Bankers accustomed to dealing with the threadbare economies of debt-laden South American and African nations still are trying to assess the effect of a moratorium by a relatively healthy debtor. Chris Ball, managing director of Barclays National Bank in South Africa, notes how foreign banks swiftly put South Africa in a bind that economic sanctions couldn't have brought about for a long time.
