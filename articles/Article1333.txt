 Retail Sales Declined 0.7% During May --- Economists Say the Drop, Third in as Many Months, May Not Mean Recession   By By Tuesday Georges, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1990  The May decline followed drops of 0.9% in April and 0.4% in March. Nevertheless, economists say the three-month decline, while reflecting continued weakness in the overall economy, doesn't necessarily foreshadow a recession.  "The figures show some sign of economic weakness, but a good part of that is just a distortion {caused by} the weather," said Thomas Swanstrom, chief economist for Sears Merchandise Group in Chicago. He cited unusually cool weather in certain regions, and concluded: "I think the jury is still out as to whether this is really some sign of economic weakness or if this is just some type of aberration."
