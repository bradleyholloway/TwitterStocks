 Yugo's Troubles Pose Problems For Car Owners   By By Gregory A. Patterson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1989  In the wake of Yugo America Inc.'s bankruptcy filing last week, some dealers are holding a fire sale on the cars, offering up to $1,000 off the $4,500 sticker price. But other Yugo dealers have halted sales, because they fear they won't get reimbursed for warranty repairs.  The company insists it's making progress toward that goal. "The game plan is to continue marketing the Yugo in the U.S. and to continue to support the 120,000 Yugo owners," says Ronald Hoffman, senior vice president for operations. And some dealers are sticking with Yugo. "It's a good car for our (local) economy," says Richard Kelley, owner of MacKenzie Motors in tiny Brewer, Maine, where incomes are low by national standards. Mr. Kelley continues to sell the car (at about $400 below sticker price) and says he's honoring warranty claims.  But many dealers paint a far less rosy picture. Crystal Chrysler-Plymouth-Yugo, Kalamazoo, Mich., says Yugo sales in the week after Yugo America's Chapter 11 filing fell 40% from a year earlier.
