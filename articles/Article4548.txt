 Cost of Gasoline Continues to Rise Despite Glut of Oil --- Prices Reach Two-Year Peak As Some Refiners Widen Control Over Supplies   By By Thomas Petzinger Jr. and George Getschow, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1985  As every motorist learned in the 1970s, gasoline prices rise in lockstep with crude-oil prices. But these days, many people are puzzled and outraged by a paradox: Crude-oil prices are plummeting and gasoline prices are rising.  Oil industry spokesmen attribute the price rises to a number of factors, including the aftereffects of the recent British coal-miner strike and the costs of complying with new federal lead-content regulations. But consumer groups, independent gasoline marketers and even some oil-company executives say the industry is weary of low margins or losses on refining and is controlling gasoline supplies to boost prices.  Moreover, mergers, refinery closings and the withdrawal of several companies from major marketing areas have made it easier for refineries to push through higher prices. A few years ago, "the independent refineries would have gone right around this price increase and ridden it back down," says Robert French, an executive at California Target Enterprises Inc., an independent gasoline marketer. But bankruptcies of independently owned refineries have enabled Big Oil to pass along higher prices, he says. "The motoring public is going to pay through the nose."
