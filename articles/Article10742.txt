 The Contra Fight: How CIA-Aided Raids In Nicaragua in '84 Led Congress to End Funds --- But Officials Help Insurgents Raise Private Funds Here; The Role of Rep. Boland --- Scaring Exxon's Ships Away   By By David Rogers and David Ignatius, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1985  The operation, outlined in a classified CIA document, marked the peak of U.S. involvement in the four-year guerrilla war in Nicaragua. More than any other single event, it solidified congressional opposition to the covert war, and in the year since then, no new money has been approved beyond the last CIA checks drawn early last summer.  U.S. officials are quietly helping the insurgents raise private funds to keep alive the Contra program the CIA began to finance in 1981. As he throws himself personally into the fight, President Reagan faces broad public opposition to U.S. involvement in efforts to topple the Sandinista regime. The level of private contribution so far -- between $5 million and $10 million -- can't match the support formerly provided by the CIA. And in Honduras, a guerrilla base throughout the war, the Tegucigalpa government nervously awaits a new congressional vote on funding this season.  Contra leaders say the CIA training improved their forces, but the insurgents resented what they regarded as CIA interference in their operations. At the same time, CIA paramilitary officers were upset by the ineffectiveness of the Contras. A bridge at Corinto was repeatedly targeted, for example, but missions failed. As the insurgency force grew -- doubling to about 15,000 during 1983 -- the CIA began to use the guerrilla army as a cover for its own small "Latino" force. Guerrilla radio broadcasts gave credit to the anti-Sandinista movement, but the raids were carried out now by non-Nicaraguans from such countries as Bolivia and Ecuador.
