 Microsoft Seeking to Derail AOL Talks With Netscape --- At Same Time, Netscape Said To Try for an Alliance With CompuServe Inc.   By By Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1996  VIENNA, Va. -- Microsoft Corp., seeking to derail talks between its software rival Netscape Communications Corp. and America Online Inc., is trying to persuade the computer on-line service to license Microsoft Internet software instead.  Though some details of the AOL talks are still sketchy, people close to the two companies said Microsoft is seeking a broad licensing agreement with AOL, the leading computer on-line service. The licensing pact would give America Online's five million subscribers Microsoft's Internet Explorer software to navigate the multimedia portion of the Internet known as the World Wide Web, the individuals said.  The rival talks highlight the intense competition between Microsoft and Netscape to become masters of the Internet software universe. Already the central force in personal-computer software, Microsoft upped the pressure recently on Netscape by offering its Web browser and server programs free. Microsoft is vowing to make Internet access a built-in component of Microsoft's operating system and applications software. On Tuesday, Netscape countered by cutting prices and offering an array of new server programs to help businesses set up various services on the Internet.
