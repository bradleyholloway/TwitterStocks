 She Might Have Inherited Millions, But For Her Mother --- While Ralph Falk II Received A Fortune, His Sister Was Cut Off: Now She's Suing   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1991  To his widow, Marian, and his son, Ralph II, Dr. Falk bequeathed Baxter stock that would grow to be worth nearly $200 million. Marian lived the life of a wealthy socialite until she died last December at age 95. Ralph II, meanwhile, succeeded his father as chairman of Baxter, which went on to be the nation's biggest hospital supply concern. Retired 11 years ago, he is 69.  But there is another Falk, one the family apparently tried its best to forget. Her name is Carol, the only daughter of Ralph and Marian. Dr. Falk's will left Carol $100. Her mother's will didn't mention her at all.  Mrs. Falk was a svelte and striking beauty, and her daughter's obesity, beginning around age 8, became an obsession. According to Carol, now Mrs. Lopacich, her mother marched her nightly into the bathroom and onto the scale, reading off the little girl's weight disapprovingly.
