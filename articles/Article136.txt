WASHINGTON, May 12â€” The House Appropriations Committee today sought to assure college students and lending institutions that there would be no changes in federally guaranteed student loans for the academic year starting this fall.  The Reagan Administration is seeking broad changes in student loan programs to reduce the cost to the Government, including a formula that would take into account family income and assets. The Administration has also proposed halting Federal payments of interest on the loans while a student is in school.  The House Appropriations Committee, in approving a supplemental money bill for the current fiscal year, noted that it did not include the Administration's proposals.
