 Japan Considers Wider Disclosure Of Stock Holdings   By By Marcus W. Brauchli, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1988  Japan's Ministry of Finance next year may tighten share-ownership rules to require investors to disclose if they own more than 5% of a company's stock, a spokesman said.  The ministry spokesman said the proposal, which would bring Japan's ownership-disclosure rules into line with those in other major financial centers, including London and New York, will be studied by a quasi-official committee on securities trading later this year or in early 1989. At the moment, however, "there is nothing concrete," the spokesman said.
