CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb. 16â€” From the windows of his office in the launching control center George F. Page has an unobstructed view of the space shuttle Columbia in the steel embrace of its launching tower, three miles to the east where the palmetto scrub gives way to sand and to the Atlantic Ocean.  Mr. Page, the shuttle launching director, watched this afternoon as a rain squall passed over the Kennedy Space Center. Rain and stiff winds in recent days had hampered the work of technicians at the launching pad. But nearly all of their work had now been done, and this rain was no cause for concern. Indeed, Mr. Page had just made the decision to begin the countdown.  And so at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, with Mr. Page and 120 others at the control consoles in the firing room, the digital clocks began counting down the seconds, minutes and hours until the planned ignition of Columbia's three main rocket engines. The 20-second test firing of the engines is scheduled for 7:45 A.M. Thursday.  This is the dress rehearsal for Columbia's long-awaited orbital debut, now expected to come sometime in April. The mission, piloted by John W. Young and Capt. Robert L. Crippen of the Navy is planned to run three days and 36 orbits, after which the delta-wing reuseable shuttle is to glide to a runway landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Test Will Be Unmanned  Mr. Young and Capt. Crippen will not be in the cockpit during the flight-readiness firing and the spaceship will remain locked to its launching pad. But otherwise the countdown will involve nearly all of the prelaunching preparations of a real mission.  Soon after the countdown got underway - six days behind its original schedule - liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen were pumped into Columbia's fuel cells, the units that produce electricity for operating the spaceship's electronics and, as a byproduct, make potable water during the flight. All other systems will be inspected by electronic sensors, reporting their findings periodically to computers in the firing room.  ''This is going to look to us like a real launch,'' Mr. Page explained. ''We depend on this to give us an indication of any problems in our preflight procedures and in the shuttle itself. Everybody's got a certain amount of concern. It's the first countdown for a new vehicle, and you expect some problems and surprises.''  One problem arose earlier in the day and for a time it threatened to delay commencement of the countdown. The secondary electrical power system for the computerized controller on one of the three main engines appeared to be malfunctioning. Its voltage output was below normal, but not below operational needs.  After hours of trouble-shooting, Mr. Page said, it was decided to proceed with the countdown. Computer instructions were modified to take into account the anomaly. Besides, since the primary power source for the controller was working, there probably would be no need for the backup system to take over the management of that engine's firing.  The 184-foot-high space shuttle - the winged Columbia and its external fuel tank and two booster rockets - stands on Launching Pad 39A. This was the liftoff site for nearly all of the Apollo lunarlanding voyages. It has been modified considerably, however, to accomodate the rather unstreamlined shape of the shuttle.  Standing highest above the mound of concrete is the fixed service structure, 247 feet of red and gray steel superstructure resembling an unfinished skyscraper. Elevators, pipes and electrical lines run up and down the structure. A hammerhead crane extends from its uppermost reaches. Access arms reach out from the structure to the vehicle so that technicians can get at their work. Pipes run between the tower and the vehicle carrying pressurization gases and the shuttle's propellants, super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Cradle Around Columbia  To one side of the steel tower, the side away from the sea, the smaller rotating service structure forms a 130-foot-high cradle around Columbia. From the structure technicians checked out the spaceship and, in the future would install the payloads for its cargo bay.  Out from the launching pad, beyond the security fences, several wild pigs root in the underbrush and an armadillo pauses by the side of the road, reminders that most of the Kennedy Space Center is a wildlife refuge as well as a citadel of technology.  If the countdown rehearsal and flight-readiness firing are successful, technicians still have more work to do on the shuttle. Patches of insulation on the external fuel tank came unglued in January and must be rebonded. Mr. Page said the repairs should begin a few days after the firing test and, as far as he can tell now, should not necessitate hauling the shuttle back to its hangar.  Such a move would mean a further postponement in the flight. At present, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is saying that the launching will occur in the week of April 5. But Mr. Page is not so sure it can be done.  ''It's a very optimistic target,'' Mr. Page said. ''There's just an awful lot of things to do and the schedule is tight.'' Many officials and engineers of the Kennedy Space Center would not be surprised if the launching had to be put off until middle or late April.  Illustrations: Photo of the space shuttle
