 New Tools Can Help Patients Reduce Cost of Medications   By By Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2003  BenefitsCheckUpRx also searches a handful of drug-discount cards, also sponsored by drug companies, another option for people with slightly higher incomes. To be included on the site, the cards have to be free to consumers and provide a discount of at least 20%, he says.  BenefitsCheckUpRx has the broadest range of deals of any Internet resource so far, including information about 30 state-funded pharmacy programs, which offer discounts to older people with lower incomes; age and income requirements vary from state to state. In New York, for example, one program offers aid to people who are 65 and older with annual incomes of as much as $35,000 (couples can make $50,000).  Neoma Armstrong, for example, a 78-year-old widow in Pueblo, Colo., already had enrolled in Pfizer Inc.'s patient-assistance program to help pay for her arthritis and heart medications. But last week she called Pueblo's "Senior Link," a telephone counseling service backed by local governments, to get advice on how to pay for another drug her doctor prescribed recently for her ulcers. A counselor there, who had just learned about BenefitsCheckUpRx, typed in her information and discovered that Mrs. Armstrong, whose Social Security and small pension checks total about $1,000 a month, should qualify for a discount through TogetherRx, one of the discount-card programs run by several drug companies.
