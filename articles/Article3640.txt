 Love & Money: A 2007 Plan: Spend and Spend Some More   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  That means we're looking at the expense of hiring a professional speech therapist later this year. The therapists we're considering charge between $150 and $200 an hour. We're not sure how many sessions our daughter will attend each month, but if it's once a week, that's upward of $800 monthly that we have to begin working into our spending plan at some point.  I know: odd choice. But ever since my son has been able to understand Christmas, I've wanted to take him to the Santa Claus Village in northern Finland. He loves the Christmas season, and while he's still a believer, I want him to experience the aura of Santa in a somewhat authentic semblance of the North Pole -- a trip that [Amy] and I know will leave a lasting impression on him.  I've been pricing airfare and hotels, and a trip to Finland for four will set us back about $7,500 -- more than we've ever paid for any single vacation. But to both of us, this is a trip that, most likely, can only happen this year since our son will soon stop believing. It is a once-in-a-lifetime trip for our family, elevating it into a different category than a standard family vacation. (Our daughter, who will be 4 at the time, may be too young, but waiting until she's old enough pushes our son well past the age of belief.)
