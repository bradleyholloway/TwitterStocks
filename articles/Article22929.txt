 Martha Stewart Could Be Charged as `Tippee' --- Court Papers in Guilty Plea By a Merrill Employee Say She Based Sale on Inside Information   By By Jerry Markon, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2002  Neither Ms. [Martha Stewart] nor her broker, Peter Bacanovic, was identified by name, but people familiar with the case said that they were the alleged "tippee" and "financial advisor" referred to in the document. Late yesterday, Merrill fired Mr. Bacanovic, who has been on paid leave, for what the firm said was his refusal to cooperate. In addition, the firm said it fired Mr. Bacanovic's assistant, Douglas Faneuil, because of his guilty plea yesterday to a misdemeanor in connection with the case.  The U.S. attorney's stance is an aggressive reading of federal securities law -- which bars trading on "material, nonpublic information" -- and is intended to pressure Mr. Bacanovic to cooperate and agree to testify against Ms. Stewart, people familiar with the situation said. If he doesn't, Mr. Bacanovic could face charges in the case within a matter of weeks, the people said. The court papers allege that the information was "misappropriated and stolen" from Merrill by Mr. Bacanovic.  Prosecutors want to know what, if anything, Dr. [Sam Waksal] may know about Ms. Stewart's ImClone trade and whether she had any inside information when she made it, people familiar with the matter have said. Such information could be crucial to any insider-trading prosecution of Ms. Stewart, chairman and chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. That company's stock has been battered by the investigation.
