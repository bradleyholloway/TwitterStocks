 Politics & Economics: Germany's Health Pact Raises Doubts About Future Overhauls   By Thomas, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2006  Germany's fractious government coalition has survived its most serious crisis, as Chancellor Angela Merkel secured a compromise on an overhaul of the country's health-care system. But the outlook for overhauling the welfare state and labor rules is grim, with analysts warning that the government's slow progress is holding back Europe's largest economy.  "There are some reform projects on the agenda but the proposals don't bring us forward," said Jurgen Michels, economist with Citigroup. "The danger is that if there won't be any further reforms, Germany will put at risk the increased competitiveness it's gained over the past years thanks to wage restraints."  The government's track record has disappointed both voters and economists. Support for Ms. Merkel's conservative camp fell to 33% from 36% at the end of August, the lowest level since Germany's reunification in 1990. Merkel's coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, received 31% of the vote, up from 30%.
