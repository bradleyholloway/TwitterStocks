 David Bloom Gets 8 Years in Prison For Fraud Scheme   By By Betty Wong, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1988  David Bloom, the 24-year-old investment adviser who spent most of his clients' nearly $15 million on art and real estate for himself, was sentenced to eight years in federal prison.  Mr. Bloom, who pleaded guilty in March to one count each of mail fraud and securities fraud, also was ordered to make full restitution to his victims -- primarily friends of his family. From January 1986 through early this year, he operated through Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc., which had about 170 clients, without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Before a courtroom packed with observers, who gasped when the sentenced was pronounced, Mr. Bloom said his "life was out of control" and the scheme had "become a charade of tremendous proportions." He apologized for his "horrendous behavior and actions," and said he had undergone extensive psychiatric treatment earlier this year.
