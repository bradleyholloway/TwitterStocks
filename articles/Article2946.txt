 E-Commerce (A Special Report): Selling Strategies --- Fast Food -- The Net, With a Side of Fries: Fast-food firms are at last on the Web's menu   By By Shirley Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  Ms. [Jackie Rodriguez] says Burger King is smart to try to use the Internet, but cautions that its success will depend on how innovative the programs are. "If you're sitting in front of a computer screen, you're not driving past a Burger King. You're not going to have that direct impulse," says Ms. Rodriguez. "You want some kind of interaction with the consumer to develop a Burger King connection in their mind."  With eBay, Burger King has set up a similar marketing alliance that is tied to promotional codes on products. Fast-food customers will earn points on the San Jose-based online auctioneer to bid for one million prizes, ranging from CDs to a chance to play basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters. When customers buy certain foods or drinks with peel-off codes on the container, they then go to a Web site operated by Burger King and eBay. The code translates into earned points, which the customer deposits in eBay accounts and which can be used to bid on the prizes posted on the joint site.  Schlotzsky's also is experimenting with Internet kiosks that allow customers to walk into restaurants and punch in their own orders. The company installed its first kiosk in a store two months ago. Under Ms. [Robin Hanna], the chain is working with IBM to develop seamless transactions by installing the wireless technology. Schlotzsky's is testing software that will allow customers using their cellphones to locate the nearest Schlotzsky's and then place an order via speed dial on their phones while they are a few blocks away. The chain plans to launch a pilot program in Austin in the next few months.
