 Unit of Southland Financial Proposes Debt Restructuring   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1987  Southland Financial Corp. unveiled a $472 million debt restructuring plan that would turn over the land assets of its troubled Las Colinas Corp. unit to a new limited partnership and eventually could reduce the unit's stake in the properties to less than half.  The key component in the unit's months-long effort to restructure its debt and stave off foreclosure is a proposal to exchange its $200 million in high-interest mortgage debt for debt and equity in the new limited partnership, which would own the undeveloped land in the 12,000-acre Las Colinas planned development west of Dallas.
