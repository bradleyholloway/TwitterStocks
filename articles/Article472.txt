WASHINGTON, April 13â€” Taxes will take a smaller bite out of the American worker's daily earnings this year, economists for a nonprofit watchdog group, Tax Foundation, said today.  Each year, economists at the Washington-based group compute how much of a worker's daily earnings go to pay Federal, state and local taxes, along with how much is spent for necessities.  This year, they calculate, the amount of time of each work day necessary to pay off the tax collector is 2 hours 44 minutes, down 3 minutes from 1981.  State and local taxes will claim 53 minutes, the same as last year, while Federal taxes will take 1 hour 51 minutes. The economists attribute the drop to the Federal income tax cut.  Other major drains on eight-hour earnings were listed this way: Housing and household operation, 1 hour 30 minutes. Food, 1 hour 5 minutes. Transportation, 42 minutes. Medical care, 30 minutes. Clothing, 22 minutes. Recreation, 20 minutes.
