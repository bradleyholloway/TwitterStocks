 Letters to the Editor: Internationalism vs. Isolationism   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1988  Vermont Royster writes with his usual perceptiveness of World War I ("The 20th Century's Forgotten War," editorial page, Sept. 22).

Indeed a case can be made that our participation in World War I was one of the worst foreign-policy mistakes we ever made.
