 Business Bookshelf: Why Money Can Now Make Its Way Around the World   By Rees, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2007  Eventually, though, the new orthodoxy itself lost its force, particularly as markets sprang up in the 1960s in which governments or corporations deposited part of their assets in currencies outside their home market (primarily in London, since the deposits there were subject to virtually no regulation). These "Eurocurrency" markets, says Mr. [Rawi Abdelal], "represented the ad hoc evolution of international capital markets." Such markets got a further boost when the U.S. and Britain officially liberalized capital flows in the mid- to late- 1970s, followed by Japan in 1980.  The liberalization didn't stop there. Over the next few years, some of those socialists maneuvered themselves into the top jobs at places like the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Their collective memories of France's capital controls led them to push for a broad deregulation of capital flows. "The French experience of the beginning of the 1980s had been extremely convincing for me," said Michel Camdessus, who became head of the IMF in 1987. "I preached on every possible occasion that you cannot trust exchange controls in the long term."  Mr. Abdelal is unequivocal about the value of Europe's action: "Global financial markets are global primarily because the process of European financial integration became open and uniformly liberal." He also highlights how free capital flows got a boost from the two primary credit-rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. In the 1990s, both began to give higher ratings to government-backed debt when the country in question had an open capital account.
