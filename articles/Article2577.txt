 Squaring Off: Question: Should San Francisco's airport be allowed to swap wetlands for runways?   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1999  A combination of tight runway space and a fog-bound location have long made flight delays a familiar part of travel through San Francisco International Airport. Late last year, SFO officials proposed a $2.4 billion plan to ease the jam by building a new runway -- on 1,100 underwater acres to be reclaimed from San Francisco Bay. Such a plan raised the hackles of some environmentalists, but SFO proposed a tradeoff: compensate for the bay fill by restoring to natural state some 29,000 acres currently in use as commercial salt-evaporation ponds in the South Bay, more than 15 miles away.  Would the runways-for-wetlands proposal be a sound trade-off? Yes, says John L. Martin, director of San Francisco International Airport. No, says David A. Lewis, executive director of the Save San Francisco Bay Association, better known as Save the Bay.  In June 1998, the airport commissioned the consulting firm URS Griener to study airfield capacity at the three Bay Area airports, SFO, Oakland and San Jose. The study concluded that there is a lack of capacity at all three airports, negating any proposal to shift flights from one airport to another. The study proposed several possibilities for reducing delays -- such as using new technology and changing aircraft approaches -- but they won't work for all types of bad weather. The study found that the only way the runway system at SFO can be improved is to construct new runways in San Francisco Bay.
