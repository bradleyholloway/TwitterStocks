 PORTALS: Are Videogames Ready To Be Taken Seriously By Media Reviewers?   By Delaney, Kevin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2003  ONE PAPER TO BE presented in Utrecht applies a literary criticism concept of French writer Andre Gide to Super Monkey Ball, a simple action videogame. Troels Degn Johansson, of the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen, interprets the pitfalls facing players as a "recognition of one's fundamental insufficiency" in life. Unlike other serious university researchers, however, this one notes that he stinks at playing the game.  Other academics call for more rigorous definitions of the words "fun" and "gameplay" in videograme analysis. The debates between camps of researchers -- like the "narratologists" and "ludologists" -- are inpenetrable for outsiders. But some conference papers are more accessible, such as those concerning policy debates on topics like game addiction and the violence often portrayed.  Works like these remind us of games' growing influence on contemporary art, politics and culture. One interesting example online is NewsGaming.com, a Uruguayan Web site providing the videogame equivalent of political cartoons. Its first effort, called "September 12th" takes aim at the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
