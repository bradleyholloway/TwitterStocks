 AIDS: Better Silence Than Falsehoods   By By David Sanford, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1987  Unlike the scores of talented men whose deaths caused by acquired immune deficiency syndrome are now well noted on obituary pages, Mr. Bennett has joined the short list of victims identified publicly while still alive. Such publicity was resisted by Rock Hudson and fought by Roy Cohn and Liberace, and Mr. Bennett has shunned such attention, too, to the point of actively misrepresenting his condition.  On Jan. 23, 1986, a Times story noted that Mr. Bennett had withdrawn as director of the London production of the new musical "Chess." He had done so, said the story, "reportedly because of an attack of angina." The eight-time Tony winner and recipient of the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for drama had chest pains, palpitations and shortness of breath. Or so said the president of the Shubert Organization, producer of the show, quoting Mr. Bennett's unnamed doctor. Mr. Bennett himself wasn't taking phone calls.  Last Oct. 2, a Times reporter named Jeremy Gerard wrote a story about Michael Bennett's decision to sell a building he owned in Manhattan that was his business address and also the site of rehearsal halls and workshops dear to theater people. The cited reason for the sale was not the $14.5 million Mr. Bennett stood to realize in disposing of a structure he had purchased for $750,000. Again it was Mr. Bennett's reported heart ailment. And an associate of his said that because of his illness Mr. Bennett didn't expect to be working in the theater anytime soon. (Mr. Bennett wisely still wasn't returning a reporter's phone calls.)
