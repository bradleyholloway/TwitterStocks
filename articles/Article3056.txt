 AstraZeneca Has Victory in Ruling On Drug Patent   By By Colleen DeBaise, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  Prilosec, the blockbuster purple pill that last year accumulated sales of nearly $6 billion, has been at the center of the debate over legal and regulatory moves by some major drug makers to delay generic competition against big sellers. AstraZeneca's original patent protection on Prilosec ended in October 200l, but the company sought addition protection from generic competition based on a special formulation for the drug.  Kudco's version of Prilosec is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In the court case, Kudco had argued that it coats omeprazole -- the generic version of Prilosec -- with a nonalkaline substance, and that it has its own patent on this method, valid until 2016. It's not clear how soon Kudco would be able to put its version of Prilosec on the shelves. Andrx currently has exclusive rights under FDA rules to market its copy of Prilosec for six months. But with those plans stymied by Judge [Barbara S. Jones]'s ruling, the launch of any generic version of Prilosec may be stalled if Andrx chooses to appeal the ruling.
