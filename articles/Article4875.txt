 REGIONS   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1988  FORMER astronaut Donald "Deke" Slayton describes his company, Houston-based Space Services Inc., as "have rocket, will travel." Where he hopes to travel is Hawaii, but he may face some heavy lobbying from Florida.  Hawaii's big advantage is geography: Because it's closest to the equator, launches from Hawaii require less fuel than from other parts of the U.S. And, says Mr. Slayton, "The neat thing about Hawaii is, you can go in any direction without worrying about where your (rocket) stage is going to impact, because you've got ocean everywhere."  Florida Gov. Bob Martinez says a private spaceport in his state could piggyback on the Cape Canaveral infrastructure. He's asked the legislature for $500,000 to study the project. Playing the state's own geographical card, Jon Peck, the governor's spokesman, says, "It's a lot easier to get to Florida from Michigan or Texas than it is to get to Hawaii from anywhere."
