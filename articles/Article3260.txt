 Where Did That Big Rally Go?   By Schulte, Erin, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2004  Some think President [Bush] will strike back soon, which could help the stock market steady itself. "Bush will start to do his advertising, and answer back for the economy bashing," says Mr. [Alexander Paris]. "The economy has been growing for two years, and I think employment will start picking up."  "Investors broadly prefer the known to the unknown, whether it's for comfort or whether they have greater conviction for how policy will evolve," Mr. [Jack Caffrey] says. "Investors like the predictability of an incumbent -- or, they like gridlock."  "At the first rate hike, usually the economy is starting to do well -- the market holds up and gives roughly average performance going out a year," says Sam Burns, senior equity research analyst at Ned Davis Research. "After two or three rate hikes, you say, 'Whoa, they're serious -- it's a tightening cycle.'" In short: one rate increase, good; several rate increases, bad.
