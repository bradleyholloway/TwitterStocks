 On Sports: Betting in the Press Box   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1986  It's also OK to bet in the racing press boxes, and track managements typically set up windows for the exclusive use of the inhabitants. It's a service, to be sure, but I suspect it also serves a business interest. I've heard it said that anyone who could get the betting concession in the jockeys' quarters at a track could retire in comfort after a year. We writers are probably a bit smarter than that. It might take two or three years to get to Rio on our wagers.  All that is apropos of my day at the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita Park here Saturday. Did I bet? Are you kidding? The seven featured races offered purses of $1 million, $2 million or $3 million, and matched the best horses in the world, not just the little old USA. Not betting would have been like working for the water company and never taking a drink.  A few of those dollars -- 70 to be exact -- were mine, and an account of what I did with them might give more sense of the affair than a bald recitation of the winners, or even a hairy one. Open the Daily Racing Form with me for the first race, a 1 1/16-miler for two-year-old males with a purse of $1 million. Here's Polish Navy, winner of all four of his starts and $364,000. Here's Gulch, winner of five of six starts and $387,000. Here's Bet Twice, winner of five of six and $620,000. Sensory overload threatens. What's a bettor to do?
