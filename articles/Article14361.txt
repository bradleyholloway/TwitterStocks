 Business World: Small Firms Brace for a Legislative Attack   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1987  John Sloan, a former Nashville banker, is president of the National Federation of Independent Business, which means he's chief lobbyist for Main Street, U.S.A. His constituents own and operate corner cafes, insurance agencies, hardware stores, medical and legal services, laundromats -- you name it. Half employ 10 or fewer workers.  John Sloan's people are largely taken for granted, but as it happens they have been the stars of the American economy in the 1980s. As big corporations have laid off workers by the thousands to meet competitive pressures, small firms have more than cushioned the blow. They have created some 10 million new jobs since 1980, according to an estimate made at last year's White House Conference on Small Business. Moreover, equal opportunity is the rule, mainly because small entrepreneurs make their own opportunities. By one estimate, women now account for half of new business start-ups in the U.S.  Congress last year stiff-armed small-business pleas for relief from its number-one problem, soaring costs of liability insurance. It seems that the plaintiffs' bar, which sees damage suits and damage awards as its own version of free enterprise, has friends in Congress, too. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum waxed eloquent on the issue, saying "Congress has no right to put a price on human misery." The NFIB is having more success with tort reform in state legislatures, but nothing dramatic.
