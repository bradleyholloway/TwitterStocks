 Love & Money: When the Tooth Fairy Plays Favorites   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2004  The key is to tailor the explanation to a child's age. "Your answer as a parent," Dr. [Ted Feinberg] says, "needs to be in sync with where you view your child's abstract-reasoning abilities. Essentially, you're looking for an answer that, in talking it through with your child, you can tell is making sense in his or her head. But leave the door open for your kids to come back later and seek a more complete answer since, at some point, they're going to realize that your original answer doesn't make much sense anymore."  So, for instance, when Alex, a friend of mine in New York, confronted this, she chose analogies her daughter could immediately grasp. "I told her, 'Let's look at your classroom,'" Alex says. One girl is excellent at sports, but really short. Another is thoughtful but struggles academically. The point, Alex told her daughter, "is that everyone is different. With families that means every family makes different amounts of money and chooses to use their money in different ways."  Instead of just explaining that some families have more money than others, [Deanna] takes her daughter to serve meals to families who have little food, few means and often no place to live. "That way," Deanna says, "when these questions come up, I can say, 'Remember the people we serve food to at the church? There are people who don't have luxuries.'"
