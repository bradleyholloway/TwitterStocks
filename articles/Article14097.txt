 Fed Threatens to Shut Operations in Kansas Of Bank in Missouri   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1985  The Comptroller of the Currency recently approved a request by Mark Twain Bank to move its headquarters 16 miles to Overland Park, Kan., from Independence, Mo.  The Comptroller's office said the move was legal under provisions of the National Bank Act, which it administers. But the Fed, in a letter to Mark Twain Bancshares Inc., the St. Louis holding company that owns Mark Twain Bank, said the move violated the terms under which the Fed approved the 1982 purchase of the Independence bank.  The Mark Twain Bank move took advantage of another loophole in federal banking laws banning interstate branching. As with limited-service banks, the move was approved by the Comptroller.
