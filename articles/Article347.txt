 Darts Win in the Latest Round But Still Lag Well Behind Pros   By By Georgette Jasen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 2002  The latest results don't do much to improve the dart throwers' overall standings when results of 143 contests since 1990 are tallied. The score is now 87 to 56 in favor of the pros compared with the darts. It is 77 to 66 when the pros are compared with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, the pros' average six-month investment gain is 10.2% during the same period, compared with just 3.5% for the darts and 5.5% for the Dow industrials.
