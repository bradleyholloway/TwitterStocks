Mayor Koch and John D. Simpson, president of the New York City Transit Authority, presented yesterday the first of what they said would be a series of monthly public reports on the status of the city's bus and subway system.  There were no suprises in the dozen multicolored charts used by Mr. Simpson, but in the end both men agreed that while the system had a long way to go, actions taken over the past year had at least halted the system's long slide into disarray.  ''However bad it is,'' said Mr. Simpson, ''it is stable and better then it was last year.'' Yesterday's report and press conference came a little more than a week after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority released the first of its own comprehensive monthly reports, which are required by law. However, the Mayor has been publicly requesting that transit officials issue a report from the Blue Room at City Hall, and yesterday he got his way. The two reports mirrored each other.
