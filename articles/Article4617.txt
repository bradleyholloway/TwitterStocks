 American Culture Is Often a Puzzle For Foreign Managers in the U.S.   By By Amanda Bennett, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1986  A group of Arab oil workers sent to Texas for training found American teaching methods impersonal. Several Japanese workers at a U.S. manufacturing plant had to learn how to put courtesy aside and interrupt conversations when there was trouble. Executives of a Swiss-based multinational couldn't understand why its American managers demanded more autonomy than their European counterparts.  To all these people, America is a foreign country with a strange corporate culture. Just as Americans doing business abroad must grapple with unfamiliar social and commercial practices, so too must the European, Asian and Latin American managers of U.S. subsidiaries, a growing number of whom are coming to work here. The U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization says that last fiscal year 65,349 intercompany transferees, up from 21,495 in 1978, were brought here to work in an administrative or managerial capacity or to use some specialized knowledge.  In part, the transferees are following their employers' money. Direct foreign investment in the U.S. has increased from $30.6 billion in 1978 to $174 billion by the end of the third quarter of 1985, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. American companies too are bringing in more foreign managers for training that will enable them to replace high-cost American personnel in such places as Hong Kong, West Germany and Brazil.
