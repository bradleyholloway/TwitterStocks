 Searching for Clues in Copter Crash   By Gardiner, Sean; Pervaiz Shallwani, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2011  A preliminary examination of the helicopter involved in a fatal East River crash has revealed no immediate explanation for the incident, such as a fire, engine rupture or a bird strike, federal investigators said Wednesday. Authorities said they will probe further into the Bell 206B JetRanger and its maintenance history, as well as look into the possibility of human error or adverse weather conditions, such as wind gusts.
