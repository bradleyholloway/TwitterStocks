 SHOP TALK   By By William Mathewson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1988  It happened on Aug. 31, when Mr. Wall merged 14 weak Oklahoma thrift institutions into six. Sen. Boren heard about the mergers from reporters shortly before the Bank Board announced them. The senator says Mr. Wall broke a promise to brief the Oklahoma congressional delegation before making any major move.  Then Sen. Boren put in an 11th-hour phone call to Mr. Wall to ask about two weak Oklahoma thrifts that had long sought to acquire insolvent savings and loan associations. Greg Kubiak, the Democratic senator's chief legislative aide, says that Sen. Boren put down the phone and told him to tell the two thrifts they could still bid to merge with the consolidated thrifts.  Certainly Mr. Biehl looks particularly rugged in two pictures of him that appeared in the September issue of Money magazine. Money had interviewed Mr. Biehl, a co-founder of the San Mateo, Calif., investment-counseling firm of Bailard Biehl & Kaiser, and illustrated the article with two photographs taken of the interviewee on a California beach. In one of the pictures, Mr. Biehl has a jean jacket slung over his shoulder; the other shows him sitting on the sand with a dog at his side.
