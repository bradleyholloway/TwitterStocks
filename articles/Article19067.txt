 Entergy to Sell Units as Part of Overhaul   By By Kathryn Kranhold, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1998  New Orleans-based Entergy hopes the sales will raise about $4 billion, most of which will be used to pay down debt, according to Robert Luft, chairman and acting chief executive officer. The company is also looking to invest in the development of power plants internationally and to buy nuclear power plants.  The announcements come just over two months after Mr. Luft took over as acting chief executive in May, succeeding Edwin Lupberger. He immediately started a strategic review of operations.  Entergy is giving up its former plans to become a consumer service company that distributes electricity and home security. Instead, as the country moves toward a deregulated power industry, Mr. Luft said Entergy would pursue the wholesale side of business. That includes trading electricity, building power plants internationally, and buying and operating nuclear power plants.
