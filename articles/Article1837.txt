 Dart Proposes to Take Over Stop & Shop For $30 a Share, or About $840 Million   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1988  Dart Group Corp. proposed a friendly takeover of Stop & Shop Cos. for $30 a share, or about $840 million.  The Landover, Md.-based retailer, controlled by the Haft family, said in a letter to Avram J. Goldberg, Stop & Shop's chairman and chief executive officer, that its proposal "provides an attractive opportunity for stockholders" of the Boston-based supermarket and department store chain.  The Hafts, who already have a stake of about 3% in Stop & Shop, said their offer represents an 80% premium over a $16.625 price the shares traded at in early December and about a 49% premium over a $20.125 trading price Jan. 11.
