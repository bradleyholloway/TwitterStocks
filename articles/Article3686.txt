 Why Car Batteries Are Dying Young; Plethora of Gadgets, Chargers, Onboard Systems Sap Power; Beware the Killer Cup Warmer   By Welsh, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2007  For consumers, the proliferation of onboard electronics means increased comfort, convenience, efficiency and safety in the form of computerized engine controls, tire-pressure sensors, and powerful navigation and entertainment systems. The downside: All these power- sapping accessories -- coupled with vehicles' increasingly complex networks of electronic-ignition systems, pollution-control devices, security systems and display screens -- could be helping to drive up the death rate for car batteries.  The 12-volt car battery traces its origin to French physicist Gaston Plante, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859. Over time, car batteries have generally become more powerful and longer-lasting. Still, ever-increasing demands from motorists have kept their typical life span between three and five years. They can last twice that long if they are cared for properly and not often exposed to extreme temperatures.  For years batteries have been marketed as "maintenance free," and consumers have taken them for granted. But the extra strain they are under in modern cars has many owners giving them renewed attention. Experts say it's a good idea to disconnect the battery when a vehicle is parked for weeks at a time, but it will still slowly discharge even when stored. Small charging devices called trickle chargers, which cost $30 to $60, can extend battery life by keeping it fully charged when the car is parked.
