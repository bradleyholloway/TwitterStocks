 Business and Finance [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1990  THE U.S. ECONOMY appears headed for significantly higher unemployment and little or no growth in the next year, according to a survey of economists conducted by The Wall Street Journal since the Mideast crisis began. The consensus represents a swift change of mood from a similar survey less than two months ago, when most economists predicted a continuing expansion. The economists still disagree, however, about whether a recession lies ahead.  Iraq has slashed its oil production to as little as 600,000 barrels a day, in response to the tightening world embargo. The current level, about one-sixth the country's pre-embargo output, is enough to meet the nation's internal needs plus a trickle of exports bypassing the near blockade, mainly via trucks through Jordan.  Stock prices rebounded sharply in thin trading as bargain hunters picked through the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.20 points to 2746.78. Bond prices fell amid continued worries that inflation is accelerating. The dollar weakened against most major currencies.
