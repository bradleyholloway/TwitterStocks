 OPEC Is Pumping More Crude Than It Said It Would --- It's Hard to Get Compliance With Plans to Scale Back When Prices Are So High   By By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  Data released by the International Energy Agency in Paris showed the 10 OPEC members that were committed to sharply reducing their oil output scaled back only slightly in March, or by some 120,000 barrels a day, to 25.85 million barrels a day. The total was 650,000 barrels a day higher than the target of 25.2 million barrels a day that OPEC set in January. That was when the group's oil ministers decided at a meeting in Vienna to cut production 1.5 million barrels a day, effective Feb. 1.  Still, the IEA's data provide some hope of relief. Growth in oil demand continues to weaken along with the world economy. Meanwhile, world output of crude oil rose 890,000 barrels a day to 78.21 million barrels a day. More than half of that increase, or about 530,000 barrels, came from Iraq, OPEC's 11th member, which doesn't take part in the group's quota system because its exports are regulated by the United Nations. That pushed OPEC's output, including Iraq, up 410,000 barrels a day to 28.51 million barrels a day.
