 BankAmerica Asks Suitor To Withdraw --- First Interstate Requested To Pull Back Proposal As Firm Studies Outlook   By By Richard B. Schmitt and G. Christian Hill, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1986  In asking Los Angeles-based First Interstate to pull back, John R. Beckett, chairman of the BankAmerica board's executive committee, said the board "is aware of nothing that would justify a decision to merge the bank at this time." Mr. Beckett, who was instrumental in the recent return of A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's former top official, as chief executive officer, added, "The board is encouraged by the aggressive approach being taken by the new management team to address the bank's problems and put it on the road to recovery."  The board's action effectively accomplishes two purposes. First, it relieves its investment adviser, Salomon Brothers Inc., from the dilemma of producing an opinion on a First Interstate bid that some merger specialists considered fair but which BankAmerica's board didn't want.  The decision also puts First Interstate on the defensive. If the Los Angeles concern doesn't withdraw its bid, it risks being viewed as a hostile bidder in the eyes of BankAmerica's shareholders, employees and customers, an image that could hurt its ability to ever acquire the bank. First Interstate still could formally launch a hostile bid, although such offers are extraordinary in the banking industry. Sources said the company now is more likely to retreat, perhaps only temporarily, in the hope that BankAmerica's operations and shareholder support will erode, setting the stage for a revived bid.
