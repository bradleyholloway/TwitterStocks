 Brokers Get Focus in Market Timing   By Jaime Levy Pessin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2006  Susan Merrill, chief of enforcement for NYSE Regulation, the regulatory arm of NYSE Group Inc.'s New York Stock Exchange, said "market-timing" cases against mutual funds have largely been wrapped up, but many individuals could be in the cross hairs.  "Now, we're beginning to focus on the individual brokers who were facilitating market timing of customers, and we're looking at supervisors of those brokers," Ms. Merrill said at a seminar sponsored by the Practising Law Institute in New York.  Market timing involves rapid trading in mutual funds, typically by investors like hedge funds that are given privileged access. The practice isn't necessarily illegal, but it can violate individual funds' policies and hurt returns for buy-and-hold fund investors.
