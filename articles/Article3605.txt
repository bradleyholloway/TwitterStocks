 E-Commerce (A Special Report): Openers --- Easy Now   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2002  Fixing this problem is a crusade for Jakob Nielsen, a self-described "user advocate" and principal of Nielsen Norman Group, a Fremont, Calif., consulting firm. Mr. Nielsen writes and speaks extensively on ways to make home pages, corporate intranets and Web sites in general easier for people to use.  Mr. Nielsen: Improved, yes, but only because it couldn't get any worse. In 2000, the average e-commerce site followed 45% of usability guidelines [created by Mr. Nielsen] and in 2002 the score had improved to 49%. Still far to go.  Mr. Nielsen: The classic remains Amazon.com. Always the best, still the best. Amazon has the highest score I have ever recorded in terms of following the usability guidelines on a big Web site. For example, you can tell Amazon the names of your favorite authors and they will send you e-mail when there is a new book out by one of these authors. And the key trick is that Amazon makes these messages seem like customer service that users will be happy to get in their inbox, not spam like most marketing messages.
