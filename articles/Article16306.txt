 Fidelity Spins Off Geode Investors; Move Could Allay Concerns About Conflicts of Interest; Perold Will Run Company   By Hechinger, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2003  Yesterday, a Fidelity spokeswoman said the closely held Boston firm would no longer have an ownership interest in Geode, although some unnamed Fidelity employees would retain an unspecified minority holding. Geode, however, would continue to manage the corporate money Fidelity has already invested. The company said it would continue to use Geode as a way to test "alternative investment products." In a regulatory filing, Fidelity said Geode had $293 million under management, as of March 31.  Jacques Perold, a 16-year Fidelity veteran who is president of Geode, will leave Fidelity to run the firm, along with a handful of other Fidelity employees. Mr. Perold, 45 years old, also oversees Fidelity's $28 billion in index funds, or investment pools that seek to match market indexes rather than pick stocks. Those funds include Fidelity Spartan 500 Index, Spartan Extended Market Index and Total Market Index.
