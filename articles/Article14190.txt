 RCA Names Goldman Chief Of Record Unit   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1985  RCA Corp. named Elliot Goldman, who formerly oversaw Warner Communications Inc.'s record operations, as chairman and chief executive officer of its 75%-owned RCA/Ariola International record unit.  A change at the top of RCA's record unit had been expected. Mr. Goldman, 50 years old, succeeds Robert Summer, who is being named president of RCA's Red Seal Label, a classical and theatrical-music operation, and will be responsible for industry and goverment relations.  Though RCA is the third-ranked record company, it hasn't been nearly as profitable or successful as industry leader CBS Inc. and second-ranked Warner. RCA doesn't break out results, but the record unit's sales were about $400 million last year.
