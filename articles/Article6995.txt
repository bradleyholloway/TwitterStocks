 'Family Friendly' Plan Sets Cable Rift; FCC Heat Spawns Talk Of New Tier of Channels; Weighing a Financial Hit   By Joe Flint, Peter Grant and Amy Schatz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2005  Mr. [Kevin Martin] put pressure on cable operators by making it clear that the family-tier issue could influence the FCC's consideration of Time Warner and Comcast's agreement to buy the assets of Adelphia Communications Corp., which is currently operating under bankruptcy protection. Last week the FCC asked Time Warner and Comcast for extensive follow-up information which some observers interpreted as a sign that the commission was considering a number of conditions to approving the deal. An FCC official with knowledge of the staff's review, however, said the information request was routine and it's too early to speculate on what conditions, if any, the commission might require.  Some of the largest cable companies were ready to adopt voluntary decency standards, people familiar with the matter say, but because of opposition from several large entertainment companies, including Viacom Inc. and News Corp.'s Fox, a consensus couldn't be reached. The final attempt to reach an accord came late last month during a conference call involving many of the country's leading programmers that was organized by Kyle McSlarrow, chief executive of industry lobbying group the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. Mr. McSlarrow has been told to come back today to Capitol Hill to provide Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) and other senators on a progress report of the industry's attempts to find a solution to indecency concerns.
