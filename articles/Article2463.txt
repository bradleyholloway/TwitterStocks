 Compaq Says Cheapest PC's Profit Rises   By By Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1998  Accelerating sales and a sharp drop in costs pushed the margin on Compaq's $899 computer, which is also its biggest seller, above its more expensive consumer PCs, said Rod Schrock, vice president of Compaq's consumer division. "The big misconception is we make a lower gross margin in the sub-$1,000 market," Mr. Schrock said. "For the consumer business, those are the most profitable desktops."  Although Compaq's consumer unit represents less than 20% of revenue, it is expected to be one of the few bright spots in the company's second-quarter financial statement, which will be released tomorrow. Compaq will report a loss of more than $5 billion after special charges related to its $9 billion acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp., which closed in mid-June.
