 A Salary That Fits the Owner May Be Too Big for the IRS   By By Sanford L. Jacobs, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1985  WHEN YOU OWN your own business, you don't have to disclose your salary to a bunch of stockholders. Only public companies are obliged to issue proxy statements listing executive pay. It's no secret that Mesa Petroleum Co. last year paid its chairman, T. Boone Pickens Jr., total compensation of $22.8 million.  The IRS considers the unreasonable amount a dividend, which is nondeductible. Nondeductible expenditures cost a business more than deductible ones, of course. For a corporation in the 40% tax bracket, a $100,000 outlay that isn't deductible means paying $40,000 of income tax that wouldn't be payable if the expenditure were deductible. That's why small-business owners prefer taking salary and other forms of deductible compensation out of their companies rather than dividends.  WHAT'S REASONABLE? According to the law it is "the amount that would ordinarily be paid for like services by like enterprises under like circumstances." When the IRS questions an owner's compensation, Mr. Lang says, the best argument "is to be able to say, 'here are two similar companies with similar salary ranges.'"
