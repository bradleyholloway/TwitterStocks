ALBANY, Feb. 3â€” Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today denounced as ''poorly reasoned'' and ''narrow'' a report by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan that said a proposed increase in New York's basic welfare grant would be harmful to economic development and discourage recipients from seeking employment.  Mr. Cuomo accused Mr. Regan of basing his report on ''hearsay'' testimony of carefully selected officials and on the ''nonempirical assumption that poor people migrate to New York because of its benefit levels.''  ''Politically, this is a good time to be beating up on the welfare people,'' Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Regan, a Republican who has expressed an interest in the governorship, asserted in a report released by his office yesterday that New York's welfare benefits ''discouraged recipients from seeking work in the South'' and artificially ''distorted the job market.''  Others Also Criticize Regan  His comments provoked many of the political, religious and socialwelfare leaders around the state who have spearheaded the fight for welfare grant increases.  The State Coalition for Fair Public Assistance, which was formed last year to press for welfare grant increases, condemned the report, saying it contained several flaws. The coalition accused Mr. Regan of intruding into the area of welfare.  ''Regan himself admits that this is a matter for political decision in the legislative and executive branches,'' said Thomas McKenna, chairman of the Coalition and executive director of the State Communities Aid Association. ''One can only speculate that his ambition to be Governor is behind this headline-grabbing ploy.''  The Comptroller's report intensified the debate over benefit increases at a time when proposed increases appeared to be gaining support in the State Legislature. The Democratic-controlled Assembly, led by Speaker Stanley Fink, approved a bill last year to increase the welfare allowance by 10 percent, but it was killed in the Republican-led Senate.  Now, the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, has proposed increasing the monthly public-assistance cash grant to welfare recipients by 15 percent. The proposal is expected to be taken up in the Senate next week.
