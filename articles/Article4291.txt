 New York Limits Assets Insurers Put in Junk Bonds   By By Johnnie L. Roberts, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1987  New York state issued rules to limit insurance company investments in the high-yield, low-grade securities known as junk bonds.  Under the regulation, insurers can't invest more than 20% of their assets in such securities without the state insurance superintendent's approval. And directors of life insurers incorporated in New York that have junk bond investments are required to adopt written standards for those investments.  The asset-limitation rule, effective June 24, applies to 146 insurers that are incorporated in New York or licensed to sell policies there. Only two companies currently exceed the limit, but the new rule won't require them to reduce their junk bond holdings.
