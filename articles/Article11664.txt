 GM to Reduce Cadillac Output; Slow Sales Cited --- Factory That Builds Seville And Eldorado Models To Be Closed for Week   By By Andrea Puchalsky, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1992  GM said it will close for one week beginning Monday the Detroit-Hamtramck, Mich., Cadillac factory that builds the Seville, Eldorado and Buick Riviera models. A Cadillac spokeswoman said the closing was related to slow demand.  Cadillac recently launched with considerable fanfare the 1993 Seville STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe, which are equipped with a new, high-tech Northstar engine and transmission. Cadillac officials said the cars would put the division back into competition with imported luxury market leaders such as the Lexus LS 400. Dealers say demand for the top-of-the-line Cadillacs is strong, but sales aren't as robust for lower-line versions without the 290-horsepower engine. In October, Cadillac built 5,185 Sevilles, but sold 3,775.
