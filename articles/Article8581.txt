 Army's First TV Ad Campaign In Five Years Seeks More Recruits   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1995  The Army says the major reason for the drop-off in acceptable recruits has been its limited advertising spending over the past few years. But now, armed with a heftier ad budget, the Army is launching its first new campaign in five years with television commercials produced by Young & Rubicam's New York office.  Gone is the focus of being sent to faraway lands and seeing the world. And the message that Army recruits will receive training that will make them more employable once out of uniform is refined in the new spots: Serving in the Army with its up-to-date equipment and technological education is like working in the real world.  While money for college and skilled training is still high on the list of what recruits want, Army officials say, the ads needed to address more clearly the payoff and relevance to civilian life. "We found kids [18- to 24-year-olds] are already using information age aspects of the workplace in their schooling," says Col. Myers, referring to computers and CD-ROMs. "The Army is developing its own version of an information age fighting force that will be fully automated by the year 2010. So we saw an opportunity to link the expectation of today's youth to today's Army."
