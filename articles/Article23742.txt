Thomas Melville House, 317 pages, $16.95 Hedge Fund Wives By Tatiana Boncompagni Avon, 284 pages, $13.99 Maxxed Out By David Colllins William Morrow, 310 pages, $24.99 In Michael M. Thomas's novel "Love & Money," a washed-up movie director named Clifford Grange notices that his wife is increasingly absent from home. Readers, thanks to the author, are well ahead of the curve -- we know what Connie is up to by the book's second line, as she drives to an assignation: Her skin burns with an erotic anticipation so intense and possessive that it scares her: her hands are trembling, her heart feels like it's beating at twice its normal rate.
