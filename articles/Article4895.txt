 Bicoastal Unit's Ex-Aides Charged With Conspiracy   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1992  The largest supplier of military flight simulators in the 1980s and two of its former presidents were indicted for allegedly defrauding the government by routinely inflating cost estimates on sole-source contracts.  A federal grand jury in Binghamton, N.Y., accused Charles Monachello and George Barna, who both served as president of Bicoastal Corp.'s former Link Flight Simulation unit, of conspiracy and fraud. The grand jury, as expected, also charged Bicoastal, the successor to Singer Co., and three other officials of the former unit with participating in the alleged overcharge scheme from 1983 to 1988 involving simulators for F-16 jets and Blackhawk helicopters. The contracts were valued at more than $273 million.
