President of Bernstein  Lewis A. Sanders, 35, has been named president of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a New York investment research and money management firm. He succeeds Mr. Bernstein, 55, who founded the concern bearing his name in 1967 and who remains chairman and chief executive officer.  Mr. Sanders - who will also continue for a while as research director of the firm, which has almost $400 million under management - was sanguine about the current stock market decline, in which the Dow Jones industrial average has plummeted to 851.12, its lowest level in more than 15 months. ''We see in adversity typically a fair amount of opportunity,'' he said yesterday. ''While there is a difficult transition period with respect to the various policies that the Administration is pursuing at the moment, an important opportunity is being created.''  Mr. Sanders, a chartered financial analyst whom Mr. Bernstein called ''the driving force behind our product development,'' was associated with Oppenheimer & Company for two years before joining Bernstein a year after it was established. He became research director in 1972 and added the title of executive vice president seven years later, when he was given the additional responsibility of overseeing money management activities.  Mr. Bernstein, whose experience includes service with the Marshall Plan in France after World War II and as a financial assistant at Food Fair Inc., went to Oppenheimer as a registered representative in 1959. Six years later, he joined Ralph E. Samuel & Company, another New York Stock Exchange member firm, and became a part ner. He startedhis own business to provide research and mone y management to institutions and wealthy investors.
