 Private Properties   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2001  ALFONSO "ALFY" FANJUL JR., head of his family's powerful Florida sugar dynasty, is buying a 9,000- square-foot mansion in Palm Beach, local real-estate agents say. The asking price was $14 million; Mr. Fanjul has signed a contract, though the deal has yet to close. The home, currently owned by an heiress who's building an even larger mansion just a few doors away, was built in 1983 and has six bedrooms, a swimming pool and a deepwater dock. It lies on a little more than an acre. Mr. Fanjul, who fled to the U.S. in 1959 during the Cuban revolution, is chairman and chief executive of Florida Crystals, which recently bought Domino Sugar in a deal valued at about $185 million. News of the politically well-connected family's long legal battles with migrant cane workers resurfaced this year, gaining attention through a Vanity Fair magazine profile.
