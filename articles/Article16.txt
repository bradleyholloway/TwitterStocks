In the view of Charles Hamilton, the New York dealer in autographs, one of the 10 rarest autographs in the world is the signed resignation of Richard M. Nixon, a document in the National Archives on which Mr. Hamilton places a value of $100,000.  Now Mr. Hamilton says he will have the next best thing up for auction Jan. 22 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.  ''It's a souvenir typescript of the one-line resignation, bearing a huge, scrawling signature of Nixon,'' he said. The dealer said that ''fairly recently, and since Nixon left California for New York, someone - my anonymous consignor of the document - induced him to sign a typed replica of the original resignation.''  Dated Aug. 9, 1974, and addressed to then Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, the letter says simply: ''I hereby resign the office of President of the United States. Richard Nixon.''  Mr. Hamilton said he expected the letter to fetch ''only $1,500.''
