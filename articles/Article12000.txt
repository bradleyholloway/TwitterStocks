 NATO Resumes Bombing in Bosnia In Wider Campaign   By Mark M. Nelson and Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1995  In Washington, former Pentagon planner Zalmay Khalilzad predicted that the Bosnian Serbs would make the minimum move necessary to stop the raids. To counter that, and to further punish the recalcitrant Bosnian Serb commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, he advocates that NATO demand that the Bosnian Serbs not withdraw their heavy weapons, but instead abandon them in place. Then, he said, NATO could destroy the weapons.  NATO has other reasons to weaken the Bosnian Serbs. It is preparing an influx of U.S. and other NATO troops to enforce the peace agreement and wants to ensure the Bosnian Serbs can't threaten them. NATO ambassadors discussed those plans at a weekend meeting in Brussels.
