 PepsiCo Switches Its Ad Account For Diet Pepsi to DDB Worldwide   By Brian Steinberg and Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  Pepsi's relationship with BBDO has frayed for months, according to people familiar with the situation. In June, Pepsi said it was "shocked" when BBDO ousted creative chief Ted Sann, the force behind many of Pepsi's best-known recent ads. The task of soothing tensions could fall to Andrew Robertson, who became BBDO Worldwide's chief executive in June.  The beverage giants have often neglected their diet brands when it comes to advertising. Diet Pepsi has been using the slogan "It's the diet cola," borrowing from the year-old Pepsi-Cola campaign "It's the cola," which has received lukewarm reviews. That campaign marks a departure from the company's previous celebrity-driven ads and seeks to remind consumers that nothing goes better with food than a Pepsi. Diet Pepsi is expected to get a new tagline with the new campaign.
