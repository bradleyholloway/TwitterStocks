 A Campus Impresario Presents the Pope   By By Linda Williams, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1987  Billy Graham, the evangelist, signed his name under his likeness. So did the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, archbishop of Canterbury, and Archbishop Iakovos, head of the Greek Orthodox Church in North and South America. Now Mr. Holderman, the president of the University of South Carolina system, hopes to get the one missing autograph: Pope John Paul II.  The pope will be the big man on campus today when he is scheduled to stop by the Holderman house for an ecumenical meeting with national Christian leaders. The pope's visit will mark an unusual stop along his U.S. tour, in a state that is only about 2% Roman Catholic. The pope's presence here is the latest testament to Mr. Holderman's considerable promotional ability.  The papal visit also underscores the Holderman ability to pull high-level strings and stage high-profile events. (In 1984, the university hosted a conference of Caribbean heads of state and President Reagan.) Aided by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, Chicago's archbishop and a university alumnus, Mr. Holderman has worked for the visit since 1979. By holding a university-sponsored yearlong ecumenical observance, Mr. Holderman had a vehicle that justified a stop on the pope's schedule. The pontiff will meet at Mr. Holderman's campus residence with the religious leaders, including Southern evangelical Protestants. The agenda also includes an ecumenical service for 72,000 at the university stadium.
