 Cloning the Pioneer Spirit; Space-Agency Woes Show Japan's Struggle for Pathfinder Status   By Martin Fackler and Ichiko Fuyuno, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2004  The result has been much hand-wringing in Japan about what has gone wrong with the country's push into space. The fault isn't technology; Japan's is widely recognized as world class. Rather, a growing number of critics and officials within Japan's space agency say the problem is one of attitude: Adept for so long at playing catch-up with the world, Japan is struggling to learn how to be a pioneer.  "Japan is used to following the examples" of the U.S. and Europe, says Shinichi Nakasuka, an associate professor of astronautical engineering at the University of Tokyo. "Doing a new thing means the railway tracks aren't laid out for you. You have to make your own tracks. Japan doesn't have experience doing this yet."  Japan's bid to join the ranks of space-faring nations rests on the H-IIA, a towering 176-foot orange rocket with the word "Nippon" -- "Japan" in Japanese -- emblazoned down the side. Its powerful liquid- fuel engines are regarded as among the most technically advanced in the world, rivaling those of America's newest rocket, the Delta IV built by Boeing Co. "We wanted to build something that would top other countries," says Norio Sakazume, an engineer who led development of the H-IIA's main engine.
