 Estate Tax Proves Contentious in Frederick's Tale --- Dispute in Lingerie Case Hinged on Valuing Assets   By By Jess Bravin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2001  Consider the travails of Frederick Mellinger's descendants. Mr. Mellinger leveraged the assets of millions of American women and countless male fantasies into Frederick's of Hollywood, a lingerie empire that stretched over 160 stores and a catalog business at the time of his death in 1990 at age 76. After Mr. Mellinger's widow, Harriett, died in 1993, the Mellinger estate fell subject to the estate tax, laying the ground for a legal battle with the IRS that wasn't resolved until 1999.  In her January 1999 ruling, Judge [Mary Ann Cohen] recounted the course of Mr. Mellinger's business success. "The company's original market was American GIs who, after spending time abroad, were eager to get for their wives or girlfriends the lingerie that was fashionable in Europe," she wrote. Mr. Mellinger, who moved his business to Los Angeles in 1947, "pioneered many trends in the industry," according to the judge. The company survived the fashion wars, including the arrival of Victoria's Secret, and in 1993 saw earnings of $4.7 million from sales of $128.5 million.  Mr. Mellinger, in a practice common among the wealthy, had placed his half into a trust for Mrs. Mellinger's benefit, to spare her any estate tax upon his death. After her death, however, "we knew there was going to be a big estate tax" hitting the Mellingers' two children, says Mr. [Hugh V. Hunter], the accountant. "We had to do something about it."
