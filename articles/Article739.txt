 A Gathering Glut: Auto Industry Faces Era of Plant Closings Due to Overcapacity --- Japanese, Koreans, Big Three All Build New Factories; Why Some Texans Worry --- Hostility on Jefferson Avenue   By By Paul Ingrassia and Doron P. Levin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1986  But just last month GM told workers that the plant had been dropped as a candidate to build the company's next-generation midsize car. And because the rear-wheel-drive Chevrolet Monte Carlos and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes now built at Arlington are outmoded and nearing the end of their road, the plant's future is uncertain. "I am very, very much concerned," says John Childers, the president of the United Auto Workers local chapter. "Everyone here is."  Six to 10 of the 50 car-assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada could shut down for good between next year and the early 1990s, auto analysts say, compared with six that closed when the industry collapsed in 1980-83. And every assembly plant that closes during the next five years will take with it factories that make components ranging from seats to bumpers to pistons -- a disappearing act that would cost thousands of people their jobs.  Ironically, this new Asian invasion of the North American car market is partly sponsored by Detroit. Each of the Big Three is tied to a new Japanese plant as a partner or a customer. Detroit, meanwhile, is adding to the looming overcapacity by building new assembly plants of its own, with each manufacturer hoping that modernization can help it keep or expand its share of the market. General Motors will be turning out 500,000 Saturn cars a year from a new Tennessee plant by 1990. Ford Motor Co. is building a plant in Mexico to ship cars to the U.S.
