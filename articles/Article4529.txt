 Bid on American Medical Raised In New Offer   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 1989  BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- American Medical International Inc., which is weighing a $1.66 billion offer to take the company private, said it received a letter from another party "expressing an indication of interest" in an acquisition. Brian M. Freeman Enterprises Inc., Roseland, N.J., has proposed a plan in which the big hospital company would be acquired by a newly created employee stock ownership plan for $27 a share, including $23 in cash and the balance in securities, American Medical said.  Neither American Medical nor Freeman Enterprises would place a value on the transaction.  Earlier this week, an investor group led by Clayton & Dubilier Inc., a New York investment firm, said it completed arrangements to finance a $24-a-share offer, which includes $21 in cash and the rest in securities. The group includes M. Lee Pearce, a large American Medical shareholder, and Shamrock Investments, a Los Angeles investment concern. The group's offer expires on Thursday at 5 p.m. EDT.
