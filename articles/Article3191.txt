 Fidelity Called For An End To The Nyse'S Specialist Floor-Trading ...   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2003  FIDELITY CALLED for an end to the NYSE's specialist floor-trading system for auctioning stocks. The company instead is advocating a Nasdaq-style electronic system in which computers pair buy and sell orders without human go-betweens. Fidelity has complained that specialists trade for their own accounts at the expense of investors.  SEC officials are looking at Nasdaq's separation of market and regulatory operations as a model for stock-market regulation.  Commodities: Oil futures $31.95 a barrel, $0.02; Dow Jones-AIG futures 128.417, 1.236; DJ-AIG spot 163.308, 1.824.
