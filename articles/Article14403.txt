 Researchers Step Up Efforts To Develop Synthetic Blood   By By Frank E. James, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1987  Growing fears of such complications among both doctors and patients have rekindled researchers' desire to make a safe synthetic blood. A blood substitute would have other benefits: It could prevent shortages of blood in medical emergencies, simplify transfusions by eliminating the need to match the blood type of the recipient, and be made available to patients in ambulances and other places where storing fresh blood is impractical.  Dozens of companies and universities are seeking a blood substitute, and one -- Northfield Laboratories Inc., a small private research concern near Chicago -- is about to begin the first human clinical trials of a synthetic blood in several years. Other companies could get clearance soon from the Food and Drug Administration to start human clinical trials, an agency official suggests.  WHILE THE SEARCH for a synthetic blood is fraught with perils -- for instance, allergic or immune reactions can be dangerous -- competitors say Northfield's progress with its product, "polyhemoglobin," is significant. "It's an accomplishment, and something that will set the framework for others, including us," says Dale Smith, group vice president in charge of blood products for Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc., the big Deerfield, Ill.-based health-care products and services concern.
