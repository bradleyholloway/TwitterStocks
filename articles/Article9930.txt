 Blueprint / Wilmington, Del.   By Maura Webber Sadovi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2006  Delaware and Wilmington were dealt a blow when Bank of America Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., acquired MBNA Corp., based in Wilmington, in January and said it was selling four buildings in Delaware and terminating leases on three other properties. In Wilmington, the bank is selling a vacant former courthouse and a 74,000-square-foot office building.  Boosters of the Wilmington market add that the construction provides sorely needed large blocks of space for expanding and relocating companies such as automobile club AAA Mid-Atlantic, which recently moved its headquarters to the revitalized Wilmington riverfront from Philadelphia. Just three years ago, Wilmington had no large blocks of space to offer companies, says Judy McKinney-Cherry, director of Delaware's Economic Development Office.  The area's job growth has pushed developers like Buccini/Pollin Group, a private real-estate developer with headquarters in Wilmington and Washington, D.C., to build. Robert E. Buccini, managing partner of Buccini/Pollin, says the company has leased much of the space in a 371,000-square-foot office building under construction in downtown Wilmington to such tenants as WSFS Financial Corp. Says Mr. Buccini: "Financial services and the business of law have exploded in Wilmington."
