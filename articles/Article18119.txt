 Sears Struggles to Save Catalog Business   By Schwadel, Francine, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1990  So far, that hasn't been enough. The Sears catalog, with annual sales of about $4 billion, hasn't made money since 1985. If it doesn't turn a profit soon, Sears, Roebuck & Co. may be forced to close the catalog that once set America's standard of living.  For now, Sears is doing all it can to stay in the catalog business. But last month, Sears Chairman Edward Brennan took control of the company's faltering merchandise group and vowed to improve profits. He is expected to slash expenses and eliminate unproductive businesses. Catalog unit managers "know they're on a short fuse," says one person close to the company. Sears "has to exit businesses that don't perform," says another.  Sears would clearly prefer to keep the catalog, but the fact that its fate is in question at all underscores the depth of soul-searching now going on at Sears. Two years ago, the giant retailing and financial services company seriously considered closing the catalog but decided to give it one last chance.
