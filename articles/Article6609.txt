 Florida's Insurance Panel Is Sued Over Fraud   By By Christopher Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2002  The complaint, filed in state court in Palm Beach County, Fla., contends that even though the insurance department determined "the plaintiffs were being targeted and harmed by deceitful insurance practices" of American Benefits Services Inc. in 1998 and 1999, the department "took no action to halt ABS's dishonest conduct." Lawyers for the three named plaintiffs are asking for class-action status. The suit seeks $117 million in compensatory damages.  The lawsuit also maintains that, even as American Benefits was swindling investors, it was currying the favor of the insurance department. Long after the department had discovered the wrongdoing, according to the lawsuit, "ABS employed lawyers and professional lobbyists who were closely tied to high-ranking DOI officials, and who arranged frequent private meetings with them to advance the company's interests."
