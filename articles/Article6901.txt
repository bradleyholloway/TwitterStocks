 Companies Sweeten Sales of Adult Cereal With Sugar   By Adamy, Janet, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 2005  With the adult cereals, "the loyalty to the original brand transfers to the new product, and people assume they're just getting a different flavor," says Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group. "They don't realize the cereal has been watered down with more sugar."  Kellogg attempted to target the adult sweet tooth back in 1995 with Temptations, a brand it billed as an "indulgence cereal for the sophisticated palate." Hoping to appeal to consumers who were driving specialty-coffee and fancy-popcorn sales, Kellogg launched cereal flavors such as French vanilla almond and honey-roasted pecan. But Temptations wasn't very tempting to consumers, and Kellogg eventually canceled it.  In focus groups, adults who don't normally eat cereal have told Kellogg they like the health benefits of cereal but not the taste. "To them, it was maybe a little bland," says Mark Baynes, senior vice president, marketing, in Kellogg's morning-foods division.
