WHEELING, W.Va., July 10â€” Hollis Stacy, playing well on the Speidel golf course despite temperatures in the mid-90's, tied a tournament record with a six-under-par 66 today. She took a one-shot lead over Kathy Postlewait and Cathy Morse after the second round of the West Virginia Classic on the Ladies' Professional Golf Association tour.  Miss Stacy, the defending champion, knocked in putts of 40 and 35 feet for birdies on the front nine in tying the tournament record set in 1975 by Karolyn Kertzman.  Miss Postlewait and Miss Morse, who were tied at 138 going into Sunday's final round, both shot 68's today but could not catch Miss Stacy, who plays so well in Wheeling that she calls herself ''the honorary pro at Speidel.''  ''I feel so confident on this golf course,'' said Miss Stacy, a two-time United States Women's Open champion who currently stands seventh on the money-winning list. ''It's hilly, but you don't mind walking the hills when you're making birdies.'' 4 Birdies on Front Nine  Miss Stacy had four birdies on the front side of the par-72, 6,150-yard course, then added two birdies on the back side despite the hills, heat and humidity.  In a wholesale assault on a golf course that has often intimidated the touring pros because of its mountainous terrain, eight golfers turned in rounds in the 60's today, including a second-year pro, Mindy Moore, who had a 67. Twenty-five golfers shot 71 or better.  Miss Moore nearly tied the nine-hole L.P.G.A. record when she shot a 30 on the front nine and missed a 12-foot putt on the ninth hole that would have tied the tour record of 29. She stood at 147 after a first-round 80.  A stroke behind Miss Postlewait, who has yet to win on the tour in nine years, and Miss Morse was Alice Miller, who had a 69 after a first round 70. At 141, four strokes behind Miss Stacy, were Jan Ferraris and Kathy Young, who both had 71, 70-141 totals.  Tied at 142 were Cathy Reynolds, who also had a 67; Beverly Klass, who shot a 69, and Alexandra Reinhardt, who had a 70.
