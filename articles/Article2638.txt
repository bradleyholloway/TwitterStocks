 A Real Tailspin, in Weekly Episodes --- As a Young Woman Struggles With a Drinking Problem, MTV Show Draws Viewers   By By Sally Beatty, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1999  On Tuesday night, Ruthie Alcaide returned to "Real World," MTV's top-rated weekly series about what happens when you put seven young strangers under one roof for four months. Ms. Alcaide left the nonfiction show this summer to spend a month in an alcohol-treatment program after careening out of control on camera.  MTV has made Ms. Alcaide's personal drama an important part of "Real World" and its promotions. One recent spot shows Ms. Alcaide drinking in a bar and confronted by her roommates. Another shows a tearful Ms. Alcaide lashing out at cast members who urged her to check into rehab. A promo that ran last weekend showed Ms. Alcaide, who has identified herself on the show as bisexual, returning to her "Real World" home from rehab, with a new female lover.  MTV executives say they have been careful to treat Ms. Alcaide's problems honestly and responsibly. "If you saw what was happening to Ruthie, it would be very hard to think that alcoholism or excessive drinking is glorious," says Brian Graden, MTV's top programming executive. MTV producers say the show offers valuable lessons on the dark side of alcohol.
