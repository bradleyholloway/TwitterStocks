 Contract with France   By Kravis, Marie-Josee, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2006  dLast year's attacks on E.U. proposals to liberalize trade in services are symptomatic. Services are highly regulated by member countries that impose restrictions on almost everything from banking to store hours and prices. The proposal to allow services to be traded freely throughout the E.U. (as long as they met the standards of their country of origin) was anathema to President [Jacques Chirac] and then Chancellor Schroeder, and they killed it. The image of the Polish plumber stealing French jobs was prominent a few weeks later when the French rejected the European constitution. How could they support the transfer of power to a European Commission intent on challenging France's social model?  President Chirac seems to relish every opportunity to repudiate the so-called "Anglo-Saxon" caricature of crass, uncaring capitalism and competition. What is this Anglo-Saxon paradigm? Britain has a nationalized health-care system and strong labor unions. Meanwhile, non-Anglo-Saxon, social democratic Sweden has dramatically cut its public debt and Finland achieved low unemployment and a high rate of R&D spending while undertaking economic reforms.  Nevertheless, Mr. Chirac overlooks these successes and draws attention to the external threats to France's quality of life and l'exception francaise. Consequently, he and other French leaders are reaping the agitation they have sowed. Their citizens distrust the E.U., resent the U.S., are unsure of the euro and its effects on monetary and fiscal discipline, shun freer trade, and are fuming with anti-capitalist rage.
