 Dollar Remains in Established Ranges Amid Indecision Over Key Pairs' Paths   By By John Hardy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2002  Late yesterday in New York, the euro was at 87.53 cents, up from 87.41 cents earlier in London and above 87.40 cents Friday in New York. The dollar was at 128.36 yen, down from 128.95 yen earlier in London and from 128.53 yen Friday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6797 Swiss francs, down from 1.6864 francs Friday, while sterling was at $1.4205, down from $1.4212.  This view is by no means universal, with other strategists expecting the dollar to quickly push back toward 130 yen, preparing to resume its long rally against the yen as soon as repatriation flows cease to underpin the currency -- at the end of Japan's fiscal-year on March 31.
