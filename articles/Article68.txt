ALBANY, May 16â€” Governor Cuomo was interviewed for television today about his campaign to increase the state's drinking age. The interview was produced, directed and distributed by state employees.  It was conducted by a state public- relations officer who read questions solicited by the Governor's staff from 11 upstate television stations.  The 13 1/2-minute tape was then distributed across the state for any station that wanted to use it on news or publicaffairs shows, according to the Governor's spokesmen. The stations may broadcast the tape in its entirety or cut into segments, the spokesman said.  In Buffalo, for example, WKBW used two segments of the interview on its 6 P.M. news. ''We used a story because of its convenience,'' Tim Clark, the acting news assignment editor, said. ''We may not have used it if it involved flying to Albany.''  The 11 upstate stations submitted questions to be asked on the show, but New York City stations refused to participate because they preferred to have reporters of their own conduct interviews. Mr. Clark said he, too, would have insisted on a ''one to one'' interview if the subject had involved more controversy.  'A Great Deal of Interest'  The tape was made and distributed by the New York State Network, a television production operation that is part of the State University and distributes both educational programs and programs featuring state officials.  The show was confined to questions about the Governor's call for an increase in the legal drinking age from 19 to 21. ''A number of stations have expressed interest in having cuts of the Governor speaking about the issue,'' said Mark Gordon, a Cuomo aide who arranged the show. ''There certainly has been a great deal of interest. This seemed like a good way to give them the ability to have their questions answered.''  This morning the stations were called and asked what questions they would like to have answered, according to Mr. Gordon. ''We were able to answer the vast majority of them,'' he said. ''It was done so each of the stations had at least one of their questions answered.''
