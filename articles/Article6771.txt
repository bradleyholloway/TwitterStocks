 Deals & Deal Makers: MONY Investors Can Proceed With Proxy Effort to Halt Sale; Judge Says Shareholders Didn't Violate SEC Rules In Fight Against AXA Deal   By Plitch, Phyllis, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2004  MONY has countered that AXA's bid is "full and fair," and the best alternative for the company, which says it faces difficulties as a stand-alone concern. In a statement, MONY said it was "disappointed" with the judge's decision. AXA declined to comment.  In declining to issue the injunction, Judge [Richard Holwell] sought the opinion of SEC staffers. Agency staff, in 1993, determined that an investor could rely on the exemption because "providing a copy of management's proxy card -- which would be returned directly to management -- does not create any proxy authority in the soliciting party," and wasn't a "form of revocation," wrote Alan Beller, director of the division of corporation finance, and Giovanni Prezioso, general counsel, in a "friend of the court" letter sent in response to the judge's inquiry.
