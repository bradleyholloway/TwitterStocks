 Modern Don Quixotes Tilt at Turbines   By By Sarah Spikes, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  Cliff Freeman, a Wales farmer, likens his first wind-farm sighting to a spiritual experience. "When I first saw wind turbines in Wales, they were far off in the distance, and I knew that I had to get closer," he says. He drove toward them, left his car and scrambled up the wind farm's hill. Most of the turbines were obscured by mist, Mr. Freeman says, so he followed the whooshing sound of the blades.  According to Mr. [Jan Vium]'s logs, he has visited 400 wind farms in Denmark and has about 100 left in order to see every one in the country. He hasn't seen any wind farms in the United Kingdom, but when he and his wife took a trip to the Netherlands, she saw tulips while he visited turbines.  Mr. [Ken Maddocks] works turbine spotting into his vacations, and photos of the turbines go straight into the album with other family shots. In Denmark, he visited an 18th-century church and climbed a spiral ramp to see the view. "When I got to the top I was delighted to see that there were wind turbines easily in view from up there -- about 12 of them a mile outside the city," he says. "They were about 30 meters tall with 20-meter blades. Beautiful."
