 Biotechnology: `Assembly Line' Revs Up Genentech   By By Ralph T. King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1998  For years, Arthur Levinson, the chief executive officer of Genentech Inc., kept a framed comment by Merck & Co.'s research chief on his office wall: "Genentech can only develop one product at a time."  For Dr. Levinson, a 47-year-old molecular biologist who has spent his career at Genentech, the changes are an attempt to revive a sluggish drug pipeline and respond to an ominous threat: Swiss drug giant Roche Holding Ltd., the company's majority owner, has the right to take over Genentech under an option agreement, which it is likely to do if Genentech's stock price doesn't gain momentum.  Genentech isn't completely out of Roche's shadow. The company's stock runup makes it unlikely that shareholders will exercise their right to sell out to Genentech for $60 a share under the complex option expiring in July 1999. Yet Roche could still elect to buy the 33% of Genentech it doesn't already own for as much as $82.50 a share. That leaves Dr. Levinson 15 months to convince Roche not to do so.
