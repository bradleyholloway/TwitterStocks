 Ask David Wessel   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2004  A combination of the tax cuts President Bush won, a recession, and spending on Iraq, homeland security and other things turned the surpluses Mr. Bush inherited into deficits. Deficits are prudent when the economy crumbles, and so far the U.S. government has been able to borrow without pushing up interest rates. The harm comes over time, like termites in the basement. Deficits subtract from overall national savings, making it harder for the U.S. economy to invest in things that will pay off in higher living standards in the future.
