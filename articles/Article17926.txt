 On Sports: Soccer: Commodity With Poor Future   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1989  Chicago -- "How big is your ego?" Lee Stern asked. I was about to tell him what a genuinely modest fellow I am when he asked me another. "Can you imagine yourself leading a parade up LaSalle Street?"  Stern's glory day came in 1981 after the team he owned, the Chicago Sting, defeated the New York Cosmos in Toronto to capture the Soccer Bowl, the championship game of the North American Soccer League. The Sting won the title again in 1984 but got no parade, and, after that season, there was no more NASL, either. Now there's no more Sting, the team having folded last year after four seasons in the Major Indoor Soccer League.  You might have read somewhere that the World Cup, the quadrennial soccer bash enjoyed by billions, will grace these shores in 1994. Whether natives in short pants will greet it remains to be seen. If the professional sport ain't dead in the U.S. of A, it certainly is moribund. The outdoor game -- the real one -- succumbed with the NASL, and even the MISL, with its zipped-up, "Americanized" rules, sags on the ropes or, more aptly, boards. It's down to seven teams this season from 11 in 1987-88 after Cleveland, Minneapolis and St. Louis joined Chicago in the checkout line.
