 Business and Finance [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1987  STOCK PRICES SOARED, driving the Dow Jones industrials up 44.01 points, to a record 1971.32. The broad-based rally was attributed to institutional investors, who went on a buying binge following last month's tax-related sell-off. The gains were fueled by higher stock-index futures.  The dollar rebounded, helped by West German intervention that was mainly aimed at weakening the mark, dealers said. Still, the dollar is expected to remain weak and a realignment of the European Monetary System is considered inevitable.  BankAmerica rejected First Interstate's takeover offer, as expected. The banking company said it plans to take "steps to deter First Interstate's hostile advances," including raising additional equity capital.
