 Consumer Gripes Against Airlines Rose 34% in May   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  Consumer complaints against airlines in May rose 34% from the previous month, and were almost triple the year-earlier level, the Transportation Department said.  By far, the biggest complaint rate was against Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company. The department received 21.39 complaints per 100,000 Continental passengers in May, just slightly better than the April complaint rate of 25.40.  Eastern Airlines, another Texas Air unit, accumulated 10.11 complaints per 100,000 passengers in May -- the second-highest number and an increase from the 6.98 level in April. Ranked behind Eastern were Trans World Airlines, Pan American World Airways and Northwest Airlines; all posted increases in their complaint rates from April.
