 Senate Republicans' plan for tax cuts of $245 billion aims at middle ground   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1995  The Senate Republicans' tax bill, which was approved on Oct 19, 1995 by a split Finance Committee, is compared to the House bill. The Senate's $245 billion in tax cuts pave a middle ground between the House's deeper cuts and President Clinton's more modest mix. The Senate bill includes a $500-a-child tax credit and lower capital-gains taxes. Sen William Roth (R-DE) called the tax cuts "historic," while Democrats called them a giveaway to the richest taxpayers.
