 CSFB's Quattrone Faces Obstruction Investigation --- Star Banker Goes on Paid Leave; U.S. Attorney to Check Possibility He Urged Evidence Be Purged   By By Charles Gasparino and Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, said yesterday that it placed Mr. [Frank Quattrone] on paid administrative leave after evidence surfaced that seems to contradict Mr. Quattrone's account. The firm says it found other e-mails between Mr. Quattrone and a senior legal official indicating that he had been advised about the investigations only days before advising technology bankers to "clean up" their files.  Even as the news has worsened for Mr. Quattrone, CSFB until now has stood by him. CSFB Chief Executive John Mack, who joined the firm in mid-2001, proclaimed that his own internal investigation, completed by CSFB's new general counsel, former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement chief Gary Lynch, found that Mr. Quattrone did nothing wrong. Even as late as Wednesday of last week, when the e-mail that urged files be cleaned up became public, CSFB came to Mr. Quattrone's defense, after he personally assured Mr. Lynch that he didn't know of the government probes when he sent the e-mail.  Mr. Lynch agreed to the request, asking CSFB's outside law firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell, to review all communications involving Mr. Quattrone. Later Friday afternoon, Mr. Lynch was told that, in fact, there was an e-mail on Dec. 3, 2000, to Mr. Quattrone from former CSFB in-house lawyer David Brodsky. In that e-mail -- before the "cleanup" e-mail was forwarded by Mr. Quattrone -- Mr. Brodsky informed Mr. Quattrone of the various regulatory probes into the firm, some dating to mid-2000.
