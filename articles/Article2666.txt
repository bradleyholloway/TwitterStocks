 GE, Motorola and Schwab Gain As Data Assuage Rate Worries   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2000  "Bond yields have moved up to some very attractive levels," said Peter Canelo, U.S. equity market strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Signs of inflation pressures in the U.S. economy have begun to soften, including the readings contained in some economic data yesterday, suggesting the Federal Reserve can take a less aggressive role on interest rates going forward, which could lift the pressure on growth stocks.  Meanwhile, many technology stocks posted sharp gains on expectations of strong quarterly profits. Chip names, awaiting Intel's earnings report due out after the close of trading, rallied. Micron Technology increased 1 5/8 to 76. Motorola added 4 15/16 to 138 3/4. Rambus gained 2 to 84 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Shares of several banking stocks also moved up ahead of some profit reports. Firstar, a name Lehman Brothers championed recently, gained 1 7/16 to 23 1/4; the Milwaukee bank is slated to report results today. Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq) gained 1 13/16 to 65 1/2; the Cincinnati banking concern is scheduled to release a profit statement today, as well. First Union also added 7/8 to 34, ahead of today's profit statement.
