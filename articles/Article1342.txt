 Lydall Inc. Says Second-Quarter Profit Was Flat or Up a Bit on 8% Sales Drop   By By Suzanne Alexander, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 1990  The maker of fiber-based industrial products expects to report net income of $2.2 million to $2.3 million, or 76 to 79 cents a share, on sales of about $32 million, Leonard Jaskol, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview. Analysts were expecting net income of 80 cents a share, the company said.  Mr. Jaskol noted that in the past year, Lydall has phased out three product lines in its Manning non-wovens division. The products, inherited when Lydall acquired Manning Paper Co. in 1986, didn't fit with Lydall's technology and were draining too many resources, the company said. Mr. Jaskol said the phase-outs cost the company about $2 million in sales for the second quarter.  Mr. Jaskol said Lydall's blood filter media, which filters out contaminants in blood, is becoming increasingly popular with hospitals as concern about AIDS and other blood-related diseases becomes more acute. Lydall recently agreed in principle to become sole supplier of filtering media for oxygenators and cardiotomy filters to a unit of medical supplier Baxter Travenol Inc. for at least two years.
