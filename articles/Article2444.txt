 Crowds in Indonesia Set Fire to Cars and Stores After Tuesday's Killing of Six Student Protesters   By By Richard Borsuk and Puspa Madani, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1998  Though life unfolded relatively normally for many Jakarta residents, the central business area got its first look at mass protests against the Suharto administration and heard police fire warning shots into the air as demonstrators for a time filled Jalan Sudirman, one of the city's busiest thoroughfares.  Reflecting the drama on the streets, stocks plunged on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the rupiah weakened markedly. Jakarta's Composite Index lost 6.6%, falling 28.469 points to 402.057. The rupiah weakened to about 11,400 to the dollar in London trading Wednesday after opening at 9,500 in Jakarta Wednesday, a 16.7% plunge in value. As recently as last July, before the Asian financial turmoil began, the rupiah traded at 2,400 to the dollar.  The embattled 76-year-old Mr. Suharto, who has ruled Indonesia for 32 years with the military's backing, is returning to Jakarta from Cairo on Friday, one day earlier than scheduled. In Jakarta, Vice President B.J. Habibie quoted Mr. Suharto as asking "the whole nation" to show restraint to maintain stability "needed to implement the reforms we want and to get out of the crisis we face."
