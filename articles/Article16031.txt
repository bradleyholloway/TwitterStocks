 Letters to the Editor: Don't Want to Pay Your Debts? Sue!   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2001  "Although she was financially able to pay the bills, she stopped doing so and threw the bills away." So instead of telling their client that she brought the mess down upon herself, the lawyers embrace her, and make her into the victim of that giant, unfeeling, uncaring, heartless General Electric. If I was her attorney I would have sent her home with the advice to be more diligent about paying bills when due. She deserves no sympathy, and the attorneys should not have taken on a case that lacks merit. But I guess they see a big payday if they win. Only in America!
