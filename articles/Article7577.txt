 Ratings Fight Is Heating Up In Daytime TV   By By Peter W. Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1986  After dumping television's longest-running serial drama, "Search for Tomorrow," will National Broadcasting Co. eventually replace it with another "soap"? At CBS Inc., will "Capitol" survive another season? And what will Capital Cities/ABC Inc. do about its troubled 11 a.m.-to-noon EST time slot?  While NBC already has been crowned the runaway winner for the eight-week-old 1986-87 prime-time season, the contest for daytime ratings is much closer -- and heating up. NBC made its big daytime move this week, deciding to replace "Search" with a game show. Changes are expected at CBS and ABC in the months ahead. CBS, for instance, early next year will launch its first new soap in five years.  "In an average season, prime-time makes more dollars than daytime, but on a profit-margin basis, daytime is clearly more profitable than prime-time," says Alan J. Gottesman, media analyst for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Holdings Inc. Last year, advertisers spent $1.65 billion on weekday daytime commercials, 20% of network advertising revenue.
