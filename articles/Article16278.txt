 Monthly Mutual Funds Review --- Mosaic Makes an Art of Reports --- Group Details Reasons For Buying and Selling Fund Stocks on One Page   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  Months after the sale by Mosaic, Interpublic said accounting irregularities would require it to restate several years of earnings; it also said it is the subject of a formal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. "The thesis report helped us get out before most of the damage was done," says Rich Eisinger, a Mosaic analyst and co-manager with Mr. [Jay Sekelsky] of Mosaic Mid-Cap Fund.  At Mosaic, Mr. Sekelsky generally looks to buy companies with sustainable double-digit earnings growth. But he will only buy them when he believes the price is low enough to provide far more upside potential than downside risk. While that is commonly called a "growth-at-a-reasonable-price" approach, Mr. Sekelsky also likes to call it "growth at a reasonable risk." Mosaic runs concentrated stock portfolios that usually have no more than 30 holdings.  Mr. Sekelsky doesn't completely remember how the thesis reports became part of the standard operating procedure at Mosaic. But he believes they date back to the early 1990s, not long after his 1990 arrival from Wellington Management Co. in Boston. As Mr. Sekelsky worked to convince Frank Burgess, Madison Investment Advisors' founder and president, of his stock picks, he says he found a bullet-point listing of attributes to be a useful discussion tool. (Before joining Wellington, he had grown up primarily in northern Wisconsin and had received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Wisconsin in Madison.)
