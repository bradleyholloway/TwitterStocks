 Encore (A Special Report); Too Much Togetherness? More couples are discovering that the transition to retirement can be one of the toughest tests for a marriage; Here's how to navigate the waters   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2005  "The first year [in retirement] for almost all couples is rocky," says David Arp, who with his wife, [Claudia Arp], founded Marriage Alive International, an education program for couples that's now in its 22nd year. During the years in which you're building your career and raising children, "it's very easy to put your own relationship on the back burner," Mr. Arp says. "All of a sudden you look around and the kids are gone; you have all this time -- and you're not sure you know that other person."  "It comes up again and again. [Retirees] say: 'We didn't plan for the 20-plus years we're going to be alive,' " Dr. [Deborah B. Smith] says. "People are healthy, which is a huge change in retirement, compared to even the 1960s. [Then,] people didn't retire until they were physically unable to work. Today it's, 'Wow, we're healthy; now what do we do?' That's a big challenge."  The first may be the most important, as well as the most controversial. That's because it applies primarily to men. It's the husband's willingness to be influenced -- to listen, to understand his wife's point of view and to do something about it -- that often makes for a happy marriage, and a happy retirement. Why the focus on men? Because "our culture reinforces the idea that men should be decisive," Dr. [David Woodsfellow] says. But "decisiveness," he adds, is sometimes expressed as "my way or the highway."
