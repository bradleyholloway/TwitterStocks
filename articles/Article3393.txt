 Japanese Balk At U.S. Demand To Extend Pact On Auto Trade   By By Todd Zaun, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2000  Instead of extending the 1995 pact, Tokyo proposed that the two governments create a bilateral forum in which the two sides meet periodically to discuss automotive-industry issues. U.S. negotiators turned down Tokyo's idea, and the U.S. official in Tokyo said the U.S. was "disappointed that Japan would not extend the current auto agreement."  Still, Japan may be willing to compromise. While Tokyo suggested that the forum focus on environmental issues, Mr. [Hidehiro Konno] said Japan hasn't ruled out using the forum to discuss other topics. According to Mr. Konno, the U.S. hasn't said what it wants beyond a renewal of the current agreement, though in Washington, Japan's persistent trade surplus with the U.S. remains a sore point.
