 An Engineering Icon Slips --- Quality Ratings for Mercedes Drop in Several Surveys; Not as Good as GM's Opel?   By By Scott Miller and Karen Lundegaard, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2002  A surprise blow to Mercedes's quality reputation came last week when a normally secretive study of car quality in Europe was leaked to a German trade publication. The report, conducted for the auto makers themselves, showed Mercedes quality and customer satisfaction falling since 1999 to levels below Opel, the German unit of General Motors Corp. and a brand with one of the worst images in Europe. A separate German survey ranked the German-built Ford Focus compact car No. 1 in a study of durability during the first three years of a car's life. The survey, conducted by TUV, a German auto-inspection and research association, put half a dozen Toyota models ahead of the first Mercedes model -- the SLK, which came in twelfth.  The surveys are a blow for Mercedes and its parent DaimlerChrysler AG. With its Chrysler Group unit in deep financial trouble, DaimlerChrysler has relied on Mercedes as a cash cow. At the same time, Chrysler is counting on Mercedes to help lift its own quality by supplying key components like engines.  Mercedes and Opel verified the leaked portions of the report, but didn't comment on specific faults. Johannes Reifenrath, director of communications at Mercedes-Benz passenger cars in Stuttgart, said a more detailed version of the survey showed Mercedes quality was at least as high as Opel, but he declined to provide any additional data.
