 Pep Boys Curbs Its Enthusiasm, and Wall Street Applauds --- Shut Stores, Demographic Trends, Rivals' Troubles Aid Auto-Parts Chain   By By Anne Marie Chaker, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2002  Though the plan initially contributed to $96.5 million in pretax expenses and helped lead to a loss of $51 million, or $1 a share, in the fiscal year ended January 2001, it has since impressed investors and defied analysts' expectations. The result: The stock price rebounded to a 52-week high of $18.49 in December 2001 from around $4 a share in October 2000. It rose 35 cents to $14.55 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. Pep Boys also posted the sixth-largest gain last year in the category of small and midcapitalization stocks.  Moreover, the company is looking to profit from closures of service centers and retail stores at competitors. Its big competitors on the retail side -- such as AutoZone Inc., of Memphis, Tenn., and CSK Auto Corp., of Phoenix -- recently announced store closures. In June, AutoZone said it would close between 30 and 60 auto parts stores. CSK followed in August, announcing that it would shutter 36 stores. Kmart Corp.'s filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code leads analysts to believe that the company will shut down hundreds of its stores -- about a third of which have car-service centers.  "The rapid expansion in the 1990s of all the retailers has stopped. All the large retailers have announced store closures," says Mr. [George Babich]. "That's going to be good for Pep Boys."
