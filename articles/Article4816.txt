 Mexican Share Rise Is Seen Continuing As Presidential Choice Pleases Investors   By By Shepard Barbash, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1987  As long as earnings continue to rise and the ruling party's presidential candidate pledges to maintain current policies, they say, the Mexican stock market probably can stay on the path that has seen prices more than triple since Jan. 1, even after adjusting for Mexico's virulent inflation.  However, analysts note that the market's rise started from an extremely low point after a 1982 crash and that prices only regained 1979 levels a few months ago. In addition, a big further jump in inflation or an outbreak of political instability could change the bullish outlook.  For now, however, excess liquidity, falling interest rates and the nomination of Budget and Planning Minister Carlos Salinas de Gortari to succeed President Miguel de la Madrid late next year are expected to push prices up a further 25% after inflation by year end.
