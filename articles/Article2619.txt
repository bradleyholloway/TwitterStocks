 Cablevision Posts $167.8 Million Loss And Tops Forecasts   By By Leslie Cauley, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 13, 1999  Cablevision Systems Corp. reported a second-quarter net loss of $167.8 million, or $1.10 a share, slightly better than some Wall Street expectations, as the company continued to benefit from strong demand for its cable-television, telecommunications and entertainment services.  Cablevision said operating cash flow, a key measure of a cable company's health, increased 9.2% on cable operations on a pro forma basis, and about 8.3% for the whole company-12% if $8 million in one-time Y2K costs weren't included. Second-quarter revenue increased about 18% to $946.3 million from $805.2 million.
