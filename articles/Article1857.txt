 British Aerospace Selects American To Be Chairman   By By Brian Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1994  Following rumors of a boardroom fight and criticism from some politicians, John Cahill will leave his post as chairman of British Aerospace PLC.  Mr. Cahill leaves the position after serving only two years of a five-year contract. In his place, British Aerospace appointed an American, Bob Bauman, who is chief executive of SmithKline Beecham PLC. Mr. Bauman, 62 years old, plans to leave SmithKline, an Anglo-American health-care company, in April, when he will move to his new post.  While a statement issued late Friday by British Aerospace portrayed Mr. Cahill's early departure as amicable, the U.K. media speculated that his exit stems from a boardroom battle over the future of the company's defense business. In addition, Mr. Cahill has come under attack recently from some British parliamentarians because of his generous contract and his refusal for tax purposes to live in the U.K. An Englishman, Mr. Cahill has homes in both Florida and New England.
