 Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover Forgo Adding to Foreign Loan Reserves   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1988  Chemical New York Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. both declined a second round of special reserve increases for loans to developing countries, signaling a split between money-center and regional banks on the foreign-debt issue.  In announcing its fourth-quarter earnings, Chemical, the nation's fourth-largest banking concern, left its loan-loss reserves basically unchanged at about 25% of its $5.3 billion in loans to Latin American countries.  In recent weeks, a host of regional banks as well as one money-center bank, Security Pacific Corp., have boosted their reserves to 50%, and even 100%, of Latin American loans. The first round of reserve building was triggered last May by Citicorp, the nation's largest banking concern, which set aside $3 billion to cover 25% of its Latin American exposure; that move was followed by the rest of the banking industry.
