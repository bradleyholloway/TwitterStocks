 Beverly Enterprises Expects to Report 4th-Period, 1987 Loss   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1988  PASADENA, Calif. -- Beverly Enterprises said it expects to report net losses for the 1987 fourth quarter and year and for the first half of 1988 principally because of higher labor costs and changing patient patterns.  Robert Van Tuyle, chairman and chief executive officer, said yesterday in an interview that the fourth-quarter loss likely will be wider than the loss of the year-earlier quarter. Mr. Van Tuyle didn't elaborate on the loss for the year but said that revenue for the latest quarter totaled about $530 million and $2 billion for the year. He said final details won't be available until early next month.
