 African Supplier of Mercenaries Shuts, Says It Wants to Give Peace a Chance   By By Robert Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1998  JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Executive Outcomes Ltd., one of the world's premier suppliers of mercenaries, said it is closing down as of Jan. 1, marking the end of an era in "military consulting," as the company calls its trade.  For African rulers facing rebellions, EO, based in Pretoria, South Africa, has long been the place to call. Founded in 1989 by two soldiers from South Africa's old white-run military, EO became synonymous with soldiers of fortune.  "The people in EO have decided to move on," said Nico Palm, EO's director and owner and a former army engineer. "It's a business decision. Like a professional boxer who knows when to throw in the towel, we've decided now is the time to go."
