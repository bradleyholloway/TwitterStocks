 Dry Wells Belie Hope for Big Caspian Reserves --- Bad Luck, Low Oil Prices Lead Some to Reassess, Put Clinton Plan at Risk   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Christopher Cooper in Houston and Hugh Pope in Almaty, Kazakstan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1998  The Caspian oil game is still in the early stages, and big discoveries sometimes come after a string of dry holes. Oil executives remain optimistic about the region, and some companies have started pumping a total of over 400,000 barrels of oil per day from previously known fields. But in the six years since this chunk of the former Soviet frontier opened to outside investment, major oil companies have spent billions of dollars drilling for oil, and haven't yet hit a new discovery significant enough to repay the investment.  But while the oil men may take the long view, they are still cautious. A group of foreign companies exploring for oil in the Caspian are supposed to pick a route later this month for a planned pipeline to pump an anticipated flood of new Caspian crude to global markets. Although the Clinton administration favors a route from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan, Turkey, one company official said that proposition, costing a minimum of $2.5 billion, will die on the vine if companies continue to drill dry holes in the south Caspian.  In a report last year, the U.S. State Department estimated that the Caspian region's possible oil reserves could reach 178 billion barrels, giving tiny Azerbaijan almost as much oil as the entire continent of Asia. Currently, though, the bulk of Azerbaijan's proved reserves, about seven billion barrels of oil, come from a single offshore field discovered years ago by the Soviets. The area has been the site of several recent dry holes.
