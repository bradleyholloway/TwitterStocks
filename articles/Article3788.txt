 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2004  The rising yields represent a relatively minor financial burden on China's government. Still, the trends are one more indication of the challenges Beijing faces in trying to retain control over all aspects of the country's financial system and, specifically, over interest rates. The government's debt-led growth strategy makes Beijing increasingly beholden to the market.  At the same time, the federal government aims to cover more services, such as home care and prescription-drug plans, which now aren't core parts of the national insurance system. "These are the new frontiers of the health-care system, and pharmaceuticals is the fastest-growing area of provincial health spending," Mr. [Pierre Pettigrew] said. He didn't say how the government plans to address treatment delays or how much additional funding it plans to inject into the system.  Opposition politicians say Mr. [Paul Martin]'s government has failed to make specific commitments. "This is the same rhetoric," said Conservative Party health critic Rob Merrifield of Mr. Pettigrew's speech. Mr. Martin's Liberal government, Mr. Merrifield said, has failed to make good on commitments to health-care reform made by outgoing Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien last year.
