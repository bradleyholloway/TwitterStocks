 Brokers Promote Alternative to Mutual Funds; In Bid for Small Investors, Securities Firms Embrace Exchange-Traded Funds   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2004  ETFs are baskets of securities that resemble index-tracking mutual funds in that they also track the movement of a particular index or sector. But ETFs trade throughout the trading day, unlike mutual funds, whose price is set just once a day. ETFs began as a product aimed at institutional investors, but they have begun to catch on with individuals, because the fees tend to be low. Investors, though, pay a commission on each ETF purchase or sale.  For many firms, the move toward ETFs fits into a broader shift toward fee-based business. ETFs are "an inexpensive option that allows you to go after a broad swath of the market cheaply," says Michael Kostoff, executive director of the VIP Forum, a Washington research group that tracks the wealth-management industry. "The broker can tell the client, 'I've put you in this ETF product, which is much cheaper . . . , and therefore I'm earning my fee."  The Biggest Baskets Here are the six top exchange-traded funds based on total assets. ------PERFORMANCE*----- ASSETS EXPENSE YEAR- 3-YEARTRUST (TICKER) (in billions) RATIO TO-DATE 1-YEAR ANNUALIZED SPDR Trust (SPY) $46.05 0.10% 2.19% 9.83% 2.53%NASDAQ-100 Trust, Series 1 (QQQ) 20.69 0.20 -2.49 1.93 0.83iShares S&P 500 Index Fund (IVV) 9.90 0.09 2.16 9.83 2.55iShares MSCI-EAFE (EFA) 9.81 0.35 6.77 17.40 8.40DOW Diamond Series Trust I (DIA) 7.44 0.18 -2.41 5.97 4.52S&P MidCap 400 Trust,Series 1(MDY) 6.55 0.25 3.83 11.52 10.20 * Percent change in net asset value Note: Figures as of Oct. 8, 2004 Source: Thomson Financial
