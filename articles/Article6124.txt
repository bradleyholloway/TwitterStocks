 Leading the News: Doubt Rises About EchoStar-Hughes Merger   By By Andy Pasztor and Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  Talking to reporters afterward, Mr. [Eddy Hartenstein] indicated that Hughes and EchoStar, the owner of the Dish Network, "haven't come to a final conclusion" about whether giving up spectrum to Cablevision Systems Corp., which has talked about launching a new satellite-TV service using the capacity, will be a major part of the concessions. In fact, he said, there "haven't been any extensive discussions" between the companies and any potential new entrants like Cablevision.  That proposal has become a central component of the companies' discussions with the FCC. FCC officials have concluded that eliminating all competition in the satellite-TV market outweighs the potential consumer benefits of creating a stronger competitor to the cable industry, according to people familiar with the matter. As a result, the companies are trying to convince the FCC that strengthening a satellite competitor like Cablevision should be enough to assuage their concerns.
