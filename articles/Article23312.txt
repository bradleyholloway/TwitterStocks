 The Abortion Mainstream; The Abortion Mainstream   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  If an attorney's advice to his client says anything about his personal views, this memo would indicate that Judge [Samuel Alito]'s position on abortion is in sync with that of a solid majority of Americans. Polls show that most voters don't want Roe overturned but strongly favor some limitations on abortion rights such as laws on informed consent -- which was the subject at issue in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Pennsylvania case heard by the Supreme Court in 1985.  The memo "casts serious doubt" on whether Judge Alito could rule objectively in abortion cases, says New York Senator Chuck Schumer. "The more we know, the more disturbing it gets," opines California Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer. "The document isn't just a smoking gun. It's a smoking cannon . . . Samuel Alito is poised to change 25 years of reproductive rights for women in American," offers People for the American Way.  The flap over the Alito memo is a useful reminder of why documents from the Solicitor General's office are generally kept confidential. Presidents won't get very good advice if they think that some day Chuck Schumer will be twisting their meaning on the Senate floor. The 1985 memo lost its privileged status because Mr. Alito had copied the civil division of the Justice Department. The Administration says it won't release other SG documents, and it shouldn't.
