 Takeoffs & Landings   By By Michelle Higgins and Jonathan B. Weinbach, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2000  While most agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, don't rate airlines for safety, the FAA has a searchable database (nasdac.faa.gov/internet/) that lists accidents and incidents for domestic airlines and international carriers that have happened in the U.S. Then there's Aviation Safety Network (aviation-safety.net) which covers accidents and incidents since 1945. One of its pages is devoted to the safety profiles of 50 international airlines.  Time was, fliers and agents could count on discounted fares if tickets were purchased at least 14 days in advance. Not so anymore. With random pricing wars, e-fares, and the addition of low-cost carriers, it's anybody's guess what's the best time to buy -- particularly for travel during the holidays, when "blackout dates" cloud the rules even more. Nowadays, "there is no universal rule of thumb when it comes to pricing," a spokesman for American Airlines says. "The fares just come and go."  Don't fret just yet: As at all Olympic cities, there will be plenty of last-minute lodging opportunities, and Coldwell Banker is hardly the only broker in town. It's simply the "official" broker, which means it shares a percentage of rental fees with the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee. "Joe Olympic fan will have plenty of options," says Chris Robertson, of Prudential Coleman Real Estate of Park City, Utah.
