 The Economy; CAPITAL: A Tale of Two Treasury Secretaries: Robert Rubin and Paul O'Neill   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  AS U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY, Paul O'Neill was often entertaining, Robert Rubin rarely so. Mr. O'Neill would pop off, then appear genuinely surprised that his words had impact. He might get a full page in "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations." Mr. Rubin contemplated how each word would look in print before parting his lips. He'll never make Bartlett's.  Despite Mr. [Karl Rove]'s obvious power, the book reports no attempts by Mr. O'Neill to influence him. Perhaps because of his dozen years as an autocratic chief executive, Mr. O'Neill had no skill at steering big- ego colleagues to a consensus. He consistently made himself the issue. Mr. Rubin's years overseeing what was then a big Wall Street partnership, Goldman, Sachs & Co., equipped him far better. He knew that being right on an issue wasn't enough to prevail.  Mr. O'Neill's irresistible phrases (such as likening Mr. [Bush] to "a blind man in a roomful of deaf people") overshadow a serious point about the differences between the [Bill Clinton] and Bush White Houses. Mr. Rubin writes that Mr. Clinton encouraged and enjoyed a lively intellectual debate, even one that challenged views widely shared by his team. Mr. O'Neill testifies that Mr. Bush does not. White House discussions were marked, he says, by "incestuous amplification." Mr. O'Neill comes off as obnoxious and arrogant, but smart. It seems the president never got beyond the first two characteristics.
