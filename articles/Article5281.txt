 Soviet Aide Proposes Economic Treaty --- Plan Would Link Republics In a Common Market, Ensure Debt Payments   By By Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1991  The U.S.S.R. would make private property the basis of its economy and take steps to ensure repayment of its foreign debt under a new economic treaty being proposed by Grigory Yavlinsky, the deputy head of an interim committee now running the Soviet economy.  Mr. Yavlinsky's draft treaty amounts to a more comprehensive -- although not the only -- plan for rearranging the Soviet economic system following the failure of last month's coup and the collapse of hard-line communism.  It seeks to lay the foundations of a Soviet-style common market, in which the individual republics participating would form a customs and banking union and cooperate closely on fiscal, monetary and social policy. The ruble would remain the unifying currency, though republics could print their own money under certain conditions. All participants would agree not to hinder the flow of goods and services among them, and to lift obstacles to private enterprise.
