 Politics & Economics: Lawmakers Urge Bush to Do More On Immigrant Bill   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2006  "He's got to get more involved. I'm not sure where we're going, if we're going at all," said Sen. Mike DeWine (R., Ohio).

"I tell you what would help, is if we had the support of the White House," Mr. [Richard Durbin] said. "If the president would pick up the phone and call the Republican senators and tell them, I'm ready to support this bill, I want you to support this bill."  "The measure of this is, will people come forward?" said Angela Kelley, deputy director of the National Immigration Forum, which supports the bill. "I am nervous at some of the changes I have heard discussed, and the committee bill and conference is our best shot."
