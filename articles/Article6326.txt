 Judges Ask Tough Questions in Elian Hearing   By By Marjorie Valbrun, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  A panel of three federal judges in Atlanta sharply questioned lawyers during a hearing on whether six-year-old Elian Gonzalez deserves a chance at political asylum, contrary to the wishes of his father, who wants to take the boy home to Cuba.  Some of the inquiries from the bench yesterday could be interpreted as signaling the judges' inclinations, either for the position of the Miami relatives who want to keep Elian in the U.S., or for that of the boy's father, who is backed by the Clinton administration.  The boy was rescued off the coast of Florida last November; his mother and 10 others died trying to escape Cuba for the U.S. Relatives in Miami sought political asylum on Elian's behalf, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service refused to consider the application because of the boy's age and his father's desire to take him home. A federal judge in Miami in March upheld the INS action, and the Miami relatives appealed to the 11th Circuit.
