 Private Properties [1]  By By Felicia Paik, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1995  Loida Lewis, chairwoman of TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., has purchased this year's most expensive property in the Hamptons, the retreat of choice for the Wall Street and Hollywood jet-set crowd. Mrs. Lewis paid $12.1 million for an 11-acre waterfront residence in East Hampton, N.Y., according to Dayton Halstead Real Estate. In 1994, Mrs. Lewis assumed the reins of the giant food distribution company founded by her late husband, Reginald Lewis.  The Fort Salonga weekend retreat of famed choreographer and former New York City Ballet director George Balanchine is on the market for $289,000. Mr. Balanchine, who died in 1983, built the 2,000 square-foot home in 1939 as a surprise wedding gift for his bride, Vera Zorina, a ballerina and actress. She lived there for many years after their marriage broke up in 1943. The house is now owned by artist Millicent Danks. Coldwell Banker Sammis in Northport is handling the sale.
