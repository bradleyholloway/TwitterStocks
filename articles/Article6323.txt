 AltaVista IPO Is Again Delayed; CMGI Forecasts Autumn Deal   By By Jon G. Auerbach and Suzanne Mcgee, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  The planned initial public offering of Internet search engine AltaVista Co., one of the most closely watched deals during the new-issues market's turbulent spring season, is being delayed until the fall, according to company executives.  Internet investor CMGI Inc., the majority owner of AltaVista, postponed the IPO last month amid the stock-market downdraft affecting so-called business-to-consumer Internet sites. The offering was expected to raise about $280 million, making it among the largest of the season.  Although many industry experts believed AltaVista would try to pull off the IPO in the coming weeks, CMGI Chief Executive David Wetherell told the Chase H&Q technology-stock conference in San Francisco that the company would wait until September or October. Mr. Wetherell said AltaVista should at that time be closer to profitability.
