 Intel Raises Profit-Margin Outlook; Chip Maker Also Boosts 1st-Quarter Sales Forecast; Production Costs Decline   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 2005  He characterized Intel's raised forecast for profit margin as particularly significant, since margin trends tend to drive investor perception of the company's momentum. "Gross margins have bottomed for Intel," Mr. [Walia] said. "When margins for Intel bottom, you have to get back in" to the stock.  In 2004 Intel built up too much inventory in the first half, and a new version of its flagship Pentium 4 chip didn't offer many advantages over prior products. Intel missed delivery dates, dropped a plan to make chips for projection TV sets and missed a target of hitting a speed of 4 gigahertz by year end. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. got to market first with several new technologies.  Separately, Intel confirmed that it is awarding its advertising business to Interpublic Group's McCann Erickson unit, succeeding Havas's Euro RSCG. Eric Kim, vice president and co-director of Intel's sales and marketing group, said the new agency will help the chip maker accelerate a strategy based on promoting technology "platforms," which could include multiple chips and software, instead of focusing on microprocessors alone.
