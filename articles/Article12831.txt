 Questions Persist in Energy Sector --- Practice of Adjusting Value Of Trading Portfolios Casts Doubt on Earnings   By By Chip Cummins, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2002  Duke said last month that its $46 million gain in the second quarter was "a result of applying improved and standardized valuation modeling techniques for all North American regions." By standardizing the way its trading desks in Calgary, Alberta, Salt Lake City and Houston value long-term contracts, the company ended up with the gain, executives said. Duke executives said the company frequently updates its models, but that they have proved accurate in booking earnings. "We do not have a history of things being out of whack," said Mark Svrcek, Duke's vice president for risk control and reporting.  Last year, Duke booked $619 million in mark-to-market gains. Moody's Investors Service, in a report this spring, said about 55% of Duke's portfolio was valued based on quoted prices. Duke said about 60% of its portfolio comes from valuing contracts against market prices and "other external sources." The rest comes from models and "other valuation methods."  Duke executives said their models use "industry best practices" and have proved accurate in gauging earnings and predicting cash flow. Duke said it assigns independent analysts, though still on Duke's payroll, to regularly validate the models traders use.
