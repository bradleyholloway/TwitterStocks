 Hedging Strategies Get Closer Look; Mutual Funds May Benefit From Investing Methods Often Used by Hedge Funds   By Lipschutz, Neal, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2004  Charles J. Gradante, managing principal at hedge-fund consulting firm Hennessee Group, said in testimony that one way to level the investment playing field would be to allow mutual funds to adopt some hedge-fund strategies. "With some modification in the areas of restricted shorting, performance fees, liquidity and leverage, the retail investor can invest in a hedge fund with the protection of regulatory oversight," he told the Senate committee.  If a hedge fund wanted to serve retail clients or work with retirement assets, it would become a Registered Investment Adviser, Mr. Gradante said. But if they stay away from smaller investors and retirement funds, hedge funds should be exempt from SEC registration, he argued. "Hennessee research indicates that hedge-fund managers do not want to manage retail assets," he said.
