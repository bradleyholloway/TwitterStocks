 U.S. Treasury Overhauls IRA Rules --- New Payout Proposal Gives More Flexibility   By By Lynn Asinof, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2001  For instance, under the old regulations, IRA owners locked in their annual minimum distributions by picking a method of calculation and a beneficiary just after turning 70 1/2. But with the new rules, there will instead be a uniform table to determine the minimum distributions they will be required to take each year. And that table is generous, giving everyone the smallest minimum distribution provided under the old system -- allowing more of people's IRA money to continue to grow tax-deferred in years to come.  Inheritance issues are also simplified. Under the new regulations, minimum distributions of inherited IRAs are based on the life expectancy of the beneficiary. And the beneficiary now isn't finalized until Dec. 31 of the year following death instead of being locked in soon after the IRA owner turns 70 1/2. That means that people can change their beneficiary whenever they wish up until their death with no repercussions. In many cases, there is even the opportunity for posthumous planning.  A beneficiary, for example, could disclaim the IRA, allowing it to pass to a contingent and perhaps younger beneficiary. Or a co-beneficiary, such as a charity, whose designation would shorten the IRA payout period, can "cash out," leaving the other beneficiaries free to use their life expectancies. Or the IRA could be divided into separate accounts for multiple beneficiaries with different life expectancies.
