 `Butterfly Bank' May Save Insects -- and Developers   By By Ryan Tate, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1999  Launched by Escondido developer Greg Reden, it provides what proponents say is a market-based way to end the battle between developers -- eager to build on prime Southern California land -- and environmentalists, determined to protect one of the region's most fragile creatures: the quino checkerspot butterfly.  For Mr. Reden -- who with his partners at Johnston, Poutre & Reden Inc. owns 2,000 acres of butterfly habitat east of Temecula -- the butterfly bank offers a chance for financial redemption.  The pivotal figure in the project is the quino checkerspot, which once ranged throughout Southern California but is now confined to just two locations: western Riverside County and the Otay Mesa area of San Diego. Since it was declared an endangered species in 1997, developers have dreaded discovering the red, yellow and black butterfly on their property. The federal Endangered Species Act restricts destruction of the habitat of any species so designated.
