 Entertainment + Technology (A Special Report): The Games We Play --- Head Trip: Virtual Reality Is Coming, and Out-of-the-Home Entertainment May Never be the Same   By By David J. Jefferson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1994  Technoheads say the potential to create digital fantasylands is almost limitless. Forget spinning on merry-go-rounds and careening down roller coasters. In the Disneyland of the future, patrons may get their kicks by strapping on high-tech goggles equipped with tiny computer monitors, and slip down virtual water slides with their favorite swimsuit models. If the audio and visual cues are good enough, customers will have a hard time distinguishing virtual from real.  But the crude, liquid-crystal visual displays in the headsets make Cybergate seem a closer cousin of Pong than Mortal Kombat. And the blizzard of "pod control instructions" from the flight attendants are more daunting than a VCR manual. Worse, more than a few novice cyberpilots walk away spacesick from the jarring visual displays and the claustrophobic, sweat-inducing feel of the headsets. "It's been a real technical challenge," says Ken Stone, project administrator for Visions of Reality, based in Irvine, Calif. Each Trip: $10 Despite the shortcomings ("It will constantly get better," Mr. Stone promises), the company is betting that folks will pay $10 each to get a peek at even primitive VR. It is about to open its first arcade in Newport Beach, Calif., and says it will have a chain of 150 within 18 months.  Do customers feel cheated? Apparently not, given that some have played the game more than 2,000 times at Virtual World. "A lot of people will argue whether what we present is virtual reality. That misses the point. We don't sell the graphics. We sell a good time," says Tim Disney, chairman and chief executive of Virtual World Entertainment, the Burbank, Calif., company that is developing the Virtual World entertainment centers.
