 Dollar Breaks Through 110-Yen Level To New 8-Week High as Rally Thrives   By By Betty W. Liu, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1996  The dollar broke through the psychologically important 110-yen level yesterday, hitting another eight-week high against the Japanese currency as prospects for a rise in U.S. interest rates continued to feed the dollar rally.  The U.S. currency ended the day near its intraday high against the yen, but up only slightly against the mark. It hasn't traded above 110 yen since its fall during the mid-July U.S. stock-market turbulence.  The dollar's flat level against the mark doesn't mean a change of market view about interest rates. There has been little news during the past day or so to dissuade players from their belief the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting Sept. 24, Mr. Dix added.
