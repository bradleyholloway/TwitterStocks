 Boeing Nears Accord With United Parcel To Convert Up to 30 Used Jets for Cargo   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 2000  The negotiations also are believed to include provisions for fleet management, comprehensive engine maintenance and possible Boeing financing. The Seattle-based maker of airliners, space and defense systems began expanding into higher-margin aircraft-service and modification segments during the past two years as a means of accelerating growth. A contract with UPS is seen by analysts as an important momentum-builder.  Tom Weidemeyer, president of UPS's airline operations, told a cargo industry conference in Bal Harbour, Fla., last week that the company seeks to "balance the risk equation between new and old aircraft." At the gathering, Joe Gullion, president of Boeing's services unit, announced a cargo-conversion program for shorter-range 737 aircraft, as part of a venture with the aerospace unit of B.F. Goodrich Co. and an alliance of Taiwanese firms.  Last year, Boeing signed a ground-breaking agreement, valued at about $2 billion, with DHL Worldwide Express. Boeing agreed to buy more than 40 used 757 passenger jets, turn them into package freighters, sell and lease the planes to DHL, and then maintain them.
