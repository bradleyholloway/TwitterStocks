 E-Commerce (A Special Report) --- The Industries -- Aiming High: Two European companies are betting that full-price, top-quality apparel will sell online   By By Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1999  Stockholm-based Dressmart AB and U.K.-based boo.com Group Ltd. are turning heads in the Internet world with strategies they believe are the next stage in Internet salesmanship. While companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and CDNow Inc. continue to grow by maintaining huge selections of low-value goods and passing low overhead costs on to consumers through discounts, these new retailers think customers are ready to pay full price for more individualized and high-ticket items such as brand-name clothing. The lure: lots of perks for buyers and beefed-up customer service.  "Books, compact disks and software were the first generation of the Internet," says Kajsa Leander, chief marketing officer for boo.com, clicking rapidly through online pictures of tennis shoes, sunglasses and hooded sweatshirts in a half-completed office in London. "What we are doing is the second generation, and it is more dynamic, interactive and tailored."  And the company promises to make it as easy as possible to buy those items. In addition to offering a large central Web site (www.dressmart.com), Dressmart also has signed exclusive deals with leading Swedish companies such as Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson to create "microsites," which are housed on internal corporate networks. Employees of these companies can visit the site during the workday, place their orders and receive shipments free at the office the next day. Dressmart is currently working on new payment methods, one of which would allow employees to pay for their goods with the same pass that gives them access to the office, with the bill coming directly out of their salaries.
