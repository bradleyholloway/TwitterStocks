 AB Electrolux Would Sell Certain Lines Of White Consolidated if Offer Succeeds   By By J. Ernest Beazley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1986  AB Electrolux of Sweden said it will sell certain operations of White Consolidated Industries Inc. if its $711 million tender offer for the U.S. appliance maker succeeds.  Electrolux disclosed its plan in an offer that began yesterday to acquire all 15.8 million shares outstanding of Cleveland-based White for $45 each. The acquisition would combine Europe's No. 1 appliance maker with the No. 3 U.S. manufacturer.  Also, in an interview, Hans Werthen, Electrolux's chairman, said the company isn't inclined to sweeten its offer for White. "We have offered what we think is a fair price, and after all the price is 22 times earnings," Mr. Werthen said. "So I think we will stick to our price. There's always some speculation when a big deal like this comes out."
