 Fed to Explain More Clearly Its Inclinations   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1999  The Fed disclosed yesterday that after months of discussion, its policy-making committee agreed in December to simplify the wording of the directive it crafts at each meeting. It also said it plans "on an infrequent basis" to issue public explanations even when it decides not to move interest rates when it wants "to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of future policy."  Earlier this week, the Fed again voted to leave rates steady. Under its new policy, its lack of explanation suggests the Fed isn't gearing up to raise interest rates.
