 One Web Retailer's Watchword: `Free After Rebate' --- What's the Catch? CyberRebate Makes Money in Other Ways, Like Some Very High Prices   By By Peter Edmonston WSJ.com, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  [CyberRebate] has other ways of making money. A fraction of CyberRebate's customers -- well below 10%, Mr. [Joel Granik] says -- don't bother to collect their rebates at all. And thanks to its stratospheric prices before the rebate, CyberRebate can reap a staggering margin on these "no-rebate" sales. For example, CyberRebate charges $206 for a Fisher Price toy phone, compared with a retail price of about $30, according to the manufacturer's Web site. But CyberRebate will return all $206.  Mr. Granik says CyberRebate has been taking steps to improve its record, including the introduction of a 24-hour toll-free customer service line in December. He notes that CyberRebate has its own rebate-tracking service that allows customers to print rebate forms and monitor the status of their rebate requests online.  During the week ended Jan. 27, CyberRebate rose as high as the No. 3 spot, behind only eBay Inc. and Amazon, according to PC Data. The site owes some of its rising popularity to a recent marketing deal with Yahoo! Inc., which began promoting CyberRebate from its shopping section in December. Mr. Granik also credits word of mouth for his site's ascent up the charts.
