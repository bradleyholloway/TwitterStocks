 American Express to Buy Card Portfolio From Bank of Hawaii, Still Use Its Name   By By Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2000  Bank of Hawaii customers will still have Bank of Hawaii credit cards, but American Express will handle the actual processing, billing and accounting for card transactions. The card will have the small American Express logo along with the bank's brand to signal the affiliation with the New York-based financial-services company.  American Express is one of the biggest card issuers in the world, and has broad acceptance among merchants. This deal follows a separate deal in August, when American Express announced plans to acquire the ShopRite credit-card portfolio, and to issue a cobranded ShopRite card. That transaction is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2001.
