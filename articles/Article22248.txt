 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1997  APPLE COMPUTER is considering the sale of key business units as part of a stepped-up effort to reduce costs, according to people inside the company.

Pacific Gas & Electric agreed to buy the natural-gas business of Valero Energy for $722.5 million in stock. The acquisition bolsters PG&E's natural-gas pipeline and marketing position.  China and the U.S. agreed to renew a bilateral textile accord after grueling talks that underscored both sides' determination to improve ties. The accord is likely to make only a small dent in the nearly $40 billion trade deficit that the U.S. has with China.
