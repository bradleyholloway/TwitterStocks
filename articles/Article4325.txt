 Memorial Service For Henry Ford II Follows His Script --- Captains of Industry Gather To Sing Magnate's Praises As Dixieland Band Plays   By By Paul Ingrassia, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1987  Henry Ford II knew what he wanted done in life, and, so it seems, in death as well.  "They said Daddy's name was on the building," said Edsel B. Ford II, Henry Ford's only son, "but his commitment was much more than that. His heart was in it too." The 38-year-old Edsel, general marketing manager of Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division, described his father as "a man of many contradictions, but that was to be expected. . . . He had no choice but to lead a challenging and complicated life."  Among those contradictions was Henry Ford's lifelong yearning for privacy, despite the demands of a public life -- a conflict evident in yesterday's memorial service. The 11 a.m. service, held at Detroit's Cathedral Church of St. Paul, was public, in contrast to last week's private funeral. But the Ford family wouldn't allow it to be publicly broadcast or recorded; Henry Ford didn't want it that way.
