AL COHN was one of Woody Herman's ''Four Brothers'' in the late 40's - one of the saxophone quartet that played the tune ''Four Brothers'' with the Herman Band. For many years Mr. Cohn has been an arranger and composer, and his writing is one of the major contributions to the success of ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' the musical for which he orchestrated Duke Ellington's music.  This week, through Sunday, Mr. Cohn is making one of his infrequent appearances as a performer at Bechet's, Third Avenue between 75th and 76th Streets, where he is leading a quartet with Richard Wyands on piano, Scott Lee on bass and Walter Bolden on drums.  Mr. Cohn is a straight-ahead, no-nonsense saxophonist. Instead of spreading out in developing his solos, Mr. Cohn remains within a relatively narrow scope, but his playing becomes more intense and his most extreme physical reaction is a bouncing jiggle. This results in contained, concentrated performances that burn or simmer rather than explode. His variant on an explosion is an unaccompanied passage or a cadenza that effectively intensifies the inner fire of his playing.  His musicians provide him with a firm, steady foundation, but when he lays out, not playing, the remaining trio is rather bland, though Mr. Lee's clean virtuosity gives it some sparkle. John S.
