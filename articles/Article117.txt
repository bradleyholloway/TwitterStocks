 Milken's Sentence: Was Justice Done? ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 23, 1990  Michael Milken, whose junk-bond empire fueled the takeover boom of the 1980s, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for violating federal securities laws and committing other crimes. In sentencing the man who came to symbolize the successes and excesses of the decade, Federal District Judge Kimba Wood said the punishment had to send a message to the financial world. The Wall Street Journal sought comment from interested and disinterested parties about the fairness of the sentence and its impact on the financial markets.  "The stiff sentence was necessary. It sends a strong message to the thousands of wolves and coyotes we created during the '80s in the worlds of banking, business and law. And it should make us all more reflective about our values and our particular areas of responsibility.I am not proud of my profession and its role in the credit binge of the '80s. Many of the excesses could not have occurred but for the readiness of some of our most brilliant lawyers to prostitute themselves for large fees."
