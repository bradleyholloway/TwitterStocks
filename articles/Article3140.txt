 Leading the News: Schering-Plough Profit Plunges 71% --- U.S. Pharmaceuticals Sales Slipped by More Than Half With Claritin Patent Gone   By By Peter Landers, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2003  New Chief Executive Fred Hassan withdrew Schering-Plough's earlier predictions of a quick profit recovery and warned of possible job cuts as the company deals with the loss of patent protection on allergy-drug Claritin in the U.S.  Mr. Hassan named longtime lieutenant Carrie Cox to lead Schering-Plough's global pharmaceuticals business and said the company's key functions will be managed globally from headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J., rather than splitting U.S. and international operations, as currently. In the first quarter, 60% of Schering-Plough's pharmaceuticals sales came from outside the U.S.  The first-quarter results also underscored Schering-Plough's failure to establish Clarinex, an allergy drug launched in January 2002, as a successor in the prescription market to Claritin, which is now available over the counter at U.S. pharmacies for a fraction of its old price. Clarinex sales totaled $173 million world-wide, which was above the year-earlier first quarter but slightly below sales in the fourth quarter of 2002.
