 Schering-Plough Hepatitis C Treatment Is Cleared by FDA for Relapsed Patients   By By Natalie Hopkinson and Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1998  The FDA recommended that the drug combination, which manufacturer Schering-Plough Corp. markets as Rebetron, be used for chronic hepatitis C patients who have relapsed since using other therapies for the disease.  While Rebetron isn't a cure, clinical trials showed substantial progress after the six-month treatment. The tests showed the drug therapy reduced hepatitis C virus levels in 45% of patients, compared with 5% under previous treatments. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplants and kills 8,000 to 10,000 people each year.  The therapy is two-pronged: Patients take Rebetol pills, also known as ribavirin, and inject themselves with Schering-Plough's Intron A. ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. licenses ribavirin to Schering-Plough.
