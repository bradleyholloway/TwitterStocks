 The Reel Deal: Regal Move Gives Anschutz Big Movie Role   By By Paul M. Sherer and Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  Regal, Knoxville, Tenn., is the nation's largest theater chain, with 4,361 screens at 396 locations. Regal, United Artists and much of the rest of the theater industry fell into deep trouble during the past several years by borrowing too much money to build fancy new theaters. Regal's bank lenders last month blocked interest payments due to the company's bondholders, putting it in default on those bonds. The company has said it is considering filing a bankruptcy petition.  Mr. [Philip F. Anschutz] quietly bought up Regal's bank debt during the past several months, paying between 70 cents and 75 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. His Anschutz Corp. holds about 80% of the $350 million of loans, with Oaktree holding the balance. To preserve his anonymity, Salomon Smith Barney bought the Regal debt for Mr. Anschutz, just as it earlier did with the United Artists debt, according to market participants.  Regal was wrong on both counts. Other theater circuits, even smaller regional ones, were able to build new facilities just as fast as Regal, and they often beat Regal to the best locations. The result was an explosion of new movie theaters in the U.S. that resulted in an overbuilt industry. Compounding the problem, Regal and other chains haven't been able to close their old, now-obsolete theaters fast enough. With so many screens in operation all over the country, hopes of demanding better film terms from Hollywood also evaporated.
