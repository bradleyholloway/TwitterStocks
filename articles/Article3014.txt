 Local French Candidates Gloss Over Immigration --- Despite Turmoil Over Issue Across Europe, Men Have Few Answers in Sangatte   By By Charles Fleming, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2002  Jan Mohammad, a 16-year-old Afghan inmate of Sangatte since last September, recently broke his leg falling off a truck he had hoped would smuggle him through the Channel Tunnel to Britain. Asked what message he would like to deliver to political candidates like Messrs. [Bernard Deram] and [Jack Lang], he says: "France has no program for refugees. They should just let us go on to England."  Mr. Lang isn't a lot more helpful, although his delivery is more polished. "The Sangatte refugees need a global, coherent plan," he says, but declines to elaborate on what such a plan would entail. Mr. Lang evokes the idea of a Europeanwide police force, but stresses it is the responsibility of the British government to tighten up their immigration laws and render the country less attractive to immigrants.  For the people who live near the Sangatte camp, a large vacant warehouse on a hillside above the small town, the refugees are the biggest issue on the local political agenda. Claude Devos, 54, who runs a local cafe, complains his only patrons are British and French reporters looking for local color about the refugee camp. He is happy to oblige their requests, displaying an electric cattle prod and a pistol equipped with rubber bullets that he keeps under the counter in case of trouble. (Most of the refugees are friendly, he adds, but he has had cause to chase some out of his cafe.)
