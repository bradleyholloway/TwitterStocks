 MarketWatch: Building Wealth, DRIP by DRIP . . .   By Farrell, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2005  Most people haven't heard about them for one simple reason -- companies can't advertise their DRIPs. Why? Securities and Exchange Commission rules won't let them say much about this fabulous way of saving and building wealth, except to existing shareholders. And because brokers, fund managers and other middlemen can't make any fees or commissions if you buy stocks directly from a company, you won't hear about the secret from these middlemen.  I can tell you: DRIPs are a great way to invest dollars, reinvest dividends, create a long-term savings plan and build a retirement portfolio of solid blue chips. And it's easy, says Charles Carlson, editor of the DRIP Investor newsletter and author of several books on investing including "Buying Stocks Without a Broker" and "No- Load Stocks" (another buzzword for DRIPs), both useful primers for new DRIP investors.  You have to love Mr. Carlson's eight-stock "starter" DRIP portfolio. This winner had an 18.8% average annual return for the 10 years through 2004, handily beating the 10.3% of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. If you invested $1,000 in each of the stocks for the 10 years -- a total of just $8,000 to start -- your portfolio would have grown to $45,046.
