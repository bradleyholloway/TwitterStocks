 In Surprise Move, Kraft's Lenny Resigns to Head Hershey   By By Shelly Branch and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2001  While Messrs. Kilts and [Douglas R. Conant] were considered ripe for the picking, Mr. [Rick H. Lenny] was thought by many to be firmly ensconced in his new position. The 49-year-old executive, who had spent 18 years at Kraft before joining Nabisco in 1998, was tapped by his old employer just three months ago as group vice president, Kraft Foods. In that role, he oversaw Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery -- one of four new North American business segments created in the wake of the Nabisco deal. Hershey didn't approach Mr. Lenny until after he had begun his latest assignment at Kraft in December, says one person close to the situation.  His contract negotiations entered their final stage last week. But Mr. Lenny declined to discuss the specifics of his pay package except to say, "When the shareholders of Hershey do well, I'll do well." He continued: "I feel very good about my total compensation package." Mr. [Kenneth L. Wolfe], the departing CEO, said Hershey would disclose Mr. Lenny's contract in its next proxy statement, due for release within a few days.  Mr. Lenny's willingness to relinquish his powerful job at Kraft -- and possibly burn some old bridges -- signaled an intense desire to run a publicly held company. "It wasn't tough to convince him [Mr. Lenny] once we explained the [Hershey] opportunity" because he yearned to run a publicly held company, said John Wood, a Spencer Stuart recruiter who handled the search. "He knows the categories these [Hershey] guys operate in."
