 Secret Summer Talks of Auto Makers In Sweden Lead to Bitter Words in Fall   By By Stephen D. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1989  An acrimonious public exchange between Swedish industrialist Peter Wallenberg and AB Volvo Chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar shed new light on prospects for a "Swedish solution" to Saab-Scania AB's car-division woes.  Both Saab-Scania and Volvo are in talks with major European auto concerns about cooperation or possible mergers. Saab-Scania is negotiating with Italy's Fiat S.p.A.; Volvo with France's Renault.  In a surprise statement Friday, Volvo's Mr. Gyllenhammar opened the door to a Volvo-Saab-Scania alliance and hinted at possible snags in the talks with Renault. The Volvo chief revealed that he offered to acquire Saab-Scania during private talks with Mr. Wallenberg this summer.
