 Before You Economize On Low-Cost Printers, Check Out These Two   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1999  With that in mind, I've been trying out two new color inkjet printers, both very good, both from top manufacturers. One machine, the new $299 Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 882C, is touted as "a premier home printer for professionals and families." It replaces the company's top-selling DeskJet 722C, which has been my favorite all-around printer.  The second new printer is the $449 Epson Stylus Color 900, a top-of-the-line business-oriented model that is billed by Epson as "the world's fastest color inkjet printer," yielding "laser-sharp text and amazing photo quality output."  You won't go wrong with either, but I'd only recommend the high-end Epson for home users and small businesses that need maximum speed in printing color graphics. For everyone else, I found the HP 882C to be a better choice, offering a more economical balance of high quality, convenience and very good speed-better text speed, in fact, than the Epson.
