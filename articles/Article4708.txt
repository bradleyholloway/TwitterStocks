 The Gallery: Paleolithic Art Comes Out of the Cave   By By Pam Lambert, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1986  Cave men have gotten a bum rap. For one thing, they rarely lived in caves. "If you're using fire for cooking, you want someplace with ventilation," says anthropologist Randall White. "In a cave you're likely to asphyxiate." For another, relations between the sexes appear to have been more than a stone's throw from what Mr. White describes as "the popular stereotype of hulking brutes dragging women around by their hair." An intriguing group of female statuettes known as Venus figurines demonstrates that, in at least one respect, paleolithic women were literally put on pedestals.  In fact, much of what we think we know about our prehistoric progenitors may be wrong. Over the past 20 years, new discoveries -- and fresh analyses of old ones -- have radically altered anthropologists' picture of the earliest "Homo sapiens sapiens." Now, instead of being relegated to the dust heap of history, dwellers of the late Ice Age (also called the Upper Paleolithic period) 35,000 to 10,000 years ago are being hailed as the mothers of human invention. The originators of language, art and music. Perhaps even the first of the world's great civilizations.  This revisionist case is currently being made by "Dark Caves, Bright Visions: Life in Ice Age Europe," a new exhibition at Manhattan's American Museum of Natural History; the institution's director, Thomas D. Nicholson, proudly calls the show "the original physical evidence of the evolution of the human spirit." On view in the museum's Gallery 3 through mid-January, the 240 art objects and artifacts constitute the largest collection of original late Ice Age relics ever exhibited in the U.S.
