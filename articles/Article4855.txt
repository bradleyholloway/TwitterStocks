 Small Advertising Agencies Often Resort To Gimmicks to Grab Attention of Clients   By By Brenton R. Schlender, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1988  During the recent competition for the advertising account of Microsoft Corp., Peter M. Hatt, a senior partner at Borders, Perrin & Norrander, thought he had hit upon a perfect way to show off one of his advertising agency's advantages -- and its creative talents to boot.  The stunt -- emphasizing the advantages of having an ad agency in the same state as the client -- didn't win Borders the account. But it did elicit a lot of laughs at Microsoft, as did other hijinks perpetrated by Borders and another firm competing for the $14 million job. The competition once again showed that agencies like Borders, small in size but not in nerve, go all out when vying for a big account.  During these visits, Borders and another regional firm that would make the final four, Martin/Williams Advertising Inc. of Minneapolis, let loose. When the Microsoft team showed up at Martin/Williams, agency officials asked them to sit as judges in a "Bill Gates Look-Alike Contest" in honor of Microsoft's owlish-looking founder and chairman. All 115 Martin/Williams employees donned tousled, dishwater-blond wigs, horn-rimmed glasses and baggy sweatshirts.
