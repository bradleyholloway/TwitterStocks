 A New Alternative to Monthly Minutes --- Cellphone Companies Push Prepaid Calling Cards, But Are They a Better Deal?   By By Ruth Simon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2002  Prepaid calling plans, in which customers buy a limited amount of phone time that is tracked via computer, were originally marketed to people with poor credit. But they are now gaining wider acceptance among people with far bigger pocketbooks. Indeed, at a time when wireless companies are finding it harder and harder to attract new customers, the plans have become a growth engine for the industry. Last year, 12% of cellphone customers used a prepaid or other spending-limit plan, and that figure could more than double by 2006, according to Yankee Group, a Boston-based technology-consulting firm.  Other wireless companies are also beefing up their services and marketing efforts. Cingular Wireless is rolling out voicemail, three-way calling, text messaging, games and other special features to its prepaid customers. Verizon Wireless is marketing its FreeUp prepaid program in the front of its phone stores, instead of hiding it in the back where prepaid plans were once sold. Cincinnati Bell, a third of whose wireless customers are on prepaid plans, uses a team of 10 to 15 high- school and college students to promote those services at basketball games, concerts and other special events.
