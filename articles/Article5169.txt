 Plane Passengers Will See Boom In Number of In-Flight TV Ads   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1990  Japan Air Lines recently introduced in-flight ads on its screens for the first time, and Delta Air Lines soon may follow suit. TWA is putting sponsored newscasts on additional flights, while British Airways is permitting six minutes of commercials per hour on its entertainment programs -- twice as many as five years ago. Advertisers now spend roughly $15 million a year on in-flight TV ads, 50% more than in 1987, industry executives estimate.  The individual screens also will come with a plethora of advertising messages (except during first-run films), as cash-strapped carriers scramble to pay for systems that can cost $1 million per aircraft. First-class and business-class passengers on JAL's New York-to-Tokyo run began watching in-seat television last month, along with commercials that included spots for Martell cognac. American Airlines will install individual screens for first-class travelers starting later this month. The carrier already has lined up sponsors for several of its 15 different videotaped programs.  Airvision, a U.S. unit of Dutch electronics giant Phillips N.V., yesterday announced that Mexicana Airlines will install Airvision's six-channel TV sets for all passengers starting Dec. 15. Similar personal-video systems are planned by next spring at KLM, British Airways and Northwest Airlines. "All the main airlines will be flying something {like this} in first class" within two to three years, says Mark Horton, British Airways' media services manager.
