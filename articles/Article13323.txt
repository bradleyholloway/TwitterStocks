 Can SpiceJet Break Through?; Travel Boom Might Help Indian Carrier's Pummeled Shares   By Eric Bellman and Binny Sabharwal, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2006  Shares of SpiceJet, like those of other Indian carriers, have had bad times in 2006, having fallen 44% this year. Yesterday, SpiceJet shares were at 46.10 rupees (96 U.S. cents), down from 82.45 at the beginning of the year. This is despite a general rally in Indian shares and increased investor interest in the country.  SpiceJet is dealing with the problems better than competitors, some analysts say, by focusing on the most profitable routes. Instead of spreading its wings all across the country, like low-budget competitor Air Deccan -- a unit of listed Deccan Aviation Ltd. -- SpiceJet is providing as many flights as it can on high-density routes between India's biggest cities.  According to Edelweiss Securities, SpiceJet is expected to report a net loss of 276 million rupees ($6 million) in the current fiscal year ending March 31, but it should be able to turn a profit of 875 million rupees in the following 12 months. That, Edelweiss Securities says, would give SpiceJet a price/earnings ratio of around eight for its next fiscal year, well below the forecast average of more than 15 for airlines globally.
