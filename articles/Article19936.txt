 Phone Rollout Flattens Comcast's Net; Subscriber Losses, Spending Drive Down Stock Price 5%; A Strong Demand for Digital   By Grant, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2005  Investors also expressed some disappointment that Comcast didn't make more progress in rolling out its new phone service that uses Internet technology. The service, which has been launched in 21 markets, added only 46,000 new subscribers in the quarter. But Comcast officials noted that the company has started to add phone subscribers at a much faster pace now that more markets have begun to introduce the service. Phone subscribers totaled 105,000 at the end of October, a spokeswoman said. Executives predicted that they will hit their target of 200,000 to 250,000 new phone subscribers by the end of the year.  Comcast is hoping to increase revenue and earnings through a wide range of technology initiatives. Comcast executives declined to comment on recent reports that Comcast may work with Google Inc. in a bid for America Online. But they noted that Comcast has the largest high-speed Internet business in the U.S., with 8.1 million subscribers, and that the company has barely tapped that business for advertising revenue.
