 Journal Exchange -- The Informed Reader: Insights and Items of Interest From Other Sources   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2007  Are American soldiers modeling themselves after Jack Bauer, the ruthless antiterrorism agent on the Fox TV series "24"? The U.S. military is increasingly worried that the popular show's use of torture as an essential tactic to fight terrorists is having a toxic effect on the training of real-life soldiers, Jane Mayer reports. But the show's creator insists he serves as a valuable conservative counterpoint to Hollywood's entrenched liberalism.  Last fall, Gen. [Patrick Finnegan] went to Los Angeles to voice his concerns with the creative team of "24." Absent from that meeting was Joel Surnow, the series' co-creator and executive producer. Mr. Surnow, whose political leanings Ms. Mayer traces to his facing financial difficulties in his childhood and in his early career, contributes money to conservative causes and feels the image of Sen. Joseph McCarthy has been unfairly maligned. Discussing the military's complaints about "24," he says, "They say torture doesn't work. But I don't believe that."  For now, Mr. [Tom Vilsack] is hoping that Iowans' pride in one of their own, coupled with the appeal of politics -- he advocates cutting off funding for the Iraq war, and he has aggressively championed his state's role in ethanol production -- will carry him forward. "I'm not a rock star," he tells a gathering of potential voters. "But I'm rock solid."
