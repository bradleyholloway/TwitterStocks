 Scandal-Filled Year Takes Toll on Companies' Good Names --- Johnson & Johnson Keeps Lead, GE Slips in Reputation Ranking; Public Says, `Tell Us the Truth'   By By Ronald Alsop, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2003  Johnson & Johnson was clearly the exception. Accounting fraud, greedy CEOs and plummeting stock prices conspired to hurt most companies' reputation scores. Of the 46 companies ranked both this year and last, only six received notably higher reputation scores this time, while 21 had significantly lower ratings. Even General Electric Co. slid to 20th place from 12th. Publicity about the lavish retirement package for Jack Welch, GE's former chief executive, seemed to taint the company's reputation. Several respondents criticized executive compensation at GE, with one urging it to "stop treating executives like royalty."  Big gainers included United Parcel Service Inc. and Home Depot Inc., both showing strong improvement in customer-service ratings. Bridgestone Corp. moved up to No. 55, after spending two years mired in last place because of the serious accidents blamed on its Firestone tires. "Firestone seems to have finally admitted the problem," says John Strom, a retiree in Victorville, Calif., who was "scared to death" while riding in his son's car when a Firestone tire blew out a few years ago. "Now it's up to [them] to tell it straight: What did you do to correct the situation? We consumers aren't tire engineers, but we know BS when it's offered."  This year, Harris constructed a separate "corporate sincerity" ranking, composed of six characteristics -- sincere, honest, informative, deceptive, secretive and self-serving. Harley-Davidson ranked first in the index, with Johnson & Johnson in second place. People perceived Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom as least credible.
