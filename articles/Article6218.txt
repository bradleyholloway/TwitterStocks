 Cathay Pacific Senior Pilots Accept Cuts In Pay, Averting a Threatened Strike   By By Christina Mungan and Erik Guyot, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1999  Cathay Pacific Airways senior pilots agreed to accept pay cuts, ending a dispute with management half a day before it threatened to trigger this city's first strike in six years.  Some 600 pilots, who had been threatened with losing their jobs, agreed yesterday to pay cuts of 7% to 22% in the next three years in exchange for stock options. That is good news for Asia's third-largest airline, which analysts estimate has been forfeiting US$2 million to US$4 million of revenue a day since pilots began saying two weeks ago that they were too stressed to fly. The news came as a relief to many others in Hong Kong.  The face-off between the airline and its pilots had its roots in the very bedrock of Hong Kong's economy -- the local currency's peg to the U.S. dollar. This arrangement has protected Hong Kong from the sharp currency depreciations that have hit most other Asian economies. But it also means that Hong Kong cannot benefit from exports made cheaper by a weak currency. Instead, local businesses must maintain their competitiveness by slashing expenses such as rents or, as in the case of Cathay, wages.
