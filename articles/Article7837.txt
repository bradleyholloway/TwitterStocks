 Your money matters: when to 'go long?' that's the question   By Jasen, Georgette; Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1989  Money managers, financial planners, and economists have differing views on whether or not short-term interest rates will continue to go up. Professional investors use a number of indicators to decide whether or not an interest-rate turn is soon to occur. These indicators include: 1) the average maturity on money fund maturities; 2) the amount of cash in bond funds; 3) the price of gold; 4) the prime rate; and 5) the yield curve. According to such investors, an inverted yield curve indicates that the rise in interest rates has not peaked.
