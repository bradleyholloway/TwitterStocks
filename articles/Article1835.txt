 Ericsson Abandons Computer Division, Selling It to Nokia   By By Marcus W. Brauchli and Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1988  Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson abandoned its troubled foray into computers, agreeing to sell most of its loss-plagued data-systems division to Finland's Oy Nokia for an undisclosed sum.  The transaction will create the Nordic area's biggest computer maker, to be known as Nokia Data. It will have annual sales of about seven billion Swedish kronor ($1.16 billion), the companies said.  At the time, Ericsson had hoped to create a computer-industry powerhouse by mixing telecommunications and computing technology. But analysts say it fell down in executing its strategy, fielding more products and opening more sales offices around the world than its slow-growing computer sales could support. In the process, the venture's red ink mounted and Ericsson was forced to pump cash into the division to keep it afloat.
