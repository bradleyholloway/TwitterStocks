 Health Outlays Are Moderating, New Data Show --- Medicare, Medicaid to Cost Less Than Projections Over Next Five Years   By By Hilary Stout and David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1994  Federal officials now calculate that the government's two big budget-busting health programs, Medicare and Medicaid, will cost about $45 billion less over the next five fiscal years than they projected in the fall. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics says medical-care prices rose just 5.4% last year, the smallest increase since 1973 (though still twice the overall inflation rate).  While the tempering of heath spending is welcome, some people in the Clinton administration and on Capitol Hill worry that it could take away some of the political momentum for overhauling the U.S. health system. Already, some Republicans are arguing that there isn't a "health crisis" in the U.S. -- a view echoed last weekend by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee.
