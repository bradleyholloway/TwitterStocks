 Reckson Rejects Icahn's Late Bid; Stockholders Will Be Asked To Approve Planned Merger With SL Green Realty   By Forsyth, Jennifer S, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2006  The development is a victory for SL Green, of New York, another REIT, whose efforts to acquire Reckson hit a kink on Nov. 16 when Mr. [Carl Icahn] and his then-partner, New York real-estate developer Harry Macklowe, jumped in with a surprise proposal. The partners announced they were willing to pay $4.6 billion for Reckson, trumping SL Green's $4.1 billion bid from Aug. 3. Reckson's directors began discussions with Messrs. Macklowe and Icahn, and last week it looked as if SL Green was losing ground when Mack-Cali Realty Corp., an Edison, N.J., REIT, was allowed to join the Icahn-Macklowe partnership. But over the weekend Mack-Cali and Mr. Macklowe both opted out, leaving Mr. Icahn alone in the bidding.  Both SL Green and Reckson had publicly questioned whether Mr. Icahn's bid was credible. But Mr. Icahn said he wanted to buy Reckson because it is a good value -- not to prove doubters wrong. "I didn't appreciate them saying that, but I don't make investment decisions of this magnitude based on just being a little miffed," he said.  To bolster his bid, Mr. Icahn had offered to immediately deposit $613 million into escrow if Reckson accepted his merger proposal, his letter states. That would have covered the $99.8 million breakup fee that would be owed to SL Green if Reckson went with another bidder. It also would have included a "good faith deposit" by Mr. Icahn that would be forfeited to Reckson if American Real Estate Partners didn't meet its merger-agreement obligations.
