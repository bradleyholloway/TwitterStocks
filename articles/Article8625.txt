 U.S. bond sale to test Japan's policy overhaul   By Vogelstein, Fred, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1995  Japan's five-year economic downturn has put a sharp dent in the country's appetite for US Treasurys. But the Treasury's massive auctions of US debt during the week of Aug 7, 1995 will be the first major test of Japan's accounting overhaul, which should make it less risky for Japanese investors to invest abroad. In Aug 4, 1995 trading, the Treasury's 30-year bond rose about 1/4 point to 108 29/32. The bond's yield fell to 6.9% from 6.92%.
