How can you help your preschooler develop basic skills? Dr. Nancy K. Naron, Director of Project EARLY in Chicago, suggests that you can have your child do the seemingly simple activities below to help improve language and motor skills and memory. Language Skills  Name actual objects in the house or apartment and then put each into a sentence that describes its characteristics, such as, ''The ball is smooth,'' or, ''The button is bumpy.'' Act out movements of such words as run, walk, hop. Play riddle games such as ''I am thinking of something you can throw and catch'' -a ball. Repeat short sentences as in, ''John is in his room.'' Play detective by hiding an object and then asking questions about its location.  Motor Skills  Trace a line or a picture using thin paper or stencil. Use a shoestring to lace a cardboard square with the holes punched out. Play jacks to develop eye-hand coordination. Place a ladder along the ground and then walk forward and backward between the rungs. Hop, skip and jump to music. Catch a bouncing ball or beanbag. Memory  Look for objects missing in a picture. Walk into a room, observe the surroundings and then with eyes closed describe the room. Use playing cards to match cards with similar numbers, shapes, colors or letters. Learn nursery rhymes, poems and finger plays. Perform several tasks in a directed sequence, for example, draw a square on a paper and then put the orange on the desk.  Dr. Naron also offers these guidelines for parents working with young children: Base word games on a child's interest in animals, for example, or sports. Work first with objects, then pictures, and then use merely words. Begin with a child's strengths - for example, if the child is weak in oral language skills use visual cues such as pictures to identify words or objects. ''Praise, praise, praise a child's efforts.''
