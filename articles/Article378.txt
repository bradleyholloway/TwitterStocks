 Leading the News: Medicare Benefit Covering Drugs Nears Passage   By Laurie McGinley, David Rogers and Sarah Lueck, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2003  Some Republicans, meanwhile, want to revisit the issue to more effectively contain federal health spending. And Democrats already vow they will reopen the legislation soon to try, among other things, to make the drug benefit more generous. "There will be efforts to go back over and over again until the commitment we made to seniors over the last 30 years is upheld," Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said yesterday. Sen. [Edward Kennedy] added: "We're going to fight it next year. We're going to fight it in the congressional elections and in presidential elections as well."  "This thing is always a work in progress," said Medicare chief Tom Scully. "Unfortunately, it's a politicized issue. That's why it wasn't done sooner. The fact is, a lot of this is politics, not substance. You've got conservative Republicans who don't like it, you've got liberal Democrats who don't like it."  Democrats are planning their own aggressive oversight of the program's implementation. "We believe that Medicare has turned out to be a universal, highly efficient delivery system," said Rep. George Miller, a California Democrat. "And now you've planted a series of landmines to destroy that system."
