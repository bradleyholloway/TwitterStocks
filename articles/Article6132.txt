 Gore Plans to Outline Principles to Guide World-Wide Expansion of the Internet   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1998  Vice President Al Gore, building on a speech he delivered four years ago to guide the growth of the Internet, plans to outline five principles that could help shape the global information highway's expansion.  In an address today before government regulators and private businessmen from more than 180 countries, Mr. Gore also will continue his romance with the fast-growing high-tech industry -- a historically apolitical group that could become a powerful ally in the 2000 presidential campaign. Already, Mr. Gore has developed a close-knit advisory group of high-tech executives, nicknamed the "Gore-techs," who could well become financial backers.
