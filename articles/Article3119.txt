 War, Terrorism Fears Pressure Yields --- Traders Awaiting Iraq News Give Short Shrift to Reports That Economy Is Gaining   By By Michael Mackenzie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2003  In very uncertain times, investors often shift funds into short-maturity Treasurys, which are viewed as a haven.

The tone of the market was being dictated in part by technical levels being triggered in the futures market and a squeezing of positions in Treasurys that involved going "short," or selling borrowed securities in anticipation of price declines.  Traders said concern about geopolitical developments will likely keep Treasurys well-supported. Many said they would closely monitor a report by the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector today regarding Iraq's disarmament effort.
