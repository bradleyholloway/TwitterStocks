 Recorder Reveals Plane Problems Before Crash   By By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1998  HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- Canadian investigators said the data recorder from Swissair Flight 111 showed the doomed plane had been experiencing a growing number of problems with its electronic systems during the minutes leading to the crash.  Investigators didn't identify which systems were having problems, and an analysis of the flight data is still under way at a Canadian government lab in Ottawa. Experts are assessing the pattern of the problems, hoping to trace them to a common area of the aircraft.  Only a small portion of the plane's wreckage has been recovered and because of bad weather last evening, divers still hadn't brought up the flight's cockpit voice recorder, which could provide important information on what the pilots experienced as conditions on the flight deteriorated.
