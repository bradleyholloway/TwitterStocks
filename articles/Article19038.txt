 Indonesian Students Protest Reported Delays in Reform   By By Richard Borsuk, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1998  Early Saturday, Mr. Hartono and Information Minister Alwi Dahlan were summoned by Mr. Suharto, who in March was unanimously given a seventh five-year term by a special assembly, most of whose members he appointed. Mr. Alwi told the palace press corps that the media had misunderstood Friday's comments and that rather than oppose reform for another five years, the 76-year-old president "has opened the door" for it. An Indonesian political analyst called Saturday's government comments a "clumsy" move to try to undo damage done by that day's headlines. He asserted that the limited reforms ministers brought up Saturday -- such as in how legislators are chosen -- would be welcomed in good economic times, but in the current bad economic times, "students won't accept such a slow pace of change."
