 Bond Market's Weeklong Rally Falters, Partly Because of Jitters Over Dollar   By By Edward P. Foldessy and Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1985  But after the markets closed late yesterday, the Fed disclosed that its policymaking committee "chose not to move aggressively" to tighten credit conditions. That came in a letter dated yesterday from Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to Walter Fauntroy, delegate from Washington, D.C., and chairman of the House subcommittee on domestic monetary policy. The Fed's policy-setting arm, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, met Monday and Tuesday to plan credit strategy for the weeks ahead.  Mr. Volcker's letter strengthened the conviction of several analysts that the Fed hasn't altered its policy at all. They argue that the Fed doesn't have any reason to tighten credit conditions because they say the economy appears to be expanding at a moderate clip with inflation remaining subdued. Others, though, cautioned that Mr. Volcker's wording left open the possibility that the Fed chose to authorize a very slight credit-tightening move.  Prices of actively traded Treasury bonds rose early in the day but later slumped, winding up the session with small declines. Trading in Treasury issues was described as moderate, but the municipal and corporate markets were hit by another flood of new issues.
