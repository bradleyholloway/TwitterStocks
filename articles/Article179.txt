TOKYO, Nov. 16â€” The first bottles of 1989 Beaujolais nouveau hit the streets of Tokyo at exactly 1:31 A.M. today, aboard a fleet of racing cars that tore in from Narita Airport. The city was waiting. By 1:32, hundreds of young Japanese computer programmers and stock traders and office workers grabbed for newly filled glasses, ignoring the river of wine that spilled across dinner jackets and dresses as bartenders ripped corks from scores of bottles.  Still, the revelers in Roppongi, a nightlife center in Tokyo, failed to grab the record for first consumption. That title may have gone to passengers aboard a Japan Railways luxury train who paid $140 each for a ride to Narita, where barrels of Beaujolais were loaded aboard a few minutes past midnight and poured by French hostesses on a painless trip back to the city. Or maybe to partygoers in hotels near the airport, which weeks ago sold out for the occasion.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
