 SmartMoney: When to Dump That Fund   By Black, Pamela, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2003  Step two: Check out the fund manager's performance. Is the manager doing a bad job, or is the investment style just temporarily out of favor? One way to judge is to compare the manager's performance with others in the fund category -- growth, say, or small cap. (You can see at a glance how your fund stacks up against its peers by going to www.smartmoney.com/fundsnapshots and punching in the fund's ticker symbol.)  If you're selling fund shares in a taxable portfolio, it pays to think about tax-loss harvesting. By selling losers, you can "harvest" capital losses to offset a corresponding amount of capital gains. That's because even if there are no gains in a down year, capital losses from fund sales can be carried over from year to year indefinitely -- and $3,000 of them can be used each year to offset tax on ordinary income.  Better yet, by selling a losing fund and reinvesting in a similar fund, you get tax losses without changing your asset allocation. Don't try this by reinvesting in the same fund within 30 days, because then a tax loss wouldn't be allowed by the IRS. In any sell decision (just as in any buy), you'll also want to consider transaction costs and sales charges, or "loads."
