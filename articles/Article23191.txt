 India Market Needs a Breather; Stock Prices May Be Higher Than Potential Earnings Warrant   By Bellman, Eric, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2004  Still, cautious analysts and institutional investors warn that the rally might have taken prices higher than their potential earnings warrant. "Strong liquidity and positive sentiment may be overriding short-term fundamentals," says Sanjiv Duggal, chief investment officer at HSBC Asset Management India in Bombay. "For the medium term, we are not really concerned, but for the short term, people have made a lot of money and may take some off the table."  "More and more global fund managers are realizing the long-term potential of India," says Sivasubramaniam K.N., senior portfolio manager of equity at Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India). "This has led to increased inflows even in times of volatility."  The index is up 40% from postelection lows, reflecting growing confidence that economic liberalization and growth will stay on track. "When the elections happened, there was a hiccup" in stock prices, Mr. Duggal of HSBC says. "But we have had a very positive view [of India] since June."
