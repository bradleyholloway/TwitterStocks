WASHINGTON, Aug. 2â€” Dr. Donald Rollie Payne, husband of Jessica Savitch, an NBC News correspondent, was found dead in the couple's home today, the police said.  Lieut. W.O. Richie said that Dr. Payne, 45 years old, had apparently committed suicide by hanging.  ''Foul play is not suspected,'' he said.  Emergency personnel were unable to revive Dr. Payne, who was discovered unconscious by his wife in the basement of their home. The exact cause of death will be determined by an autopsy, Lieutenant Richie said.  Roberta Spring, a family friend in Washington, said that the couple had married earlier this year. According to Miss Spring, Dr. Payne was born in Dallas and grew up in Wichita Falls, Tex.  He graduated from Rice University in 1958 and received a medical degree at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas in 1962.  Dr. Payne served his medical internship at the University of Iowa and his residency at Georgetown University Medical Center in obstetrics and gynecology. He has been in private practice in obstetrics and gynecology since 1970.  Dr. Payne is survived by a former wife, Dee Anderson Payne, four sons and a sister.
