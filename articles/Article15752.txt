Lucio A. Noto, Mobil's chairman and chief executive officer, stands to receive a healthy payout, although such packages often are renegotiated. Based on the most current financial documents, Mr. Noto would receive a $1.9 million severance payment if control changes, plus another $6.6 million in possible payouts and bonuses.
