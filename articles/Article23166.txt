 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2004  Naturally, this would be especially good news for taxpayers in states without a broad-based state income tax, such as Texas, Florida and Washington state. "I want that passed," says Rep. George Nethercutt, a Republican from Washington state who is running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat. "It's a good provision," he says.  The new legislation also extends relief from the dreaded AMT. The $58,000 exemption amount for married couples will be extended for another year. Without action, it would have fallen to $45,000 next year. The $40,250 exemption amount for singles extends for another year, instead of dropping to $33,750. If Congress hadn't extended these exemption amounts, many more middle-income families would be pulled into the AMT. This system, whose origins date back decades, was designed to make sure high-income people couldn't avoid paying federal income tax. About 3.4 million people will be hit by the AMT this year, up from one million in 1998.
