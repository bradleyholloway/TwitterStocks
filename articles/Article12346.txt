 It's Sad but True: Good Times Are Bad For Real Slackers --- In Their Last Redoubt, Seattle, Even the Economy Won't Let Them Off the Hook   By By Christina Duff, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1998  Catching some live music at the Crocodile Cafe one weeknight, D.J. (John) Thompson, 29 years old, shakes his bleached-blond head as people file out before 11 p.m. "Slaves to the grind," says Mr. Thompson who, when he bothers to work, is a coffee-stand vendor.  Their six-month romance is a window into the near-death of slacker culture. Ms. (Annie) Rath was once smitten with Mr. Thompson's attentiveness. He wrote her songs. Never rushed off to make a phone call. Reminded her of simpler days, when she worked in a bookstore.  She realizes now, she says, that Mr. Thompson basically has nothing better to do. While she works 10-hour days and picks up the tab for their veggie burritos, he strums a guitar in the house he shares with four guys. "He needs to move on," Ms. Rath says gently.
