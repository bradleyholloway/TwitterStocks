 TV: Spoiling the Broth --- Mr. Bourdain Hews to Type As the Macho Food Maven; Thank Goodness for `Nigella'   By By Tunku Varadarajan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2002  Mr. [Anthony Bourdain] is a New York chef whose controversial first book, "Kitchen Confidential," made him something of a foodies' celebrity. In this new program, he takes viewers on a journey to his favorite sources of food around the world. Each episode kicks off with a breathless and pretentious preface: "I'm leaving New York City and hope to have a few epiphanies around the world." So full of it is Mr. Bourdain, in fact, that he brags to his viewers that "I'm looking for extremes of emotions and experience. I'll try everything, I'll risk everything, I have nothing to lose."  For a more restful food-watching experience than that provided by Mr. Bourdain, viewers are indeed fortunate that they can turn to "Nigella Bites" on the E! and Style channels, a show which made its debut in November and which will conclude in March. Featuring Nigella Lawson, who is feted in her native Britain as a kind of household divinity, the show is neither innovative nor especially informative. Instead, it is restful and civilized. Whereas Mr. Bourdain is leather-skinned and menacing to look at -- with a pierced left ear, a bad haircut and a tattooed arm -- Ms. Lawson is "harmonious, calm, voluptuous and creamy," to use words that she used herself on an episode I watched, to describe a sauce she was preparing to pour on her linguine. Her Oxbridge vocabulary and buttery English Home Counties accent is also in attractive contrast to Mr. Bourdain's rasping diction.
