 PC Sales Soared 19.4% in Europe In First Quarter --- Big Brand Names Were Winners, but Slowdown Looms, Analysts Say   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1993  In the first quarter, sales of personal computers in Europe jumped 19.4% to 2.5 million machines -- nearly matching the 20.8% rise of the fourth quarter, according to a quarterly Wall Street Journal Europe/Dataquest Europe Ltd. report on the European PC market. Because of a year-old price war, however, average PC prices fell, and total industry revenue slipped 3.3% to $5.1 billion.  The most impressive gains were made by Compaq Computer Corp., which nearly doubled its share of PC shipments to 10.7% from 5.6% a year earlier, and increased its share of industry revenue to 13.7% from 8.9%. Other big players, such as International Business Machines Corp., Dell Computer Corp. and Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, also gained share, whereas Apple Computer Inc. and Commodore International Ltd. lost ground. The top 10 PC makers boosted their combined share of shipments to 60.5% from 50.7%.  "Everybody was positively surprised by the strong growth in the first quarter," says Andreas Barth, head of Compaq's European operations. As in the fourth quarter, lower PC prices spurred demand despite weak European economies. In the past 12 months, average PC prices in Europe have plummeted -- by nearly 70% on some models. But the pace of price-cutting is already slowing. While that may help the industry increase its profits, it could also spell the end of the six-month-old buying spree, industry executives say.
