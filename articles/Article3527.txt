 Your Money Matters (A Special Report): Nest Egg; Forget the Mattress: As interest rates rise, managing your cash is no longer an afterthought   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  "People have really felt that cash was an afterthought," says Peter Crane, vice president and managing editor of iMoneyNet, a Westborough, Mass., financial-information company. "But that's starting to change." Savvy investors are "realizing they can gain a lot by putting more thought into where they're keeping it."  Investors willing to tie up their cash for several months at a time might consider six-month or one-year CDs, which currently yield up to around 4.9%. Jumbo CDs, which typically require deposits of $95,000 or more, can provide even better returns. CDs with a term of one year or less "are very attractive" right now because their yields are better than shorter-term options but they don't require investors to lock up their money for too long, says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com, a financial-information site based in North Palm Beach, Fla., and owned by Bankrate Inc.  Toronto-Dominion Bank's TDWaterhouse unit -- which is being acquired by Ameritrade Holding Corp. -- automatically puts investors' money in sweep accounts with annual yields of 0.25% to 2.78%, depending on the investor's total balance with the brokerage firm. But customers with total balances over $100,000 can elect to have their money swept to one of five money-market funds, a couple with yields over 3%, a spokesman says.
