 Ford Nears Jaguar, Land Rover Sale   By Jason Singer in London and Stephen Power in Frankfurt, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2007  A spokesman for Ford said the company continues to expect "a resolution" of Jaguar's and Land Rover's fates "by the end of this year or the beginning of next." He added that the auto maker is "committed" to keeping its labor leaders informed as the sale unfolds.  Jaguar and Land Rover together employ about 16,000 people, mainly in the United Kingdom. Ford acquired Jaguar for $2.5 billion in 1989 and Land Rover for $2.75 billion in 2000. The company has put them up for sale as it seeks to re-focus on its core Ford brand and its troubled North American business. Ford posted losses of $12.6 billion last year, and has seen its sales tumble this year amid a broader downturn in auto sales.  With Jaguar and Land Rover burdened by unfavorable exchange rates, a relatively high cost base in the U.K. and potentially expensive new environmental regulations, some analysts are skeptical of Ford's ability to command a hefty price for them. Merrill Lynch & Co. estimated earlier this year that the combined sale of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands would raise $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
