 Media: Liberty Cancels Offer to Acquire Home Shopping   By By Johnnie L. Roberts and Mark Robichaux, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1993  The withdrawal, announced over the weekend, raises some uncertainty about the future control of the television home shopping industry. For now, it dashes any prospect of a merger between Home Shopping, based in Clearwater, Fla., and the only other dominant service, QVC Network Inc. Because Liberty also owns a major stake in QVC, Wall Street analysts had speculated that Liberty would eventually merge the two services, even though Liberty said it had no plans to do so.  Liberty, the spinoff of cable-television giant Tele-Communications Inc., had proposed a cash-and-stock transaction to buy the roughly 75 million Home Shopping shares it doesn't already own. Liberty already had voting control of Home Shopping, having acquired a supervoting class of Home Shopping stock in December from chairman Roy Speer for $160 million in cash and Liberty stock.  But shortly after Liberty's proposal to the remaining shareholders, Home Shopping was hit by allegations concerning Mr. Speer and former president Lowell Paxson. Among the allegations was that Messrs. Speer and Paxson paid a third executive $12 million in Home Shopping shares after he threatened to expose their alleged secret interests in some Home Shopping suppliers.
