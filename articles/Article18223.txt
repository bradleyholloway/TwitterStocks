 Jurors Don't Mind Duty, Survey Finds   By By Stephanie Simon and Amy Dockser Marcus, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1991  The survey also defied conventional wisdom in finding that people with college educations and responsible jobs do serve on juries in large numbers, even though many attempt to evade jury duty. Jurors with full-time jobs paying more than $25,000 a year, and with at least one year of college education, fill about half the seats in jury boxes across the U.S., the study found.  Although 40% of the jurors said jury duty interfered with their work, only 15% called their service a financial burden. About 85% of employers, who also were surveyed, said they paid full-time workers their salaries during jury duty, and most also allowed jurors to keep their daily jurors' pay, which ranged from $6 to $50.  In recent years, many courts have tried to increase compliance with jury-duty summonses by assigning potential jurors to two-week telephone standby and asking them to call the court each morning to see whether they will be needed. Most jurors surveyed said they liked the system, which frees them from unproductive waits in court. Employers who were surveyed, however, resented the unpredictability of of the system: They said they needed to know in advance whether to hire a temporary replacement for workers summoned to jury duty.
