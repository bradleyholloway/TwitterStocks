 Cisco to Push Internet Products for Use at Home   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1999  The San Jose, Calif., maker of computer networking gear is using this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to highlight a new cable modem device, as well as an expansion of its longstanding relationship with AT&T Corp. to help develop a national cable modem network.
