 Dividend News: First City Bancorp. Of Texas Reduces Payout to 15 Cents   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 9, 1985  First City Bancorp. of Texas, reeling from the slump in energy lending and hurt by an increase in nonperforming real estate loans, more than halved its common stock dividend.  Analysts, noting that First City had one of the highest-yielding stocks on Wall Street, weren't surprised by the move. "People weren't buying it for the yield because they knew the yield wasn't secure," said Joseph LaManna, an analyst with Duff & Phelps, Chicago. "The company wasn't really earning the dividend and in the long run it is prudent to cut it." Analysts said that First City seemed to be following the lead of BankAmerica Corp., another troubled lender that slashed its dividend 47% earlier this week.
