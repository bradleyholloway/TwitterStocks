 Ogilvy Wins Race For Microsoft Job After Tough Fight   By By Kathleen A. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1988  Microsoft Corp. awarded its $14 million advertising account to Ogilvy & Mather's office here, marking the end of a closely watched two-month contest and a signficant coup for the agency.  The account of the Redmond, Wash.-based computer-software maker was given up last year by Keye/Donna/Pearlstein in Los Angeles, widely viewed as one of the city's hottest agencies. Paul Keye, chairman, said the agency resigned because Microsoft executives "insisted on controlling the creation of the advertising past what we felt was their competence."  Ogilvy & Mather is a division of Ogilvy Group Inc., a New York-based ad agency holding company whose units include Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and Scali, McCabe Sloves.
