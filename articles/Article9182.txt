 Bush Backers' Consistency Is Questioned On Ads Criticizing McCain's Record   By By David Rogers and Phil Kuntz, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2000  The contradiction raises questions about the credibility of the $2.5 million advertising campaign against Mr. [John] McCain, and whether it is intended to advance an environmental cause or simply to damage the maverick Republican in his fight with Texas Gov. George W. Bush.  The ads ran in New York, Ohio and California, three of the most important states in today's primaries. The ads were bought by Sam [Wyly] and Charles Wyly, both backers of Mr. Bush and longtime major GOP donors and fund-raisers, through a group they created last week, Republicans for Clean Air. The Wylys have made their money in computer businesses, but more recently have invested heavily in a company that sells electricity produced using renewable sources.  The spots portray Mr. McCain as an enemy of clean air because he "voted against solar and renewable energy" and "that means more use of coal-burning plants that pollute our air." In supporting material to back the ad, the sponsors pointed to a vote Mr. McCain cast against increased funding for renewable energy research on June 16. Most of the Republican senators backed by the two brothers and their immediate relatives in recent years voted precisely as Mr. McCain did on the same roll call.
