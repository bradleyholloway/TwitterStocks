 Tastings: For the Hidden Animal in Us --- Big and Bitter, Italy's Amarone Is a Real Bear of a Wine; `Not for the Fain of Heart'   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2002  AMARONE is a wine that inspires passion among its advocates, people like Anthony Baccaro, a private investor from Glen Mills, Pa. "I have to admit outright that [Amarone] is my favorite wine," he wrote us. "I like a wine with a really big, explosive taste. Amarone can be intense beyond description. But they are not for the faint of heart." Amarone, he added, "is for the hidden animal within us."  Every wine store we visited had at least two Amarones, but few had many more than that. Amarone ages beautifully, but the vintages we saw almost everywhere were fairly recent. It's hard to find the same Amarone twice, though one label we see often is Masi, which is a good thing because we have found that producer reliable through the years. And we're sorry to tell you that the days of $4.50 Amarone are over. We had to set our price limit at $50 to get a big enough collection for a tasting. Most cost above $35, and many are above $40, although the prices vary quite a bit. We saw the same vintage of Masi in three stores for $30, $31.99 and $45.05. It appears $36 is average for that bottle.  By the way, if you happen to see a wine that says Ripassa or Ripasso or even Ripasso Method on the label, give it a try. It's Valpolicella that is pumped up by mixing it with the dried grape skins from the Amarone. Some people call it "junior Amarone." While these are a far cry from Amarone, lacking the intensity and remarkable bite, they are quite good and very distinctive, especially for the price, which is often around $13 or $14.
