 Digits   The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1998  INTUIT INC., which had a major role in a past Microsoft Corp. battle with the government, is likely to make a cameo appearance in the next one. The Justice Department, in an antitrust complaint it is expected to file today, is likely to refer to the terms of last July's deal between Microsoft and the publisher of the popular Quicken financial software. Under it, Intuit stopped distributing Netscape Communication Corp.'s Navigator Web browser and agreed to integrate Microsoft's Internet Explorer into Quicken. In return, Microsoft agreed to promote Quicken's Web site on Microsoft's "Active Desktop" feature.  The Justice Department has focused on ways in which Microsoft used its Windows market dominance to boost the market for Internet Explorer. Intuit executives said at the time that one reason for the switch from Netscape was that Internet Explorer's technology was easier to integrate into Quicken. Still, Microsoft may have gotten the better part of the deal: the Active Desktop channels haven't generated much interest. All of the companies declined to comment.  Other Internet merchants, who have signed up for prominent placement on Web sites reached through PCs, believe that TV connections will eventually become a major consumer phenomenon and that now is the time to cut deals to reach couch potatoes. TCI, which has already signed up BankAmerica Corp. and Intuit Inc. to provide home banking, is being courted by sellers of many types of products and services. "The next target is the set-top box," says Jon Diamond, vice chairman of on-line music specialist N2K Inc. TCI isn't commenting, and an Amazon spokeswoman says "we have nothing to report about TCI now."
