 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  A: See an IRS press release dated Jan. 8, 2007, or an earlier IRS pronouncement dated Dec. 22, 2006. They're both on the IRS Web site (irs.gov) under "Newsroom."  On Jan. 8, the IRS said it won't be able to process returns until Feb. 3 for people who claim any of these three so-called extender provisions. IRS officials picked Feb. 3 because that will give them enough time to update the agency's systems to reflect the recent tax- law changes "without disrupting other operations tied to the tax- filing season."  The good news is that "the vast majority" of taxpayers won't be affected by these late changes and "will not notice any difference as they start filing tax returns this month," IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson says.
