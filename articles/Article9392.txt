 Bankruptcy Judge For Enron Case Is Stickler for Detail   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2001  Weil apparently doesn't have any hard feelings. "We have appeared before this judge for several years, and he has been brilliant, experienced, practical and fair. You can't ask for anything more," said Martin Bienenstock, a Weil partner and Enron's chief bankruptcy counsel in the case. "Leslie Fay was a unique situation." Currently, for example, the firm is representing Sunbeam Corp. in its Chapter 11 proceeding before Judge [Arthur Gonzalez].  In the Leslie Fay case, Mr. Gonzalez, as the U.S. trustee, objected that Weil had failed to disclose a conflict in connection with its role advising a board audit committee that investigated accounting problems that drove Leslie Fay into bankruptcy in 1993. Mr. Gonzalez initially recommended that Weil be disqualified from any further work in the case and sanctioned.
