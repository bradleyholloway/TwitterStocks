 Maxim Restates Latest Year's Results; Loss Was a Much Larger $19.6 Million   By By James R. Hagerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1999  The Kennesaw, Ga., floor-covering retailer said it had a loss for the year of $19.6 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with net income of $15.4 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Earlier, Maxim reported a loss of $3 million, or 17 cents a share, for the latest year. Maxim restated its revenue for the year to $664.4 million, down from the previously reported $684.4 million. In the prior year, revenue was $365.1 million.  Meanwhile, Maxim warned that it expects its financial statements for the year to include a note from auditors questioning "the company's ability to continue as a going concern." That question results from Maxim's previously disclosed default on the terms of a $95 million bond issue. Maxim said it inadvertently violated the terms by repurchasing more of its own stock than was allowed.
