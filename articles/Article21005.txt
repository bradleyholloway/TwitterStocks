 Schools Are Given A Positive Review By Education Chief   By By Joe Davidson, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1986  Education Secretary William Bennett released a personally written report that found elementary education "in pretty good shape" but called increased parental involvement "the single best way" to bring about improvement.  The 80-page report, entitled "First Lessons," was released with unusual fanfare by the Education Department. With television camera crews in tow, Mr. Bennett talked to first graders and gave a copy of the report to the principal at Amidon Elementary School in Washington.  Arnold Fege, director of governmental relations for the national Parent-Teacher Association, agreed with the need for greater parental involvement but was generally critical of the report. He said it wasn't based on "solid educational research" and called it a self-promotion effort by Mr. Bennett. The secretary's push for increased parental school selection, Mr. Fege said, was a veiled call for vouchers and tuition tax credits, which would hurt public education and not provide equitable choices for parents.
