 Politics & Economics: Indian Officials Name 2 Suspects In the Mumbai Train Bombings   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  Officials said earlier yesterday that the prime suspect in Tuesday's bombings is Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based Islamic militant group that operates in Kashmir, the Himalayan region at the center of the long-running India-Pakistan conflict.  The Indian Foreign Ministry demanded Wednesday that Pakistan dismantle all terrorist networks on land it controls -- but fell short of directly accusing it of the attacks. In an interview with the Associated Press in Washington, Pakistan's foreign minister dismissed suggestions that his country bore responsibility for the attacks.
