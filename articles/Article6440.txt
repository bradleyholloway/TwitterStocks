 The Politics of Demonization   The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 2001  In fact, that characterization, like what is now being done to [Ted Olson], is the demonization of perfectly innocent associations. The "Arkansas Project" was an exercise of the American Spectator's First Amendment rights, something much of the major media seems to think applies only to itself. Note, incidentally, that [Sidney Blumenthal] just called off a libel case he brought against cyber-columnist Matt Drudge, paying Mr. Drudge $2,500. The Blumenthal lawsuit was cut from the same cloth as the phony Arkansas Project flap -- an attempt to intimidate media critical of the Clintons. Mr. Blumenthal subpoenaed numerous journalists from his redoubt in the White House. Back then the Post would report on a White House effort to undermine one of its own Whitewater reporters.  Now along comes David Brock, a former anti-[Bill Clinton] Spectator writer who decided somewhere along the road that he really belonged in the Clinton camp and is about to publish a book lambasting conservative opponents of Mr. Clinton. Lo, David Brock has come forward to attest to Senator [Patrick Leahy] and the Washington Post that Mr. Olson was directly involved in the Arkansas Project, and therefore has deceived the Judiciary Committee. His evidence is his accounts of Spectator dinners attended by Mr. Olson, or sometimes his wife, and an $8,000 check to Mr. Olson's law firm from the Spectator in 1995 for unspecified legal work.
