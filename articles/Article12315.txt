 Cisco Beats Forecasts on Surge in Revenue   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1998  Cisco Systems Inc. posted better-than-expected operating earnings as revenue jumped 33% in its latest quarter, the result of strong demand for all its major lines of computer-networking equipment.  For its fiscal third quarter ended April 25, Cisco's net income was $64.6 million, or six cents a diluted share, down 83% from $378.3 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. But excluding several one-time charges, profit was $483 million, or 45 cents a share, a penny more than analysts expected, according to First Call.  The company is the biggest player in the networking business, with a market position comparable to Intel Corp.'s in semiconductors and Microsoft Corp.'s in software. Analysts were looking for signs of continued momentum after Cisco beat second-quarter estimates. There had been fears that the company, along with competitors, was experiencing weaker demand in the early part of its third quarter.
