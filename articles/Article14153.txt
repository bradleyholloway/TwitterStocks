 Eight Months After Bhopal Gas Disaster, India Grapples With Long-Term Relief Bid   By By Matt Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1985  The official death toll was 1,754 people, although other estimates put it at 2,500. The methyl-isocyanate gas also seriously injured 60,000 people, doctors estimate. Like Mulchand, many of them are unskilled laborers. They still have trouble breathing and they aren't capable of resuming their jobs. One recent day Mulchand was sitting on his cart roasting a few ears of corn, while his 11-year-old son struggled to push the unwieldy load across a street.  In the wake of the Bhopal disaster, the government quickly mustered food and medical relief. Doctors still comb the city and many talk of staying for years. But the huge task of training and reemploying Bhopal's gas victims has yet to begin, and many fear it never will.  Eight months after the disaster, the government has thoroughly surveyed only about half of the 43,000 families believed to have been affected by the gas. "It isn't so much a question of villainy," says Mahesh Buch, who heads the Bhopal-based National Center for Human Settlements and Environment. "No one in government has given a thought to rehabilitation. They just don't know what needs to be done."
