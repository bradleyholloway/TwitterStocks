The weekend package at discount rates has become a feature of downtown hotels around the country. It may have originated decades ago in New York; at least the Convention and Visitors Bureau has been promoting such packages for years and for the last three years has been putting out a booklet listing many of the possibilities. Here are some samplings from the latest list.  (For each hotel in New York the initial rate given is the package rate for a double room for two nights on the weekend; the regular rates are for a double room for two nights during the week, with none of the package extras, and not including taxes. All packages are subject to change at the discretion of the hotel.)  Doral Park (Park Avenue at 38th Street, 212-687-7050): $150 including refrigerator in room, bottle of champagne, box of Godiva chocolates, a newspaper each morning and Continental breakfast in room; regularly $210.  Loews Drake (440 Park Avenue at 56th Street, 212-421-0900): $335 including cocktail, dinner at Wellington Grill, tickets for two to a Broadway show and gift of a crystal apple from Tiffany; regularly $230 to $320.  Plaza (Fifth Avenue at 59th Street, 212-759-3000): $360 including champagne and strawberries upon arrival, one American breakfast in room with gratuities, one dinner in Edwardian Room with wine and gratuities; regularly $200 to $420.  Of the city's three newest hotels only the Grand Hyatt (42d Street at Lexington Avenue, 212-883-1234) offers a weekend package. Its $126 one-night-only package includes a $30 credit toward food or drink at the hotel and taxes; a double room during the week is $165.  The entire list of hotels may be obtained free from the Convention and Visitors Bureau, Two Columbus Circle, New York 10019 (212-397-8200).  A sampling of weekend hotel packages in nine other cities that can be reached from New York by a flight of two and a half hours or less follows. It was compiled with the help of New York Times correspondents and local reporters who regularly contribute to The Times. Philadelphia  Philadelphians no longer wince at the old jokes, and people who make wisecracks suggesting anything dreary about this city merit only a pitying glance for their ignorance, reports William Robbins, a correspondent for The Times. You would sound pretty foolish now if you said you went to Philadelphia but found it closed, considering all its treasures. Worth seeing, of course, are Independence Hall, where the Continental Congress met and where the Declaration of Independence was signed; the nearby Liberty Bell; Elfreth's Alley, said to be the oldest continuously occupied street in the country, and Society Hill.  But there is more to Philadelphia. The Academy of Music (Broad and Locust streets) is one of the oldest grand opera houses in the country and the home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Opera Company of Philadelphia and the Philly Pops. Farther south on Broad Street is the Shubert Theater, where the Pennsylvania Ballet performs between mid-October and mid-March. There are also the restored Forrest Theater (1114 Walnut Street), which gets many top productions from Broadway, and the Walnut Street Theater, the oldest continuously operating theater in the country. And there is the Philadelphia Museum of Art; its collection gives precedence only to the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the National Gallery in Washington.  The city's restaurants are of a wide variety. Le Bec Fin is one of the country's most expensive restaurants and may be, as some critics say, the best. Excellent still is the Old Original Bookbinders, famed for its seafood, and the more recent Bookbinders Seafood House, a competitor run by the family that established the original that is, according to some critics, even better. Among at least 100 new restaurants there is the Commissary, a cafeteria-style place with offerings of exotic and haute cuisine.  Convenient to almost everything are three hotels. One is the renovated Bellevue Stratford (Broad and Walnut Streets, 215-893-1776), having taken back its name after a brief period as the Fairmont. The lobby gleams with mellowed marble walls and columns and the spacious guest rooms have marble baths, each with its own telephone. The Champagne Weekend is offered at $198, including tax and gratuities, a bottle of champagne on arrival Friday, a drink at the Hunt Bar, a complete breakfast in bed Saturday morning and a Sunday buffet brunch. The hotel also offers live entertainment at a 24-hour restaurant and 24-hour room service. Regular double rates are $80 to $100 a day but a special daily rate of $45 to $65 is being offered through March 15.  The Latham Hotel's (17th and Walnut Streets near Rittenhouse Square, 215-563-7474) weekend rate is $248 including a credit of $50 for Friday night dinner in Bogart's (the hotel's restaurant), a $15 credit for Saturday's breakfast or lunch at the Commissary (around the corner), a $50 credit for Saturday night's dinner at the Garden (a nearby restaurant), a $20 credit toward Sunday brunch in the hotel, a $30 gift certificate at Nan Duskin's (a women's clothing shop), a $10 gift certificate at Lawrence Wagner (a gourmet shop), Godiva chocolates, Sunday papers, fresh flowers and garage parking. Regular double rates are $70 to $85 a day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NEXT PAGE >
