 The Ego Investment Factor   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2003  From Washington, it's impossible to gauge how the war actually is going; perhaps the administration's optimism yesterday that Baghdad may fall imminently is justified. But war-zone dispatches from the most reliable journalists, such as Michael Gordon of the New York Times and Rick Atkinson of the Washington Post, plainly reveal the war's first two weeks have been more problematic than top planners envisioned. Mr. Rumsfeld's straight-faced insistence that there was no conflict over the force structure has been directly contradicted by military sources. They complain the Pentagon command insisted upon going in with too small a force, failing to wait for critical units like the Fourth Infantry Mechanized division, dismissing the import of more armor and artillery, and the possibility of fierce resistance.  Mr. [Joe Galloway] has reported U.S. commanders' -- past and present -- unhappiness with some of the plans of the defense chief and his civilian advisers; at first, they say, the Pentagon high command only wanted to commit 60,000 U.S. troops. This is an argument that won't be resolved until the war's outcome, but of this there is no doubt: Mr. Rumsfeld and his chief advisers confidently believed a smaller, faster, more lethal operation would render moot the Powell Doctrine of reliance on massive force, basically Republican theology since the Vietnam quagmire.
