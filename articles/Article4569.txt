 Thrift Regulators Could Further Raise Bailout Debt Apart From U.S. Budget   By By Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1989  Thrift regulators are considering yet another device to raise funds for the savings-and-loan bailout without officially adding to the federal budget deficit.  Ever since President Bush presented his thrift rescue package in February, one of the government's major objectives has been to avoid the appearance of adding to the deficit. The thrift legislation Mr. Bush signed in August partially accomplished the task by establishing the Resolution Funding Corp., an "off-budget" agency that will issue $30 billion in bonds over two years to help cover the cost of liquidating insolvent institutions. Because the bonds will be backed by savings-and-loan funds, rather than by the government, they won't be counted as adding to government debt.  "No matter which approach we take, funding for (Resolution Trust) will be very complicated," William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told a Senate hearing last week. The FDIC staff is handling the bulk of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s work.
