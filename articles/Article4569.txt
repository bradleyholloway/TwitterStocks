 Rupert Murdoch Is Said to Be in Talks To Buy Rest of Fox Film From Partner   By By Bill Abrams and Michael Cieply, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1985  A contract of sale is being drawn up, sources familiar with the negotiations say, but an executive familiar with Mr. Davis's affairs said odds that a final agreement would be reached were "50-50 or less." Mr. Murdoch acquired a half-interest in the Hollywood film studio last March for $250 million, and the price for Mr. Davis's half is believed to be between $300 million and $350 million. In addition, Mr. Davis would retain some of Fox's extensive real estate interests.  Although Mr. Murdoch has been eager to buy the entire studio from the start, Mr. Davis has wavered in his desire to sell. The Denver-based oilman has made Los Angeles his second home and has become a fixture in the Hollywood social scene. Mr. Davis's family also is known to have reservations about the sale of his Fox stake. His 34-year-old son John is a production executive at the studio.  Mr. Diller, who has extensive experience in the television business as a programming executive at American Broadcasting Cos. and in Paramount's successful television-production business, has been closely involved in planning strategy for the Metromedia television stations. When Mr. Davis, who initially was to be Mr. Murdoch's partner in the Metromedia transaction, later decided against participating in the transaction, it no longer was in Mr. Davis's interest to have Mr. Diller spend time on the Metromedia stations.
