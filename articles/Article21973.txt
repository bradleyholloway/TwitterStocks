 Remember the Losses -- and Lessons -- of Somalia   By By Larry E. Joyce, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1994  On this day in 1906 my father was born in dusty Segoville, Texas. And on the same day in 1993, my son, Army Ranger Sgt. James Casey Joyce, was killed on a dusty street in Mogadishu, Somalia, at the age of 24. Today, I'll call my dad and wish him well on his 88th birthday. And, at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, I'll observe the first anniversary of my family's most tragic loss.  The ceremony was arranged by No Greater Love, a nonprofit group that was formed to honor the memory of those who gave their lives in defense of this nation or who were victims of terrorism. Today, they will remember the 44 members of the armed forces who died in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope. My family will be there, along with the families of the other American casualties of Somalia.  That is why the No Greater Love ceremony today is so important. Already the media's memory of Somalia is beginning to fade. Reporters and columnists continually refer to President Clinton's foreign policy misadventures and few mention Somalia. Three days before American troops were sent into Haiti, the New York Times reported that the anticipated invasion would be the first time Mr. Clinton had ordered American soldiers into ground combat.
