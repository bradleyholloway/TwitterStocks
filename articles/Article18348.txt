 Unpaid Child Labor, Compliments of Maryland   By Laband, David N, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1992  David N. Laband discusses requirements passed by Maryland's state Board of Education that will require public high school students to perform community service to fulfill graduation requirements. He says the requirement is not only a violation of child labor laws that are vigorously applied to the private sector, but that it is also a de facto violation of federal minimum wage statutes.
