 Viacom Nears Pact With Blockbuster On Paramount Bid   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1994  Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. made progress toward an agreement for Blockbuster to pump additional funds into an increased Viacom bid for Paramount Communications Inc., according to people familiar with the situation.  Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone and his advisers were said to be scrambling to arrange the new financing, with more than one option under consideration for structuring any new Blockbuster investment. But Viacom and Blockbuster were also described as "getting close" to an agreement after meeting with Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga over the past two days.  Viacom has until midnight tomorrow to top a $9.9 billion, $82.40-a-share offer for Paramount by QVC Network Inc. If Viacom doesn't boost its $9.3 billion, $77.84-a-share bid, and holders of 51% of Paramount shares submit their stock to QVC, that would end the protracted bidding war for Paramount, the publishing and entertainment giant.
