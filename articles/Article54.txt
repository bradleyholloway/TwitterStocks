 Adding Glitz to the Menu at McDonald's   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1987  It's 7:30 on a Sunday morning and Angelo Lencioni is polishing the walls of his McDonald's. Later, if he takes a break from mopping, pouring coffee refills and slinging burgers, he might huddle in his cramped office to sketch out a new decor or dream up ideas to improve service.  Combining the zeal of a second-generation restaurateur with the time-tested formulas of the nation's largest fast-food chain, Mr. Lencioni has built the busiest McDonald's in America.  Operations like Mr. Lencioni's, one of 7,300 McDonald's Corp. outlets nationwide, are a major reason the big chain continues to post record earnings while results of its competitors sag. Located north of Chicago's Loop, several blocks from the exclusive "Gold Coast" shopping strip, his 24-hour restaurant draws an estimated 320,000 visitors a month -- roughly five times the average for the chain's outlets. His sales last year exceeded $4.5 million -- more than three times the average, and 4 1/2 times the average for Burger King, the No. 2 hamburger chain owned by Pillsbury Co.
