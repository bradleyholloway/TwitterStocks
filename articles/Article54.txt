To the Editor:  Sweeping claims are being made that an educational revolution via the computer is on the horizon, and some educators go so far as to see the computer replacing books in classrooms and libraries.  Yet you noted in an Aug. 6 news article, ''In the Land of Sony, the Abacus Is Still King,'' that the survival of the abacus is not merely a matter of tradition. It rests in the belief that it provides a conceptual sense of mathematics that is lacking in electronic calculators.  Predictions of the demise of the book as a result of electronic technology remind me of similar predictions that accompanied other inventions.  The demise of the stenographer was predicted with the invention of the Dictaphone, the demise of the theater with the invention of the talking motion picture, the demise of the concert hall with the invention of the phonograph, the demise of the motion picture with the invention of television and the demise of handwriting with the invention of the typewriter (albeit the ball-point pen has led to some very poor scripts).  Aside from being easily portable and readable, in comparison to an electronic screen, and aside from its physical attractiveness, the book (with its pages) conveys a tactile quality and pleasure that no push-button circuitry can provide - even when one is only browsing or skimming through a book, or making marginal notations (preferably only on the pages of one's own books). Moreover, the book can be read while sitting, standing or lying down. It can even grace the walls of a home library or den when it is not being read. The physical attributes of a book and its printed pages are far more personal than the computer screen or printout, as indicated by the common practice of writing one's name in a book to designate valued ownership, or of writing an inscription when presenting a book as a gift to a friend. But the book is more than this. Its physical quality is intimately linked to the very evolution of human language and thought. We would do well to heed the advice of Norbert Wiener, a pioneer of the new technology, who wrote in one of his books, ''Render unto man the things which are man's and unto the computer the things which are the computer's.'' Incidentally, if one should want to learn how to program or use a computer, there are many good books on the subject.
