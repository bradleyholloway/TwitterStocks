 Lipper Overhauls Mutual-Fund Categories   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1998  Lipper Inc., one of the standard bearers of mutual-fund performance measurement, says it is finally overhauling what was seen by critics as its increasingly obsolete classification system for U.S. stock funds. The new fund categorizations are expected to be fully in place by the end of the second quarter next year, and the changes could have broad implications for fund managers.  Under Lipper's old categories, stock funds were classified in vague groupings such as growth-and-income funds and capital-appreciation funds, based on the investment objectives as described in prospectuses. Under the new system, however, funds will be examined using market-capitalization and risk criteria. The funds will then be classified under headings that bear some similarity to those that Morningstar Inc., a Lipper rival, introduced in November 1996.  For fund managers, the change means many will have to rejigger their portfolios if they want to be in certain specific categories. A small-capitalization stock-fund manager, for instance, must be careful that the stocks in the portfolio don't grow so much that the fund is reclassified as a mid-cap fund.
