 PURSUITS; Food & Drink -- How's Your Drink? Mystery in a Tall Glass   By Felten, Eric, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2007  [Beach] had good reason to protect his secret formula. "Trader Vic" was just plain Victor Bergeron until he saw Donn's joint in Hollywood. He promptly remade his own Oakland restaurant -- a hunting lodge- themed place called Hinky Dink's -- into a South Seas idyll. Trader Vic served Zombies, and in 1940 Stetson offered a straw hat it named the Zombie, "with a bow to Trader Vic." But the most egregious usurper was a Broadway publicist, producer and nightclub impresario named Monte Proser, who promoted himself as "the father of the Zombie."  There aren't many places to go these days to get a Zombie; even fewer with a clue how to make one, thanks to Beach's secrecy. But Jeff "Beachbum" Berry has devoted years to tracking down the original recipes from the Beachcomber and other Polynesian-themed bars. The Zombie has been his white whale. In "Intoxica!" (2002) Mr. Berry printed what he believed to be Beach's original recipe, only to discover later two new primary sources for a competing recipe. In his newest book on Tiki drinks, "Sippin' Safari," Mr. Berry allows that this one -- made with lime, pineapple and grapefruit juices, falernum (a tropical syrup), pastis, cinnamon syrup and grenadine (not to mention the rums) -- may be the most authentic. But I prefer the version he had previously championed. Made with lime, lemon and pineapple juices, passion fruit syrup, sugar, Angostura and rum, it is a Zombie that Mr. Berry suspects Donn himself simplified to be made at home. Not only is it manageable, but it tastes better, too.
