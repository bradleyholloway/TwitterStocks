WASHINGTON, Feb. 18â€” Following are excerpts from a document issued by the White House today as a ''fact sheet'' on President Reagan's economic program:  Summary: The program calls for fundamental reduction in the role of the Federal Government, including:  - Reductions in personal tax rates and business taxes;  - Spending cuts and other measures to reduce the budget deficit;  - Reductions in the burden and the intrusion of Federal regulations; and  - A new commitment to a stable monetary policy. New Actions Announced Today  In his address to a joint session of the Congress and in detailed economic and budget reform messages, the President described his proposals and plans for:  - The first round of major reductions in Federal spending. Additional spending reductions will be presented on March 10, 1981, in a full revision of the 1982 budget. Together, these proposals will reduce F.Y. 1982 spending $41.4 billion below current policy levels. They will also result in $2.0 billion in user fees and $5.7 billion in off-budget cuts for a total of $49.1 in savings.  - A major reduction in individual and business taxes.  - Additional measures to reduce the cost, burden and intrusion of government regulations. The President's proposals are summarized below. Budget Outlook With The President's Budget Savings and Tax Reduction Program  Official budget estimates showing the President's tax and budget savings proposals will be provided in the March 10 revision of the 1982 budget. The table below provides a preliminary estimate of the renewed fiscal balance when the President's measures are fully implemented: 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 lings 654.7 695.5 733.1 771.6 844.0 912.1 plan 600.2 650.5 710.2 772.1 850.9 942.1 rplus 54.5 45.0 22.9 0.5 6.9 29.9 .N.P Outlays 23.0 21.8 20.4 19.3 19.2 19.0 Receipts 21.1 20.4 19.7 19.3 19.3 19.6 New Priorities  Achieving the President's budget savings targets will require an end to the proliferation of new Federal programs and a reversal of the trend toward greater Federal roles in economic and social programs. The President's program stresses two overriding priorities:  - Sufficient budget resources must be provided to rebuild the nation's defense capacities;  - The social safety net of income security measures erected in the 1930's to protect the elderly (including cost of living protection for the elderly), unemployed and poor, as well as veterans, must be maintained.  Beyond these two priorities, all other Federal programs are being subjected to thorough scrutiny and widespread reduction. Major Features of the President's Program  - A $41.4 billion reduction in F.Y. 82 outlays compared to the current policy base, together with $2.0 billion in user charges and $5.7 billion in off-budget outlay reductions for a total of $49.1 billion in fiscal savings.  - A dramatic downward shift in Federal spending growth rates, bringing the 16 percent trend of the recent period to about 7 percent over the next several fiscal years.  - A steady reduction in the Federal deficit, resulting in a balanced budget in 1984 and modest surpluses thereafter.  - The first comprehensive proposal in more than a decade to overhaul the nation's overgrown $350 billion entitlements system. Proposed revisions of food stamp, extended unemployment benefits, trade adjustment assistance, student loans, various secondary Social Security benefits, Medicaid and other entitlement programs would save $9.4 billion in fiscal year 1982, with savings growing to $18.9 billion by F.Y. 86.  - Substantial cutbacks or actual elimination of nonessential or ineffective Federal programs, including CETA public service jobs, Amtrak, energy technology commercialization programs, impact aid and Federal support for the arts.  - Proposed consolidation of nearly 100 narrow categorical grant programs into a few flexible block grants for state and local support of education, health and social services. Savings by F.Y. 1983 would exceed $4 billion.  - Sharp reductions in direct Federal subisidies for synfuels development, Export-Import Bank activities and the dairy industry, along with a substantial stretch-out of funding for highways, airports, sewage treatment plants and water projects.  - Increased user fees for barge operators, airways system users and commercial and recreational vessels. A Stronger National Defense within Restrained Overall Spending Levels  The President has decided that budget resources must be devoted to national defense to improve and sustain the readiness of U.S. forces and to increase their ability to deter and, should deterrence fail, to prevail in response to aggression againt U.S. interests. The defense budget has been reviewed closely to achieve cost savings. Part of the defense growth will be financed by the savings that result from increased efficiency and reductions in travel and other marginal activities.  The President has also decided that Federal spending growth must be held to 6 percent in F.Y. 82 and that similar restraint must be exercised in future years. To provide $7.2 billion extra for defense in 1982, overall spending levels must be reduced by $41.4 billion or by 6 percent from the current policy base. 1 2 NEXT PAGE >
