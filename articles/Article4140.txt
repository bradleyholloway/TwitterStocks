 Ruckus in Greenville, S.C., Underscores Power Of Billboard Industry as Potent Business Lobby   By By Christopher Conte, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Last spring, a large billboard touting a local gasoline dealer sprouted near a scenic hill on the outskirts of this quiet southern city. Depicting an oncoming car that appeared to be bursting through the sign, it declared: "COMING ON STRONG IN GREENVILLE."  Too strong, according to many residents. The sign's sudden intrusion on the landscape stirred a sharp public outcry, leading the city council to consider an ordinance that would outlaw 85 of Greenville's 95 billboards. Sign companies fought back aggressively, launching radio and television ads, orchestrating grass-roots pressure on council members and threatening a long and costly lawsuit.  Overwhelmed, the city council approved only a watered-down ordinance. No signs will be forced down, although it will be harder to erect new ones. "I've never seen anybody go to such lengths to influence us," says Knox White, the council member who proposed the original ordinance.
