 Pound Hits Low Against Mark; Dollar Declines --- Closely Watched Threshold Of 2.00 German Marks Is Pierced by U.S. Unit --- Charles W. Stevens Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1986  Underlying sterling's weakness is Britain's beleaguered economy and the uncertain future of the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, traders said. Speculators in sterling also are nervous about the outcome of this week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Although Britain isn't an OPEC member, the success or failure of the cartel in extending production limits will affect the United Kingdom's export revenue from North Sea crude.  Many traders believe the pound will suffer a heavy blow if OPEC ministers aren't able to agree on further production limits. On the other hand, sentiment toward sterling is so bearish that a new OPEC agreement limiting oil output would offer little aid to the British currency. "It's kind of a stacked deck," said Richard Witten, vice president of foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Co., New York.
