 Tidewater Accused Of 'Entrenchment' In Jacobs Group Suit --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1985  A group led by investor Irwin L. Jacobs sued Tidewater Inc., alleging that the company's management has devised an "entrenchment scheme" aimed at blocking takeover offers.  The suit by the Jacobs group, whose $415 million takeover proposal was rejected by Tidewater last January, claims that proposed changes in Tidewater's bylaws and a recent acquisition involving Tidewater stock represent "a course of self-dealing and the wasting of corporate assets," by the company's management. New Orleans-based Tidewater, which operates a 310-vessel fleet of ships servicing the offshore oil industry, said it couldn't comment on the suit because it hadn't seen it.
