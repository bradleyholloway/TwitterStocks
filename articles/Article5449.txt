 Lady luck helps local economies   By Fahrenkopf, Frank J, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1997  Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, takes issue with "a seriously flawed, widely discredited study conducted on behalf of a devoted anti-gaming group" which was quoted as fact in the Jan 15, 1997 article "Gambling Craze: Bustling Casinos, Quieter Realities." Fahrenkopf says the gaming industry provides more than a million good-paying jobs and contributes to local and state economies.
