 Merger Planned By Columbia Hospital Corp. --- Galen Health Care Inc. Agrees to Stock Swap Valued at $3.2 Billion   By By Robert Tomsho and Gabriella Stern, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1993  Columbia Hospital Corp. and Galen Health Care Inc. said they will merge in a $3.2 billion stock swap that will create one of the nation's largest health-care providers.  With political pressure mounting on health-care companies to cut costs, the merger gives small but fast-growing Columbia an opportunity to test its aggressive cost-cutting strategies in a host of new urban markets now served by the much larger Galen. Galen was spun off from Humana Inc. in February when shareholders voted to split Humana into a healthplan concern and a hospital company.  Under the merger's terms, Galen shareholders will receive 0.775 shares of Columbia stock for each Galen share held. Galen currently has about 160 million shares outstanding. Columbia, with about 26 million common shares outstanding, said it would issue 123 million new shares to complete the transaction, which remains subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies.
