 Intense bidding is expected for MCorp's ailing units   By Allen, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1989  Bidding on MCorp's (Dallas) three failed banks has become intense, with Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank having the most suitors. NCNB Corp. (Charlotte, NC) has shown great interest in Bridge Bank, but the FDIC already was NCNB's partner in acquiring First RepublicBank Corp. (Dallas) last year. Further collaboration might be politically dangerous. First City Bancorp (Houston) and Chemical Banking Corp.'s Texas Commerce Bancshares unit are also in contention since the acquisition would put either of them in a league with NCNB. Less likely suitors include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Banc One Corporation (Columbus, OH) and Bank of Scotland.
