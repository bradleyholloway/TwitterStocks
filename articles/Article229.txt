DOVER, England, Aug. 13â€” John Erikson, a 26-year-old physical education teacher from Chicago, has become the first person to swim the English Channel three times nonstop, the Channel Swimming Association said today.  Erikson emerged from the 21-mile waterway between England and France just before midnight Wednesday on the French side.  His total time for the three stages was 38 hours 27 minutes, according to reports received by the association in Dover.  ''We are absolutely in awe of it because we didn't think it could be done,'' Audrey Scott, an association spokesman said. He entered the water in near-perfect conditions Tuesday morning at Dover's Shakespeare Beach. Exact details of his three stages were not immediately available.  Mrs. Scott said she believed Erikson did the first crossing to Cap Gris Nez on the French coast in 10 hours 10 minutes, then swam back to land at Folkestone near Dover in about 13 hours.  Swimmers are allowed 10 minutes on the beach between stages. Mrs. Scott said she heard from a boatman that Erikson was sustained on his swim by doses of baby food, given to him by the crew of the observer boat.  Two other swimmers attempted three-way swims and failed.
