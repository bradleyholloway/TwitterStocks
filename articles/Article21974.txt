 New Study Says Europe's Wages Not Inflexible --- Research Punches Big Holes In Long-Held Theories For Controlling Unions   By By Dana Milbank, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1994  The study, based on statistical research in 15 countries by two British economists, contradicts what politicians, business leaders and economists have come to view as gospel: That European wages are more rigid than their American and Japanese counterparts, that is, labor costs remain high even when unemployment rises. Some economists believe the findings could be used to discredit policies aimed at weakening unions, loosening labor regulations and cutting unemployment benefits.  But the economists, David G. Blanchflower of Dartmouth College and Andrew J. Oswald of the London School of Economics, found that wage flexibility shows little variation across the globe. Using a computer analysis of government wage and employment data for millions of workers, they found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, Western Europe's wages are no more rigid than U.S. or Asian wages. In each country, they discovered, a doubling of the local unemployment rate (within a region or industry) is associated with a drop in pay of roughly 10%.  Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, called the similarity in wage rigidity "a remarkable finding. If what they find is confirmed, it will be an astonishing discovery." Mr. Burtless said even liberal economists like himself had come to the conclusion that Europe's wage inflexibility was to blame for making its unemployment worse than America's or Japan's. Its high unionization, generous unemployment insurance and laws making it costly to fire workers had been blamed for keeping labor costs artificially high and spurring unemployment.
