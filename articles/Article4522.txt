 World Bank's 'Modest' Report on Africa Isn't What Some Leaders Want to Hear   By By Lee Lescaze, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1989  At the beginning of this decade, many African leaders got angry at foreigners who portrayed Africa as a continent in crisis. Now that Africa's economic crisis is accepted wisdom, some African leaders are upset by a World Bank report that says things mightn't be as bad as they seem.  The dispute raises anew old questions of who has the best prescriptions for Africa, with the bank claiming success for the methods it approves and bank critics charging that the bank is trying to block consideration of alternate strategies. If the dispute lingers, it may confuse Africans and aid-donor countries alike and thus hinder efforts to promote economic growth.  This seeming good news immediately was called cynical by Adebayo Adedeji, executive secretary of the Economic Commission on Africa. In a counterreport, the ECA charges the alleged turnaround "merely reflects a turnaround in the perception of some observers." The core of the ECA criticism is that the World Bank is trying to pat itself on the back and thereby advance a claim that the only way to do things is the World Bank's way.
