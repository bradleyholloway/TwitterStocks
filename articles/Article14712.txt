 Chartwell, Set to Receive Two Seats On Avon Board, Is Said to Boost Stake   By By David B. Hilder, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1990  Chartwell Associates L.P., an investor group that has been promised two seats on the board of Avon Products Inc., increased its stake in Avon to more than 15% from 10%, according to Wall Street executives.  Chartwell, whose investors include Mary Kay Corp., the Fisher real estate family of New York and oil heir Gordon Getty, yesterday bought a three-million share block of Avon stock that was assembled by Salomon Brothers Inc., the executives said. Salomon said the shares were purchased for $36 each, but it didn't identify the buyer or sellers.  Chartwell has been buying Avon shares recently, the Wall Street executives said, and is expected to file information with the Securities and Exchange Commission soon, indicating that it owns an Avon stake of as much as 16%.
