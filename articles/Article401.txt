 Wal-Mart Tire Workers Get Set for Union Vote in Colorado   By Zimmerman, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2005  Wal-Mart, of Bentonville, Ark., has 1.2 million U.S. workers, making it the country's biggest private employer. Organizing even a tiny piece of Wal-Mart would be a huge coup for the labor movement, which sees the retailer as emblematic of labor's declining fortunes in the U.S.  Christi Gallagher, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said any hiring of additional employees "has been part of the normal course of business," adding that "It is no secret that the union has a longstanding campaign against Wal-Mart, and it's no surprise they're targeting us there, but time and time again, our employees have rejected the union."  If the workers succeed in unionizing, it would mark only the second time that a union has gained a foothold in a U.S. outlet. In the only other such instance, meat cutters at a Texas Wal-Mart voted in 2000 to be represented by a union. Weeks later, Wal-Mart eliminated that job category companywide, a move the retailer said was unrelated to the vote.
