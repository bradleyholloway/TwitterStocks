 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1993  BELL ATLANTIC'S BID to acquire cable giant Tele-Communications and its Liberty Media spinoff could vault the Baby Bell to the forefront of shaping an interactive video world for the 21st century. The deal, which could spur a flurry of other mergers and alliances, has a value of $11.8 billion, and could rise to over $20 billion. The role of TCI's John Malone in the Bell deal throws into uncertainty the cast of players in the battle for Paramount.  Merger activity this year is more than double the 1992 pace and is being spurred by high stock prices and rapid change in several industries. The latest deals are being funded largely by stocks, unlike the 1980s buyouts, which were financed by junk bonds.  Woolworth plans to close 970 of its stores in the U.S. and Canada, eliminate 13,000 jobs and take a $480 million charge in its third quarter. The moves, which mark Woolworth's second major cutback in two years, represent about 10% of the company's stores world-wide and 9% of its work force. ---
