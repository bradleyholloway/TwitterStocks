 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Are Utilities Humdrum? Hardly; High-Wattage Performance Lights Up Mundane Group, But Even Bulls Are Cautious   By Salisbury, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2006  Electric-utility companies have seen "extraordinary gains," says Standard & Poor's stock analyst Justin McCann, who is neutral on the sector. "At a minimum, they are not undervalued," he says.  "People are getting paid more for capacity in the ground," she says. Building new plants isn't easy. "The permitting and siting alone -- never mind the construction -- can take six to eight years."  As to whether the sector will continue its strong performance, she is "positive on the group," but notes that utilities have been advancing for some time. "I'm not saying it's going to race up," she says.
