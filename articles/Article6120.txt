 Minimizing Mutual-Fund Taxes Amid Tumult --- Investors Who Choose Best Way For Valuing the Cost of Shares Can Expect a Saner IRS Bill   By By Ruth Simon, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1998  Even with the sharp drop in fund values during recent weeks, many investors still have gains that would become taxable if they sold. Like stocks, profits on the sale of mutual-fund shares held for more than a year are taxed at a top capital-gains rate of 20%. Gains on shares held for 12 months or less are taxed as short-term capital gains, at ordinary income rates of as much as 39.6%.  Things get more complicated after that. The reason? Fund investors typically hold shares that have been bought at a variety of prices and a variety of times, either directly or through reinvested capital gains and dividends. As a result, the investor's tax bill will depend on which shares are sold.  Sometimes, the most convenient method will result in a higher tax bill. But alternative methods that could result in a lower tax bill require that investors keep detailed records of fund purchases and reinvestments. Investors who don't have these records will need to get them from their brokers or fund companies. In some cases, however, the information may not be available or the investor may have to pay for back statements.
