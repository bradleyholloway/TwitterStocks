 World Wire   By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1991  Eurosport, the pan-European satellite sports channel, went off the air after its European Broadcasters' Union contract ended. Its demise follows the European Community Commission's February outlawing of Eurosport's exclusive rights to sports events covered by the EBU.  Eurosport went on the air in February 1989, financed through British Sky Broadcasting, which is owned by the News International unit of Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based News Corp.  The EC ruling followed a complaint by Eurosport's main rival in Europe, Screensport, controlled by the British book and stationery giant W.H. Smith. Screensport argued it couldn't get a market foothold. The 39-member EBU, which includes Europe's main public-sector broadcasters such as British Broadcasting Corp. and France's Antenne 2, effectively has the rights to most big sports events. The EC is conducting an antitrust probe of the EBU itself.
