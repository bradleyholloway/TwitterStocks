 Turkey Takes Steps Toward Joining the EU --- Country Presses the IMF For Emergency Funding; Turmoil in the Markets   By By Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2000  Bankers say Turkey's heavily sold markets could bounce back quickly, assuming the IMF supplies new funds in return for speeded-up Turkish reforms in the banking system, privatization and social security. Failure to reach an agreement with the IMF, however, could revive worst-case scenario fears of a devaluation, a potential disaster to Turkish credibility that Turkish officials have vowed to avoid.  The success of Turkey's three-year disinflation program, initiated this year with $8 billion of backing from the IMF and World Bank, was illustrated again by figures released on Sunday. Consumer inflation had fallen in November to an annual 43.8 %, the lowest level in 14 years; Turkey's economic planning and foreign investment has been blighted for three decades by high inflation, legal complications and erratic growth.  "The accession partnership agreement," as the road map agreed to yesterday is called, "is important for the EU and it's important for Turkey," said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. Turkey said its prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, would accept an invitation to join EU leaders as a guest for part of their summit meetings in France this week.
