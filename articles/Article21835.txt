 The Tax and Budget Debate: Deficit-Cutting Bill Bears a Resemblance To 1990 Predecessor --- But Differences May Be Crucial; Realistic Economic View, Increase in Taxes Are Cited   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1993  The deficit-reduction bill emerging from the House-Senate conference committee bears a surprising resemblance to the 1990 deficit-reduction bill that Congress finally passed -- and George Bush, to his later regret, signed.  Both raise income tax rates on the wealthiest Americans and make them lay out more in Medicare payroll taxes. Both rely heavily on money-saving changes to the Medicare program. Both reward the working poor by sweetening the earned-income tax credit. Both set strict ceilings on congressional appropriations, but not on spending for federal benefits. Both claim to reduce the deficit over the next five years by nearly $500 billion.  And then there is the gasoline tax. After rejecting a bigger energy tax than Mr. Bush and congressional leaders negotiated, Congress ended up raising gasoline taxes by only a nickel a gallon in 1990. This time, President Clinton's big broad-based energy tax gave way to an increase of 4.3 cents a gallon.
