Targeted Genetics soared 3.44, or 34%, to 13.56. The Seattle gene-therapy company posted a second-quarter loss of 12 cents a share, compared with its year-earlier loss of 19 cents a share.

In addition, Targeted Genetics said it agreed to a development and marketing agreement with Biogen, a Genovo shareholder, and said the pact's value could reach $125 million.
