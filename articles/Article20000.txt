 Ringing In Change at France Telecom; As Customers Balk at Paying for Phone Service, Company Looks for What Will Sell   By Abboud, Leila, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2006  The change has punched a hole in France Telecom's revenues. About 950,000 subscribers have dropped their France Telecom lines for alternative providers since 2003, according to recent data from French regulators. France Telecom currently has 26.9 million residential fixed-line subscribers. In February, France Telecom told investors that 30% to 40% of France's overall residential voice traffic would travel via Internet calling by the end of 2006, up from 14% in 2005 and 2% in 2004.  The company is also moving into the content realm. It acquired exclusive rights to broadcast France's national soccer league to its mobile-phone subscribers and offers them 52 TV channels as well. Last fall, France Telecom's mobile-phone, digital-TV, and Internet users could download ringtones and watch Madonna's new single "Hung Up" weeks before Warner Music Group Corp. released the album in France. At the Cannes film festival in April, France Telecom announced a deal for customers to order Disney and Miramax movies as part of their digital- TV package.  Analysts say Mr. [DIDIER LOMBARD]'s strategy makes sense. The key will be to deliver without any more of the trip-ups that have burned investors over the past couple of months. Last October, France Telecom said revenue would grow "nearly 3%" and not 3% to 5% as previously expected. In January, the company said sales growth would be "between 2% and 3%."
