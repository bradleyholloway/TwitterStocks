 Procter & Gamble Has Its Eye on Bristol-Myers's Clairol --- Swap of Drug Business for Hair Care Fell Apart, but P&G Remains Interested   By By Emily Nelson and Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2000  A spokesman for P&G, Tom Millikin, confirms the company "plans to review" Bristol-Myers' offering for Clairol, once it is issued, and considers Clairol "a strong brand that could be a strategic fit for us." Mr. Millikin added that currently P&G "has made no commitment."  Analysts were intrigued by the idea that P&G could get out of the drug business. If the swap idea had come to fruition, P&G would have been able to abandon an ambitious, albeit fledgling effort to build an area that most analysts saw as an albatross in need of scale and massive research-and-development investment in order to compete against rivals who are rapidly consolidating into pharmaceuticals giants. The drug business is P&G's smallest business, accounting for about $1 billion of its $40 billion in annual sales.  Mr. Millikin, the P&G spokesman, says "we are committed to the successful launch of Actonel." P&G sees Actonel as a big piece of its women's health effort, the customer group that buys most its products, which include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers. P&G has said Actonel will showcase its ability to pair consumer marketing know-how with a drug to beat larger competitors.
