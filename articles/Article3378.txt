 U.S. Steps Up Public Campaign Against China's Pirated Products   By Hutzler, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2005  Mr. [Donald Evans], in a speech to U.S. and Chinese officials and business executives yesterday, said Chery Automobile Co.'s QQ minicar is virtually a twin of the Chevrolet Spark developed by a GM unit in South Korea, GM Daewoo Automotive & Technology Co. Mr. Evans didn't directly accuse Chery of theft, but said the company is using pirated proprietary information to produce the QQ. Mathematical formulas and other design information "were simply stolen from GM Daewoo," Mr. Evans said. "This is an incident that defies any kind of innocent explanation."  While once confined to inexpensive consumer products sold domestically, Chinese piracy has expanded rapidly, moving into export markets and covering complex manufactured goods. The trend isn't upsetting only U.S. multinationals, which sell to China and use it as a manufacturing base; it also makes it politically harder for Washington to defend two-way trade that last year tipped an estimated $150 billion in China's favor.
