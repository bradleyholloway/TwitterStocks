 Napster Settles Suits; Judge Says System Must Remain Shut   By By Don Clark and Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 2001  In turn, pressplay agreed to use Microsoft's Windows Media format for music files, as well as Microsoft's technology for restricting copying and tracking usage of recordings. That deal is important for Microsoft's long-running competition with RealNetworks Inc., whose technology is being used by MusicNet, a pressplay rival backed by AOL Time Warner Inc., of New York, EMI Group PLC, of the United Kingdom, and Germany's Bertelsmann AG.  In connection with the settlement, Napster essentially apologized to the musicians, saying in Dr. Dre's case that officials at the company "regret that we were not more sensitive" to the rap artist's desire to control how his music is distributed. The Napster statement also said Metallica had taken "a courageous stand and a tough and principled approach" in trying to protect its copyrights.
