 California Faces Higher Prices at the Pump --- Bush's Ruling That Ethanol Replace Additive MTBE May Pinch Fuel Supplies   By By Alexei Barrionuevo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2001  Unwilling to bet entirely on the U.S. ethanol industry, California officials, along with oil giant BP PLC, held discussions in May with ethanol producers from Brazil, the world's largest ethanol producer. Brazilian producers say they have idle capacity they could bring on line, and "we think we could do it for a competitive price," says Eduardo de Carvalho, president and chief executive officer of the Association of Sugar and Alcohol Producers of Sao Paolo, which represents about 60% of Brazilian ethanol production.  Mr. Carvalho declined to discuss prices. But California Energy Commission officials say they believe they could get Brazilian ethanol for $1.20 a gallon, below the recent Gulf Coast spot prices for ethanol of just under $1.40 a gallon. But a current import tariff of 54 cents a gallon would boost the Brazilian price to $1.74 a gallon.  Ethanol is also tougher to transport, and there aren't any dedicated ethanol pipelines to California, nor are there plans to build any. While most of California's MTBE comes from the Gulf Coast, ethanol will first have to travel to the Gulf by rail or barge from the Midwest, adding five to seven cents a gallon to gasoline prices.
