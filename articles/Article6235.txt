 Forget Fixing Leaky Toilets: There's A Better Way to Invest in Rental Property   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2003  That 28% gain, however, isn't really comparable to the 31% return from equity REITs. One reason: REIT returns benefited from leverage. Currently, REITs have debt equal to a little under 50% of their total capitalization. That's like owning a $200,000 property with $100,000 left on the mortgage.  People sometimes argue that rental properties are a better investment than REITs, because you can employ more leverage. But this argument doesn't impress Chris Mayer, a finance professor at New York's Columbia Business School. He points out that, if you really want a leveraged play on real estate, you could open a margin account at your favorite brokerage firm and buy REITs with borrowed money.  Currently, equity REITs yield an average 6%. It doesn't cost much to collect that yield. If you invest through a no-load REIT mutual fund, there's no expense when buying and selling. Your only costs are the fund's annual expenses and trading costs, plus taxes if you held your fund outside of a retirement account.
