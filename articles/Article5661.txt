 Arthritis Drug From Centocor Shows Promise --- Remicade Gave Potent Relief For Most Severe Form Of Disease, Data Show   By By Robert Langreth, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1998  The experimental drug, called Remicade, is one of two new biotechnology drugs designed to slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, the most disabling form of the disease, by blocking certain overactive molecules in the immune system. The other drug is Immunex Corp.'s Enbrel, which won government approval just last week and will be co-marketed by the giant drug maker, American Home Products Corp.  The Remicade data were presented here yesterday at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, where a record 5,600 arthritis specialists heard presentations about several powerful new classes of arthritis drugs. "In my thirty years of practice, I have never seen more exciting approaches to treat this dreaded disease," said Arthur Weaver of the Arthritis Center of Nebraska.  Unlike the more common and somewhat milder osteoarthritis, which often is the result of a wearing down of the joints with age, rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive autoimmune disease that afflicts 2.5 million Americans. It can lead to crippling joint deformities and there have been few good treatments without nasty side effects. But some patients who have taken the new agents in clinical trials of Enbrel and Remicade have experienced dramatic recoveries. So far, the new agents don't appear to have many side effects.
