 Soft Money Ads Begin for Gore Despite Pledge   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2000  The spots could open Mr. [Al Gore] to criticism that he is breaking a vow, taken after he had sewed up the Democratic primary in March, to forgo "soft money" TV ads as long as the Republican candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, abstained as well. But Gore campaign officials make the case that they aren't bound by that pledge, because the GOP has run some ads in California and because Mr. Gore has been targeted by groups allied with Republicans over his position on missile defense.  Aides say the ads will help present a fuller picture of Mr. Gore to those voters who only know him as vice president and a wooden speaker. In addition, they hope the ads will help energize Gore activists worried that the campaign has been adrift since Mr. Gore vanquished Democratic Party challenger Bill Bradley.
