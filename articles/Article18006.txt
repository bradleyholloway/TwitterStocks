 Son of Founder of Johnson Products Focuses on Continuing a Turnaround   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1989  Eric G. Johnson is in an even tougher position than most sons who follow in their fathers' footsteps: In his case, he must turn around Johnson Products Inc. in the wake of an unusual divorce settlement in which his father lost control of the firm.  The 38-year-old Mr. Johnson immediately promised to be more focused on the bottom line at the beleaguered manufacturer of cosmetics and hair-care products for black consumers. He says he will be less involved in community work than his father, George E. Johnson, who ceded a majority stake in the company to his mother, Joan B. Johnson, as part of the divorce settlement Monday.  The elder Mr. Johnson, 62, a symbol of black pride on this city's South Side, has been active in everything from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to the International African Chamber of Commerce. "I won't have that kind of time in the next couple of years," says the younger Mr. Johnson.
