 Education: College, With All the Perks --- Schools Try Free Phones, Cable to Woo Students; `A Parent's Nightmare'   By By Elizabeth Bernstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 2003  This month, with teenagers across the country choosing their colleges, schools have a new recruiting twist: the battle of the perks. While parents may be scratching their heads over the offers, colleges from Northwestern to Duke are pushing free cellphones, free cable television and even specially baked birthday cakes. Emory University has started taking freshmen to Atlanta Braves games. "We want students to be happy," says Brit Katz, Emory's assistant dean for campus life.  It wasn't all that long ago that a college student's idea of fancy was a pay phone in the dorm hallway. That all started to change in the late '90s when flush schools started piling on big-ticket luxuries like high-end gyms (Yale) and condo-like dorms (Boston University). More recently, as the number of high-school graduates ballooned to the highest levels since the early '80s -- and competition for the top seniors intensified -- more colleges started focusing on fattening up scholarships. Indeed, 81% of private-school students this year are getting financial help from colleges, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers.  While Northwestern's upgrade might be pricey, experts say it's not like schools are sacrificing to offer the freebies. To give all its students Internet access next year, Cornell is tacking a $245 mandatory fee onto room-and-board costs. Other colleges say they give away laptops, but only after raising tuition to help pay for such perks. Even when colleges can't pass on the charge for, say, cellphones, not all students take advantage of them anyway. "It doesn't cost schools a lot to do it and they get credit for it," says Seppy Basili, vice president at test-prep company Kaplan.
