 Stock Offerings Are Postponed Or Withdrawn --- Volatility and Uncertainty In Market During July Took at Least 31 Victims   By By Michael Santoli, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1996  Through July, at least 31 planned stock offerings were either withdrawn or postponed in response to severe volatility and uncertainty in the stock market.  If each pulled initial offering was priced at the midpoint of its expected range and other scotched deals were issued around current share prices, the total amount of stock issuance forgone would have amounted to about $1.8 billion. And this doesn't count all the issuers that haven't formally canceled deals but have given up hope of tapping the market soon.  A total of $9.8 billion in common stock was issued during July, according to Securities Data Co. That monthly rate is just 8% below the first six months of this year, when $63.9 billion in stock was issued, an amount that put the industry on pace to approach the one-year record of $130 billion set in 1993.
