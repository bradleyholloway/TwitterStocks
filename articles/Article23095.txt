 More WMD Dominoes   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  The larger story here is that all of this has followed from the Bush Administration's tough line against terror-sponsoring states.

The trail from both countries has led to a global network of weapons traffickers and especially to Pakistan. All of the WMD dominoes haven't fallen yet, but the ground underneath them gets shakier all the time.
