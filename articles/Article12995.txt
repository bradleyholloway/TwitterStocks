 Kmart to Report Holiday Season Was Profitable   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2004  "We are managing the business to restore profitability," Kmart Chief Executive Julian C. Day said in a statement. "Much of the promotional activity in prior years resulted in generating unprofitable sales."  Observers said the falling sales will become more troubling if they start to erode Kmart's profitability. "The thing that stands out is their ability to extract profit from a relatively static customer base," said Richard Hastings, retail-sector analyst for Bernard Sands, a New York-based credit advisory.  The sliding sales, he said, indicate that customer loyalty remains a problem. "The long-term solution to Kmart's challenges is to build a base of much-younger shoppers."
