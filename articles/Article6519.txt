 Gold Futures Hit Highest Level In 25 Years on Geopolitical Fears   By Sykora, Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2006  "It took out a prior high on the chart, and that is bullish," said Tom Boustead, metals analyst with Man Financial. "It was the technicals after making a new high, and more fund money was coming in."  "It may be getting some lift from geopolitical concerns," Mr. Boustead said. He cited the health problems of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, which has caused worries about Israel's leadership.  There are concerns about Iran's nuclear program with some of the hawkish comments by that country's president, added Dan Vaught, futures analyst with A.G. Edwards. "You have that in the background," he said. "But I tend to think today's strength in the precious metals, gold in particular, is once again reflecting a strong influx of capital into the commodities, particularly into index hedge funds and other methods people are using to combat inflation."
