 After Sales of Video-Game Machines Subside, Software Shares May Not Maintain High Scores   By By Khanh T.L. Tran and Kate Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  The bulls on the software stocks see this as possibly the biggest boom cycle in years, with high sales volume in the next few weeks. T.K. MacKay, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., says "there's no doubt that the shares are expensive" but "if you keep the long-term time frame in mind, there's no reason why an investor can't still capture the success that EA will likely see for the next few years." He believes Electronic Arts shares are worth $64, based on revenue and profit assumptions stretching out five years. Jonathan Rudy, a software analyst for Standard & Poor's equity-research group who also is a fan of Electronic Arts, adds: "I wouldn't consider it a value play by any stretch right now."  Spencer Wang, an ABN Amro analyst, however, finds the stocks "largely reflective" of the upside expected in the industry; he has a "hold" rating on Electronic Arts, Activision and THQ. Using analysts' consensus numbers compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call for earnings in the fiscal year ending in March 2003, Electronic Arts trades at 44.5 times its estimated earnings, while Activision trades at 32 times estimated earnings. THQ, with a fiscal year ending in December 2002, trades at 31.2 times. The estimates are for operating earnings, which exclude business expenses such as restructuring charges.  Kathy Vrabeck, an executive vice president with Activision, Santa Monica, Calif., credits "all of the excitement around the Xbox and the GameCube [for driving] overall interest from consumers." The company's hit Tony Hawk skateboarding game was featured in Xbox advertising; it also is making versions for the competing PlayStation 2 and GameCube. The company yesterday raised its guidance for earnings and revenue in fiscal 2002 and 2003.
