 Conglomerates' Conundrum; When It Comes to Ads Aimed at Investors, How Do You Put a Face on the Faceless?   By J. Lynn Lunsford and Brian Steinberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2006  So he's trying to accomplish what many successful conglomerates such as General Electric Co., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and BASF AG have tried with varying degrees of success. He wants to create a "brand" for a parent company, and, in the process, help UTC's share price better reflect its strong performance. UTC is betting that the overarching slogan "United Technologies. You can see everything from here" will educate the public, and especially investors and financial analysts, about a far-reaching operation.  Even companies with well-known names sometimes highlight the fact that there's more to them than meets the eye. For example, when lawmakers were growing increasingly concerned about childhood obesity, Coca-Cola Co., in 2003 unveiled a corporate effort aimed in part at Capitol Hill that for the first time included all of its beverage brands, including Minute Maid juices, in a single ad. More recently, Coke has been running ads with the slogan, "Make every drop count." As part of that campaign, a promotion found on a Coke Web site reads, "You've always known Coca-Cola, the soft drink. Now it's time you knew us as Coca-Cola, the company."  The headline on the helicopter ad reads, "Our helicopters saved 44,179 people from disaster sites last year," and goes on to note that is "just one way UTC's passion and precision come together to benefit both our shareholders and our world." Another ad that will promote UTC-sponsored art exhibits shows a drawing of a transparent human head with machine cogs for a brain. The headline: "Most of the things we do move man. Occasionally they move mankind."
