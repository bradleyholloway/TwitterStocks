 Private Properties   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  A NORTH CAROLINA farm once owned by the late Raymond C. Firestone, son of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. founder Harvey Firestone, is for sale, with an asking price of $5.2 million. Known as Landmark Farm, the estate on 82 acres is in the heart of Southern Pines, N.C., horse country. In the 1960s, Mr. Firestone chose the area to build a retirement home. He hired interior decorator Otto Zenke and architect Mott B. Schmidt to create a modified version of a late 18th-century manor. The result: a six-bedroom, 10,000-square-foot manor with an exterior of hand-made brick, white clapboard and a shake roof. The residence also has nine full baths, two half-baths, six fireplaces, a screened-in porch and a terrace overlooking one of the property's two ponds. On the lower level, there's a wine cellar, recreation room, family room and an indoor swimming pool. Outside, there's a pool, a two-bedroom guest cottage, a four-bedroom farm manager's house, a two-bedroom guest/pool house with a two-car garage and a dog kennel, a five-bedroom bunk house, an eight-stall barn with an apartment, a foaling barn and two riding rings. Chris and Kathy Virtue bought the estate of Mr. Firestone in August 1996 for $2.3 million. They purchased additional land and installed the outdoor pool. Altogether they spent about $1 million on improvements. Maureen Clark, of Sotheby's International Realty affiliate Clark Properties of North Carolina in Southern Pines, has the listing.
