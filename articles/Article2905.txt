 WNBA Signs Anheuser-Busch As a Sponsor for Its New League   By By Stefan Fatsis, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 1996  The fledgling Women's National Basketball Association thinks not. The new league, which begins play in June, yesterday announced Anheuser-Busch among its first four corporate sponsors. The others are Lee Apparel, maker of Lee Jeans; uniform supplier Champion, a unit of Sara Lee; and sports-equipment manufacturer Spalding Sports Worldwide.  The four companies have committed to spending a total of about $40 million over three years, an unprecedented level for women's sports. The marketing clout of its parent, the National Basketball Association, is critical, but the eight-team WNBA still is a start-up, and one sign of that is the juicy marketing package it's offering. Similar to a model developed by Major League Soccer, which recently completed what was by most accounts a successful first year, WNBA sponsors will receive exclusive TV and print advertising, arena signs and national and local promotional rights. General Electric's NBC, Walt Disney's ESPN and Lifetime Television, jointly owned by Hearst and Disney, will televise 34 games in 1997.  In addition to spending money, big sponsors confer credibility on pro sports. Beer companies know how to get a big bang out of professional sports, but they have traditionally targeted a male audience. The WNBA's goal: sponsors appealing to the women's market but treating the sport no differently than a men's league.
