 Questioning the Books: Some Lawmakers Use Bush Pension Plan As a Blueprint for Their Own Proposals   By By Kathy Chen and Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2002  Today, Reps. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.) are expected to introduce a bill that largely reflects the White House's pension package. But Mr. Portman said in an interview yesterday that passage will be a challenge because of the mixed reactions from interest groups. "We don't know what is the right balance," said Mr. Portman, an informal adviser to the White House. "It's an educational process."  Mr. [Bush] unveiled the proposals -- the work of a cabinet-level task force assembled after Enron Corp.'s collapse wiped out retirement savings of most of the company's employees -- at a Republican retreat Friday. The proposals would, among other things, allow employees to sell any of their employer's stock in their 401(k) retirement plans after three years and would hold employers liable for what happens to workers' 401(k) assets during blackout periods on stock sales.
