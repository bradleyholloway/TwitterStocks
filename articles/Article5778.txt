 Replica, Operator Of Football Game, Goes Out of Business --- President Says It Is Unclear How or Whether Players Will Get Any Money Back   By By Stefan M. Fatsis and William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1995  More than 12,000 football fans who paid as much as $100 a-piece to join a computer-based fantasy game were sacked when the company operating the game, Replica Corp., abruptly folded in midseason.  Since its founding in 1987, closely-held Replica, based in Dedham, Mass., also operated baseball, basketball, golf and investment simulation games in which participants compiled teams or portfolios. Thousands played, and winners were awarded cash and merchandise.  The football game, Sports Challenge Football '95, was the only active operation, Mr. Johnson said. Replica's stock game, the Collegiate Investment Challenge, was sponsored for eight years by AT&T Corp. and attracted 15,000 high school and college players last year, said Mitch Montagna, a spokesman for AT&T's Universal Card operation, which promoted the game.
