 The Faux Foreign Policy Leadership   By Hunt, Albert R, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2003  Don Rumsfeld hasn't declared whether Spain is part of what he considers the increasingly irrelevant "Old Europe" or the "New Europe," supportive of America. Unfortunately the Spanish people seem to be lining up: A clear majority now disapprove of the United States and attribute it to the policies of the [George W. Bush] administration.  Of course, we still have our "special relationship" with the Brits; Tony Blair's unwavering and courageous support of American policy just might cost him the prime ministership. And President Bush may have looked into Russian president Putin's heart, but during the Iraqi war that was trumped by the former-KGB agent's head, which followed the anti-U.S. attitude of his constituents.  The Don Rumsfeld Field of Dreams Foreign Policy -- lead and they will follow, or, if they don't, who cares -- isn't working. Around the globe, the Bush foreign policy is described as "arrogant" or complaints abound about "treating us with contempt" or "humiliating us."
