 Leading the News: Continental to Delay Boeing Order; Deferral to at Least 2008 Is a Worrisome Signal For Weak Aviation Market   By Scott McCartney and J. Lynn Lunsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2003  Continental, which has permanently grounded 82 planes since 2001, has reached agreement with Boeing to delay delivery of 36 of the 56 737s it had on order for several years to 2008 and beyond, according to people familiar with the terms. The airline is still trying to negotiate deferral of all 11 757-300s it has on order at Boeing -- a move that could jeopardize Boeing's 757 production line.  Continental's total Boeing order has a list price between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, but large airlines receive substantial discounts. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Continental estimated the cost of the 67 aircraft it has on order at $2.5 billion. The deferrals call into question recent projections from both Boeing and Airbus -- if other airlines follow Continental's move. During last month's Paris Air Show, executives from both Boeing and Airbus said that they believed this year was the bottom of the slump, and that they expected the airlines to begin taking increasing numbers of deliveries by 2005.
