 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2007  A: No. You don't need to buy another house to qualify for a federal tax break on the sale of your home. Based on what you've told me, you shouldn't owe Uncle Sam any capital-gains tax on that $175,000 gain you made on the sale of your California home.  This exclusion applies only to your primary residence. You easily met the two-year requirements. But even someone who couldn't pass those tests might qualify to exclude most or all of the gain under certain circumstances. The seller may be eligible for a reduced exclusion if that person had to sell because of a "change in place of employment," health reasons or "unforeseen circumstances."
