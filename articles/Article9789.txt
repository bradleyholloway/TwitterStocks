 Vaccine Cuts Risk Of Cervical Cancer 90%, Study Says   By Martinez, Barbara, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2005  In the latest study, Merck's vaccine, called Gardasil, was effective in preventing infection from four types of HPV that lead to the majority of cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. In the study, of 552 women ages 16 to 23, roughly half were given three rounds of the vaccine and the other half were given a placebo. After three years, there were 36 cases of infection among the placebo-taking women, and only one case of a confirmed persistent case of infection among the women who had the vaccine. There were an additional three cases where the virus was detected but not confirmed among the vaccine takers.
