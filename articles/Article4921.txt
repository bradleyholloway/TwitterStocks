 Goldstar Begins Plant to Challenge Japan Chip Firms ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1988  SEOUL, South Korea -- Goldstar Co. said it began construction of a mammoth, $2.22 billion semiconductor manufacturing complex in Chongju in central South Korea.  The move by the Lucky-Goldstar Group unit provides the latest evidence of South Korea's determination to challenge Japan for a bigger chunk of the booming, $46 billion world chip market. It also reflects Goldstar's efforts to catch up with Korean industry leader Samsung Co.  "This plant is very important to Goldstar. It shows Goldstar is moving into semiconductors in a big way," said William Stoops, analyst at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers. Another analyst said the decision to build the factory indicates a strategy shift from the production of custom chips to mass-production memory chips, which are riskier because they require big investments to achieve economies of scale.
