 Man Who Led Nomura's Foray Into U.K. Pubs May Be Leaving   By By Silvia Ascarelli, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2001  The potential parting of ways reflects a sense that the investment unit run by the 41-year-old Mr. Hands has outgrown Nomura and its London unit, Nomura International PLC, these people say. In his 61/2 years with Nomura, he has built up a portfolio that has tied up a huge chunk of the Nomura group's capital. The current market value of that portfolio hasn't been disclosed.  His next deal for Nomura could be the acquisition of the Meridien hotel chain, one of Europe's best-known upscale hotel groups, for about GBP 1.85 billion from Compass Group PLC. Nomura has been named the preferred bidder, and those talks could be wrapped up in about a month.
