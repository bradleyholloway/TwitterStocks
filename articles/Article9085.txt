 Shacking Up: Forget the `M' word. More older couples are simply living together rather than getting married   By By Trish Hall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  Not long ago, Marcia Lasher and her husband, Shepard, went out to dinner at a restaurant near their condo in Lakeworth, Fla. Like them, the other four couples who gathered that night were older people, in their 60s, 70s or 80s. But unlike the Lashers, none of the other couples were married. They were simply living together.  That is not, of course, the way life has always been. There was a time, not so long ago, when today's retirees were horrified at the idea of their children living with someone out of wedlock. But now, it seems, the generation that railed against their children living in sin has crossed over to the dark side. Among people over 65, the number of unmarried couples living together rose more than 50% to 188,000 in 1998 from 119,000 in 1980. While that is just a small portion of the couples in that age group, about one in 100, it does reflect a profound change in attitude -- one that has made it easier for unmarried people of all ages to live together without suffering social disapproval.  Anna K. Daniels, for instance, used to socialize occasionally with her husband and another couple, Earl E. Hart and his wife, usually going to the theater in nearby Syracuse, N.Y. Then, her husband of 49 years and his wife of 53 years died in the same year. A few months later, Ms. Daniels and Mr. Hart ran into one another at the supermarket and decided to have dinner together. They dated for six years, until about two years ago, when Mr. Hart moved into Ms. Daniels's home.
