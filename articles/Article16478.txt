 Republicans to Discuss Plans For Overhaul of Social Security   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2005  Administration officials said the president has made no decisions and won't propose any plan until late February, suggesting that he won't reflect the big transition costs of a Social Security change in the fiscal 2006 budget request he will send to Congress early next month. Republicans, just returned for the new Congress, are hoping that Mr. [Bush] will more clearly signal at tomorrow's White House meeting what he has in mind and not leave the politically difficult details to lawmakers.  Separately, today Republican senators will caucus privately on the year's agenda, led by Social Security along with funding for the Iraq war, at a Library of Congress retreat that will include a briefing from the president's chief adviser, Karl Rove. Tomorrow's White House meeting, meanwhile, will kick off a variety of Republican congressional activities aimed at forging strategy on Social Security, including a Monday briefing of leadership staff by White House officials and Senate Finance Committee briefings on the issue.
