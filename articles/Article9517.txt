 Manager's Journal: Selling the Internet   By By Christopher M. Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2003  HAL RINEY, one of the greatest advertising mavens of our time, said not long ago that the "magic of traditional advertising is no longer magic." Mr. Riney should know -- he created the television ads that helped elect Ronald Reagan president and made Bartles & Jaymes household names. He told Advertising Age magazine that the Internet "offers a better and far more extensive resource for information than the . . . 30 second commercial."  At the moment, with so many dot-coms gone bust and the broader economy in a slump, now seems an odd time to be pledging alleigance to the edgy medium of Internet advertising. Television remains powerful, allowing us to be passive spectators in history and reliable receptacles for product information. But the more quickly the news moves these days, the more people turn to the Internet for breaking stories and in moments of anxiety.  Americans' use of the Internet continues to grow at an extraordinary rate. Over 160 million are now online. And when you consider that these people spend nearly five hours less per week watching television than their offline counterparts, Mr. Riney's comments don't seem so crazy after all. Television advertisers routinely face the fact that 40% of viewers leave the room during commercials. Online users, at least are glued to their tasks.
