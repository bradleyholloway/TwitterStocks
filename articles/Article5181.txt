 Two Are Charged With Illegal Entry To International Data Group's System   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1990  Two teen-agers were charged with breaking into a voice-mail system owned by the publisher of Computerworld, underscoring the vulnerability of the proliferating systems to computer hackers.  The two youths from Staten Island, N.Y., allegedly gained unauthorized entry to a computerized voice-mail system owned by International Data Group, Framingham, Mass., then changed recorded greetings to lewd messages, made bomb threats and erased customers' messages, said John Keary, a New York state police investigator.  The tampering occurred between May and September at the company's Peterborough, N.H., office, at which eight computer magazines published by the concern are based, said Jane Creighton, International Data's telecommunications director. She estimated the voice-mail disruptions cost the company $2.4 million in lost revenue from advertisers and other expenses.
