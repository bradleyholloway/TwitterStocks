To the Editor:  Although some of your readers may have been disillusioned by your Nov. 13 report that scientists often disagree on which projects are most deserving of National Science Foundation funding, it is hardly surprising that proper choices of future directions are as difficult for scientists as for practitioners of other fields of human endeavor. ndeed, the perceptions are only slightly less clouded even after completion of scientific research.  Many scientists can attest to the controversies that abound during peer review of research results submitted for publication or even after publication, when the time comes to decide which research is most deserving of award and recognition.  I think the moral is clear and timely, as our Government is looking to rearrange its scientific priorities and funding assumptions. As in the commercial marketplace, a variety of suppliers are more likely to match the needs of a diverse number of researchers than any one funding mechanism or agency. For example, in solid-state physics (my field of study) a researcher can seek funding from the N.S.F., an agency known for the high quality of its review and funding procedures. The Departments of Energy or Defense and a number of other agencies are also significant sources of research support, and that is as it should be, for none of them are perfect at seeing the future.  It would be a mistake to consolidate - as some in the Office of Management and Budget have proposed - much of the other agencies' missions into the N.S.F., exemplary as its procedures may be. Competition in giving and soliciting research funding is one of the important ways of dealing with the human limitations of peer review. MARC H. BRODSKY Mount Kisco, N.Y, Nov. 13, 1981
