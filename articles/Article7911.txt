 Investors Seeking Fast Profit by Flipping IPOs Start to Come Out of Hibernation   By By Sonja Steptoe, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  These investors, derisively known as "flippers," buy shares of an IPO and then unload them immediately after the stock begins public trading. The idea is to reap higher prices from other investors who weren't able to get in on the initial offering.  Securities companies that underwrite IPOs don't like flippers because of the trading havoc they create. The underwriters strive to maintain calm trading in the new issues they bring to market. They don't like to see a new stock fall below its offering price. But flippers can sometimes exert enough pressure to topple the stock and, in the process, unnerve other investors who had planned to hold onto their shares.  The company didn't allow trading in the shares of the Ventura, Calif., oil and natural gas exploration concern for seven days after the shares were sold to the public. Subscribers were prohibited from trading until after they received physical delivery of the shares and paid for them. The tactic allows an underwriter to closely track the movement of shares and penalize brokers who sell stock to flippers.
