 SmartMoney: When Fixed Income Isn't   By Bullock, Nicole, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2005  Not all variable-rate bonds are guaranteed to offer rising interest payments because short-term rates are going up. Some issuers, such as Sallie Mae and John Hancock, have issued bonds whose payments are tied to inflation. Although rising inflation usually leads to higher rates, the two don't always move in lockstep. During the stagflation of the 1970s, prices for many goods and services rose, but the economy was weak; inflation-linked bonds would have been attractive in that kind of environment.  Floating-rate bonds aren't without drawbacks. Most notably, when rates fall, so do the interest payments. Floaters also typically start out paying a lower interest rate than similar fixed-rate bonds to compensate issuers for the risk of higher payouts down the road. Variable rates won't protect investors from credit risk. If the issuer runs into financial problems, the price of a bond will drop, as was the case for bonds of auto maker General Motors when it issued a recent profit warning.
