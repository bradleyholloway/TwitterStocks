 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): So What If It's Gas?   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1988  The world's civilized nations are trying to figure out whether Iraq did or did not bomb the Kurds with poison gas. We are wondering what the world thinks it is going to do if it concludes that the Iraqis did gas the Kurds.  Iraq has admitted using gas against the Iranians but denies using it against the Kurds. Some preliminary investigators say they haven't seen evidence of gassings. Yet a strong circumstantial case for the gas attacks has been developing since the March gas attack on the village of Halabja, in which 4,000 died. The U.S. State Department is standing by its recent assertion of Iraqi gas attacks, but as usual declines to reveal the sources of its intelligence. The refugees themselves charge that in the post-cease-fire assault more than 2,000 have died and 5,000 were wounded, largely from the gas attacks. About 100,000 Kurds -- a people not previously known for running -- have fled across the border to Turkey to escape the onslaught.
