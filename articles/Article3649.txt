 Personal Business: Online Shopping Sites With Extra Benefits   By Ransom, Diana, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  Many of these sites link to hundreds of retailers, including big names such as Barnes & Noble's bn.com, Amazon.com, Gap.com and toysrus.com. You make your purchases at the retailers' sites, so prices and shipping costs are the same as if you went there directly.  Check the minimum cash-out or donation amount. "We don't write a check to a nonprofit for less than $5," says David Rosa, vice president of technology at CharitableEmporium.com. Upromise waits until you have $25 in your account, while Schoolpop doesn't issue a payment unless a school's account reaches $100.  CharitableEmporium.com obtained a private ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that members can take a tax deduction for donations through the site. Relying on legal counsel, iGive.com says deductions through that site are also deductible. But in the BenevoLink program, it's the retailers, not shoppers, who get the deduction.
