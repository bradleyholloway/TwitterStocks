 Trends   By By Tamar Hausman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1997  In the kitchen, tiny fruits and vegetables are popping up on cabinets, as are knives, forks and spoons.

Of course, decorative drawer pulls are more expensive than run-of-the-mill wooden knobs -- the pulls are generally $10 to $60 apiece; an antique pewter horse's head pull costs $75 at Liz's Antique Hardware -- especially if the affinity grows into a collector's addiction. That's what happened to Kay Bower, a Houston actress.
