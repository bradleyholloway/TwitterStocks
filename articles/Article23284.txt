 Northwest Pilots Vote to Reopen Contract Talks   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 2005  The Air Line Pilots Association said it aimed to reach a new agreement that would include "significant" cost reductions, and Northwest said it was pleased with the offer. The union's move came as the carrier said soaring fuel costs are pressuring it to seek even greater labor concessions and are complicating its decision on whether to file for bankruptcy-court protection.  Without labor-cost restructuring and pension relief, the airline said, it is unlikely to be able to raise any more money from the capital markets. If Congress doesn't grant pension reform, Northwest said, it will have to consider seeking bankruptcy-court protection. "As a result of the recent spike in jet-fuel prices, the time period for the company to resolve these problems has been reduced," it said.
