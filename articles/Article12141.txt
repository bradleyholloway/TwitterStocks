 New List Shows Hottest Firms (Well, Sort Of)   By By Karen L. Tippett, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1996  The list highlights Florida companies with the largest gains in revenue during the past five years. Companies will be awarded plaques at a presentation tomorrow in Tampa to honor their status as the "Fast 50." The idea, say economic-development officials, is to dispel the notion held by venture capitalists and much of Wall Street that Florida suffers from a dearth of high-tech stars.  "This is to help people around the country realize that there are good investment opportunities in the state," says June Schmid, spokeswoman for the Enterprise Corp. of Tampa Bay, an Enterprise Florida affiliate that developed the rankings at the agency's behest. Enterprise Florida is the quasiprivate Orlando-based agency that is replacing the Commerce Department.  Another that wouldn't make the grade: Hi-Rise Recycling Systems Inc., a Miami company that is spending lots of money to install garbage-recycling equipment in tall buildings -- but lacks hefty profits. Brad Hacker, controller, insists Hi-Rise will eventually post big earnings gains. Meanwhile, sales at Hi-Rise are increasing fast enough to place it eighth on the revenue list. Says Mr. Hacker: "Next year, we'll hopefully go from No. 8 to No. 1," bumping V.O.C. Analytical Laboratories Inc., a Boca Raton environmental-testing concern, from the top spot.
