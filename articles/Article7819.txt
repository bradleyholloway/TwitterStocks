 OPEC's Scheduled Talks Dominate Thoughts Of Oil Traders as Optimism for Accord Sprouts   By By Allanna Sullivan and James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1988  The price of crude oil at the New York Mercantile Exchange is expected to remain within a trading range of $13 a barrel to $14.25 until the cartel's oil ministers gather in Vienna Nov. 17 to begin a series of committee meetings before the full ministerial meeting four days later. Depending upon whether the ministers strike a production accord, the price of crude in the futures market could rise $2 a barrel or tumble at least $2.  Oil traders, by nature eternal optimists, are starting to wager that there's a good chance the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will hammer out an agreement as cartel members bow to the threat of continued overproduction by Saudi Arabia. "The Saudis are going to the meeting armed to the teeth," said Peter Gignoux, head of international oil trading in London for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Gignoux was referring to an estimated 70 million barrels of stored oil the Saudis could unleash into the market if OPEC producers don't comply with the Saudi strategy that calls for production discipline.  If the Iran-Iraq issue can be settled, the remaining points of disagreement will become easier to resolve. The much-publicized issue of how to define crude oil output for quota purposes is evolving into a non-event. Wiping away another point of disagreement, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are prepared to include into their own quotas oil production from the neutral zone, which they had been jointly pumping to support Iraq's war effort against Iran. And if Iran and Iraq settle their differences, they may join Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in applying political pressure on the United Arab Emirates to stop flagrantly violating its quota.
