WASHINGTON, April 27â€” A survey of house-buying trends indicates that in 1970 the average home mortgage interest rate was 8.5 percent and the average monthly payment was only $126.88.  Ten years later, the survey found interest rates averaging 12 percent and average monthly payments at $621.  Mortgage interest rates for the last half of 1981 are expected to range from 14.5 percent to 15.5 percent, with money remaining tight, according to Jackson Goss, president and chief executive officer of the Investors Mortgage Company of Boston.  A national survey by Mr. Goss's company sampled at random 2,500 mortgage applications from across the United States for the years 1970, 1979 and 1980.  Among its findings was that single persons accounted for less than one-half of 1 percent of home purchases in 1970, but by 1980 accounted for 24 percent.  It also found that the average sales price of new and existing homes rose from $23,100 in 1970 to $56,910 in 1980.
