This has been no ordinary, run-of-the-mill week for Leona Mitchell, the soprano who has starred in productions at the Metropolitan Opera, the San Francisco Opera and Covent Garden.  On Tuesday in Los Angeles, where she lives, she finished filming her first movie role, as an opera singer in Luciano Pavarotti's first movie, ''Yes, Georgio.''  And tomorrow Miss Mitchell will be back in her home town of Enid, Okla., where a street will be named for her. ''The people of Enid have always been wonderful to me, so I'm sure a lot of them will be around to see the parade and hear the speeches,'' Miss Mitchell said yesterday. ''It's my father who arranged all of it, though. He's so proud of all of his children. I'm the 10th of 15.''  The singer's father, the Rev. Hulon Mitchell, is the pastor of the Antioch Church of God in Christ, on the corner of East State Street and South Enid Boulevard, which will become Leona Mitchell Boulevard.  The Pentecostal minister said yesterday that the Enid City Council changed the street name officially, as of tomorrow, after he had obtained the signatures of 80 percent of the taxpayers on the boulevard on a petition saying they approved.
