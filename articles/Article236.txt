 Grain Exporter Agrees to Settle Big Fraud Case   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1996  Arab Finagrain Agri-Business Trading Ltd., a Continental-controlled joint venture in Geneva, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the U.S. Agriculture Department of export-credit guarantees for which it wasn't eligible, a Continental spokesman confirmed. Under the plea agreement filed here in federal court, Arab Finagrain is required to pay a criminal fine of $10 million, the spokesman said.  Continental, while admitting no wrongdoing, agreed to pay $25 million to settle the government's civil claims against the company and Arab Finagrain. "The company entered into this agreement to avoid protracted and expensive litigation," said Daryl Natz, a Continental vice president. "Neither Continental nor any of its employees was found to be in violation of any civil or criminal law."  The Continental settlement as well as the Arab Finagrain plea bargain, are to be announced today by the Justice Department, Mr. Natz said. Because Continental wasn't convicted of any criminal wrongdoing, it will be able to continue participating in government-sponsored programs, including export credits to promote the sale of U.S. commodities overseas.
