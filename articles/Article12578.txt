 Boy Scout Battle Pits Gay Activists vs. Minority Kids   By By Heather Mac Donald, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2000  The Supreme Court ruled last week that the government can't force openly gay scoutmasters on the Boy Scouts in violation of the Scouts' moral code. But the battle is hardly over. Expect gay-rights activists to intensify the pressure on corporations, United Ways and other voluntary organizations to withhold the tens of millions of dollars they annually contribute to scouting, and to sue public entities that sponsor the Scouts for discriminating against homosexuals.  The victims of this campaign will be poor, minority children. That's because charitable dollars donated to the Scouts go mostly to the inner city. Suburban Scout troops are self-supporting; they raise their expenses through Christmas tree sales, bake sales and other means. Suburban parents can afford to buy their sons Scout uniforms, equipment and camp tuition. Inner-city families have a harder time.  When Fran Harty, a scoutmaster in the mostly white southern end of Staten Island, N.Y., takes his troop camping in Delaware, 10 fathers show up in cars. Scouts in Harlem take the bus. Corporate donations defray part of the costs of uniforms and camp fees, though in keeping with the Scout ethic of self-reliance and thrift, nothing is given away. "We ask them to earn their way to camp," explains Jim Wilson, executive director of Atlanta's Operation First Class, a program targeted at inner-city boys. Scouts have to show mastery of the Scout Oath and Law, or make progress towards Tenderfoot rank, before they are given handbooks or help with uniforms.
