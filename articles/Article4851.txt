 Coniston Discloses 6.8% Gillette Stake; Long Fight for Control Appears Likely   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1988  Coniston Partners, the New York partnership best known for pressuring Allegis Corp. into a big restructuring last year, yesterday confirmed what Wall Street arbitragers had long rumored: it holds a 6.8% stake in Gillette, and said it might seek representation on the company's board or the sale of the company.  Waiting in the wings are any number of potential acquirers, including Unilever N.V. and, ironically, Revlon Group Inc. and its chairman, Ronald O. Perelman, who last fall gave up a yearlong struggle for control of Gillette. Wall Street sources say that Mr. Perelman remains intensely interested in acquiring Gillette, but the New York investor is prohibited from seeking control by a 10-year standstill agreement signed in 1986.  Gillette indicated that it will resist Coniston. "The directors have consisently stated the view that Gillette has a bright future as an independent company," said Colman Mockler Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive. "(Coniston) appears to be trying to pressure the Gillette directors into putting the company up for sale and to stir up renewed speculation in Gillette's stock . . . The board will not be pressured. It will review this matter and take whatever action, if any, is appropriate and in the best interest of all stockholders."
