ST. LOUIS, Jan. 9â€” The St. Louis Board of Education today asked a Federal judge to include all school districts in three surrounding Missouri counties in the city's desegregation case.  A motion prepared for filing with District Judge William L. Hungate contends that the city has too few whites to desegregate schools by itself.  The board is seeking inclusion of 23 school districts in St. Louis County as well as school districts in adjacent Jefferson and St. Charles counties.  Marjorie Weir, the board's president, said that desegregation ''is a metropolitan problem'' and that it must be addressed ''in a metropolitan geographical area.''
