It's not every actor who gets to portray five characters in a single play, but for Scott Sparks, who does just that in the Off Broadway production of ''My Blue Heaven,'' the challenge is even more unusual.  In addition to playing a master of ceremonies, a minister and a book publisher, Mr. Sparks portrays both a chicken and a goat.  Neither part, however, presents a special problem for Mr. Sparks. ''I'm from Texas,'' he explained, ''and I've been around them quite a bit, especially chickens.'' It takes more than a Texas boyhood, of course, to make a man a chicken, and Mr. Sparks conceded he'd been helped in his interpretation by studying in Poland with Jerzy Grotowski, a teacher who stresses development of an actor's self-awareness more than specific technique.  ''It tapped me as a human being and helped me get in touch with myself,'' said Mr. Sparks, adding that as a result of the training he was able to act in a ''more human way.''  Does that really help in portraying a chicken? ''Yes,'' said Mr. Sparks. He ackowledged that he was proudest of his goat, a meatier part that not only had extensive dialogue, he pointed out, but required leaping as well.
