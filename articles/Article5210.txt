 Nynex, Benpres, TelecomAsia Set Philippines Pact   By By Reginald Chua, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1995  MANILA, Philippines -- As expected, Nynex Corp. of the U.S. signed an agreement with Benpres Holdings Corp. of the Philippines and TelecomAsia PCL of Thailand, under which they will invest $650 million in telecommunications projects in the Philippines, joining a crowded field of competitors looking at a potential boom in the market.  Nynex Network Systems Co. and Telecom Holding Co., a unit of TelecomAsia, will jointly acquire a 25% stake in Bayan Telecommunications Holdings Co. Manila-listed Benpres owns the remaining 75% of Bayan, which was previously named Telecommunications Holdings Corp. The name was changed to "emphasize that our project has a strong national focus," a Benpres statement said. Bayan means "nation" in the Filipino language.
