 Russia Takes a Step Back   By By Alexei Bayer, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1998  Unlike the dismissed Sergei Kiriyenko, who appealed to foreign investors but was a political lightweight at home, Viktor Chernomyrdin has a real domestic power base. During his years as prime minister, he learned to work with a hostile Duma dominated by Communists and nationalists. Mr. (Boris) Yeltsin's strategy is clear: The Chernomyrdin government will push most of the laws required by the International Monetary Fund through the Duma and increase tax collection. The IMF will then commit to a $11.2 billion installment of its loan, which is currently in doubt. This will stabilize the ruble, create preconditions for a more favorable debt-restructuring deal, and eventually restore investor confidence.  What Russia needs is to bend over backward to attract foreign multinationals. They alone have investment capital and can get access to world financial markets; they also have the know-how to build and run a modern industrial enterprise -- something Russia still sorely lacks. To lure investors back, the Russian government must convince them that it has a functioning economy. Unlike the first stock market rally in 1996-97, when economic growth was promised but never delivered, this time the Russian economy will have to achieve a true business recovery -- or at least create credible preconditions for one.
