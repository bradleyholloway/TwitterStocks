 The Surplus in Perspective   By By Lawrence B. Lindsey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2001  By contrast, 38 years ago, President Kennedy proposed a tax cut twice as big a share of gross domestic product as the one just passed. The government was running a budget deficit of 1.3% of GDP at the time, not a huge surplus as today. Saying, in his 1963 State of the Union address, that enacting the tax cut "overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress," Kennedy argued that the tax cut "will increase the purchasing power of American families and business enterprises . . . encourage the initiative and risk taking on which our free system depends, induce more investments, production, and capacity use . . . and reinforce the American principle of additional reward for additional effort."  President George W. Bush has recognized the problem and has made it clear that he will protect the Social Security surplus. He established a bipartisan commission, co-chaired by former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and AOL Time Warner executive Richard Parsons, to develop a longterm Social Security solution. Preserving the Social Security surplus for long-term reform is important for the health and credibility of the system.  New York Federal Reserve Bank President William McDonough argued that the tax cut could boost 2001 economic growth by 0.4 points (twice that rate in the last half of 2000) and by 0.7 points in 2002. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter wrote to its clients, "The tax bill . . . delivers fiscal stimulus sooner than we've been expecting and it packs a punch: we estimate that it will boost second half growth by about 1 1/4 percentage points." Jeffrey Feiner of Lehman Brothers wrote, "The tax cut comes at a good time and could be an important catalyst in the long awaited recovery."
