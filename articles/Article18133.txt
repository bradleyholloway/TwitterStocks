 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Onerous in Oregon   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1990  The nation's outstanding laboratory for citizen ballot initiatives is actually not California but Oregon, where barriers to qualifying the measures are low. Thanks to a state supreme court decision last Friday, the people retain their access to the attention of insulated public officials.  A lower court had thrown five initiatives off the ballot because officials hadn't met a deadline for preparing financial-impact statements. The suit was spearheaded by teachers unions that oppose two of the measures, which would cut property taxes and provide tax credits for school choice.  The Oregon experience isn't unique. There were similar tax-related ballot efforts in New Jersey and Illinois, but lawsuits by public-sector interests succeeded in knocking the citizen initiatives off the ballot there.
