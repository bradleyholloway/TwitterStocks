 Property Insurers To Be Assessed For Storm Losses   By By John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1998  The Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association is imposing a $100 million assessment on private insurers of homes and property around the state -- and, in effect, their policyholders -- in order to cover losses the state-created carrier suffered from Hurricane Georges and Tropical Storm Mitch.  The FWUA this week was mailing notices to the companies, which must pay within 15 days or face a penalty. The firms can, however, pass the charge on to policyholders. The move is expected to result in a one-time, 2.4% surchage on annual premiums for most homeowners and commercial-property owners.
