 Company Rings in Profits By Catering to Latinos   By By K. Oanh Ha, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1997  Indeed, with MexiTel Communications LLC, Messrs. Sneper and Davis have built a successful business by crossing racial lines and catering to the Latino community.  "The Latino customer is a loyal customer," says Mr. Davis, who was a salesman for an overnight-delivery business before he and Mr. Sneper launched MexiTel in 1995. "We learned that real quick."  Since opening their first caseta here in Oxnard 2u years ago, Messrs. Davis and Sneper have blanketed California's agricultural belt -- from the coast to the San Joaquin Valley to the Sacramento Valley -- with more than 100 phone centers in nearly 50 cities. They're particularly popular among farm laborers who often work seasonally and move around too much to establish a permanent phone number.
