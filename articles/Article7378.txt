 Under a Cloud: Bank of Boston Faces Image Problem Likely To Linger for Years --- It Pleads Guilty to a Felony, Admits Handling Money For Alleged Mob Leaders --- Poor Judgment, Chief Says   By By Davis Wessel and Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1985  The incident shows something of the style of Mr. Brown, who now is disclaiming responsibility for a controversy that is humbling the company's First National Bank of Boston, the nation's 16th-largest bank. In the past month, the bank has pleaded guilty to a felony and paid a $500,000 fine. It has admitted handling millions of dollars in cash for reputed organized-crime leaders without alerting the government. Federal officials trying to stop money laundering have made an example of it, and three congressional committees plan hearings into its cash operations.  What went wrong at Bank of Boston, which in many respects has a reputation as solid as the red granite of its headquarters building? "The record shows a lot of lack of judgment," Mr. Brown has admitted. It also shows surprisingly sloppy controls for a $22 billion bank and a devastating inability to deal with a public crisis. And it shows an aggressiveness that has helped the bank grow larger than its three nearest Boston competitors combined but also seems to have bred arrogance that has become a corporate hallmark.  The controversy began with a Justice Department investigation of Gennaro J. Angiulo, who is alleged to be the head of organized crime in Boston and who has been charged with racketeering and loansharking. For at least seven years, the bank says, Mr. Angiulo and his associates walked into a small branch in Boston's Italian North End with paper bags full of cash and walked out with cashier's checks -- 163 of them worth $2.2 million between 1980 and 1983 alone. Federal regulations, enacted in 1972 and toughened in 1980 to combat money laundering, require reports on such transactions.
