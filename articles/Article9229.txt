 Manager's Journal: Don't Give Up on Content Sites Too Soon   By By Steven Rattner, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2000  WSJ.com's success is due to content of Journal-like quality. For start-ups, without a reservoir of content from a print or broadcast version, the challenge of providing a useful product (one people will pay for) is exponentially more daunting. How can a new venture hope to assemble the material of an ESPN or CNN, just to take a couple of the popular Internet content sites?  Other believers promote the notion of targeting small audiences with niche products (e.g., the Drudge Report) that don't carry the heavy content costs of conventional ventures. No doubt some Internet models will emerge along these lines, but smaller-scale enterprises will still face the challenge of providing useful information in an Internet world of limitless access to the best content being produced anywhere on the globe, all just a few clicks away.  Perhaps in recognition of this, the ambitions of many of the start-up content plays on the Internet these days look suspiciously like those of their print or broadcast antecedents. That means heavy expenditures on content gathering -- a tough challenge under the best of circumstances. Why would any right-thinking investor back Salon or Slate when quality magazines like the New Republic or the Weekly Standard haven't made money for years?
