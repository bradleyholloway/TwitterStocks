 Honda, Toyota to Introduce `Hybrid' Cars in U.S.   By By Robert L. Simison, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1999  The two-seat Insight uses a tiny one-liter, three-cylinder engine -- with an electric motor for extra power when needed -- to hold fuel consumption to record-low levels for an auto in the U.S. market. The car topped the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's high-mileage list Friday with a rating of 61 miles a gallon in city driving and 70 on the highway.  When it goes on sale in the U.S. in December, the Insight will be the first such "hybrid" gasoline/electric-powered auto on the U.S. market. But it will be joined next spring by Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius, a more-traditional four-door sedan, which uses similar technology to hold down fuel consumption and emissions. Toyota has been selling the Prius in Japan for the past two years.  The Prius uses similar technology to that of the Insight, but it relies on a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder engine with an electric-motor supplement. Toyota says that under a Japanese testing protocol, the Prius gets about 66 miles a gallon in city driving. Toyota and Honda both plan to offer the vehicles in environment-conscious Europe next year.
