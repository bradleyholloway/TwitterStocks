 Politics & Economics: Bush Touts His Immigration View As House Republicans Push Theirs   By Lueck, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2006  Mr. [Bush], when visiting a Northern Virginia business run by immigrants, reiterated his belief that immigration changes should include expanded guest-worker programs and a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S. Mr. Bush said that "we're not going to be able to deport people who have been here, working hard and raising their families." He added, "I want to work with Congress to come up with a rational way forward."  Yesterday, Mr. Bush emphasized his support of fines for employers that hire illegal workers and his desire to "help people assimilate" by learning English -- both ideas that resonate with House Republicans. However, the differences between the House and Senate positions loom larger than shared aspects. House leaders haven't budged on their opposition to extending citizenship to illegal immigrants, which they call amnesty but which supporters of the Senate bill say is the only practical way to deal with longtime workers. Election-year concerns and a packed schedule make it even less likely the chambers will compromise by this fall, when lawmakers head home to campaign.
