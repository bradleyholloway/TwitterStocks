 Soon You Can Ditch Telemarketers --- Free Do-Not-Call Service To Begin Ahead of Schedule; FTC Web Site Opens by July   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2003  When that effort failed, the trade group filed a lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma accusing the FTC of impinging on its free-speech rights and seeking an injunction allowing telemarketers to continue making unsolicited calls while the lawsuit proceeded through the court. But a federal judge ruled against the trade group in late March, saying that telemarketers had to comply with the registry because they were unlikely to win their lawsuit against it.  In a statement, the DMA, which has proposed the creation of a universal list run by the Federal Communications Commission that would supersede the state programs, said the FTC had "jumped the gun and opened the door to potential federal bureaucratic duplication that could lead to marketer and consumer confusion." The FTC program, it argued, exempts phone companies and other high-volume telemarketers and makes it very expensive for telemarketing companies to buy access to the registry.
