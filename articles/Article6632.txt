 New York Firms Prepare in Case Of Transit Strike   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2002  Multex.com Inc., for instance, says its Long Island facility -- about 20 miles from Manhattan -- got a workout after Sept. 11, 2001, when it became the headquarters for many employees who couldn't make their way into New York City. That gives the data firm confidence in using it again. "It's going to be difficult, but we'll still get the job done," said a spokeswoman, who also said home computer connections and reserved hotel rooms in Manhattan will keep senior executives in business.  Of course, not everybody can telecommute. New York Clearing House, a check-exchange and payment-processing association owned by Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., FleetBoston Financial Corp. and several other big banks, has obtained 50 buses to take 10,000 bank employees, exchange-floor traders and others daily to work from various points in Manhattan. "These are not executives, but people who turn the wheels. And there's a lot of these people," says Al Wood, senior vice president, information technology for the clearing house. FleetBoston will offer bus service in New York City's other neighborhoods to connect employees to the New York Clearing House buses in Manhattan.
