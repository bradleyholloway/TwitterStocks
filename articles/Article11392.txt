 Oppenheimer & Co. to Name a Chief of M&A Operation   By Siconolfi, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1990  The securities firm plans to announce today that Managing Director Edward C. Stanton III will lead its 10-member mergers-and-acquisition department. It also will name Charles A. Tulloh III to head a new restructuring group, and J. Brian McGrath to run the firm's leisure and entertainment group.  Mr. Stanton, 47 years old, fills a void left since early 1989, when former Oppenheimer merger head John Sanzo left for First Boston Corp. Since 1987, Mr. Stanton has been a co-general partner at a Houston leveraged buy-out fund; he earlier had worked as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers and Blyth Eastman Dillon.  In an interview, he conceded that Oppenheimer "needs more M&A firepower"; the firm has never been a force in investment banking. But he said Oppenheimer plans to move slowly. "We don't want to do anything outlandishly aggressive," he said.
