 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1991  In a stunning victory over former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, Democrat Harris Wofford capitalized on an outsider campaign that stressed health-care and economic issues. The showing of Wofford, a former college president who was appointed to the Senate after Republican John Heinz died in an air crash, confirmed reports of voter unease, not only with Bush administration policies, but also with professional politicians. At one point during the campaign, Thornburgh held a 44-point lead in the polls.  The Senate voted 64-31 to approve the nomination of Gates to head the intelligence agency, ending a lengthy confirmation process that exposed serious weaknesses in the CIA's performance over the past decade. The vote represented a personal triumph for the 48-year-old national security aide, who saw the same job elude him in 1987 in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair. A protege of the late CIA chief Casey, Gates's challenge will be to show he can lead the agency in the post-Cold War world.  A former Soviet analyst, Gates is the first career CIA officer to be director in nearly two decades. His climb owes much to the loyalties of Bush as well as Senate Intelligence Chairman Boren.
