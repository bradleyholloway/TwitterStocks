 FDIC Designs Formula to Set Rates Banks Will Pay for Deposit Insurance   By Bacon, Kenneth H, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1992  The FDIC is developing a nine-cell matrix (built from three categories of capital and three categories of supervision) to be used in assessing risk-based deposit insurance premiums. The new system will take effect in 1993 and will increase average insurance premium costs from $0.23 currently to $0.27-.28, helping the FDIC reduce the deficit it expects from bank failure resolution expenses. Banks object to the risk-based premiums being implemented so soon.
