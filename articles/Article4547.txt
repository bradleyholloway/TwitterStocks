 Futures Markets: Rate Contracts Fall As Concern Grows About Inflation   By By Delia Flores, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1985  After the futures markets closed, prices for U.S. government notes and bonds continued to decline on cash markets in response to a report of a larger-than-expected rise in the nation's basic money supply during the week ended July 1. The report, released after futures-trading ended, dispelled hopes of any easing of credit by the Federal Reserve System.  Economic crosscurrents swept the futures markets yesterday, however. Although foreign-currency futures mostly continued to rise for the seventh consecutive trading session, nonfinancial commodity futures generally declined, according to an index compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau, which fell to 226.4 from 228 the previous day. Theoretically, a dollar decline would tend to bolster commodity prices by increasing demand for commodities priced in dollars and discouraging competing imports.  But yesterday, an oil price cut by Mexico helped depress commodity futures prices; falling oil prices tend to hold down inflation. Mexico reduced its average price of heavy crude by 77 cents a barrel, and cut average quotes for its light crude by $1.24 a barrel. The Mexican move prevented futures on the British pound from joining the rally in foreign-currency contracts; Great Britain, an oil producer, is particularly vulnerable to energy price trends.
