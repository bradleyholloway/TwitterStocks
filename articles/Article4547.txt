 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1989  Despite a surging dollar that makes pricey U.S. goods less competitive abroad, some manufacturers say exports remain strong. "Exports are an important area that's holding up and growing faster than the economy as a whole," says Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corp., New York. He expects the rest of the year to resemble a "relay race" with export and capital spending passing the baton to domestic demand which may revive, thanks to declining interest rates.  Scientific Atlanta Inc., an Atlanta-based telecommunications concern, says export sales jumped to more than 20% of total sales from 14% last year. "We already have six months booked in backlog," says William E. Johnson, chief executive. "But we'll certainly be booking more because export has become such a significant factor for us." Tandem Computers Inc., Cupertino, Calif., says exports soared 30% last year and expects continued growth.  The San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network calls for a boycott of all tropical hardwoods from Southeast Asia where some of the oldest rain forests on Earth are being scorched by development. Sculptor Mark Behme of Silver Spring, Md., stopped using the rare, brilliant orange wood of the Padauk tree a couple of years ago. Mr. Behme substitutes walnut and cherry, applying stains and dyes for more exotic colors. He says the switch "hasn't made a difference to sales."
