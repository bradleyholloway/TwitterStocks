 Watching the Web   By By Andrea Petersen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2000  The executives at E-Book Systems, the producers of FlipBrowser, think the way we're surfing the Web is all wrong. Instead of scrolling down Web pages, they say, we should "flip" them like a book. The free FlipBrowser software reformats Web pages into a book-like format complete with "pages." Users can still click on hypertext. But instead of using the "back" button common in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator browsers, FlipBrowser users wield their mouse to jump back and forth between numbered digital pages. The software works really well when viewing online photo albums. Since FlipBrowser streams the pages, downloading images is fairly quick. But surfing the Web with FlipBrowser is kind of a pain. The "pages" are so thin that it is difficult to click on the right one with a mouse. Most Web pages don't fit on one computer screen, so users still have to scroll down to see all of the content. And if you've spent an hour cruising around the Web, how are you going to remember what is on page 5 of your "book"? After a day of experimenting with FlipBrowser, I sure missed my old back button.
