 Teamsters Are Intensifying Organizing At Delta Air, Federal Express, Others   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1997  UPS presented the proposal to the pilots as federally mediated talks resumed yesterday in Louisville, Ky. The company said the process means that even if the pilots vote down the proposal, UPS wouldn't face the threat of a strike until "well into 1998." The reason: UPS said it agreed to arbitration if the pilots reject the latest proposal, and if the pilots don't agree to arbitration, the mediator would restart talks.  At FedEx, the Memphis-based express-package giant, Teamsters' organizers plan to use the attractive contract the union wrapped up last week with UPS after a 15-day strike, as a lure for 90,000 nonmanagement workers, whom it has been seeking to organize for years. One strategy: The union plans to encourage UPS workers who encounter their FedEx counterparts at the docking bays and service elevators all over the country to talk up the benefits of unionizing.  Meanwhile, in recent weeks, Teamsters' organizers have been intensifying efforts to organize 7,000 Delta mechanics in the wake of successfully organizing 4,800 mechanics at Continental Airlines in July. But almost immediately upon arriving in Atlanta, the Teamsters' energies were diverted to the UPS strike.
