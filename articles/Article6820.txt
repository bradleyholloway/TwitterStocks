 GE's Gains Are Tepid, But Key Units Do Well; Power Business Is Weak, But Growth in Other Lines Augurs Stronger Economy   By Kranhold, Kathryn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2004  GE's chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, told investors Friday that GE was seeing "broad economic growth" and is "building good backlogs for the future." GE said its net income was $3.92 billion, or 38 cents a share, compared with $3.79 billion, or 38 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Its revenue grew 11% to $37.04 billion from $33.37 billion.  GE is considered a bellwether for the economy because of its breadth of businesses that are affected by short- and long-term trends. GE makes aircraft engines, medical diagnostic equipment, appliances, light bulbs, plastic and power turbines, and provides financial services such as credit cards to consumers and loans to midmarket businesses. GE owns Universal's movie studios, theme parks and cable channels, which have been combined with its NBC network and cable channels; it also has expanded into the biosciences through its acquisition of Amersham PLC of the U.K.
