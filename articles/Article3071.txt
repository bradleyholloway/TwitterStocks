 Review / TV: Could've-Been Contenders   By By Nancy deWolf Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 2002  SURFER'S GUIDE: There's at least one house in every town that goes berserk with lights and other ornaments at Christmas time. Statistics fly by in "America's Greatest Christmas Decorations" (Sunday, Dec. 15, 7-8 p.m. EST on NBC), a sampling of over-the-top decorators from Little Rock, Ark., to Las Vegas. Three million lights around one house (and a court case that pulled the plug). Half a million lights in Bakersfield, Calif., plus snow machines and fog machines. And a guy with 7.8 miles of wire and 130,055 lights, connected by 548 circuits to a computer, because, as he says, "I believe lights aren't just there to be on, they're to be flashed . . . in sequence."  "History vs. Hollywood: Gangs of New York" (Monday, Dec. 16, 11 p.m.-midnight EST) is the latest in the History Channel series about moviemaking and historical accuracy. It features clips from the Martin Scorsese movie, opening next week, about gang warfare in mid-19th-century New York, along with a tour of the former Five Points neighborhood (now Chinatown) where filthy streets in the city's worst slum often ran red with the blood of gangs with names like the Dead Rabbits and the Bowery Boys. It appears from the film clips that the bad guys were the Nativist brutes who harassed Irish immigrants, although Mr. Scorsese (no Oliver Stone, he) explains that he seeks to use history only "as a springboard and project it to an opera." The historians featured also point to ties between the Irish-dominated police force and corrupt politicians. After Sept.11, it's comforting to look back and be reminded that, no matter what, New York was and always will be teeming with life.
