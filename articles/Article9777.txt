 The Economy; THE OUTLOOK: Texas Economy Heads South on Costlier Oil   By Gold, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2005  "For the last few years, we've felt that high prices were a wash, but in the last year we've started to say it's a negative," says Gary Preuss, the state economist who built the comptroller's model.  Texas has had a hard time shaking off the most recent economic downturn, regardless of the soaring oil prices. While the U.S. went through a relatively brief recession in 2001, the Texas economy contracted for 28 months, ending in August 2003, according to the Dallas Fed. Since pulling out of recession, Texas's economic growth has lagged behind the rest of the U.S. Last year, the state's job growth was 1.3%, below the nation's 1.7%.  A BIG PART of the reason for Texas's recent swoon is that it had a bad hangover from being such a highflier in the late 1990s. It courted the high-technology industry as part of its diversification effort. In fact, the industry had a bigger boom, relatively speaking, than anywhere else -- including California's Silicon Valley. "We grew faster and came down with a thud," says Mine Yucel, senior economist with the Dallas Fed. She recently compiled data that show Texas had relatively more employment growth than California in the 1990s in several high-technology categories, including telecommunications services and computer-equipment manufacturing.
