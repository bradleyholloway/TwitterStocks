 Mitsubishi Motors Stalls As Yen Falls   By Reitman, Valerie, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1995  Mr. [Andrew Blair-Smith] says profits will be five billion to six billion yen higher if the yen stays at current levels for the remaining seven months of Mitsubishi's fiscal year. "Even if they hedged through the fall, they'll still get the benefit for the rest of the year," he says -- not knowing how far Mitsubishi's hedges actually extend.  The errant hedge isn't Mitsubishi's only problem. Ms. [Chikao Masuzawa] also notes that demand has eased for Mitsubishi's trucks, the most profitable product range in Mitsubishi's lineup of everything from small cars to huge touring buses. Trucks make up about 20% of Mitsubishi's sales and kick in an even greater share of its profit.  Of course, Mitsubishi stands to benefit long term if the yen stays at current levels after April 1996 or continues to fall. Mr. Blair-Smith sees reasons besides currency to recommend the stock. "Sales are doing well and their overseas subsidiaries are picking up," he says. Mitsubishi is well positioned in Southeast Asia, he notes, which is emerging as an export base for Mitsubishi, and its U.S. operation is picking up steam.
