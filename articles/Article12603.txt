 France's Sanofi Posts 58% Profit Surge Amid Shake-Up   By By Stephen D. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2000  The management shake-up wasn't a complete surprise. For months, rumors of bitter clashes between Mr. [Herve Guerin], 59 years old, and Sanofi Chairman Jean-Francois Dehecq, 60, have been about in the Paris markets. According to company officials, Mr. Guerin's abrasive management style irked executives accustomed to the independence they had enjoyed under Mr. Dehecq's tenure as head of the old Sanofi.  People close to Sanofi and Mr. Guerin gave conficting accounts of the events preceeding the board's decision to fire him at a meeting Monday evening. As recently as Saturday evening, Mr. Guerin denied that his departure might be imminent, and in a phone interview yesterday, he said it "had come as a complete surprise." By contrast, people familiar with deliberations of Sanofi's board claimed that directors had decided informally in mid-July that Mr. Guerin should be stripped of his management posts to end the feuding with Mr. Dehecq.
