 The Estrada Filibuster   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  We hope Republicans don't let them get away with it. The truth is that Democrats have no reason to oppose Mr. [Miguel Estrada] other than the fact that he is a conservative who also happens to be Hispanic. They have nothing else against him. The Washington Post, no conservative redoubt, calls him "well-qualified for the bench," as does the American Bar Association. He is a Honduran immigrant who made his way to Harvard and a distinguished career by dint of hard work. But Democrats are petrified that Mr. Estrada might be future Supreme Court material, so they want to kill him now before he can get the appeals-court credential.
