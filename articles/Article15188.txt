 Glossy Garden Magazines Offer Fertile Ground for Upscale Ads   By By Meg Cox, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1994  And existing gardening magazines, though plentiful, are small, niche publications like Fine Gardening and Horticulture, whose advertising is largely limited to compost-bin makers and seed companies. There is no such thing as a glossy, mainstream gardening publication full of upscale ads that attract the one million subscribers of Bon Appetit, say, or Field & Stream's two million. The most popular title is no-frills, 50-year-old Organic Gardening, with a circulation of 775,000 and virtually zero nongardening ads.  Several savvy publishers are determined to change that. Arriving on news stands today is Garden Design, a sleepy magazine that was acquired and lavishly overhauled by Christopher Meigher, a former Time Inc. executive. He is aiming for a circulation of half a million and loads of upscale advertisers. "We see our magazine as more like Architectural Digest than Horticulture; a gorgeous lifestyle magazine more than a how-to gardening magazine," says Mr. Meigher, now chairman of Meigher Communications L.P. in New York.  And giant publisher Meredith Corp. of Des Moines, Iowa, plans to start a major mass-market gardening magazine next year, hoping to reach a circulation of at least one million. It is tentatively called Home Garden and Landscape, says Christopher Little, publishing director for Better Homes & Gardens. Meredith wants its magazine to be "beautiful but heavy on the basic service journalism."
