 Off the Beaten Track / European Bookshops   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2004  -- Budapest: TheWriters Bookshop is a comfy literary den rich in Hungarian fiction, poetry, fine-art publications and English-language books. The shop's heritage is as rich as its selection. For the first half of the past century, the bookshop was the Japanese Coffee House,a literary hangout. It became Spark Bookstore around 1955 during the Communist era and remained state-run until 1991, when a group of 14 employees became co-owners.
