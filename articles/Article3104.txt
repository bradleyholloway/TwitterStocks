 Will France and Germany's Double Vision Give EU a Headache?   By By Brandon Mitchener, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  A double-headed EU leadership could turn into a "potentially disastrous" Medusa, said Andrew Duff, a U.K. Liberal Democrat member of the European Parliament. "Two executive presidents of the union is a recipe for internal conflict and external cacophony." At the executive branch, called the European Commission, the idea of a rival president over at the council also got a cool reception. "The problem is determining whether this is a simplification or complication" of the EU's institutional architecture, Romano Prodi, the commission president, said recently. "Our citizens demand a simplification."  Kirsty Hughes, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies, a Brussels-based think tank, said Messrs. [Jacques Chirac] and [Gerhard Schroeder] left out so many details that they made it difficult to discuss the proposal seriously. "It isn't clear what the territory of the EU president is going to be," she said, adding that she couldn't imagine how a council president -- most likely a former head of state -- would be able to pull rank on any EU country's current leader in policy debates.
