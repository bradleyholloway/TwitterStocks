 In Response to Firestone Recall, Senate Passes Bill to Overhaul Auto-Safety Laws   By By Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  Sen. [John McCain] later offered the House bill as a compromise, after his bill was blocked through a parliamentary maneuver known as a hold, under which lawmakers can anonymously halt action on a bill. Only one senator, George Voinovich (R., Ohio), has acknowledged having blocked the measure, although his office said he withdrew his objections based on an agreement that Sen. McCain would change some language in the criminal provisions.  Some of those requirements were unthinkable for auto lobbyists just a few months ago. For instance, the bill would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop regulations mandating systems that would warn drivers if tires are underinflated. It also directs regulators to devise real-world tests that assess vehicles' propensity to roll over. The agency's current proposal for doing so relies on a mathematical formula involving the vehicle's width and center of gravity -- a method that both consumer groups and industry lobbyists had faulted.
