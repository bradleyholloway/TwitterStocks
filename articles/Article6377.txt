 Extra! Extra! France's Le Monde Seeks Partner   By Jo Wrighton and Simon Clow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2004  Le Monde's difficulties have come as France's national and regional newspaper industry is going through a shake-up. Earlier this year aviation tycoon Serge Dassault took control of Socpresse, the publishing group that owns Le Figaro, Le Monde's closest rival.  That step sparked protests against the growing concentration of the French press in the hands of a few wealthy industrialists. Lagardere SCA, a family-controlled media and defense group, already controls a large chunk of France's regional newspapers, while billionaire Francois Pinault owns both Le Point and a small stake in Le Monde.  Le Monde saw its circulation climb during the social upheaval of the late 1960s, and it reached perhaps its zenith of influence during the early days of President Francois Mitterand's government in the 1980s. More recently, however, the newspaper has struggled, with circulation falling and advertising revenue in decline. Current management at Le Monde, headed by the paper's former political editor, Jean-Marie Colombani, took over in the mid-1990s with a mandate to shake up the newspaper.
