 Ariba, Digital Lava Spark Rally In Dot-Coms That Lifts Nasdaq   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2000  Whitehall Jewellers (NYSE) lost more than half its market value, diving 9 7/16, or 54%, to 8 3/16, after hitting a 52-week low of 8 intraday. The Chicago jewelry retailer said it expects to report second-quarter earnings of two cents to five cents a share, well below the 18 cents expected by analysts. The company said its second-quarter sales at stores open more than a year will be slightly down to flat, compared with a 12% rise last year. Banc of America and Janney Montgomery Scott were among the firms that downgraded Whitehall's stock.  Three-Five Systems (NYSE) plummeted 311, or 48%, to 33 9/16. The Tempe, Ariz., maker of liquid-crystal displays posted second-quarter earnings that beat analysts' projections, but said that slower business from Motorola, one of its top customers, will crimp its revenue in the second half. Securities firms ING Barings and Banc of America lowered their ratings on Three-Five stock.  IDX Systems jumped 2 7/16, or 17%, to 16 15/16 after the South Burlington, Vt., provider of health-care data agreed to sell its ChannelHealth to Allscripts in a stock deal valued at about $250.5 million. Allscripts also will become, through a 10-year alliance, the exclusive provider of IDX's Internet and point-of-care software that is sold to physician practices.
