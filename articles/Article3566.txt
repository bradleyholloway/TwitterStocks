 SmartMoney: Fight Those Rising Rates   By Kapadia, Reshma, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  The Federal Reserve's next move is anyone's guess, but one thing is clear: It's much costlier to borrow money than a couple of years ago, when banks were almost giving cash away. After the Fed's most recent rate boost Wednesday, short-term rates have quintupled to 5% in less than two years. While many economists predict the Fed will soon stop its credit-tightening campaign, the rates that consumers pay on debts from mortgages to credit cards could keep climbing, because some rates lag. Here is a plan of action that could save you money.  Let's say you took out your 3/1 ARM in 2003 at 3.8%. It will reset to a higher rate this year, but in many cases the annual increase is capped at two percentage points so you'll pay 5.8% -- less than what you'd get by shifting into a 30-year, fixed-rate right now. If the Fed's next move after the rate-raising campaign is to nudge rates back down, those who waited and stomached higher payments could refinance at more attractive levels. New-home buyers, however, should opt for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage since it costs only a half of a percentage point more than a five-year ARM.
