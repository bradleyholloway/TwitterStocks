McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  Grain futures rose at the Chicago Board of Trade after a weekly Agriculture Department report showed strong export sales.

Nearby wheat rose 1.5 cents to a two-week high of $2.6325 a bushel. Soybeans rose one cent to $5.165 a bushel, and corn rose one cent to $2.2725 a bushel.
