 Strong Finish Expected for Top Biotech Firms   By By Melanie Trottman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1999  Analysts said the ruling was the highlight of Amgen's quarter and will boost the long-term growth potential at the company. Sales of the anemia drug Epogen and the white blood-cell booster Neupogen powered earnings during the fourth quarter. Ms. (Elise) Wang expects Epogen to rake in fourth-quarter sales of $362 million, up 25% from a year earlier. The growth follows eased Medicare reimbursement restrictions on the drug last year and should lead Amgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., to quarterly net income of 84 cents a share, compared with 67 cents a year earlier, according to a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.  Wall Street expects Biogen will earn 54 cents a share, compared with 42 cents a year earlier, according to First Call's consensus. Analysts cite the Cambridge, Mass., company's multiple sclerosis drug Avonex for the increase.  At Centocor Inc., sales of ReoPro, the company's flagship drug used in angioplasty, are expected to fuel earnings. SG Cowen's Mr. (Eric) Schmidt said he expects sales of the drug could top the record $101 million recorded in the second quarter and expects "hefty" sales of Remicade, Centocor's recently launched drug for Crohn's disease. In a recent industry report, SG Cowen said an extensive physician survey it conducted indicated Remicade is on track to become Centocor's third major commercial product.
