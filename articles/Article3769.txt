 Earnings Digest -- Retail: TJX Net Rises 8%, but Warm Fall Hurts Results   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  Hackers broke into TJX's computer system and had the potential to gain access to tens of millions of customers' credit information. A federal judge last month said the banks that had issued the compromised cards could seek damages from TJX to cover losses. TJX has filed a motion to dismiss the two claims remaining by the plaintiffs in the case.  TJX said in March that at least 45.7 million cards were exposed to possible fraud, although recent court filings by banks suing TJX estimate the total at more than 100 million.
