 Investment Dartboard: Pros and Darts Hit Below Mark For Six Months   By By Georgette Jasen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1998  The pros were led by a short seller who benefited from the downturn in technology stocks. Pegasystems Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., company that develops customer-service software, fell 25.9% during the competition. That translated into a 25.9% gain for Howard Schilit, president of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville, Md. (In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed stock, betting that the price will drop by the time the loan has to be repaid.)  But the market's recent turbulence isn't keeping the pros from another round against the forces of chance. As is customary for this contest, the first- and second-place pros return for another six months. Mr. Schilit and Mr. (Alan H.) Wapnick will be joined by Richard Pender, senior vice president of Sentinel Advisors in Montpelier, Vt., and by Chris W. Walker, president of Pillar Capital Management in Clarkston, Mich.  For his second round against the darts, Mr. Wapnick, who also manages Lexington's Growth and Income Fund, is going with Data General Corp., a Westboro, Mass., company that designs, manufactures and markets computer servers and data-storage products. "It's a beaten up, thoroughly mauled tech stock," Mr. Wapnick says. He expects the combination of new technology and recent cost-cutting and restructuring to provide "some positive surprises" in coming months. The stock closed yesterday down 6.25 cents at $9.1875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, down from a 52-week high of $34.875 a year ago.
