 Green Cards Can Color Allied Attitudes   By By John H. Fund and Grover Norquist, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1986  Air strikes against Libya demonstrate that the U.S. is able to deal with implacable enemies. But the refusal of the French and Spanish governments to allow U.S. warplanes to pass over their territory and the reluctance of European nations to support Washington in effective economic and diplomatic sanctions against an outlaw state highlight the lack of any meaningful American leverage over its allies. It's time to use U.S. immigration laws as an instrument of foreign policy.  What should we do? First, take a look at Greek immigration to the U.S. and note that the early 1985 waiting list of Greeks eager to leave the crucible of democracy for our shores held 7,594 names. Others are discouraged from applying by the long list, which can take years to clear. The U.S. Embassy could quietly let out word that we are passing out green cards or work permits to a certain number of Greek doctors and civil engineers. Our medical and engineering professions could absorb 500 Greek doctors and 1,000 civil engineers without seriously affecting U.S. pay scales, but Greece could ill afford to lose those doctors and engineers attracted by higher pay and a better standard of living. And just what could a chastened Mr. Papandreou do in return? Offer to allow Americans to emigrate to Greece? And would Mr. Papandreou really go on television and denounce the U.S. for allowing greater numbers of Greeks to trade Athens for Atlanta? After all, Mr. Papandreou spent several productive years himself in the U.S., even going so far as to become a U.S. citizen.
