 If You Cancel a Conference, This Hotel Won't Charge   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  Although most hotel chains waived such fees in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many hotels now include those fees in standard contracts. A spokesman for Marriott International Inc., which has about 350 Marriott and Renaissance branded full-service hotels that host meetings, said the company handles each meeting individually. "There's a great deal of flexibility within each of our properties," said the spokesman, who said about 40% of Marriott's business comes from group bookings. He added that the company doesn't plan to issue an across-the-board policy about cancellation fees. Similarly, Jamie Walters, senior vice president of sales at Wyndham International Inc., said the company doesn't plan a blanket policy, but will negotiate with meeting planners individually.
