 Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 2000  [Frederick Reiken], whose first novel, "The Odd Sea" (1998), was well-received, has delivered a memorable second novel about a young man's journey to maturity in a family marked by emotional upheaval during an era characterized by rootlessness. Yet somehow [Anthony Rubin] doesn't get sucked into the Zeitgeist of disco, inflation, Jimmy Carter and first-term Ronald Reagan. His blossoming love for Juliette is precious and precarious. The two young lovers know from the start that their relationship can't last, but they make the most of what they have. It's a Lancelot-and-Guinevere scenario, but Mr. Reiken isn't heavy-handed about the "Le Morte d'Arthur" imagery he sprinkles throughout the narrative. Quite the contrary, his light touch saves this story of family dysfunction and young love from being trite or familiar.
