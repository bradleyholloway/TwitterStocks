 Blue Chips Slip Despite Early Gains   By Karmin, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2004  Stocks climbed at the opening bell, as bargain hunters picked through the carnage of last week's powerful selloff that sent many stocks to their lowest levels since the fall. But with oil prices climbing to another high, investors have become increasing concerned about the sustainability of the economic recovery and are starting to wonder whether it will temper the Federal Reserve's convictions about future interest-rate increases.  "People are nervous right now, and they are worried about doing anything too bold," says Tim Heekin, director of trading at Thomas Weisel Partners.  "The lack of consistency in the data is one big reason why the market is struggling," says Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price.
