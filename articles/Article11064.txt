 Holiday's President Goeglein to Retire To Pursue Personal Business Interests   By By Betsy Morris, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1987  Holiday Corp. said Richard J. Goeglein, president and chief operating officer, will take early retirement to pursue personal business interests, probably to become a Holiday franchisee.  However, a spokesman said that Mr. Goeglein had been discussing his departure for several months with Michael Rose, Holiday's chairman and chief executive officer. The spokesman insisted that the parting, scheduled to take place at the end of the year, was amicable and that Mr. Goeglein hadn't been asked to leave. "He's talked for some time about wanting to move to his farm in California and developing hotels, probably some Embassy Suites or Hampton Inns," the spokesman said.
