 Moving the Market: Tokyo, Korea Stock Exchanges to Broaden Alliance   By Andrew Morse and Hiroyuki Kachi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2006  Though the alliance between the TSE and the Korea Exchange, or KRX, is looser than a formal merger, it is clearly aimed at strengthening the relationship in a way that enhances business for both. The two exchanges hope the alliance will enable capital to flow more easily between Japan and South Korea, according to a draft of a statement to be released by the exchanges Friday.  The TSE has begun to recruit listings from companies in other parts of the region and plans to open an office in China, where many young companies are eager to tap the deep pockets of overseas investors. The TSE has loose alliances with 13 other exchanges, including the NYSE, Euronext and China's Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges. But the alliance with KRX could lead to a more substantial relationship.
