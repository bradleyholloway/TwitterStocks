 European Report: Europe's Weapons Makers Zero In On Pentagon; Spanish TV Jitters   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1985  The weapons manufacturers -- including Oerlikon-Buhrle Holding AG of Switzerland, British Aerospace PLC, and Thomson-CSF of France -- hope to peddle their own antiaircraft systems in the U.S. The impetus: Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's surprise decision to cancel further purchases of the U.S.-made Divad air-defense gun because of its poor performance and $4 billion price tag. The Pentagon's intention to start shopping all over again provides "a new opening for us" to sell in the U.S., says an Oerlikon official.  Thomson-CSF plans to recommend its Shahine air-defense system, initially built for Saudi Arabia. But British Aerospace hopes its own Rapier missiles, which it says downed 14 Argentine aircraft during the 1982 Falklands war, might have an edge; Washington already bought about $100 million of them a few years ago for its bases in Britain.  However, full membership in the EMS could pose fresh political problems for Britain. Part of the success of the EMS over the past few years has been the subordination of French policies to those formulated in West Germany, as the mark has come to dominate the system. Although Britain is committed to sound money policies, it has a history of much higher inflation than West Germany. It also has a long history of resisting the advice of West Germany and France.
