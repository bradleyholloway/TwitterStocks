 Stick Figures: Now, A Pool-Cue Market Draws Deep Pockets --- But Boon for Brokers Is Bane For Purists Who Decry Losses to the Display Case   By By Dawn Blalock, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1996  Mr. Montaqu, a pony-tailed fashion photographer and pool-cue collector, says of the trend: "There is a legitimacy to collecting these cues." Given the workmanship, the time it takes to create them and the reputations of the artisans and users, the once lowly cue has clearly risen to the level of art, he says.  For about a decade now, the cue-as-art market has been escalating, spurred largely by the appearance of Paul Newman and Tom Cruise in a 1986 pool movie, "The Color of Money." Two years ago one U.S. collector paid $45,000 for a cue made by George Balabushka, among a handful of pre-eminent American cue makers. Cues of famous players are also hot; the widow of Willie Mosconi has turned down six figures for a Balabushka cue he played with before his death, says John Wright, the cue broker who approached her on behalf of a client. (She couldn't be reached for comment.)  Cue maker Barry Szamboti, of Feasterville, Pa., says he has decided to keep his prices down a bit to encourage players -- and not just investors -- to purchase his cues. "I wish that it was 100% players, because every cue I make I want it to be played with," says Mr. Szamboti, the son of the late renowned cue maker Gus Szamboti. So unhappy is he about the whole cue-buying scene, he balked at going to the event at the Biltmore.
