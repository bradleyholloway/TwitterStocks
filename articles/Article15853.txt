 Singapore's Bank Shares Are Still Attractive On Anticipation of Consolidation in the Sector   By By Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1999  Singapore has five local banks -- Development Bank of Singapore, Oversea-Chinese Banking, Overseas Union Bank, United Overseas Bank and Keppel TatLee Bank -- but the government would like to have even fewer.  Last week, Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew reiterated the government's long-held view that Singapore's banks must consolidate further. But while neighboring Malaysia is forcing a consolidation among its banks, Mr. Lee says it is up to the market to decide how consolidation takes place. He did predict that Singapore likely will end up with two big banks and one or two niche players.  By contrast, analysts figure, there is more scope for change at Oversea-Chinese Banking and Overseas Union Bank, despite family interests in these banks. Oversea-Chinese Banking's chairman, Lee Seng Wee, is a member of the Lee family, which has shares in the bank and in the Lee group of companies. But Oversea-Chinese Banking last year brought in a career banker, Alex Au, as vice chairman and chief executive to shake up the bank. Mr. Au spent most of his career at Hang Seng Bank, and was the bank's chief executive in Hong Kong. When he left Hang Seng Bank, he did a brief stint at Standard Chartered in London before quitting to join Oversea-Chinese Banking in Singapore. Analysts say Mr. Au seems willing to pursue merger opportunities.
