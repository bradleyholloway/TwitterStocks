SILVER SPRING, Md. Oct. 2â€” The bidding war for Cenco Inc., one of the nation's largest nursing home operators, expanded today as a Canadian company appeared as a possible suitor.  And National Medical Enterprises Inc. of Los Angeles, the company that was apparently being outbid in its attempt to take over Cenco, said that it was extending its tender offer deadline for Cenco stock to keep its options open.  James Fingeroth, a spokesman for National Medical, said that it would continue to purchase Cenco shares at $14 a share through Oct. 9.  The boards of Cenco, of Oak Brook, Ill., and Manor Care Inc., of Silver Spring, agreed yesterday to Manor Care's bid of $16.50 for ''any and all'' Cenco shares. The offer is valued at $206.8 million.  Cenco operates 83 nursing homes with 10,000 beds. Manor Care owns 23 nursing homes with 3,240 beds and also owns general hospitals and Quality Inns, a hotel-motel owner, operator and franchiser. If completed, the merger would make Manor Care the nation's fo urthlargest nursing home operator.  Extendicare Ltd., a large nursing home operation based in Toronto, also said that it was ''taking a look at'' Cenco, according to Winston Ling, the vice president of finance. But he declined to say whether Extendicare would join the bidding battle.  Manor Care, founded in 1968, earned $7.6 million, or $1.71 a share, in its fiscal year ended May 31, on revenues of $91.7 million. It recently completed the purchase of Quality Inns. It also operates general hospitals and drug-rehabilitation centers.
