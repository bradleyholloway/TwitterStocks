 EU May Expand Its Investigation Of BT-AT&T   By By Brandon Mitchener and Jennifer Schenker, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1998  The European Commission signaled it has difficulties with the proposed $11 billion joint venture between British Telecommunications PLC and AT&T Corp., which now appears headed for a full-scale antitrust investigation.
