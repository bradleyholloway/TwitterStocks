 Survival of the Busiest --- Parts of the Brain That Get Most Use Literally Expand And Rewire on Demand   By By Sharon Begley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 2002  This view of the brain dates back to 1857, when French neurosurgeon Paul Broca discovered that particular regions are specialized for particular functions, such as language. His and subsequent discoveries gave rise to the dogma of the hard-wired adult brain, and it had profound real-world consequences. It held that if the brain sustained injury through stroke or trauma to, say, a region responsible for moving the left arm, then other regions could not step up to the plate and pinch-hit. The function of the injured region would be lost forever. And it implied that if, by the age of 12 or so, you had not recruited neurons to the specialized task of playing the violin, for instance, or learning a second language, then you might as well give up: your old brain was simply not going to learn new tricks.  By the spring of 1995, Edward Taub was also exploiting the ability of the brain to rewire itself. The University of Alabama, Birmingham, scientist was developing a revolutionary new therapy for stroke patients. The goal was to enable an intact area of the brain to take over for a region knocked out by stroke. But Dr. Taub was sure that neuroplasticity went beyond damaged brains. His goal was to see how normal behaviors changed brain maps.  The existence, and importance, of brain plasticity are no longer in doubt. The brain is dynamic, and the life we lead leaves its mark in the complex circuitry of the brain -- footprints of the experiences we have had, the thoughts we have thought, the actions we have taken. The brain allocates neural real estate depending on what we use most: the thumb of a videogame addict, the index finger of a Braille reader, the analytic ability of a chess player, the language skills of a linguist.
