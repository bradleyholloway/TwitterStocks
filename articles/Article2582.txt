 Dollar Mixed Against Major Currencies, A Day After Rubin News Upset Markets   By By Stephanie Hoo, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1999  The dollar rose against the yen and fell against the euro, holding recent ranges in orderly trading a day after markets were roiled by the resignation announcement of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.  "It's natural for the market to take a pause," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. He said investors continue to digest the impact of both Rubin stepping down and Russia's governmental crisis.  But some commentators are "dredging up things from (Lawrence) Summers' past," Mr. McCarthy said, citing concerns about Mr. Summers' endorsement years ago of a weaker dollar to narrow the U.S. trade deficit. Mr. Summers more recently has expressed support for Rubin's strong-dollar policy.
