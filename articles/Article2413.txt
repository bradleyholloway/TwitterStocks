 Coolness to CA's Computer Sciences' Bid Delays $1.1 Billion `Reward' for Officers   By By Raju Narisetti and Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1998  The stock's drop sent CA's shares well below a level which, just eight weeks from now, could have triggered an award of 20 million shares to the three: Charles Wang, chairman and chief executive officer; Sanjay Kumar, president; and Russell M. Artzt, an executive vice president. Under the 1995 program, CA's shares need to remain above $53.33 for 60 days in any 12-month period.  CA's shares first hit the target price last October, and until Wednesday, when CA disclosed the bid, had remained above the trigger price for 17 trading days. Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading the shares fell 2.5%, or $1.25, to $49.50. Volume soared to 10 million shares compared with the daily average of 2.4 million shares.  Despite the stock-price drop, Messrs. Wang, Kumar and Artzt someday should still see their big payday. Under the plan, the shares are to be granted in 2000 at the latest. Mr. Wang will receive as many as 12 million shares, followed by six million shares for Mr. Kumar and two million for Mr. Artzt. They can then sell them over a seven-year period. CA declined to comment about the stock plan.
