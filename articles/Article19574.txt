 Why Vanguard Bond Funds Fail to Keep Up --- Sector Bets Cause Yield to Lag, Revealing Big Flaw in Approach That Investors Don't Understand   By By Aaron Lucchetti and Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2002  Mr. [Ken Volpert] says that isn't the case with his funds, noting enhanced index funds typically aim to beat the results of their benchmark indexes by as much as 0.5 percentage point, while the Vanguard funds strive to keep returns within 0.2 percentage point. Vanguard's funds make their relatively smaller bets to recoup fund expenses and trading costs.  Some things, however, won't change. Since Vanguard isn't amending the prospectus of the fund, Mr. Volpert could decide on his own to reverse the modifications. Vanguard's bond index funds will continue tilting toward corporate bonds instead of Treasurys, to take advantage of their higher yields. They will also continue to select bonds Vanguard analysts believe are stable and undervalued. "We try to overlay some intelligent design into our process," Mr. Volpert says.  Vanguard, as the largest bond-index manager, with $34 billion in assets, has taken its share of slaps from other bond pickers. Bond-fund guru Bill Gross of Pimco, a unit of Allianz AG, for instance, was clearly referring to Vanguard in his column for Pimco fund investors during August, when he criticized a large bond "index" fund -- his quotes -- that substitutes corporate debt for Treasurys. The fund acted "in the Pollyannaish belief that bankruptcies don't occur overnight, they're just out there somewhere like an `X-Files' alien or something," he wrote. Of the fund's performance, he added: "Payback time, I suppose."
