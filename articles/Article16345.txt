 Intel to Report A Breakthrough In Chip Design   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2003  Luigi Colombo, the head of similar research efforts at Texas Instruments Inc., says his company will release a paper in December showing comparable progress as Intel. He complains that Intel's paper, prepared for a technical conference in Japan, doesn't disclose enough information to allow scientists to assess its assertions. "That is kind of disconcerting from a technology point of view," he says. "It sounds almost like a marketing announcement."  Bernard Meyerson, a vice president and chief technologist in IBM's technology group, says the data in Intel's paper are based on dimensions of materials that may not exhibit all the problems that occur when circuitry shrinks. "I'm unable to tell, frankly," whether Intel's paper represents a breakthrough, he says. "There is a tremendous amount of work left to do."  Mr. [Sunlin Chou], Intel's influential head of production technology, stresses that the new materials are "candidates" for use in Intel's manufacturing, but the company could modify its plans. He acknowledged that he faces an internal battle convincing some superiors, such as Chairman Andy Grove, that the high-k material can be churned out in high volumes as reliably as today's chip materials.
