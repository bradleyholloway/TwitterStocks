 Letters to the Editor: A Disgraceful Blocking of Nominees   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2001  Sen. [Patrick Leahy] seeks to rebut growing criticism that his Judiciary Committee is blocking qualified judicial nominees selected by President Bush. The criticism is warranted, and the issue is of extreme importance. The Senate's inexcusable inaction on dozens of qualified judicial nominees threatens to further clog already overburdened courtrooms, delay justice for millions of Americans and, even more alarming, make it harder for federal law-enforcement officials to get judicial assistance in their efforts to track and monitor suspected terrorists and other criminals.  Sen. Leahy seeks to justify his inaction on the grounds that some nominees have only recently been ready for Senate action. But that is no excuse for not acting on all of those candidates nominated before last August. As to those pre-August nominees, the Senate's performance has been downright disgraceful, particularly when comparing President Bush's nominees to those of his last three predecessors. With only one exception, 100% of the pre-August nominees of Presidents Reagan, Bush I and [Clinton] were confirmed in their first years of office. By contrast, the Senate has managed to confirm an anemic 40% of George W. Bush's pre-August nominees, with the Senate only a couple of weeks away from its recess.
