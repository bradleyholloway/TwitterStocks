 PJM Seeks to Settle Claims of Meddling With Monitor Unit   By Smith, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2007  Under the proposal made by PJM to FERC yesterday, the market- monitoring unit would no longer be answerable to PJM management but would continue to have access to all PJM employees, data and records. The unit would report to a subcommittee of the board of directors. Mr. [Joseph Bowring] would continue to head the unit and would submit a budget request to the PJM Finance Committee of the board annually. Mr. Bowring hasn't endorsed the proposal. Previously, he has said putting the unit outside the corporation could be costly and wouldn't necessarily improve the quality of its work.
