 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Mistaken Identity   By By Khushwant Singh, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2001  Sikhs revere their 10 gurus, and their sacred book is the Granth Sahib, compiled by their fifth guru, Arjun, in 1605 in their holy city, Amritsar, now in northern India. Like Hindus, Sikhs resent the killing of cows but don't object to eating pork. Sikhism is a branch of reformist Hinduism. The two groups have close ties; conversion from one to the other is common.  There are not many references to historical events in [Nanak]'s writings, but he does mention the invasion of northern India by the Mughal conqueror Babar in 1526 and the havoc he caused. Nanak was imprisoned for some time. He acquired a sizable following among both Hindus and Muslims. When he died in 1539 there was a dispute among his followers: Muslims wanted to bury him because they thought he was one of them; Hindus wanted to cremate him in the belief that he remained a Hindu to the end.  It is clear that Nanak wished to set up a community apart from Hindus and Muslims. He appointed his closest disciple as the second guru, and the second guru appointed his closest disciple to be the third. Thereafter succession remained restricted to one family. The fourth guru founded the city of Amritsar in 1574. His son, Guru Arjun, raised the Harimandir (temple of God) in the city. Later rebuilt in marble and covered with gold leaf, it became the Sikhs' most important place of pilgrimage.
