 44 Wall Wins Round, As a Judge in Florida Dismisses Two Suits   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1988  A federal judge in Miami dismissed two shareholder suits that had dogged 44 Wall St. for more than two years. The actions accused the mutual fund family of illegally selling shares within the state from 1980 to 1985 and asked for recission of the shares. Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp, in granting judgment for 44 Wall St., said that the shares were exempt from registration under the Florida Securities Act and that the concern had complied with state law.
