 AIG Probes May Find More Officials Knew Of Accounting Moves   By Ian McDonald and Theo Francis, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2005  "A person could say these adjustments had merit, but until there's more inspection, that's not clear," said Grace Osborne, a credit analyst covering AIG for Standard & Poor's in New York. "What's key here is that these adjustments may have been made without appropriate support."  AIG's practices for building up -- and sometimes releasing -- reserves has surfaced in a different context in the probes into its accounting. Authorities since early this year have been examining whether AIG artificially inflated its premium revenue and claims reserves through a reinsurance transaction with a Berkshire Hathaway Inc. unit, put in place in the final quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. The deal was struck shortly after AIG came under investor criticism for releasing claims reserves in the third quarter of 2000; some interpreted the release as a maneuver to help the company meet earnings expectations. AIG shares fell 6% on the day of its profit announcement.  Most of the "top level" issues in AIG's May 1 release "struck me as something that could be a judgment call," said Michael Smith, a recently retired Wall Street stock analyst who previously worked in the insurance industry. But he dubbed it "accounting gymnastics" to turn realized capital gains, "something analysts routinely ignore," into investment income, "something they routinely focus on."
