 Feeling Unappreciated? You May Find Griping Makes Things Worse   By By Joann Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2003  Complaining apparently helped derail Warren Lieberfarb. The Warner Bros. video chief was forced out of the AOL Time Warner movie studio in December. He said he was let go over policy differences. But he also told colleagues he felt bitter at not receiving enough money for his pivotal role in introducing and popularizing digital videodiscs. AOL Time Warner leaders were tired of his constant grousing, people at the company have said.  THAT'S WHAT Cindy Haas Davis did during five pay chats over 12 months. Early last year, she advanced to program manager at a Bryna, Texas, nonprofit. Her boss said she wouldn't get paid more, and initially she didn't object. Two months later, though, Ms. Davis demanded a 10% raise for performing well. Her superior not only agreed but increased the raise to 20% a week later after she divulged a pending job offer.  Through a group called Business and Professional Women/USA, the 44-year-old Ms. Davis then researched the federal equal-pay law. She wrote her supervisor citing the pay disparity as a possible violation. When Ms. Davis again met with her boss, he said, "You didn't have to come on this strong." But she had done her homework, and he granted her proposed 17% inflation adjustment. She now earns $42,000, twice her starting salary four years ago.
