 Reruns at 30,000 Feet --- Fliers Get B-Movies, Oldies As Airlines Cut Costs; The `Spy Kids 2' Revolt   By By Paul Glader, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 2003  The latest victim of airline cuts: the in-flight movie. Instead of showing the latest blockbusters, domestic carriers are screening older movies, less-popular ones or even none at all. This year, Delta fliers are getting reruns "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) and "As Good as It Gets" (1997). United and U.S. Airways are saving money on domestic flights by changing movies monthly, instead of every two weeks. Continental, meanwhile, is cutting back on dubbed films, too -- in April it had choices in five languages, down from eight in April 2001. While all of this may seem like small change, carriers are saving tens of millions: Hollywood studios estimate airlines overall are spending about 20% less on film rights now, down from more than $200 million annually in 2000 -- with big U.S. carriers cutting by as much as 50%.  The economy is the big villain here, of course. With airlines trimming all over, it's cheaper to get rights to old films or ones that flopped at the box office. But even a quick recovery may not usher a return to the golden age of in-flight movies: Thanks to the booming $12 billion DVD business, Hollywood's taking its films to video faster than ever, leaving airlines less of a window to show big movies before they hit the home. So now, the choices on most domestic airlines strike fliers as a bad compromise: Movie-loving fliers prefer the high-tech, personal video offered by foreign carriers from Singapore Airlines to Virgin Atlantic -- while others are drawn to outfits like Southwest that skip films altogether to keep costs low.
