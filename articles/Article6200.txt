 Meditrust to Pay Over $25 Million To Ex-Chairman   By By Mark Maremont, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  Meditrust Corp. said it agreed to pay more than $25 million to its former chairman, Abraham D. Gosman, who left the company last year after an ambitious diversification plan misfired and sent the company's share price plummeting.  A spokesman for the Needham, Mass., real-estate investment trust said the $25 million was calculated by a special committee of its board, based on a five-year contract that Mr. Gosman signed less than a month before his departure in August.  Mr. Gosman could not be reached for comment. A Meditrust spokesman said the board evaluated the situation and decided the payout was in the long-term interest of the company.
