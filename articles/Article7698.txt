 Urban Nightmare: Learning to Drive A Car in Manhattan --- Busy Streets, Crazy Cabbies, Horn Honkers, Potholes -- Everything Is a Problem   By By Rifka Rosenwein, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1987  Fred Clark, an instructor at Taggart's driving school, models himself after Lt. Kojak of the TV reruns. Whenever he gets into a jam, he reaches for a lollipop or a candy bar. He says it helps prevent ulcers.  It's also difficult to find a car to practice with. And if you get a car, where do you go to practice? Unlike their suburban counterparts, student drivers in New York go through trial by fire. There are no big empty lots to drive around in, no quiet residential streets on which to try three-point turns -- and, of course, no parking spaces. Even the road-test portion of the licensing exam is held on the busy streets of lower Manhattan.  He also notes that New Yorkers tend to be older than people elsewhere when they learn to drive. For teen-agers throughout the country, getting a driver's license is a rite of passage. But 16- and 17-year-olds can't legally drive in the city, so many don't bother taking "driver's ed" in high school. (Ironically, they can learn to drive here, but once they pass their road tests, their licenses are good anywhere in the U.S. except New York. These licenses become valid in New York City when young drivers turn 18.) Mr. Caporale says the average Taggart's student in New York is in his mid-20s, but quite a few are 55 and older.
