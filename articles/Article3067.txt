 Connecticut May Cut 2 Northeast Reactors From Unit's Rate Base   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1998  HARTFORD, Conn. -- Connecticut regulators recommended that two Northeast Utilities nuclear-power reactors be removed from a subsidiary's rate base.  In a draft decision, the state Department of Public Utility Control said the Millstone Unit 2 isn't "used and useful" and thus should be removed from Connecticut Light & Power's rate base, effective May 1. The decision also recommends that if Millstone Unit 3 hasn't returned to service by July 1, that unit, too, should be removed from the rate base.
