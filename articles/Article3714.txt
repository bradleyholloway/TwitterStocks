 Mergers' India Connection; Merrill Joins Rivals in Outsourcing Grunt Work   By Kelly, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2007  Merrill relies mainly on Copal's deal research, which it uses to put together Merrill-branded proposals and evaluations for corporate clients, says Mr. [Rishi Khosla]. In a written statement, David Noh, head of Pacific Rim corporate principal investments for the firm, praised Copal's "high-value analysis that makes it stand apart from its competitors."  Mr. Khosla and his partner, Joel Perlman, started Copal with a simple notion: to capitalize on the robust mergers-and-acquisitions market by providing deal research more cheaply to investment bankers. Having experienced some success with that core product, the firm is now dipping into stock research in non-U.S. markets, as well as credit research. Copal is valued at about $300 million, Mr. Khosla says.
