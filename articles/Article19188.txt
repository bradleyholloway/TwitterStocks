 Frost Hires Analyst Team From a Rival   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1999  Last week Frost hired away Southwest Securities' team of three semiconductor-industry analysts, leaving the Dallas investment-banking firm with just three remaining technology analysts. The analysts -- Cody Acree, George Chandler and Syed Haider -- announced their departures to Southwest on Thursday and will start work at Frost next week.  The move marks a reversal in strategy for Frost, which had set out to hire analysts primarily from outside Dallas's small pool of investment professionals. Frost's chief executive, Rob Brown, had said in an interview this spring he had no interest in luring away analysts from the handful of Dallas-based securities firms, such as Southwest, Hoak Breedlove Wesneski & Co., or Baldwin Anthony McIntyre & Boles. Mr. Brown says he changed his mind after Mr. Acree approached him last month. "These guys came to us and marketed themselves to us, and we were impressed with the package," he says.  Messrs. Acree, Chandler and Haider are relative newcomers to the industry. Messrs. Chandler and Haider both joined Southwest within the past eight months and hadn't held analyst positions elsewhere before, while Mr. Acree joined Southwest in May 1997 after a brief stint at Olde Discount Brokerage in Detroit.
