 Archer Wants End To Minimum Tax On Corporations   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1997  The planned phaseout of the tax, created more than a decade ago to ensure that no profit-making enterprise avoids federal taxes, is part of a package the Texas Republican expects to present to his panel next week. Mr. [Bill] Archer proposes to immediately exempt small corporations with gross receipts of $5 million or less. The tax would be phased out for all firms by Dec. 31, 2004. Also under Mr. Archer's plan, the alternative minimum tax rates for individual taxpayers of 26% and 28% would be adjusted annually for inflation.
