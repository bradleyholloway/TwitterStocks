 World Wire [6]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1997  Gehe AG, a German pharmaceutical retailer, won an 11-month takeover battle for Lloyds Chemists PLC of Britain, a pharmacy chain. Gehe said it increased its Lloyds stake to 57.46% after rival bidder UniChem PLC of Britain declined to top Gehe's bid and the Lloyds board recommended acceptance of Gehe's offer of 525 pence ($8.83) a share, or GBP 661 million ($1.11 billion). Gehe must find a buyer for Lloyds' wholesale business, under a condition set last July by the British government.  Siemens AG, a German electronics giant, agreed to buy the world leader in postal sorting systems from Daimler-Benz AG. The price wasn't disclosed. The deal involves AEG ElectroCom GmbH and U.S.-based AEG ElectroCom International Inc., two of the few profitable parts of Daimler's AEG AG defense and electronics operation. AEG ElectroCom expects to post 1996 global sales of 1 billion marks ($630 million) -- about 70% generated in the U.S. -- up from 650 million marks in 1995.  Raytheon Co., a U.S. defense and electronics concern, is teaming up with Indra Sistemas SA, Spain's 63% state-owned electronics and defense contractor, to develop air-traffic control systems world-wide. The Indra-Raytheon venture, based in Spain, will be valued at about 5.5 billion pesetas ($41.6 million). Indra will own 51% of the new company and Raytheon 49%. They have worked together since 1991 on developing the aviation systems.
