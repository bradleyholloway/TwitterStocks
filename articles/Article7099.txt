 Heard & Scene: Playwrights, Paintings, Pearls and Peanuts   By Heyman, Marshall, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2010  In tribute to Julie Andrews and the 45th anniversary of "The Sound of Music" at the VH1 Save the Music Foundation's 2010 Gala, students from P.S. 58 the Carroll School provided a rendition of "Edelweiss" and Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth sang a rip-roaring mashup tunes from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical. Jay-Z is a part owner of the Pig and one scene in "Decoded" has him sharing a meal -- the tavern's famed gnudi perhaps? -- with Bill Clinton. Pages 68 and 69 accompanied the downstairs mirror.
