 DoCoMo, Rakuten Forge Auction Pact   By Ishibashi, Kanji, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2005  Rakuten and DoCoMo said they are unsure when they can begin offering auction services, because they need to develop a server system and determine specific methods of charging customers. The companies didn't provide revenue targets for Rakuten Auction.  The tie-up will provide complementary benefits, Rakuten and DoCoMo said. Rakuten has been considering expanding its online auction services through the use of third-generation cellular phones, while DoCoMo has been searching for new sources of revenue that don't rely on its telecommunications traffic as Japan's mobile-phone market becomes saturated.
