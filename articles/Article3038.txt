 U.S. Airline Bailout Isn't on the Horizon --- Industry Itself Is Split on What Government Should Do to Alleviate Distress   By By Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2002  There are, however, areas where the [Bush] administration is already helping the industry. With private insurers charging rates that many carriers say are excessive, the airline industry wants the administration to extend temporary federal terrorism-risk insurance while the carriers develop their own self-insurance venture. Mr. Bush's economic advisers have privately voiced qualms about extending industry-specific coverage, according to administration officials, and some large, politically powerful insurers, such as American International Group Inc., have lobbied the administration to withdraw the airlines' federal coverage. Meanwhile, the Transportation Department has continued to issue temporary extensions, usually lasting 30 or 60 days, while the White House presses Congress to pass a broader terrorism-risk insurance bill for various industries.  As airlines complained about new security procedures requiring passengers to remove shoes or even partially disrobe during security checks, the Bush administration last month forced the head of the fledgling Transportation Security Administration, John Magaw, to resign. Mr. Magaw's successor, James Loy, has spoken more favorably than his predecessor about the idea of allowing travelers to go through airport security faster in exchange for extensive background checks. But he has also promised to reconsider the idea of arming airline pilots, a proposal Mr. Magaw rejected and which airlines fear could saddle with them hundreds of millions of dollars in new training costs.
