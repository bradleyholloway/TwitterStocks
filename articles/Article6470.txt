 Reserve Judgment: In Deal for Unocal, Chevron Gambles On High Oil Prices; CEO, Battling Low Output, Foresees Surge in Demand And Global Supply Squeeze; The 'Brave New World' Speech   By Gold, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  The strong results mask weakness in Chevron's core business: finding oil and gas. Last year, it pumped the equivalent of 2.5 million barrels of oil out of the ground every day. After factoring in asset sales, new discoveries and revisions to previous estimates, it didn't come close to adding that much in proven reserves. Its "replacement rate" was just 18% -- one of the worst showings by a large oil company in recent years. If that continues, Chevron could eventually pump itself out of existence. That is why many in the oil patch see Chevron's acquisition of Unocal as a sign of weakness, not strength.  Sensing a strategic opportunity, Mr. O'[Reilly] pushed ahead with merger talks and made an all-stock $15.8 billion offer for Unocal in late February. Unocal said it wasn't enough and went to Cnooc and its other suitor -- Italy's Eni SpA -- seeking bids. Cnooc offered $17 billion in cash. Eni, willing to offer only $16 billion, backed out. Chevron increased its stock bid to $16.5 billion -- as high as the board had authorized Mr. O'Reilly to go. "He put it all on the table," says Mr. [J. Bennett Johnston], the former board member.  Hours before Cnooc's final bid was due, the Chinese company told Unocal it wasn't going to bid. Chevron signed the merger papers at 4:30 a.m. on April 4. Chevron's stock took a hit because investors feared it was overpaying. Then the deal got more expensive. In late June, Cnooc made an $18.5 billion counter bid. On July 19, as the Unocal board flirted with Cnooc, Chevron sweetened its bid to $17.7 billion, of which 60% is in stock and 40% in cash.
