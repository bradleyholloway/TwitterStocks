 Viewpoint: Short List of Migraines for the Next President   By By Hodding Carter III, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1988  The New York primary has eliminated the suspense about the Democratic nominee. The terrorists have released their hostages from the Kuwaiti airliner. And the Persian Gulf seems to have gone from Condition Red to Condition Yellow. That means citizenry and government can concentrate on the half-dozen or so other issues that seem to defy solution or promise new headaches.  What we're talking about here are not headaches caused by embarrassment. In that category are the continuing scandal of Edwin Meese's hemorrhaging Justice Department and the temporary scandal of Larry Speakes's admission of practices different only in degree from those routinely followed by his counterparts past and present. (Washington journalists ought to be embarrassed by their hypocritical mewling about Mr. Speakes, since most of them have long been willing co-conspirators in the daily frauds perpetrated on the public by the government's $2 billion-a-year "public-information" industry. Journalists' capacity for moral outrage is remarkably limited when it comes to their own defects.)  As with the 1950s, ignoring the mounting difficulties will not solve them. To its credit, the Reagan administration has proved on a number of fronts it has learned that lesson, whatever the president's ideological preferences might be. Thus Secretary of State Shultz engaged Israel and its neighbors in a game, if futile, effort to resurrect the Mideast peace process. The assassination of the PLO leader and the mounting outrages in the name of law and order on the West Bank and in Gaza underscore a deadly reality: Until there is an agreement satisfactory to all parties, there will be peace for none.
