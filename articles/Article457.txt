 Dispatches From Iraq: The Answer to So Many Questions Remains: 'We'll Wait and See' Online edition  The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2007  You hear the phrase "wait and see" a lot these days when it comes to Iraq. Is Iran honoring its pledge to try to stop support of militia groups in Iraq? "We'll have to wait and see." Is the security situation here sustainable? "We'll have to wait and see."  U.S. military spokesman Rear Admiral Gregory Smith said about two weeks ago that based on recent weapons cache discoveries, it seemed like Iran was honoring its pledge to stop munitions from entering Iraq. But after a pet market bombing in Baghdad on Friday, Admiral Smith said on Saturday that the group responsible for that explosion had Iranian support. Today, Brigadier General James Yarbrough, head of the Iraqi Assistance Group, said he was taking a "wait and see attitude" to see if Iran was going to honor its pledge. "The willingness of Iran to stop the fighting helps but it's too early to tell," he said.
