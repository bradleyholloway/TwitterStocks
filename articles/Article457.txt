JERUSALEM, March 29â€” Israel's coalition Government, grappling with a wave of unrest in occupied Arab lands, tonight won a key parliamentary vote that apparently insured its survival until it returns Sinai to Egypt next month.  An opposition attempt to cut off funds from Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Government foundered when the Parliament voted 59 to 57 for an interim budget.  The vote meant the Government would be able to draw state funds until it presents a full budget for 1982-83 and was almost sure of remaining in office beyond the April 26 deadline for withdrawal from Sinai.  Parliament goes into recess this week and is not due to meet again until May, giving Mr. Begin a breathing space to deal with unrest in the West Bank and internal opposition to the Sinai handover.  The Knesset speaker did not vote tonight and three of the 120 members were absent. The only controversial business remaining was a private member's bill on the issue of defining who is a Jew. The legislation is being championed by the Agudath Israel Party, which holds four parliamentary seats and has helped keep the coalition in power.
