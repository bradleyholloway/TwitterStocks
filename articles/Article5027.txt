 Legendary Raider Sir James Goldsmith Adds to Lore With His Bid for B.A.T   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1989  Among corporate raiders, none has seemed more larger than life than Sir James Goldsmith. Indeed, the makers of the movie "Wall Street" modeled their fictional British takeover baron, Sir Lawrence Wildman, on Sir James.  Kenneth Lipper, an investment banker who was the movie's technical adviser, says he coached actor Terence Stamp, who played Sir Lawrence, by explaining Sir James's 1986 bid for Crown Zellerbach Corp.  With his staggering $21.2 billion bid for B.A.T yesterday, Sir James burst back upon the world takeover stage following a retreat from the American market. Mr. Lipper characterizes Sir James as "an asset buyer," noting that the financier was able to gain control of Crown Zellerbach's vast forest assets -- free -- by selling off peripheral assets.
