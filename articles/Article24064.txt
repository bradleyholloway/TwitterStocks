 REVIEW --- What Revelation Reveals --- It is the Bible's strangest book; Even stranger, it was only one of many now-forgotten 'books of revelation'   By Pagels, Elaine, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2012  Instead of stories and moral teaching, it offers only visions -- dreams and nightmares, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, earthquakes, plagues and war. In the climactic battle scene, Jesus appears as a divine warrior, Satan is thrown into a pit, and all humans who had died faithful to God reign over the earth for 1,000 years.
