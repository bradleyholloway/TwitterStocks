 ServiceMaster Shelves Bond Offering on Investor Nervousness   By Serena Ng and Cynthia Koons, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  Wall Street bond underwriters called off a $1.15 billion sale of junk bonds on Tuesday that would pay for a leveraged buyout of ServiceMaster Co., a lawn-care and pest-control company. Instead, ServiceMaster received its financing from a bridge loan directly from the underwriters, which they hope to replace in the coming months.  The botched ServiceMaster bond offering followed on the heels of a postponed $3.6 billion buyout bond and loan sale in late June for Ahold's U.S. Foodservice, and a cancelled $540 million bond sale for Thomson Corp.'s Thomson Learning. In those cases, the underwriters were also on the hook for unsold debt in the form of bridge loans. At Dollar General Corp., which also sold bonds and loans to finance its buyout last week, underwriters were left holding $725 million of its bonds, which they plan to sell in a separate offering.  ServiceMaster spokesman Steve Bono said the buyout firms came to the deal with firm commitments for financing and that "current market conditions aren't going to impair the closing of the transaction." ServiceMaster expects the transaction to close very early in the third quarter, Mr. Bono said.
