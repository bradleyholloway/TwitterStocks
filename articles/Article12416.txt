 Taking a Ride on the Steepening Yield Curve Of Perelman's Thrift Entices Some Investors   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1999  Bond prices are getting whacked. An interest-rate boost could be coming. So why are some people excited about Golden State Bancorp., the California thrift controlled by financier Ronald Perelman?  But longer-term rates have been rising much more quickly than short-term rates lately, a so-called steepening of the yield curve. This is good news for Golden State, because it can now charge higher rates on home mortgages, the thrift's biggest product and about 60% of the company's revenue. A steeper yield curve also makes adjustable-rate mortgages, which comprise 78% of Golden State's loan portfolio, more popular. And as long as rates stay at these higher levels, mortgage refinancings should slow, alleviating pressure on the thrift's balance sheet.  But few see Mr. Perelman or Mr. (Gerald) Ford as long-term investors. In the past, Mr. Perelman has engineered sales of companies he controlled, including New World Entertainment Group and Consolidated Cigar. Wall Street investment bankers say it's only a matter of time before Mr. Perelman -- who owns 34% of Golden State, his biggest investment -- engineers a sale.
