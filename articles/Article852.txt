 U.S. Car Sales Declined 38.4% For Jan. 1-10 --- Plunge Had Been Expected Following Spree Spurred By Changes in Tax Law   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1987  The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the Jan. 1-10 period, using a revised Commerce Department formula, was 5.1 million cars -- the lowest since mid-July 1982 -- compared with a pace of 8.2 million a year ago. The daily selling rate was the lowest since mid-December 1981.  Although dramatic, the drop came as little surprise. One auto company analyst had forecast a decrease of between 35% and 40% for the period, as did several Wall Street analysts. "We borrowed so many 1987 sales by the incentives of 1986," said William Prebe, a vice president and economist at Dana Corp., an auto supplier. Most said, however, the plunge wasn't a harbinger of prolonged troubles for the industry or the economy at large, predicting sales would pick up steadily throughout the month.  General Motors Corp., suffering from high inventories, triggered a financing price war in the industry in late August that boosted sales for more than a month, but that took away later sales, many analysts said. Sales were also pushed ahead by the expiration Jan. 1 of the sales-tax deduction from federal income taxes, accelerating December purchases of many expensive items, such as cars.
