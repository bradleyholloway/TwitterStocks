Swedish cigarette packs presently carry a brief health warning in small type. Cartons have no warning.  Daiwa Securities Co., one of Japan's Big Four brokerage houses, said it signed agreements with the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation to provide advice on organizing domestic capital and financial markets. It was the first time that the Soviet Union appointed a Western-aligned financial institution as an official adviser. As part of the agreements, Daiwa will also offer advice on establishing a Moscow Stock Exchange.  Israel, hit by a growing trade gap and the staggering cost of settling Soviet Jewish immigrants, is considering borrowing from the International Monetary Fund for the first time since the 1970s. Finance Ministry and Bank of Israel officials said the country might seek $250 million from the IMF in compensatory financing to make up for a drop in tourism and a rise in oil prices because of the Gulf crisis. After years of resistance, the central bank is also studying whether to ask for an IMF standby loan of more than $1 billion to help pay for an expected influx of a million Soviet Jews through 1992.
