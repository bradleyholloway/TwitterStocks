 Heat Over Superconductor Research Cools; AT&T Unit Reports Advance   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1987  A year ago, a major scientific conference here spotlighted the discovery of new superconductors, sparking a world-wide scientific race to develop them for commercial use. At the same conference this year, euphoria about major breakthroughs has given way to reports on the long, difficult process of refining the materials for practical use.  Perhaps the most important superconductor advance reported at this week's conference -- sponsored by the Materials Research Society -- was the development by scientists at Bell Laboratories of a method to increase the electrical capacity of wires of the new material. Bell Labs is a unit of New York-based American Telephone & Telegraph Co.  The Bell Labs scientists devised a processing technique that lets wires of the new materials carry as much as 1,000 amperes per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field. "This shows that we are out of the woods" in efforts to develop practical wires from the new materials, said Sungho Jin, a Bell Labs researcher.
