 Be like Mike?   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1995  An editorial says a planned Jun 20, 1995 celebration at Harlem NY's Apollo Theater honoring convicted sex offender and heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is not just an insult to blacks but to all Americans as well. The editorial says the merchandising of violence by black men is nothing new and this event is especially troubling since Tyson has expressed no remorse for his actions.
