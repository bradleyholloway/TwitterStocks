 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian Ridge, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2000  Californians jumped on board after summer's power woes. Garry Hays, president of United States International University in San Diego, now works with the lights off and the draperies open after the campus electric bill rocketed to $140,000 for July and August, up 84% from a year before. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco, gets 50,000 hits a month for its Internet-based energy audit. And Southern California Edison says an ad campaign pays off as 48% of residential users say they've curbed electricity use.  Reinhold Ice Cream Co. in Pittsburgh, a century-old private concern that once a year makes flavors dreamed up by local companies for a charity fund-raiser, plans to market this year's winner. It's called "Chocolate Cashew Carousel." The flavor, created by a corporate team from UPMC Health System, Pittsburgh, recently won the Silver Scoop Trophy at an ice-cream social that raised $75,000 for Pressley Ridge Schools, an agency that serves troubled children.  Bob Mandell, president of Reinhold, says he marketed the winner of the first contest eight years ago as well as subsequent winners, but stopped doing so a few years ago when his regional firm suffered some distribution setbacks as big brands moved in. Now, with increased distribution, he expects to market the winner. A dozen corporate teams competed in the August event, including law firm Reed Smith Shaw & McClay with "Raspberry Appeal" and Lamar Advertising with "Lamarvelous" vanilla.
