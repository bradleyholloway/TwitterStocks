 Fired Party Planner At Salomon Admits She Stole From Firm --- Prosecution Says Tompkins Pocketed Over $1 Million In Reimbursement Scam   By By Margaret A. Jacobs, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 1994  A former corporate party planner for Salomon Brothers Inc. admitted stealing more than $1 million from the New York investment bank during a 16-month period.  Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said Kathleen Tompkins, the investment firm's 38-year-old social-events supervisor, pleaded guilty to two felonies: one count of grand larceny in the third degree and one count of falsifying business records.  In June 1992, Mrs. Tompkins, a 10-year Salomon employee at that point, began submitting false invoices to the Salomon Inc. unit for purchases of china, linen and silver from upscale retailer Barney's and food and liquor from other choice establishments, Mr. Morgenthau said. She claimed the china and silver were used as corporate party favors, and she attached uncancelled personal checks made out to Barney's.
