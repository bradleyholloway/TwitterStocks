 VW's 28-Hour Workweek Goes Kaputt in Wolfsburg   By Stephen Power and Almut Schoenfeld, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2007  "They don't see their situation in relation to others," says Ms. [Carmen Stumpf]. Wolfsburg's mayor, Rolf Schnellecke, agrees. "It was not a very just situation" that Volkswagen employees "worked four days a week and still wound up getting more money" than "normal people" in the town, Mr. Schnellecke says.  The change wasn't easy for some. Ms. North's boyfriend, Thomas Jung, a 43-year-old VW factory worker, says he initially hung out in bars and played videogames. "I preferred going to work. . . . One feels superfluous when one is needed less," he says. Gradually, though, he began going to a gym three or four times a week, and took vacations in Spain, Portugal or the Dominican Republic "at least once a year for two weeks."  Mr. [Ronald Wachendorf], the mechanic, puts matters more bluntly. "That's part of the contract, that [VW managers] supply more [Golfs] for us," he says. "It's their problem where they get the cars from."
