 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1999  Trade Representative Barshefsky presses other countries to send only trade officials with political pull back home to negotiating meetings. "Charlene said, `Don't send people in here who can't deal,'" one World Trade Organization official says. Some delegates are annoyed she didn't come to the protester-delayed opening ceremony, but remained barricaded in her hotel.  Others say Barshefsky should dump one of her two roles: as both negotiator and official host at the Seattle meeting. She should either "spend her time negotiating" or "giving press conferences," one European delegate says. Barshefsky defenders say her tough style helped wring concessions from Beijing on China's WTO entry.  Seattle police continue to round up anyone in downtown Seattle who looks hippieish. Some protesters shed their jackets and wool hats as they move toward a downtown no-protests zone. Yesterday, about 1,000 protesters marched through downtown Seattle and formed a ring around a county jail where demonstrators are held, screaming, "Let them go."
