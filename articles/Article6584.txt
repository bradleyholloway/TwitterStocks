 House of the Week: A Doll's House   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2002  Due Diligence: This large white estate on Brazilian Avenue was built in 1925 and designed by John Volk, one of Palm Beach's best-known architects from that era. In 1999, investor Will Murphy bought it for $2.2 million and hired decorator Jennifer Garrigues to redo the interior and give it an "old Palm Beach relaxed beach house" feel. He also had a vaulted awning installed above the patio facing east and south toward the landscaped pool. But Mr. Murphy kept some things very close to his heart.
