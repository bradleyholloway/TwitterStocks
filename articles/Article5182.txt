 Agenda '95-'97 --- Republicans: What Now? [1]  By By David Frum, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1994  The 1994 election has given Republicans abundant cause to celebrate. But once the confetti has been swept up, the GOP must recognize that its gains also present grave dangers. Some 43% of Americans hold "mostly" or "very" unfavorable views of Congress as an institution, up from only 26% as recently as 1985. This week, the Democrats were the victims of the anticongressional mood. Tomorrow the mood could as easily claim Republicans.  First, Republicans must pursue the program of institutional reforms they have pledged themselves to. Such reforms, though, should be of the right kind. The GOP flirtation with faddish electronic democracy ideas, such as the proposal by Alvin and Heidi Toffler that "voters be empowered directly, through petition, to compel a legislative body to set up committees on topics the public . . . deems important," is a catastrophe in the making. "Reform" that invites the American Association of Retired Persons and the schoolteachers and other selfish interest groups to bully Congress even more brutally than they now do is no reform at all.  Republicans can benefit by an example from their own past. Under the domination of one man, Robert Taft, the Republican majorities in the postwar Congresses pried open the country's wartime and New Deal manacles. Price controls were repealed. The pro-union Wagner Act was revised and replaced with the fairer Taft-Hartley law. Taxes were cut. And despite the Cold War, even conscription was arrested for a year. If the Republicans of the 104th Congress want to achieve as much, they will need to revive that same spirit of parliamentary discipline.
