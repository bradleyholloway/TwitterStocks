 Control Over Drexel Liquidation Goes to Court-Appointed Outsider   By By Wade Lambert and Marj Charlier, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1990  The appointment of Mr. [George D.] Gould stems from a dispute over whether the creditors should be privy to Drexel's liquidation plans. Although the company and the creditors had earlier operated under an oversight procedure that gave creditors notice of the transactions, Drexel backed out of that arrangement in late May -- spurring the creditors to begin legal action demanding a role in reviewing the liquidation transactions.  The new arrangement, negotiated under the supervision of federal bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III, goes far beyond the earlier review process. While previously Drexel decided on the transactions -- after conferring with creditors -- now Mr. Gould will decide. He will serve as the chairman and only voting member of a court-appointed investment committee. The other members of the committee will be one representative each of Drexel, the parent's creditors' committee and the creditors' committee of Drexel's brokerage unit.  Under the new plan, Drexel management will recommend securities transactions to Mr. Gould. He will make decisions after consulting with the committee. Any member can appeal Mr. Gould's decision to Judge Buschman. The arrangement also requires Drexel to provide a regular update of its securities transactions and the value of its assets to the creditors' financial advisers. The review process will continue at least until early November, when a Drexel reorganization plan is expected to be proposed.
