 Genesco Inc. Lowers Earnings Estimates, Citing Slump in Sales   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  Genesco blamed a slowing economy, a comparison with strong sales for last year's second quarter, and new merchandising plans for some brands for the expected reduction in profits. The company said same-store sales, or sales for stores open a year or more, are expected to drop 3% to 5% for the second quarter, from the year-earlier period. Sales of Journeys footwear, the company's biggest seller, were slower than expected during July, the company said. Journeys accounted for 45% of Genesco's sales for fiscal 2001.
