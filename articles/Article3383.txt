 Election 2000: State Attorney General Urges Count Of Absentee Ballots Without Postmark   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2000  County election officials in Florida used varying criteria to decide which votes should count and which should be thrown away. In Hillsborough County, nine overseas absentee ballots were rejected because they had no postmark and no date, and 11 weren't counted because they were postmarked after Election Day. In Leon County, election officials decided to count ballots that were postmarked on or before Nov. 9, since they would have had to be mailed earlier than Election Day to arrive by then, said Ion Sancho, county election supervisor.  The canvassing board in Escambia County, home of the Pensacola Naval Air Station, accepted ballots that lacked a postmark, even if they didn't have a date. In Broward County, where more than 300 ballots were rejected, only two lacked a postmark. More than 100 were rejected because the postmark was late.
