WASHINGTON, Jan. 19â€” President Carter signed an executive order today putting into effect a trust fund to be used to clean up hazardous substances released into the environment.  The fund can be used for emergency response and for long-term remedial cleanup if the responsible party is unknown, unwilling or unable to clean up the hazardous substances.  The order delegates the President's authority to appropriate executive agencies to carry out the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and to obligate money from the trust fund for that purpose.  The order gives primary responsibility for response and cleanup activities to the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Transportation, under whose department the Coast Guard operates.
