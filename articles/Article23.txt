BRUSSELS, Feb. 16â€” European Economic Community steelmakers do not expect a rebound in their United States sales this spring but have made no decision to limit deliveries, sources close to the producers' association, Eurofer, said today.  They said the crucial factor in the continuing export slump was weak United States demand, which is likely to last into the third quarter.  An investigation into complaints by the American steel industry of unfair selling practices by foreign producers has put an additional damper on Common Market exports.  But the latter is a secondary consideration, the sources said. ''The American market is in a bad way right now,'' said a source who took part in recent Eurofer talks. ''It won't get worse, but it won't improve before the second half.'' American steelmakers assert that exporters have been selling steel in the United States for less than it costs to produce, putting United States steel producers at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.
