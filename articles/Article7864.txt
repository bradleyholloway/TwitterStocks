 Why Sanctions Failed in Panama   By By Kevin Quigley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1989  President Bush will publish a notice in the Federal Register today affirming that Panama continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security, and continuing the economic sanctions that President Reagan put in place a year ago. This is despite the fact that the sanctions, while imposing significant economic costs on Panama's economy, have failed to topple the noxious Noriega regime.  The Reagan administration imposed sanctions against Panama as the capstone to a series of measures designed to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power. These measures included denials of U.S. foreign aid, preferential trade treatment, and access to Panamanian government deposits in the U.S. Days after the sanctions were imposed Elliott Abrams, then assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said that "Noriega was hanging by his fingertips." Sanctions would be the coup de grace. He was wrong. A year later, Gen. Noriega remains in power.
