 Entertainment & Culture -- Morgenstern On Movies: Hollywood's Gambling Problem; With box-office receipts sliding, our columnist on what's behind high-stakes flops like 'Stealth' and 'The Island'   By Morgenstern, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2005  One flagrant example of the latter is this summer's "The Island," an expensive, entirely inert sci-fi opus starring several car chases, plus Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as fugitives from a fancy futurist gulag. (The movie has become an icon of sorts for many Hollywood second-guessers. When I started to pose the "How could they have made . . . " question to a producer friend recently, he couldn't even wait for the sentence to end. "You mean 'The Island'?" he asked.)  No wonder, then, that studio executives cling to whatever works -- special effects, or hugely expensive stars -- until it doesn't work any more. Add to that willful blindness a long-standing habit of executives' condescension toward their audience. "Their assumption is, 'I really like this project and I'm smart so America won't like it,' " the producer Stuart Cornfeld told me. "You want to say to them, 'It's OK, you're not that smart.' " The result is a succession of supposedly sure things that are increasingly unsure, as audience preferences and attendance patterns change. "Francois Truffaut defined a great movie as a perfect blend of truth and spectacle," says the writer-director Howard Franklin. "Now it's become bifurcated. Studio films are all spectacle and no truth, and independent films are all truth and no spectacle."
