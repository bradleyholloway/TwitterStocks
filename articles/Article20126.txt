 Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis; When a Fund Manager Leaves, Investors Fret -- for Good Reason   By Levitz, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2007  "That's the kind of manager musical chairs I don't like," says the 58-year-old Mr. [Tom Genovese], director of the Orlando division of the South Florida Water Management District. "I'm putting my life savings into mutual funds -- I don't want someone practicing with my money."  A Fidelity spokesman says Pyramis has retained "the vast majority of assets" invested under Mr. [James Rutherford] and has continued to gain investors in the international funds. The Pyramis assets are entrusted to money managers Peter Hadden and Steve Oler, "who have 40 years' experience and were very familiar with the strategy's investment process."  Some firms have eschewed the star system for a long time. Capital Research & Management's American Funds, for one, has used that approach since 1958. The fund firm has a general policy of not publicizing the work of individual stock pickers, preferring investors to buy instead based on a fund's overall investment style. The team members are called "portfolio counselors" rather than "portfolio managers."
