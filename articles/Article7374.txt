 You Can't Hold an ECU in Your Hand, But It Does Just Fine Against the Dollar   By By Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1985  They do "exist" as a representative composite, based on 10 European currencies, and thousands of Europeans now use ECUs to buy cars, pay hotel bills or transact other business on ECU credit cards and on ECU-denominated bank checking accounts.  Six years ago the 10 member countries of the European Common Market developed ECUs to promote monetary stability. As a composite of the currencies of the European Monetary System, the ECU has weathered the U.S. dollar's dramatic rise in recent years better than any single currency, as changes in individual components offset one another.  Reflecting a desire for greater stability, "More than 1,000 banks in 30 countries are active in the ECU market," says Andre Swings, a general manager of Kredietbank N.V., Brussels. ECUs have become the fifth biggest financing currency in the world, behind dollars, Swiss francs, West German marks and Japanese yen. By last October, the market for ECUs had surged to the equivalent of $23.6 billion, according to the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements. The latest BIS figures show that 36% of Euromarket loans during 1984's first three quarters were denominated in ECUs.
