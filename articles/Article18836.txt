 Heart Group Issues Guidelines on Use Of TPA for Strokes   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1996  The American Heart Association issued new guidelines intended to significantly improve chances of patients to survive and recover from a stroke.  The guidelines advise doctors on how to use a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, that can significantly reduce death rates and improve recovery from stroke, but only when given within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms.  Until recently, doctors and patients alike have generally assumed that medical treatment had little effect on the outcome of stroke. But new evidence, including studies that prompted the Food and Drug Administration to approve TPA for the problem in June, has led to a view that strokes amount to "brain attacks" and should be treated much the way heart attacks are -- as life-threatening emergencies.
