 Arts Group Debates Its Role Amid a Local Renaissance   By By Alina Matas, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1998  The ArtCenter South Florida on Lincoln Road once symbolized the very soul of pure but impoverished creativity: a collection of abandoned, rat-infested buildings purchased with donations in a down-and-out neighborhood and rented to those who could barely afford water color.  Now, the neighborhood is up and coming, and the 13-year-old ArtCenter, still starved for structural repairs and adequate studio space, is trying to cash in on the revival. To help finance a trendy refurbishment of its facilities, the Art Center is peddling one of its three buildings, the Sender Building at 1035-45 Lincoln Road, currently valued at about seven times the original purchase price of $650,000.  But the question of whether to sell forced the center's 19 board members to confront a broader issue: Should they stay on upwardly mobile Lincoln Road? Some argued that the grass-roots ArtCenter no longer fit in such ritzy company. Others felt the newly vibrant neighborhood was the perfect setting for the arts to thrive.
