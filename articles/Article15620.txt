 Cat and Mouse: Why U.S., Iraq Do This Dance   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1997  THE CLINTON administration, everybody says, is in the midst of another "crisis" with Iraq. First, Iraq began toying with United Nations weapons inspectors. Then the U.S. tried to tighten the screws on Iraq by imposing new U.N. sanctions. So now Iraq has responded by trying to throw out U.S. weapons inspectors. Angry words are flying. Missiles could yet fly as well.  The Clinton administration has tried to be more delicate in describing its policy toward Iraq and U.N. sanctions, allowing, in effect, that if Saddam Hussein somehow starts behaving like an Eagle Scout, sanctions could be lifted. But the net result is the same: Nobody atop the Clinton administration thinks Saddam Hussein is going to change fundamentally, so the American aim is to keep sanctions in place.  JUXTAPOSED AGAINST that, consider Saddam Hussein's history. He spent a full decade ruthlessly consolidating power inside Iraq until he became its undisputed leader in 1979. Since then, he has outlasted three American presidents, four Israeli prime ministers, one Egyptian president, one Saudi king and one Iranian revolutionary mullah. He has invaded three of his neighbors and lived to tell about it, and strangled all domestic opponents so they can't tell about it. His life is one big poker game, and he survives not with brilliant play, but by outlasting everybody else at the table.
