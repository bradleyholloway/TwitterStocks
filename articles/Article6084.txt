 Spain's Endesa Plans to Target Domestic Investors   By By Carlta Vitzthum, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1998  Endesa SA is pulling out all the stops with individual investors to guarantee the success of its coming $8 billion public share offer, Spain's biggest-ever privatization.  Chief Executive Officer Rafael Miranda said the sale of at least a 30% stake in Spain's largest electric utility will focus he avily on domestic investors. Between 75% and 85% of the offer will be allocated to individuals during the global offer scheduled to begin May 18, compared with only 62% in its last public offer in October.  As an incentive, retail investors will receive a 3% discount on the final sale price -- to be set June 8 -- as well as an additional 3% discount if they hold the shares for six months. New shareholders will be entitled to the interim dividend of 48 pesetas (32 cents) a share that Endesa plans to pay June 18.
