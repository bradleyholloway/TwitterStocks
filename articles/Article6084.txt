 Merrill Changes Stock-Research Rating Process   By By Cheryl Winokur Munk, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2002  Under the agreement with Mr. [Eliot Spitzer], Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage firm, agreed to pay a $100 million fine to New York and other states to settle charges that it provided overly optimistic research to win investment-banking business. Merrill also agreed that investment banking would have no direct input into analysts' compensation. Many of the changes announced by Merrill are actually required by new rules of the New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers that were approved last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Changes in the firm's compensation practices stem from the settlement with the New York attorney general.  Merrill said the rating system, which it plans to implement in September, will provide clients with stock recommendations based on projections of total return and risk. The compensation system, which the company said is effective immediately, "will provide further incentives for analysts to aspire to superior performance for the benefit of investors," Merrill said.
