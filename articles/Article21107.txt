 Letters to the Editor: Recontouring: Don't Get Sucked In   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1987  Your story quoted one of these physicians as stating that "any doctor willing to learn {suction lipectomy} should be able to suck fat." It is true there are plenty of short courses available where physicians can learn the basics of this particular technique. However, only physicians who complete an approved plastic-surgery residency program have received in-depth training in the art and science of surgical body contouring, including patient selection, surgical judgment and treatment of complications.  In the U.S., physicians are currently allowed to call themselves a specialist in any field they wish. I would agree with a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine that true expertise is difficult for consumers to determine on their own, and that specialty designation should not be left solely to the discretion of the individual practitioner. Certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (the only body recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties as a certifier of plastic surgeons) cannot guarantee a good result. However, it is a minimum standard of training and competence.
