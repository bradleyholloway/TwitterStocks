 Fannie Mae Has Bolstered Its Capital Base   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 2005  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, said Fannie Mae was "adequately capitalized" as of March 31. At the end of 2004, Ofheo found, the company was "significantly undercapitalized."  The regulator makes quarterly assessments of the company's capital, a process that has been complicated by accounting problems at Fannie. The Securities and Exchange Commission found in December that Fannie had violated accounting rules on the valuation of derivative contracts used to hedge interest-rate risks. As a result, Fannie plans to restate earnings for the past several years. The company has estimated that it will have to record losses on those derivatives of as much as $10.8 billion.
