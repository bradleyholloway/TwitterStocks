 Dollar Is Higher As Dealers Wait For Trade Data --- Technical Factors Are Cited In Unit's Rise as Rumors About July Deficit Vary   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1987  The dollar rose in light trading as foreign exchange dealers reacted to short-term technical factors and adjusted positions ahead of tomorrow's report on the U.S. merchandise trade balance for July.  The dollar fell initially in overseas trading on rumors that the U.S. trade deficit widened to $17 billion or $18 billion in July from $15.71 billion in June. Later, during New York trading, a contrary rumor that the Commerce Department report on the trade balance tomorrow will show a better-than-expected U.S. performance contributed to the dollar's strength.  The technical factors that helped the dollar in New York trading were created by a break this week in the currency's sharp decline. Yesterday, the dollar slowly retraced its steps up to 1.7980 West German marks, a point on technical traders' charts that for many signaled a short-term buying opportunity.
