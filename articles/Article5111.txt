 Live Entertainment Names Patterson, Ex-Head of Retailer, to Two Top Posts   By By David J. Jefferson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1990  VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Live Entertainment Inc. named Wayne H. Patterson as chairman and chief executive officer, filling the posts formerly held by Jose Menendez, slain last August along with his wife, Kitty.  Mr. Patterson, 43 years old, served more than three years at the helm of Pace Membership Warehouse Inc., and during his tenure sales and profits of the discount retailer more than doubled. Last November, Pace was sold for $323 million to K mart Corp., and since then, Mr. Patterson has served as K mart's executive vice president, specialty retailing. Prior to his work at Pace, Mr. Patterson spent more than 15 years with the accounting firm of Touche, Ross & Co.  Mr. Patterson's appointment brings a captain to a company that has drifted without a permanent chairman and chief executive since Mr. Menendez's death. "My sense is that a large part of my job will be leadership, being visible both internally and externally, and letting people know there's a full-time chairman," said Mr. Patterson, who was visiting Live's Lieberman Enterprises Inc. unit in Minneapolis yesterday.
