 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): One Last Smear   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1986  The Senate Judiciary Committee will most likely recommend today that William H. Rehnquist be confirmed as chief justice of the Supreme Court. But the vote has not come soon enough to save Justice Rehnquist's critics from sinking to a new low. Their latest effort has shown how seamy Washington political life can become.  The critics don't like the ideas of Justice Rehnquist or the man who appointed him, Ronald Reagan. But their attacks have been on a personal level. Dubious hearsay evidence that he challenged minority voters at a polling place 25 years ago was dredged up. Restrictive covenants in ancient deeds were unearthed in support of the totally unwarranted suggestion that the man was a racist. Finally, yesterday, came the new low -- a smirky suggestion that the justice was once a dope addict.  In 1977, Justice Rehnquist suffered from back pain. His doctor prescribed Placidyl, a painkiller. He apparently suffered some disorientation from using the drug before he took himself off of it in 1981.
