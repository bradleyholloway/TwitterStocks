 High Capital-Gains Tax Busts State Budgets   By Reynolds, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1990  One particular federal tax has had an especially harsh impact on state tax receipts: the 33% maximum marginal tax rate on capital gains enacted in 1986. Raising the maximum marginal rate on capital gains to 33% from 20% stopped the natural growth of taxable state income from this source. States in which capital gains had previously been an important source of taxable state income are finding weak tax receipts, perhaps without understanding the reason.  The chart shows realized capital gains (net after losses) for the five states that account for nearly half the capital gains in the entire nation (see accompanying chart -- WSJ Sep. 14, 1990). Florida and Texas have no income tax, which is one reason that many people who have accumulated substantial assets live there. New York, California and Illinois have long depended heavily on capital gains taxes. So have New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.  For the federal government, the weakness in realizations since 1986 has been at least partly offset by a much higher average tax rate on a small volume of capital gains. The maximum federal capital gains tax was increased to 45% in 1975 from 27% in 1968. Yet so few of the affected high-bracket taxpayers actually realized gains at the punitive rates of 1975 that the average capital-gains tax (on both excluded and taxable gains) remained exactly the same in 1975 as it had been in 1968: 15%. The 1985 reduction of the highest capital gains tax to 20% percent so encouraged efficient turnover of assets among higher-income taxpayers that the average tax paid remained exactly what it had been in the high-tax 1970s: 15%.
