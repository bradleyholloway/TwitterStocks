 SHOP TALK   By By William Mathewson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1988  IN SPORTS-CRAZY Boston, a new biography of Boston Celtics' superstar Larry Bird ought to be big news -- which it is, but not in the Boston Globe.  No, insist Globe Sports Editor Vince Doria and Book Editor Mark Feeney. "There have been a lot of {sports} books that haven't received a lot of mention. . . . Unless a book raises controversial issues, we don't pay much attention," explains Mr. Doria.  Then why has the Globe, while ignoring the Levine book, reported on several occasions that Mr. Ryan is writing a Bird biography? "I don't know if I'd think that was odd," says Mr. Doria. When asked whether the Globe plans to run excerpts of the Ryan book, Mr. Doria replies: "We probably will look at serial rights."
