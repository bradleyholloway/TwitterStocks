 Fox, NBC Get Static for Not Airing Debate Live   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  Fox aired its new science-fiction drama "Dark Angel" instead of the debate between Mr. Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. NBC, owned by General Electric Co., gave its affiliates the option of showing the debate or a Major League Baseball playoff game. Both networks' cable channels aired the debate live.  Fox said it also doesn't plan live coverage on its broadcast network for the other two presidential debates or the vice-presidential debate; NBC said its decision depends on the playoff schedule. (In 1992, CBS News didn't break away from a baseball game that had gone into extra innings during one of the presidential debates.)  After coming under fire from Capitol Hill, regulators and media-watchdog groups, Fox and NBC offered feeds of the debate to affiliates that wanted to air the event. But Fox said its affiliates could run the debate only after "Dark Angel."
