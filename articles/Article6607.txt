 Letters to the Editor: We Are Not Holding Americans Captive   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2002  Watching the news media and reading the editorials, one would be led to believe that cases of child abduction exist only in Saudi Arabia. This is hardly the case. In the world today, there are 1,100 cases of child abduction involving an American parent and a parent from another country. The overwhelming majority of cases involve countries neighboring the U.S. or in Europe. The cases involving Middle Eastern countries are a minority, and those involving Saudi Arabia represent less than 1% of the total. But for some strange reason, they account for virtually all the media coverage. Of the 12 cases involving the kingdom, two (Al-Gheshayan and [Amjad Radwan]) can no longer be regarded as outstanding. Of the remaining 10, five have requested that the Saudi and American governments take no action at this time, as the families themselves try to resolve the cases privately. The remaining cases are taken very seriously, and my government has formed a committee to ascertain the facts and recommend solutions, where possible.
