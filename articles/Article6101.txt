 Deloitte, Adelphia Are Squaring Off In a Blame Game   By By Robert Frank, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  A Deloitte representative said the board is simply trying to deflect attention from its own troubles, and that board members knew about and approved many of the very transactions it now criticizes. "Deloitte's work with Adelphia complies with professional standards" and is based in part on information provided by both management and the board of directors, Deloitte said in a statement.  The Deloitte representative said the firm couldn't have uncovered the stock purchases because the Rigas family created a complicated series of cascading companies to mask the transactions. While Deloitte reviewed the basic financials for the Rigas's closely held entities, they didn't audit the Rigas's books. Adelphia executives in one case created fictitious documents to create the appearance of bank transfers to buy the stock, according to people familiar with the situation.  The board is also calling Deloitte on the carpet over its handling of a $26 million timber transaction. Under terms of the deal, Adelphia paid $26 million for the timber rights on land across from the Rigas family estate in Coudersport. Immediately after the payment, Mr. Rigas purchased the land for about $500,000. The timber rights revert to the Rigas family in the event of a change of control of the company, people familiar with the situation say. An attorney for the Rigas family didn't return a call seeking comment.
