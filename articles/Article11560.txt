 TECHNOLOGY   By By John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1992  At Prudential Securities, a powerful parallel supercomputer gives quick risk analysis for mortgage-backed securities, while clients are on the line. Previously, the analysis took several minutes on conventional computers -- too long to keep clients on the phone, and long enough for market prices to change, sometimes rendering the analysis obsolete.  Now, with parallel machines -- which use dozens, or even hundreds, of processors working on different aspects of a problem at the same time -- customers get answers in as little as 30 seconds. Parallel processors, which can range from $300,000 to $3 million, offer supercomputer power at far less cost. They provide a clear strategic advantage over traditional systems, says David Audley, research director for Prudential's financial strategies group, which has used an Intel parallel machine for about a year.  Other emerging markets include credit-card companies and retailers. American Express just bought two Thinking Machines computers for its travel-services operation, while Kmart is using a Teradata parallel computer to coax new sales strategies from the mountain of transaction information collected by all of its stores each day.
