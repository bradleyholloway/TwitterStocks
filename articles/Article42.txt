Manuscripts, letters and annotated scores of three concertos belonging to Joseph Szigeti, the Hungarian violinist who died 10 years ago, will go on exhibition Saturday in the Amsterdam Gallery of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, at 111 Amsterdam Avenue, near 65th Street. Mr. Szigeti's Guarnerius violin, programs and a manuscript autographed and dedicated to him by Bela Bartok are also part of the display, ''Joseph Szigeti Remembered,'' organized by Frank Campbell, chief of the library's music division, as a tribute.
