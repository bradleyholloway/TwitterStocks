 U.S. Auto Makers Are Maintaining Production Plans   By By Damon Darlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1985  The September production schedule of about 653,700 cars, an increase of 21% over last year, is at that level because of the unusually aggressive incentive programs that the four major domestic auto makers resorted to in August to boost sales. Those programs continue this month in an effort to boost slumping sales and to dispose of 1985 models. Sales from the last 10 days of August and the month will be reported today; some analysts say 10-day sales were as high as an annual sales rate of 10 million cars. Annual sales rates for domestic cars have been hovering around the seven million mark.
