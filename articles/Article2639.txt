 Calpers Is Getting $3.8 Million in Pact On Grace Litigation   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1999  W.R. GRACE & Co., as part of an agreement settling litigation against its former directors and officers, will receive an insurance payout of $3.8 million. An item in yesterday's editions incorrectly said the California Public Employees' Retirement System, a plaintiff in the case, will receive the funds.  Mr. Bolduc left (J. Peter) Grace amid accusations he sexually harassed several Grace employees. Mr. Bolduc has said in court he didn't sexually harass employees, said Gerald Walpin, his attorney. Mr. Bolduc was a defendant in the Calpers suit but won't make any payments under the settlement, Mr. Walpin said.
