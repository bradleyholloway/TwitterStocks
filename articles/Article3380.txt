 Europe Watches Deutsche Post For Signs of Life for New Issues   By By Vanessa Fuhrmans and Silvia Ascarelli, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2000  How Deutsche Post fares over the coming weeks isn't a matter of concern just for Deutsche Post investors. Europe's entire new-issues market is watching the offering for signs that it is safe to venture back into equity offerings -- especially after the dismal performance of T-Online International AG, Lycos Europe and a host of other splashy share sales this year.  The zigzag performance of Deutsche Post on its first day reflects investors' ambivalence about the stock. Though retail investors, particularly in Germany, remain hungry for new stocks, many are still reeling from losses from two other big government-related sales this year -- a second offering of Deutsche Telekom AG shares and the T-Online IPO. On Monday, private investors were behind much of the initial selling in Deutsche Post shares, according to traders.  What is certain, though, is that Deutsche Post's size and instant blue-chip status will command the attention of many European institutional investors. Like many fund managers, Mr. [Juergen Wetzel] bought Deutsche Post shares because it is bound to be a must-have for German index funds and European blue-chip portfolios. Though Deutsche Post won't qualify to be included in the German benchmark DAX index this year, it probably will become a candidate soon. It is also likely to join the broader DJ Stoxx Index as early as February.
