 Personal Business: Be On the Lookout for Retroactive Interest   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2005  "This is a big 'gotcha' for a lot of consumers," says Curtis Arnold, founder of CardRatings.com, a Web site that compares credit-card offers.  Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, says shoppers who live "paycheck to paycheck" and aren't sure they can pay off the entire balance by the end of the promotion should refrain from signing up. Instead, it's probably wiser to just use a regular credit card to purchase the item.  Those who do risk getting hit with retroactive interest should "get a calendar and put a big 'X' over" the date when the low-interest promotion ends, Mr. McKinley says. If they can't pay off the entire balance by then, it might work to try transferring the balance to another credit card.
