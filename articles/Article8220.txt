Financial markets anticipate a slight increase in employment. Like government officials, voters have been turning cautiously optimistic, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows. By 39% to 23%, voters expect things to get better over the next year -- the highest level in a year.  "It's the second month in a row that there's been an uptick in the perception that things are getting better, and that's often a precursor of economic recovery," say pollsters Peter Hart and Vince Breglio, who conducted the survey. A new Chamber of Commerce survey of small and medium-sized firms finds sharply higher expectations for the economy but less confidence about their own enterprises.  This week's failure by U.S. lawmakers to forge compromise legislation means the issue could be postponed until after the U.S. elections. One reason: overwhelming public disapproval of the deal. The new Journal/NBC poll shows a third of voters favor Bush's stance of making the guarantees conditional on a settlements freeze -- and 49% oppose the guarantees under any circumstances.
