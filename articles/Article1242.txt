 Panel to Smoke Out Answers About Ads By Philip Morris --- Committee to Ask Whether Bill of Rights Campaign Tries to Dodge TV Ban   By By Alix M. Freedman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1989  A congressional committee will question Philip Morris Cos. about whether the company's controversial ad campaign celebrating the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights is an attempt to dodge the 1971 ban against cigarette advertising on television.  In the agreement last August, the National Archives accepted the $600,000 from Philip Morris to create the exhibit on the Bill of Rights within the Archives' building. Philip Morris received the first charter membership in a new private-sector association to support the work of the Archives. The company also received use of the Archives name in advertisements and the agency's "best efforts" to secure the voice of leading Americans, including past presidents.
