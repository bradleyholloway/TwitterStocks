 Dollar Gains Against Rival Currencies As Euro Weakness Sets Off Domino Effect   By By Jennifer Downey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2001  Traders sent the euro/dollar pair to 84.13 U.S. cents, its 2001 low, and the sterling/dollar pair to $1.3714, its 15-year low. The dollar also reached 1.8058 Swiss francs, a new 2001 high.  Sterling had previously been stabilizing from the selloff that occurred in response to the Labour government's landslide win in U.K. elections Thursday as market participants seemed to recognize that euro-zone entry for the U.K. is further in the future than was thought last week. Re-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair helped allay concerns about the pound's demise by reshuffling his cabinet over the weekend. He replaced one of the government's most vocal pro-euro figures with a foreign minister who strongly supports the party's official "wait and see" policy.  Late yesterday, the euro was at 84.34 cents, down from 85.15 cents in London and from 85.06 cents in New York late Friday. The dollar was at 121.98 yen, up from 121.45 yen in London and from 120.94 yen late Friday in New York. Against the dollar, sterling traded at $1.3727, down from $1.3799 late Friday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 1.8039 francs, up from 1.7929 francs late Friday.
