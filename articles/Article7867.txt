 Interest-Rates Prospects Boost Dollar As Market Still Awaits March Jobs Data   By By Christy Hale, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1989  The U.S. currency lingered just below 1.8700 marks and around 132.00 yen for most of the day. Late in the New York session, comments from Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, gave the dollar a slight boost. He said a sustained slowing of U.S. economic growth is needed to reduce inflationary pressures.  Dealers said Mr. Parry's comments -- possibly signaling tighter policies from the Fed -- combined with late short covering to carry the dollar to its late afternoon levels. In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8718 marks, up from 1.8703 marks late Wednesday, and at 132.16 yen, above 131.60 yen. Sterling was unchanged at $1.7020.  Dealers said non-dollar currency trading, a feature in recent sessions, predominated. Concerns about the Recruit Co. scandal in Japan weakened the yen, while the Swiss franc remained under pressure despite rumors of an increase in Switzerland's 4% discount rate. The movements by the Swiss and Japanese currencies favored the mark, and indirectly supported the dollar, dealers said.
