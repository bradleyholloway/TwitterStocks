 Business Conditions in Japan Continue To Worsen, an Influential Survey Finds   By By David P. Hamilton, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1998  The Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan, a quarterly survey of 9,129 companies, showed that major manufacturers found their business environment significantly worse in the last quarter of 1998 than in the previous period. The tankan's socalled diffusion index, which subtracts the percentage of companies who believe conditions are worsening from those who believe conditions are improving, worsened to minus 56 in the survey released Monday in Tokyo from minus 51 in the previous survey, which came out on Oct. 1.  Conditions are no better, and in many cases far worse, among nonmanufacturers and smaller firms. The diffusion index at major nonmanufacturers, for instance, fell to minus 41 in the current survey from minus 36 instead of improving to minus 31 as those companies had predicted. Small manufacturers found conditions even grimmer; their diffusion index fell to minus 60 from minus 56-tellingly, exactly what they had forecast for the latest survey, and the worst score ever reported for that sector.
