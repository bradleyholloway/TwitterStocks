 FDA Approves Extra-Strength Excedrin As Over-the-Counter Migraine Medicine   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1998  Pharmaceutical analysts anticipate big demand when Bristol-Myers repackages the medicine under the brand name Excedrin Migraine within a few weeks, without changing the retail price. Currently, extra-strength Excedrin averages $7.51 for 100 tablets.  "The analgesic market is very, very huge," said Hemant Shah, a Warren, N.J., analyst. "Migraine sufferers use all kinds of (over-the-counter) pain relievers; unfortunately, most don't work. This gives Excedrin an added edge in a highly competitive market." He and other analysts expect Excedrin Migraine to make big inroads in the over-the-counter sector, which includes millions of people who don't have medical insurance or don't want to see a doctor. But they don't expect many patients now taking prescription drugs to switch.
