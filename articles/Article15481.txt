 Turmoil at Olivetti Reflects Power Shift At European Firms --- Institutional Investors Outgun Old Cliquish Structures In Corporate Management   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters Maureen Kline in Milan And Richard L. Hudson in London, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1996  This Tuesday, shaken by such restive shareholders, Olivetti's board accepted the resignation of the man whom investors blamed most for the unprofitable company's many woes, Chairman Carlo De Benedetti. His departure was hastened by a high-stakes face-off with his lieutenant, Chief Executive Francesco Caio. But his ouster makes him the latest victim of a noisy clash between the old and new ways of doing business in Europe.  Yesterday, Olivetti's new management began what's likely to be a long process of repairing relations with its many U.S., Japanese and European investors. In a conference call with financial analysts last night, Mr. Caio gave a lengthy breakdown of Olivetti's new strategy, outlining plans to continue restructuring its troubled PC and printer businesses -- for which he confirmed a new 200 billion lira ($132 million) restructuring charge to earnings. And he emphasized plans to accelerate the company's move into the fast-growing Italian telecommunications market, in partnership with Bell Atlantic Corp. and others.  But the turmoil inside the company apparently isn't over. Olivetti yesterday announced the surprise resignation of its general manager, Renzo Francesconi. Mr. Francesconi had been brought in by Mr. Caio in July to head Olivetti's finance, administration and auditing. He wrote in a resignation letter that he didn't agree with the first-half financial results as approved Tuesday night by the Olivetti board; the results showed a 440.2 billion lira pretax loss. Mr. Francesconi couldn't be reached to comment.
