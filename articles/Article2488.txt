 Russian Crisis May Help Polish Poland's Image   By By Daniel Michaels, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1998  Thanks to eight years of tough reforms, Poland's economy has surged this year while other emerging markets have wallowed. Now Warsaw faces an acid test as global financial turmoil forces the government to redraw its assumptions for privatization revenue and economic growth. If U.S. and Western European markets take a sustained dive, say investors and analysts, Poland will probably be dragged down, too. But they add that if Western economies manage to ride out the storm, Poland could move up a class in investors' estimation even as other once-buoyant markets sink.  "This is a big test as to whether Poland's fundamentals make it immune from the shock to emerging markets," says Mohamed el-Erian, head of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney in London. If Western markets avoid a major retrenchment themselves, he says, Poland should continue to draw international investment. "When cooler heads prevail, Poland will be viewed much more as a European Union convergence play than an emerging-markets play."  Analysts say Poland's decision last week to cut two key rates indicates the country's economy remains fundamentally strong despite Russia's economic crisis. Poland reduced the zloty's monthly devaluation rate to 0.50% from 0.65% and the 28-day money market intervention rate to 18% from 19%.
