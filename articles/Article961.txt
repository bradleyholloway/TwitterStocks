 The Oh-So-British Lloyd's of London Inspires a Most Un-British Ballyhoo   By By Craig Forman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1987  The executives are running in what may be this year's most obscure election. Next Wednesday, they and nine other candidates hope to win one of three vacant seats on the council of Lloyd's of London, the world's largest insurance market. The 28-member ruling council regulates the #10 billion ($17.87 billion) market.  No one runs for the money, because council positions are unpaid. But then, these contenders don't need money. They are all Lloyd's investors -- and so each boasts a minimum net worth of #100,000. A council seat does offer something money can't buy: prestige.  The annual Lloyd's election used to be a ho-hum affair. This is Britain, where you don't run for office, you stand for it. At Lloyd's, a venerable British institution, it was considered unseemly, even unthinkable, for candidates to campaign openly.
