 Letters to the Editor: Long List of Opponents To Telescope Project   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  In your May 23 Mount Graham editorial "A Species of Extremism" you said, "no one has shown persuasively that the project would harm the squirrel." For the record: All state, federal and University of Arizona biologists who prepared the official biological documentation have opposed it. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, under oath, testified against it. Scientists nationwide have signed petitions opposing it. University of Arizona biologists risked tenure and signed. Max Planck and Ohio State scientists oppose their own institutions' participation.
