 Eastern Air Pilots Set Deadline for Strike Pending Union Vote   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1986  The master executive council of Eastern Airlines' pilots' union formally set a Feb. 26 strike deadline, pending the outcome of a strike authorization vote.  The action, which was expected, means that the union is prepared to strike Miami-based Eastern at 12:01 a.m. EST Feb. 26 if it and the company can't reach agreement on a new contract. Strike-authorization ballots were mailed to union members earlier this week, the union said.
