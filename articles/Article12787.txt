 Microsoft Attempts To Turn Criticism Over Web Services   By By Mark Wigfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2002  The move came as John Borthwick, vice president of AOL Advanced Services, took the stand again yesterday in the Microsoft antitrust trial to defend his charge that Microsoft could, if unrestrained, use the Windows operating system to funnel electronic-commerce transactions through Microsoft.  Microsoft attorney Richard Pepperman got Mr. Borthwick to admit that, for now, Microsoft's Internet strategy -- known as .Net -- is based on so-called open standards. That means that the system would work with non-Microsoft computer operating systems and software.  "Microsoft has nothing to rival Time Warner assets," one AOL official wrote. "AOL must take advantage of this in any way it can." The document recommended that Time Warner assets be withheld from any electronic-commerce site that participates in Microsoft's .Net program.
