 Austria Lifts Curbs On Foreign Owners Of 2 Banks' Shares   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1987  The move abolishes a law that denied voting rights, subscription rights and dividend payments to foreigners owning shares in Creditanstalt-Bankverein AG and Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG. Both banks are 60%-owned by the Austrian government.  A Creditanstalt spokesman said the change was a prerequisite for listing shares of the two banks on foreign exchanges. Laenderbank plans to start listing its shares on West German and possibly other foreign exchanges soon, and Creditanstalt plans to do likewise next spring.
