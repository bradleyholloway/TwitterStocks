 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Economy, Stupid   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1992  The decline and fall of George Bush will go down as one of the great dramas of American political history. A President tumbling from near 90% approval ratings to stunning defeat in less than two years, without serious scandal and despite a still-substantial reservoir of personal good will among his countrymen. A President who masterfully assembled a world-wide coalition in the Gulf War reduced to a domestic campaign of mind-numbing incoherence. How could it all happen?  To quote James Carville, Bill Clinton's Roger Ailes, "It's the economy, stupid." Almost no one doubts that the sputtering economy was the central failure of the Bush administration, and the central reason for his rejection. Debates, sound bites, abortion, family values, Iran-Contra and the rest scarcely would have mattered if the economy had been growing at 4% or 5% over the past year. Yet in fact the economic issue was even more insidious than is commonly understood, for it was a root cause of most of the other negatives.  And so it went right up to Election Day. The campaign was incoherent because economic policy was incoherent. Was renouncing the tax pledge a mistake, or making the tax pledge a mistake? Were the Reagan years to be embraced, or blamed? No doubt confused by conflict among his advisers, Mr. Bush was never able to make up his mind. So a new tax pledge was on and off, off and on. James Baker and his aides arrived to frame a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, but Richard Darman briefed for the presidential debates. Like the tax pledge, Mr. Darman's participation in a second administration was off and on. The 1990 budget deal was sometimes a mistake, and sometimes a success.
