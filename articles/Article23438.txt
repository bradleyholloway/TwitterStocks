 Don't Get Hit by the Pitch: How Advisers Manipulate You   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2007  "Con men will talk about putting people under the ether," says Doug Shadel, AARP director for Washington state. "They dangle this fantasy, and people just can't think straight." Mr. Shadel and Prof. [Anthony Pratkanis] are co-authors of a free AARP book, "Weapons of Fraud," which you can obtain by emailing your name and address to weaponsoffraud@aarp.org.  How can you avoid getting tricked into bad or fraudulent investments? "First, know the ways of persuasion," Prof. Pratkanis advises. "If you start to feel like your emotions are being played with, get out of that situation. Second, take some lessons from Warren Buffett. Understand the companies and products you invest in."  Maybe the smartest strategy is to avoid snap decisions. "I have a rule that I won't make a decision until 24 hours after hearing the sales pitch," Mr. Shadel says. "That gives time for the ether to lift."
