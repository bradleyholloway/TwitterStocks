 Carrefour's Profit Slips, but It Gains Share in France   By Kenneth Maxwell and Adriana Brasileiro, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 2005  The positive stock performance also reflected good news on Carrefour's market share, analysts said. The company said it was able to claw back a bit of market share in France as its strategy to lower prices started to pay off. Mr. [Duran] said it was the first time since 2000 that Carrefour's half-year share of the French market had been higher than a year earlier. But Carrefour warned that second-half operating profit in France probably would fall 15%, as it did in the first half, as it sacrifices profit margin to lure more customers through lower prices.
