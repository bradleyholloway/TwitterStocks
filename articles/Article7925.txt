 Bond Prices Move Higher on Strength of Dollar After European Central Bankers Push Up Rates   By By Constance Mitchell and Susan Scherreik, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1989  As expected, West Germany's Bundesbank raised the Lombard rate and discount rates one percentage point to 8% and 6%, respectively. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing and the Lombard rate is the effective ceiling on overnight loans. The West German central bank said the rate hikes were needed to cool the nation's "exuberant" economy and to combat inflation.  The Bundesbank move triggered a round of rate hikes throughout Europe as central banks in France, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium all tightened credit conditions. England's central bank signaled a rise in interest rates, causing Barclays Bank PLC and other large commercial banks to raise their base lending rates to 15% from 14%.  In early U.S. trading, Treasury prices dropped sharply due to what Brian Fabbri, economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc., called a "knee-jerk" reaction. He said investors seemed convinced that higher rates would cut the dollar's strength and that "would be bad for bond."
