 Politics & Economics: EU Ministers Fail to Solve Spat Over Protectionism in Energy Pacts   By Echikson, William, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  Europe's energy-merger battlefield moved from corporate boardrooms to Brussels' meeting rooms, but finance ministers for Italy and France failed to reach a compromise last night to appease Italian objections to the planned merger of France's Gaz de France and Suez.  Afterward, a person familiar with the deal said Italy's Enel SpA was now "more likely" to mount a competing bid for Suez, adding that the Italian energy company has arranged loans from 10 international and Italian banks.  Such protectionism is a "threat knocking on Europe's door," said Austrian Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, who was leading the monthly meeting of EU finance ministers. He said government meddling in takeovers was "unacceptable" and that regulators must commit to "open energy markets."
