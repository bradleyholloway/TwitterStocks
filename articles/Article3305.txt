 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2004  So far, the news isn't good. Even with the favorable impact from the timing of Independence Day (July 4th fell in July this year -- don't ask), retailers expect soft sales this month compared with last year. It is the weather, of course: July was swell last year, so this year is going to have a hard time measuring up.  The worry is that the softness in sales is part of a more pervasive slowdown. The economic reports so far for last month have been on the weak side, and a series of late-breaking warnings from business software companies raises the possibility that businesses put a sudden crimp on spending in June. It isn't hard to come up with a bearish case, where the fading effects of last year's tax cuts and mortgage refinancing boom throw a damper on consumer spending at the same time that businesses cut back.
