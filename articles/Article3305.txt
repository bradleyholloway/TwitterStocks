 Sunoco, Valero Energy Post Strong Net On Tight Gasoline Market, Cold Weather   By By Alexei Barrionuevo, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2000  For the past two years, volatile crudeoil prices and a drop-off in demand caused principally by the Asian economic crisis have battered refiners. But suddenly, the refining outlook is the best it has been in years, with gasoline and heating-oil inventories at low levels and the summer driving season approaching fast.  Sunoco attributed its higher-than-expected profit to low heating-oil inventories and a brief run of cold weather in January and February. The Philadelphia refiner said net income more than quadrupled to $78 million, or 87 cents a diluted share, from $19 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding an $11 million gain related to the sale of its international production business, Sunoco earned $67 million, or 75 cents a share, in the latest quarter, well ahead of the profit of 55 cents a share expected by analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
