 Limited's Net Fell 46% in 2nd Period; Upturn in Women's Retailing Is Forecast   By By Carol Hymowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1988  Limited Inc. said net income in its fiscal second quarter fell 46% to $30.7 million, or 17 cents a share, as the severe slump in women's fashion retailing continued.  In the year-ago period, the Columbus, Ohio, specialty retailer had net income of $57.2 million, or 30 cents a share. Sales for the latest quarter, ended July 30, rose 8.6% to $893.1 million from $822.1 million. But sales of stores open more than a year were flat.  Limited Chairman Leslie H. Wexner said, "I believe this difficult period has bottomed out, and I see signs of recovery." He added that "the degree of customer acceptance will be determined over the next several months. We are proceeding cautiously with the full knowledge that we have the ability to quickly match supply to demand should business accelerate beyond planned levels."
