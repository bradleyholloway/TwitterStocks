 More Ways to Have Fun In the Back Seat --- Rear of the Car Goes Plush, As Auto Makers Put in Games, Movie Screens, Even Twin Beds   By By Karen Lundegaard, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  After years of lavishing attention on everything from dashboards to cup holders, car makers this year are giving the royal treatment to the long-ignored back seat -- and its occupants. Want to pacify the kids with a "Lilo and Stitch" DVD? The new Chrysler Pacifica not only can include a movie screen but comes with theater-style seats. Cadillac's Sixteen, a prototype of a new luxury car, turns the front and back seats into a chaise lounge for passengers more interested in naps than scenery. And a whole host of new models include plug-ins for TVs, games and cellphones.  Legroom also is getting a considerable boost. The Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, a new General Motors Corp. compact car, will offer reclining seats in the rear. The seats also move forward and back a total of 7 inches, so they can be adjusted to whom or what is being hauled. Honda Motor Co.'s new Element, a small sport-utility wagon, can be turned into a roadside hotel by folding the front and rear seats flat to make side-by-side twin beds. And seeking to put an end to age-old "it's too hot" versus "it's too cold" combat, several car makers are installing controls for heat and air-conditioning in the back.  While some cars come with DVD players already installed, about 70 models offer them as an option, generally for about $1,000. For example, the "rear-seat" option on the Cadillac Escalade SUV includes a remote control DVD/CD player, overhead LCD screen, wireless headphones and a remote videogame plug. Cost: $1,295. (See chart on page D2 for a list of cars that come with DVD players.)
