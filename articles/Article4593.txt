 Aluminum Bike Could Pump Up Sagging Market   By By James W. Winston, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1985  And in bicycles for adults, the traditional steel bike may soon look as outdated as bell-bottom pants. At least, that is what designers of aluminum bikes hope.  Consequently, less-expensive aluminum designs are starting to appear. By next spring, many stores are expected to carry aluminum bikes in the $250 range of many popular steel models. As a result, aluminum bikes may capture 20% of the U.S. market within five years, says Steve Ready, the executive director of the National Bicycle Dealers Association. The trade group says aluminum this year will account for less than 1% of the projected 10.5 million bicycles to be sold.  Nobody seems to doubt that the partisans of aluminum are succeeding at building smoother-riding bikes. But the durability of their bikes is debated. "We estimate you'd have to ride our frame a million miles to get it to fail," says Stephen Zeoli, the advertising manager of Cannondale Corp., a Georgetown, Conn., maker of aluminum frames for bikes priced at $400 and up. But bicycle designer Tom Ritchie in La Honda, Calif., insists: "Steel holds up better."
