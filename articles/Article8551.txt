 World's Sports Capital? Atlanta Vies for the Title   By By Ken Gepfert, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1994  A drive to transform Atlanta into the "the sports capital of the world" will begin in earnest early next year, when local tourism officials unveil a new $1.6 million marketing campaign promoting that phrase. At the same time, the city's best-known builder, John C. Portman Jr., will add a second name to his Atlanta Apparel Mart: the International Sports Plaza.  The first is a 10-year plan to land other premier sporting events. A "mega-event target list" prepared by the Atlanta Sports Council, an arm of the local Chamber of Commerce, sets lofty goals: the National Basketball Association all-star game in 1997, baseball's all-star game in 1998, a major golf championship in 1999, the Super Bowl in 2000 (Atlanta already hosted the 1994 Super Bowl) and a major tennis championship in 2001. Last month the sports council launched a bid to wrest the U.S. Open tennis championship from New York, and it already has landed college basketball's Final Four in 2002.  The second ingredient is the transformation of an underused trade mart owned by Mr. Portman into what he calls "the world trade center for the business of sport." The idea is to build a year-round meeting place for everyone connected with the sports business: sporting-goods manufacturers and retailers, event sponsors and promoters, sports publishers and governing bodies, even athletes and their agents.
