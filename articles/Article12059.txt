 Ford Reports Flat U.S. Sales For February --- Incentives, Strong Results For Trucks Fail to Lift Company's Overall Data   By By Oscar Suris, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1996  Ford Motor Co. reported flat U.S. sales of cars and light trucks in February, despite recent incentive programs and strong sales of its two best-selling trucks.  But Ford's passenger-car sales remained sluggish, declining 4.7% from a year earlier. Although the recently redesigned Taurus sedan remained the bestselling car in the U.S., its February sales were off 8.1% from last year. For the first two months of this year, Taurus sales were down 5.9% while sales of the No. 2-selling car, Honda Motor Co.'s Accord, were up 14%, although Accord sales still lag behind Taurus sales by about 10,000 units.  Industry analysts, most of whom were expecting a tough first quarter for Ford, weren't surprised by the company's lackluster February sales. For its part, Ford hailed its results, citing February sales records for individual models like the Ford Contour compact sedan. "We are encouraged by signs of vitality in the retail car sales results," said Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales.
