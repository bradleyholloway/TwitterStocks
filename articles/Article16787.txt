 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  Under the AMT you can't deduct state and local taxes. The standard deduction, which is taken by nearly two-thirds of all taxpayers under the regular system, isn't allowed. Neither are personal exemptions. Among those most likely to be hit by the AMT are people with large families who make between $100,000 and $500,000 and live in high-tax areas, such as New York City. There are two AMT tax rates: 26% and 28%. Regular federal income-tax rates on ordinary income range from 10% to 35%.  Some lawmakers want to eliminate the AMT. But that isn't considered likely anytime soon since it generates so much revenue. So look for a compromise in which Congress essentially slaps what congressional staffers refer to as a "patch" on the problem.
