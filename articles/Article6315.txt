 Yahoo!, IBM, Intel, Microsoft Fall As Old Economy Draws Interest   By By Gaston F. Ceron, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2000  Technology stocks took another hit, but the Old Economy sectors had enough going for them to lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.9%.  Caught up in the testing was the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which dropped 132.30 points, or 3.2%, to 4055.90. Among the stocks slammed were Yahoo! (Nasdaq), down 8 7/16, or 5.9%, to 133 1/2; International Business Machines, off 3, or 2.5%, to 119 1/8; Intel (Nasdaq), which fell 3/8, or 0.3%, to 130 3/4; Microsoft (Nasdaq), down 2 3/16, or 2.5%, to 83 7/8; and Hewlett-Packard, off 1 7/16, or 1%, to 145 13/16.  Among large, well-known stocks, the day's biggest loser was Motorola, which sank 18%, or 26 1/2, to 123 1/2. After the close of the market Monday, the company reported first-quarter earnings that were slightly better than analysts had expected. But the stock fell once trading resumed yesterday because Motorola said it expects earnings for the second quarter and 2000 will fall short of analysts' targets.
