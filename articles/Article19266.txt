 Immigration Issue Flares Up in Germany --- Schroeder's Plan to Provide Work Permits to 20,000 Sparks Attacks by CDU   By By David Wessel and Cecilie Rohwedder, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2000  DRESDEN, Germany -- Kurt Biedenkopf, frequently identified by pollsters as Germany's most popular politician, says the nation's leaders haven't adequately prepared the public for a reasoned debate over immigration, an even more delicate issue here than in other rich countries because of Germany's Nazi past.  A wing of Mr. Biedenkopf's conservative Christian Democratic Union, desperate to distinguish itself from the ruling Social Democratic Party, is turning to anti-immigration populism. Juergen Ruettgers, the party's gubernatorial candidate in North Rhine-Westphalia, is using such slogans as "more education instead of more immigration" and the more pointed "Kinder statt Inder," or "children instead of Indians." Both attack Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's plan to offer work permits to 20,000 foreign software specialists, many likely to come from India.
