 Planning Ahead: Expecting a Tax Rise Next Year, Lobbyists Try to Protect Clients --- They Seek Out Coalitions, Ignore Campaign Pledges; VAT Appears Unpopular --- A Windfall for Big Law Firms   By By Monica Langley and Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1988  So lobbyists are scurrying about, trying to round up business and form coalitions to fight what they say may be the biggest tax rise in years. "There will be a tax increase next year, perhaps for as much as $30 billion to $40 billion," says John Merrigan, a top tax lawyer and lobbyist here. "We've already been contacted by a number of businesses who are concerned about next year's tax bill."  But the lobbyists' expectations are shared by many lawmakers. Despite the campaign rhetoric, congressional tax writers view the odds of a tax bill next year as high. "A tax increase must definitely be considered," says House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat. "I just don't see how we can reduce the deficit by just cutting spending." New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Moynihan, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, agrees. "Anybody who thinks we won't think about a tax increase is wrong," he says.  In fact, Congress is already on the verge of raising taxes. Tax bills in both the House and Senate would raise taxes from an acceleration in corporate estimated tax payments, a restriction on the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations and curbs on life insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters. The House tax bill also would raise additional taxes for, among others, military contractors and companies owning stock in other companies.
