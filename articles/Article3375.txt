 Law Firm Sidley Austin Is Target Of EEOC Age-Discrimination Suit   By Burton, Thomas M, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2005  "Control at Sidley Austin was hypercentralized," he said. "You had this incredibly small group making decisions" as to who made partner or was demoted, and as to what their partnership income was. Apart from 10 lawyers on the management committee, and 34 on an executive committee, "no other partners had any say on these issues," Mr. [John C. Hendrickson] said. Sidley Austin has about 1,500 lawyers. Sidley Austin issued a statement saying that nondiscrimination is its policy and that it "will vigorously defend against this EEOC action, which has no merit."
