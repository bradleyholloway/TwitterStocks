 To Fight for Principle   By By Mark Helprin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1997  Once again the Republican Party has failed to win the presidency for want of consistency and valor. Refusing to fight for principle and deathly afraid of loss, it lost without principle and died a fearful death. As if moved by the capitulationist impulse of his opponent's foreign policy, the Republican nominee, a valorous man too steeped in calculation, would neither attack his opposition nor vigorously promote his own program.  The fact remains that in 1996 the Republican Party spoke in the soft and unduly dainty language of its opponents, thinking that this was the way to win. Needless to say, it wasn't, for although it was appropriate to the message of the Democrats it was at variance with that of the Republicans. The former are proponents of a revolution in American life in which the tough talk came in the '60s and the sweet talk comes now. But though their revolution may be swathed in positiveness and pleasantries it is a revolution nonetheless.  It is a revolution in which individual rights have become group rights, in which responsibility has become entitlement, marriage has become divorce, birth has become abortion, medicine has become euthanasia, homosexuality is a norm, murder is neither a surprise nor necessarily punishable, pornography is piped into almost every home, gambling is legal, drugs are rife, students think Alaska is an island south of Los Angeles, and mothers of small children are sent off to war with great fanfare and pride. The catalog of this revolution is a record of modern life, too vast to be printed here, that every day becomes more voluminous, to the wonder and dismay of a large and seemingly powerless proportion of the population, perhaps even a majority, shouldered aside by lesser numbers of more agile true believers.
