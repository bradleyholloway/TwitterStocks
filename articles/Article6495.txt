 Juniper Posts a $29.7 Million Net Loss, But Stock Nevertheless Jumps on Results   By By Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2001  The results sparked a strong after-hours rally in Juniper shares, which jumped to $20.45, according to Island ECN. In 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Juniper shares had already risen $1.64, or 11%, to $16.64, their highest level in more than a month.  Mr. [Scott Kriens] said it is too soon to say that the telecom market had stabilized. Telecom companies likely will reduce capital spending next year, he said, but Juniper expects spending on Internet-related gear to be less affected.  Chief Financial Officer Marcel Gani told analysts that Juniper expects results in the current quarter similar to the third quarter, with flat revenue and earnings excluding items of 10 cents a share. He said Juniper expects revenue of $900 million to $1 billion next year, which would be virtually flat with projected revenue of $940 million for this year.
