 Fancy Flats In Old Boxes; Developers Turn Undistinguished Office Towers Into High-Rent -- and Low-Light -- Apartments   By Frangos, Alex, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2004  In Manhattan, an erstwhile Bank of New York back office at 90 Washington Street, completed in 1970, reopened last fall promoting "loft studios perfected." Brochures are filled with dazzling color photos of New York views, but none show the building itself, a drab, boxy, brown and white tile 27-story high-rise. Even the architect who supervised the conversion, blocks from the World Trade Center, Avinash K. Malhotra, admits it's "not really a very pretty building."  The former headquarters of the Getty Oil Co. on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles is a similar tale. The 22-story marble-clad monolith, which sat vacant for 10 years and almost became a building housing telecom equipment, save for the Internet bubble bursting, has its first open house for renters next month. One-bedrooms will go for around $1,150, larger units for over $3,500. What will prospective tenants see as they drive up? "It was your typical 1960s-designed modern building," says John Reed, the architect on that redo. "I wouldn't call it a historic landmark."  Whatever the problems, the building is almost filled. David Burke, who has a ninth-floor unit, says the space is large by New York standards. "It's narrow," he says. "But that's fine. Other studios have columns and I was able to get one without."
