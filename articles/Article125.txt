 Latin Turnaround: Long-Sickly Mexico Has Investment Boom As Trade Hopes Grow --- Outlook for Pact With U.S. Improves, and Companies Gird for a Changed Game --- New Political Climate Helps   By By Matt Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 1991  The trade negotiations would surely accelerate what already has been Mexico's most powerful economic upsurge since oil prices crashed in May 1981. Though a trade agreement probably won't be signed until next year, "the mere prospect of free trade is already generating additional investment, exports and imports," says Ciemex-Wefa, an economic consulting firm.  Inside an old pulp mill, Grupo Chihuahua, a lumber giant in the hills of northern Mexico, is rushing to complete for a scheduled July startup a state-of-the-art paper-making machine, the centerpiece of a $500 million investment program. The mill's daily production of 350 tons of paper will be marketed through another facet of Grupo Chihuahua's free-trade strategy: a partnership with Stuart Hall Inc., of Kansas City, Mo. Grupo Chihuahua bought a 10% stake in Stuart Hall, which, in turn, agreed to sell a big share of the new mill's output in the U.S.  Moreover, local investors are financing plant outlays by repatriating some of the billions of dollars they had moved abroad when oil prices collapsed. Last year, after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari unveiled his free-trade proposal, Mexico took in $8.4 billion in new capital -- through bond issues, equity investments and other sources -- compared with just $700 million in 1989, according to Salomon Brothers Inc. The New York securities firm estimates that about half of last year's capital inflow was money previously held abroad by Mexicans. And the inflow is accelerating, Salomon says. Mexico's currency reserves now total a near-record $14 billion.
