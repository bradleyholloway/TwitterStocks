Some Sunday mornings in the country, when work does not call, we set out the margarine, the strawberry jam and the apple butter, and on occasion the Portuguese marmalade. We pour coffee and then we start slicing our loaf of massa sovada, Portuguese sweet bread, and dropping the slices into the toaster. By the time a morning haze has burned off down the way at Napatree Point, R.I., the loaf is gone. The creases of the Sunday papers are filled with crumbs and the tablecloth is sticky and, in the days when our sons were young, so were the floor and the funnies.  Such orgies remind me of my first days buying Portuguese bread, when I was a teen-ager sailing in a chartered boat with my father and uncle. I saw a sign in a grocery window, probably in the Elizabeth Islands in Massachusetts, although it may have been Rhode Island: ''Portuguese sweet bread today.'' I pointed to the sign and said I'd take some, not being very sure if it was actually bread or something that should be bought from a butcher. After that, my fellow yachtsmen suggested that perhaps I might look for another loaf on the next trip ashore. By autumn, it became a private joke: Betsy's passion for sweet bread, although we all knew it was the grown-up men, not a weight-anxious teen-ager, who could shovel it away best.
