 World Wire [1]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1994  Prices per car, no matter how many passengers, range seasonally between $330 and $465 round trip. Eurotunnel, an Anglo-French consortium that built the so-called Chunnel for $14.93 billion, set an introductory $185 fare for June and July. Tickets go on sale today through travel agents.  The fares were far higher than expected to be competitive with ferry prices between $185 and $345. Eurotunnel is betting travelers will pay more for the high-speed, 30-minute trip in the 31-mile Chunnel unaffected by weather than for sea crossings of at least 80 minutes. Eurotunnel said it wouldn't engage in a price war if ferry operators cut their fares.  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan agreed to form a common market through the year 2000 and to start coordinating economic policies next year. Next month, tariffs between the neighboring Central Asian countries will be abolished and border customs eliminated, allowing free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. The two former Soviet republics, with a combined population of 39 million, said they can satisfy most of each other's trade needs. Kazakhstan is rich in energy and agriculture, Uzbekistan in cotton production and gold. Bilateral trade last year totaled about $500 million.
