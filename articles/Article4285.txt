 Five Airlines Move To Meet Price Rises By 2 Other Carriers --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1987  American, United and Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways and USAir said they will match the domestic fare increases proposed by Trans World Airlines last week and matched by Texas Air Corp. on Monday.  The increases, which are linked to rising fuel costs, will be between $3 and $7 each way on all flights. For flights under 500 miles, all the airlines except USAir will add a $3 "fuel surcharge"; for those between 500 and 1,000 miles, the fee will be $5; and for flights longer than 1,000 miles the surcharge will be $7. The changes will take effect June 19, as will TWA and Texas Air's increases.
