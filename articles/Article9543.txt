 IBM's Consulting Deal May Pay Off --- About 70% of Clients Lost To Unit of Pricewaterhouse Came Back After Purchase   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2003  Ginni Rometty, general manager of IBM's Business Consulting Services, said that it launched a "Winback" program to recapture old Pricewaterhouse clients. She said about 110 of 149 Pricewaterhouse customers that had said they wouldn't hire the unit for consulting work -- because Pricewaterhouse was also their auditor -- have resumed doing business with its successor within IBM.  The acquisition of the Pricewaterhouse business, based on its revenue last year, was expected to boost IBM's consulting revenue by about 50%, but the Pricewaterhouse unit's business was cratering when IBM agreed to acquire it. Revenue in the year ended June 30 fell 13% to $4.9 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year. That decline was driven by a 57% drop in bookings from customers that were also clients of the auditing side of Pricewaterhouse.
