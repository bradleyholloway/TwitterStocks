 More U.S. Funds Slated to Help Pay Energy Bills   By By John J. Fialka, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2000  The Clinton administration will release $130 million in additional funds to help low-income Americans pay energy bills as part of a package of moves to ease the impact of surging homeheating-oil prices.  The administration, which had earlier released $45 million from a fund to help pay heating bills, also will make Small Business Administration loans available for heating-oil distributors facing cash-flow problems trying to keep up supplies of increasingly expensive oil.  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the loans were a common request from heating-oil distributors and other industry members with whom he brainstormed to find ways to ease the economic shock of high oil prices in the Northeast.
