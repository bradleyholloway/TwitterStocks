 Wall Street: Schwab Weighs A New Round Of Downsizing   By By Susanne Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2002  In an internal memo sent Friday, Schwab Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles R. Schwab told employees that the stock-market rout, combined with various corporate governance and accounting breakdowns, has hurt its business more than expected. A Schwab spokesman declined to say how many employees might be let go, saying the firm has made no decisions.  By year end, there could be additional staff reductions of 1,000 at Schwab, estimates Morgan Stanley analyst Henry McVey. Already, Schwab has taken $449 million in charges over the past two years, including $421 million in restructuring charges. It has also cut its general advertising spending, which includes everything from television to direct mail, by more than half since it peaked in the first quarter of 2001.  Schwab's online stock-trading business is mired in a prolonged downturn, which has slashed its profits and left its stock price well below the $60 range it was trading at in mid-2000. Schwab closed yesterday at $7.67, down eight cents, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Schwab's average daily trades had fallen to 129,100 in the second quarter, down 19.5% from a year ago. At its peak, in March 2000, Schwab logged 349,900 trades a day.
