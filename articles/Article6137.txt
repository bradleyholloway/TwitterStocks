 Tough Quarter For Providers Of Oil Services --- Average 3rd-Quarter Profits Declined at Least 15%, Oil Analysts Estimate   By By Loren Fox, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1998  The oil slump has lasted long enough to damp nearly all aspects of the oil-services business. Analysts expect third-quarter profits to be down by 15% or more for companies that rent drilling rigs, evaluate rock, make drill bits and provide the whole array of products and services that make the oil-field work.  The mood is bleak, and it hasn't been helped by disappointing earnings "pre-announcements" by several companies. The biggest such bombshell came from diversified oil-services provider Baker Hughes, which in late September said it would earn 18 cents a diluted share in its fiscal fourth quarter, or just half of what analysts had anticipated. That is down from 35 cents a share a year earlier, reported pro-forma to account for its $3.3 billion purchase of geological data specialist Western Atlas Inc.  The oil-price drop was most damaging to U.S. onshore drilling, a market with many "marginal" wells that can be shut down on short notice. Nabors Industries Inc., the world's largest land driller, is expected to report third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a diluted share, down from 38 cents a year earlier, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.
