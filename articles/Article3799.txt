 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Sports -- On Sports: Olympic Trials   By Fatsis, Stefan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  The upshot is that we're in for a messy but potentially cathartic spring. Ms. [Kelli White] was nailed with the help of Justice Department documents from the Balco probe subpoenaed by a Senate committee and turned over to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, USADA. (Balco stands for Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, whose founder and three others have been indicted on steroids-related charges.) Material from the case so far has led to penalties against six track-and-field athletes. That's six more than from any other sport -- baseball among them whose athletes have testified before a grand jury.  That indicates that U.S. Olympic officials recognize the need to purge their sports, and fast. The track-and-field trials start July 9, and the USOC has to submit a team roster by July 21. Even one positive test by an American athlete in Greece will be a huge embarrassment. "It is absolutely imperative for the U.S. to field a clean team," USOC CEO Jim Scherr says. If big names are barred and the U.S. medal count declines, he says, "so be it."  The trick now for U.S. drug testers and Olympics leaders is to avoid a different perception: that they're on a witch-hunt. At issue is the use of "nonanalytical positives," that is, findings of guilt that don't include failing a drug test. USADA is weighing admissions, documents, witnesses or other evidence of use or possession. "For us, that's the same as having a positive sample," Mr. Scherr says.
