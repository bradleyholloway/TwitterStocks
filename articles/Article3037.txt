 Will Station Villages Get Atlantans on the Train?   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1998  At the center of the current plan is a 47-acre site surrounding Marta's Lindbergh Center station, just south of Atlanta's thriving Buckhead neighborhood. Last Thursday, after extending a deadline three times, the transit system accepted bids from two Atlanta companies to develop the Marta-owned property.  "We feel like there is a demand" for transit-oriented development, says David Allman, president of Regent Partners Inc., one of the bidders. "The convenience will lead people to use it." Marta officials and the two developers declined to elaborate on the proposals.  In 1974, at the time Marta was being developed, Andrew Young, then a congressman and later mayor of Atlanta, called for partnerships between transit agencies and developers. But in Atlanta, the transit system, with 46 miles of track and 36 stations, has had virtually no impact on urban development. Many stations are surrounded by large parking lots and are separated from local shops and offices by four car lanes.
