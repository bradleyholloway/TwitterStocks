 Review / TV: Coming to America   By By Dorothy Rabinowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2003  FOR A CULTURAL RELIC of the '70s still of some interest, look back at one of the more prominent members of the Loud family, star of "An American Family," 1973's 12-hour PBS documentary. Subjects of much journalism, and hot disputes about the then still shocking spectacle of a family allowing 24-hour-a-day filming as they went about their lives and work, of their familial connections or lack thereof, the Louds ultimately returned to obscurity. All but Lance Loud, the son who went on to New York, drugs and the gay scene. He died in December 2001 of hepatitis C and HIV infection, though not before ordering up a wish that his end be filmed. "Lance Loud! A Death in an American Family" airs on PBS Monday at 9 p.m. EST (check local listings). A grim sight, this last, of the once-vibrant Lance, for whom, even in the end, participation in a '70s TV documentary apparently ranked as the central and defining moment of his life.  THE WORST TELEVISION news of the year comes from AMC, the initials that once stood for American Movie Classics. This fall, the once commercial-free network went from ads between films to full-scale butchery by interruption. Along with such classics as are still available there, the lineup is now cluttered with dated stuff from the 1970s and '80s in order, the management has told reporters, to make the network "relevant." That aside, it isn't only the number of ads and promos now cutting into every AMC film (some 10 minutes' worth). It is the grinding idiocy of their babble that's most likely to send viewers fleeing to the infinitely richer precincts of Turner Classic Movies.
