 Bush Revisits School-Voucher Issue With Focus on Tuition Tax Credit   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2002  In an appearance at Milwaukee's Holy Redeemer Institutional Church of God in Christ, Mr. [Bush] lauded a Wisconsin program that helps parents pay private-school tuition with public funds. "Call it whatever you want to call it -- vouchers, choice -- whatever it is. Freedom for parents is what I call it," Mr. Bush said. He delivered a similar message Monday in Ohio, a state that last week won U.S. Supreme Court backing of its school voucher program.  The reason for the shift in emphasis -- from vouchers to tax credits -- is simple: Credits, which give taxpayers a break on their income taxes for money spent on school tuition, come with less political baggage and have a greater chance of being enacted. Even a Supreme Court blessing couldn't erase the bitter battle lines drawn over vouchers in recent years. With the tax-credit approach, Mr. Bush has a chance to deliver on a promise to his conservative base without alienating the moderate suburban voters who he hopes to attract with the "compassionate" conservative message that he is trumpeting during appearances this week.
