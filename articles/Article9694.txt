 Investors Look to Prentiss for Clue to the State of Office Market   By Starkman, Dean, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2004  An early and emphatic office bear since the downturn of 2001, Mr. [Thomas August] has lately turned cautiously optimistic. "There's enough macro data to suggest that things are back on track," he says in an interview. Indeed, Mr. August says, the company has decided: "Let's make some bets."  In May, Prentiss, a Dallas-based office landlord, surprised real- estate pros with a deal to acquire an empty 300,000-square-foot campus in Santa Clara, Calif., the heart of the moribund Silicon Valley, from 3Com Corp., based in Marlborough, Mass.  David Harris, a Lehman Brothers analyst who has a "hold" on [Prentiss], says that even an improving white-collar employment picture won't translate into improving rents and vacancy rates for office owners for months, as companies will first fill up the space they are already renting but don't use.
