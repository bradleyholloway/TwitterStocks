 Damaged Justice   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2001  Mr. [James Riady] lives in Indonesia but has agreed to come to the United States and cooperate with investigators. His influence was sweeping and much of it remains mysterious. In an August 1992 limousine ride with candidate Clinton, Mr. Riady pledged $1 million to him; Mr. Clinton told federal investigators in April, implausibly to say the least, that he had no "specific recollection" of the huge pledge. Government documents in the plea filing show over 80 illegal contributions to various political entities by Mr. Riady's Lippo Bank of California.  A Riady venture in Indonesia now employs Jim Guy Tucker, Mr. Clinton's successor as Governor of Arkansas, convicted in a Whitewater-related fraud case by Independent Counsel Starr. In 1994, Mr. Riady provided a $100,000 consulting payment to Arkansas insider Webster Hubbell, the former Associate Attorney General at [Janet Reno] Justice, then under pressure to cooperate with Mr. [Ken Starr]. Mr. Hubbell did not cooperate and went to prison on fraud charges. What Mr. Tucker, Mr. Riady and Mr. Hubbell share, of course, is potentially damaging information about [Clinton] and Hillary Clinton.
