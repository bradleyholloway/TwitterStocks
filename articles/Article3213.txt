 Barron's Insight: Gold Stocks Look Pricey By Wall Street Yardsticks   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2003  Mr. [Robert Marcin] counters that gold producers ought to be evaluated like businesses that haven't created much value for shareholders over time. Newmont, for instance, trades for 50 times projected 2003 profit of 92 cents a share. Assume gold averages $400 an ounce in 2004. Newmont may earn $1.50 a share. In that scenario, Newmont will have a high 2004 P/E of about 30. If gold rises to $500 an ounce, Newmont's annual earnings power probably is close to $2.50 a share, yet even then its P/E won't be low, at nearly 20 times earnings. Newmont also trades for more than twice its estimated net asset value, which is a calculation based on the discounted value of future profits.
