 In This Film Industry It Really Helps To Be a Blockhead; Young Cineastes Find Lego A Congenial Medium For the Age of YouTube   By LaVallee, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  "Cognizance" is one of hundreds of movies known as "brickfilms" that are getting attention on YouTube and other video-sharing sites. Amateur filmmakers use Lego pieces to create characters and scenes, sometimes spending months painstakingly arranging and rearranging the blocks before the camera. Re-creations of famous moments in "Star Wars" and "Titanic," faithfully rendered in the primary colors of Lego pieces and stitched together from thousands of stop-motion frames, have drawn hundreds of thousands of viewings. Many of the productions are original films with elaborate plotlines, soundtracks and voice- overs.  "I was still in junior high, playing with Legos, and the Internet and I collided," says Robinson Wood, 18, of San Jose, Calif., whose "Frankenstein" and "Grace" are often cited by fans as classic brickfilms. In Mr. Wood's plastic retelling of Mary Shelley's monster tale -- which some viewers have found too violent for a film made from children's toys -- he used red clay to simulate blood, and achieved the sound of breaking glass by dropping a peanut butter jar eight feet onto concrete.  As brickfilmers try to one-up one another with increasingly creative special effects, they find themselves drawing from an unusual list of household items. Artists realized that they could simulate shattered glass by slowly cutting apart plastic wrap, or a clear sheet of sugar. In Lewis Chen's "Repent," one shootout briefly goes into "bullet time," a slow-motion effect made popular in the movie "The Matrix," in which a character floats through the air while dodging enemy fire. The 21-year-old Arcadia, Calif., college student says his 15-minute film took him six months to make.
