 Catalog Critic: `Om' Remedies   By By Lauren Lipton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 13, 2001  That doesn't mean you don't need gear. Most of the kits we ordered included items we recognized from past classes: a rubbery "sticky mat," one or two brick-sized foam blocks and a strap about six feet long. The mat provides cushioning and traction. The blocks and straps help -- beginners, especially -- with tough stretches. If you are unable to sit, extend your legs and touch your toes, you can loop the strap around your feet. Or if you can't quite stand and touch your hands to the floor, you can touch the blocks instead.  In four of the kits we ordered, the props were almost identical. Actually, two kits were identical. Though the Isabella catalog describes its yoga prop set as "created especially for [us]," we got the same thing from another company, Living Arts. (Turns out Living Arts actually manufactures it.) An Isabella spokeswoman said it was an unintentional mixup and apologized profusely.  The main difference in these four sets was the number of blocks. The kits from Collage Home Video and Yoga Zone had one; Living Arts/Isabella had two, which Ms. [Mary Dunn] feels is better -- one for each hand or foot. We also didn't care for the Yoga Zone sticky mat; at 1/16 of an inch, it was half as thick as the others and therefore less cushy. We understand from Ms. Dunn, however, that everybody has different mat preferences, so our choice here is a subjective one.
