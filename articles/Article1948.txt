 Shoreham and Seabrook Nuclear Plants May Clear Hurdles to Licensing Soon   By By Bill Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1988  The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission is scheduled to vote today on certain key issues that have long been blocking the licensing of Long Island Lighting Co.'s Shoreham plant and Public Service Co. of New Hampshire's Seabrook facility. Separately, the commissioners may also vote on whether to permit the restart of another troubled facility, Boston Edison Co.'s Pilgrim plant.  To be sure, the NRC doesn't always keep to its schedule. Moreover, some Wall Street analysts think whatever happens today, Shoreham won't get a full-power license for several months, while Seabrook's licensing fate could take even longer to resolve.  Still, utility-bond analyst Daniel Scotto of L.F. Rothschild & Co. said yesterday that the NRC vote on Shoreham could move that plant "significantly closer to an operating license." The plant currently is operating at 5% of capacity.
