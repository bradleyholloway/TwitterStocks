 Google in Talks To Buy YouTube For $1.6 Billion; Deal Could Put Search Giant In Top Spot for Online Video; A Front Door for Web Visits   By Delaney, Kevin J, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  A purchase by Google, Mountain View, Calif., would also bring YouTube into a company that doesn't compete with other media concerns by producing or broadcasting its own video. That likely would make it easier for YouTube to continuing cutting deals with media and entertainment companies to carry their videos. General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal signed an advertising and content deal with YouTube in June, and Warner Music Group Corp. last month said it is working with YouTube to make its music videos and other content available through the site.  Doug Morris, chief executive officer of Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, last month told investors that YouTube violates copyright laws by allowing users to post music videos and other content. He said YouTube and MySpace "owe us tens of millions of dollars." People familiar with the matter say Universal, the world's largest recorded- music company, and YouTube have been in discussions about a possible agreement that would head off any Universal legal action against YouTube.  Founded in February 2005, YouTube is the poster child for the boom under way in online video. By the time of the Web site's official public release in December 2005, consumers were viewing YouTube videos more than three million times daily. That month, someone posted to YouTube a skit from NBC's "Saturday Night Live" dubbed "Lazy Sunday," featuring two grown men rapping about cupcakes, red licorice candy and the movie "The Chronicles of Narnia." Consumers viewed "Lazy Sunday" six million times before NBC on Feb. 3 contacted YouTube to request that it be removed, along with hundreds of other clips.
