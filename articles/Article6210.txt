Lockheed Martin's bid to buy Comsat faces new problems, as Comsat debates whether to renegotiate terms or even reconsider the deal in the wake of Lockheed's faltering stock price.

France's Aerospatiale and Lockheed are in talks to develop militarysurveillance and refueling aircraft, officials familiar with the talks said.
