 The Outlook -- Baker's Gold Gambit: Step to Stability?   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1987  Treasury Secretary James Baker took the latest step to improve coordination earlier this month; he proposed that the Group of Seven countries partly base their policy planning on a new indicator showing the relationship between major currencies and a "basket" of representative commodities, including gold.  By mentioning "gold," Mr. Baker sent tremors through economic circles, reviving talk of a return to the Bretton Woods system, under which exchange rates were rigidly linked to gold. But Mr. Baker wasn't proposing a gold standard. Instead, he wants to strengthen the so-called "indicator" system for policy coordination that has supported this year's international efforts to reassert control over exchange rates.  Since the February Louvre accord, the major industrial countries have succeeded in running the first managed exchange rate system since the Bretton Woods system gave way to free-floating rates in the early 1970s. Convinced that market volatility has unduly hampered government policy-making, the Group of Seven countries -- the U.S., Canada, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and West Germany -- have managed to keep the dollar within a secret target range, probably extending from roughly 135 yen to 155.
