When Alberto Salazar talks numbers, New Yorkers now listen. And Salazar is talking again, this time about tomorrow night's 5,000-meter run in the Wanamaker Milrose Games at Madison Square Garden.  "The American record is going to go, for sure," Salazar said recently from Eugene, Ore. "The winning time definitely will be 13:25 or lower; I think I can run 13:25, at least." The American record is 13 minutes 40.6 seconds.  Last October when he arrived for the New York City Marathon, Salazar, a 22-year-old University of Oregon senior, stunned veteran road racers by saying, "If someone runs 2:10, I'll run 2:10." Salazar won New York's five-borough race in 2:09:41 -- the fastest first marathon ever -- and became an instant toast of the town.  At Monday's weekly meeting of the Track Writers Association, area coaches were divided between Salazar and Suleiman Nyambui of Tanzania, the Olympic silver medalist at 5,000 meters in Moscow.  "I don't see anybody beating Nyambui if he sets his mind to it --indoors or outdoors," said Russ Rogers of Fairleigh Dickinson University, who watched Nyambui win the two-mile run in Dallas Saturday night in 8:26.33.  "Salazar owns New York," countered Bill Hodge of Wagner. "With that New York crowd behind him, he's got a legitimate shot."  I don't know if Salazar's going to win the race," said Howard Schmertz, the Millrose meet director, "but he's going to create the excitement."  That Salazar is talking fast times and records is an indication of confidence, not cockiness. He won an indoor two-mile last Saturday night in Portland in 8:33.5, slower than he had hoped, he said, because of an old track and no competition.  The Garden's fast year-old track and the presence of Nyambui, Craig Virgin, Matt Centrowitz, Solomon Chebor and Sydney Maree among others in a 14-man field should be more than enough incentive. Salazar has never run in the Garden, but he does not intend to sit back and let others dictate terms.  "I'd like to be in the low 8:30's for the first two miles," he said of a front-running pace that could challenge the world indoor mark of 13:20.8 held by Emiel Puttemans of Belgium. "By two miles, or maybe even a mile, I think the field's going to be spread out to four guys. It's not going to go by in 8:40. It's going to go much faster." 'Training Smarter'  Salazar has run only a few races since the marathon in New York. But he says his training for the last six months has consistently gone well, the result of a revised attitude toward running that has minimized recurring leg injuries.  "What I learned is that I was training too hard, that I was tired all the time," he said. "I'm training smarter. I'm not going out and trying to kill myself every time. I used to think I had to be in top shape to beat people.  "It's a fine line between training at your maximum, the optimum, and overtraining. For me, I can run 120 miles a week. If I run 130, I feel too tired and start breaking down. The extra two or three miles a day doesn't seem like much. But if you add it up, those two or three miles count. So instead of 20 a day, I run 16 or 17 now. I feel better and I run better." Marathon May Be His Best  Although Salazar is familiar to track and field fans as a 10,000-meter United States Olympian, his New York victory thrust him onto the cover of almost every running magazine. A marketing major, he will join the Nike Shoe Company after graduation.  His success in the marathon affirmed what he said he had felt: the 26.2-mile distance may be his best. With a final season of outdoor collegiate eligibility, he would like to improve at the 5,000 and 10,000, although Nyambui, who attends Texas-El Paso, remains a formidable rival, and Henry Rono, the redoubtable Kenyan, has reportedly re-enrolled at Washington State.  "It's been a couple of years since I ran against Nyambui," Salazar said. "He's always had the upper hand in the past, but things have changed. I don't think he's going to be able to run away as comfortably as he used to. He's going to have to stay with me now. He's going to have to run on my terms." Maree Eligible for Millrose Sydney Maree, a black South African and Villanova senior, was ruled eligible yesterday to run in the 5,000 meters at the Millrose Games tomorrow night in Madison Squre Garden. But Matthews Mothshwarateu, a black South African who attends Texas-El Paso, was not.  The International Amateur Athletic Federation had ruled all South Africans ineligible for international competition because of their nation's restrictive racial policies. The only exception was that those who attended American colleges could compete in so-called domestic meets. The Millrose is considered international because it includes athletes representing the Soviet Union, Hungary, Italy and Tanzania.  American officials asked Adriaan Paulen of the Netherlands, head of the federation to allow Maree to compete in the Millrose because he is a resident alein who married an American woman last December.  Paulen agreed, but he ruled against Mothshwarateu.
