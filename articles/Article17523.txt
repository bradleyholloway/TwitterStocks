 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Rights of Nigerians   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1985  The smoke hasn't yet cleared from the coup in Nigeria. Last week, a little-known brigadier announced in a broadcast from Lagos that power had been taken from Gen. Mohammed Buhari, who had himself seized power in the Dec. 31, 1983, coup that toppled the freely elected government of Shehu Shagari. On Tuesday, the coup makers installed the army chief of staff, General Babangida, as Nigeria's new strongman.  Nigeria is a big deal; it has 100 million people, or one in five Africans, and the prospect for democracy there was one of the great hopes in the Third World. In August 1983, 20 million Nigerians walked, rode animals or drove to the polls and ended military rule by electing Mr. Shagari president by a 12 million to 8 million spread. Less than a half-year later, Maj. Gen. Buhari and a clique of cohorts swiped the power and stuck President Shagari in jail, pending a trial that to this day hasn't occurred.
