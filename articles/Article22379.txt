 Senators Agree to Lift Highway Outlays By $26 Billion During the Next Six Years   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1998  Senators reached a bipartisan deal to boost highway spending by $26 billion in the next six years, clearing a major roadblock holding up Senate passage of the massive election year construction bill.  The deal, negotiated with the blessing of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, would divert funds raised by a 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax from deficit reduction to highway-construction needs.  The plan raises to $173 billion the amount committed to highway and safety programs under the bill now pending in the Senate. "I have always felt that we had a strong moral responsibility to adhere to balanced budgets and prudent spending, and I believe this agreement keeps us in line," said Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
