 How's Your Kid Doing in School? Check Online   By By Robert Tomsho, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2002  As soon as Mr. Threadgill gets to the insurance brokerage where he is a manager, he logs on to a Web site launched last fall by the 19,000-student Forsyth County School District, about 50 miles north of Atlanta. Along with a tally of course grades, it provides updates about whether his kids have turned in homework or skipped class. Failing grades and discipline problems trigger e-mail alerts. "It's probably the best tool that they've ever come up with," says Mr. Threadgill, who brings home highlighted printouts to discuss with his children over dinner.  Offering parents online access to everything from daily quiz grades to class-project due dates, Forsyth County is part of a movement that could fundamentally change the relationship between families and schools. Despite concerns from some about student privacy and data security -- not to mention clever student hackers -- hundreds of schools nationwide are launching similar tracking programs, many marketed by Apple Computer Inc. or the education unit of London's Pearson PLC. The idea is that such tracking systems make parents more involved in their child's academic life and thereby boost student achievement.  Still, anecdotal evidence suggests the tracking programs may help. Sophomore Amanda Threadgill, 15 years old, is earning passing grades in world literature and world history, subjects she was failing early in the school year. Her grades in dramatic arts have jumped into the 90s, from the mid-70s. "I actually do study now," she says, adding that the scrutiny taught her something else: "My parents obviously care."
