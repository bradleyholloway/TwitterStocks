 Insurance Firms Aim to Force Citicorp Out of Municipal Bond Insurance Area   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1989  FGIC Corp., a GE Capital Corp. subsidiary, this week is expected to ask the Federal Reserve Board to rule on whether Citicorp is properly applying the new risk-based capital guidelines for banks to American Municipal Bond Assurance Corp.  Ambac is a municipal bond insurance company that operates as a unit of Citicorp's Citibank unit. GE Capital is a financial-services unit of General Electric Co.  FGIC, the parent of Financial Guaranty Insurance Corp., complains that Citicorp is exploiting a loophole in bank regulation that enables it to, in effect, double-count $564 million of capital in its unit for banking purposes. The result, FGIC argues, is that the unit has been able to cut prices and gain market share at the expense of FGIC and other municipal bond insurers that aren't owned by banks.
