 U.S. Proposes Lifting Cap On Iraqi Oil   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1999  Under the oil-for-food program, which is closely supervised by the U.N., Iraq may sell as much as $5.25 billion of oil in a six-month period to buy food, medicine and to make certain other payments. The money is placed in a U.N. escrow account to prevent Baghdad from using the funds for other purposes, including buying weapons. The U.S. proposal, which must be approved by the U.N. Security Council, calls for eliminating the ceiling and streamlining the process by which Iraqi procurement contracts are approved.  Although the U.S., in announcing the program, stressed its concern for Iraq's people, the proposal also reflects the changed reality since the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq last month. Since then, France has led a move to replace both the U.S.-backed economic sanctions and the U.N. weapons monitors with a new system that, it said, might win more cooperation from Iraq. In addition, the U.N. weapons monitoring has been undercut by disclosures that Washington used some intelligence it gathered for the weapons inspectors to spy on the Iraqi regime.
