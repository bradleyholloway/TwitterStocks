 Issue of Health Benefits for Uninsured Catches Attention in the States if Not on Capitol Hill   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1987  In Massachusetts, Gov. Dukakis last month proposed a bill that would force employers to provide -- and partly pay for -- health insurance for nearly all employees. A new state agency would cover the unemployed and anyone else without insurance. "It's high time that at least one state in the nation does now what someday all will do," he told a legislative committee. At first, most of the relevant interest groups, except the hospitals and small business lobbyists, applauded. But in a telling illustration of the complexity of the problem and the cost of solving it, the coalition quickly fell apart. This week, the state House of Representatives voted 146-1 to send the bill back to committee, where it's likely to stay for a while.  Today, most American workers and their families get health insurance through employers. The elderly get basic coverage from the federal Medicare program. And the very poor get theirs from a joint federal-state program called Medicaid.  An estimated 70% of the uninsured are workers, or dependents of workers, whose employers don't offer any health insurance. Consquently, most legislation aims at those companies. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D., Mass.) wants Congress to require all employers to offer basic health insurance, but health-care lobbyists in Washington say the chances of passage appear slim.
