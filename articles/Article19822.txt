 Flu Vaccine Goes Further With a Shallower Shot; Technique Could Improve Protection, Stretch Supply; Further Testing Is Needed   By McKay, Betsy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  Two studies published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine conclude that small amounts of flu vaccine injected into the skin of healthy young and middle-aged adults offered similar protection to a full dose injected into muscle, the traditional way of administering vaccines. Less flu vaccine was needed for the injections into skin because the body's defenses are mobilized more efficiently through skin than muscle tissue, the researchers said.  A study of adults between ages 18 and 40 conducted by Iomai researchers found that as little as one-fifth of a current standard dose of flu vaccine provided at least as much protection as a regular flu shot for those in that age group. A separate study led by researchers at St. Louis University's Center for Vaccine Development concluded that 40% of a normal dose in adults between 18 years old and 60 years old elicited a strong immune response, but the lower-dose vaccination didn't provide similar protection in adults older than 60.
