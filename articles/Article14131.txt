 U.S. Auto Sales Fell 5.2% in Late May; Imports From Japan Gained in Month   By By Dale D. Buss, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1985  Domestic car makers sold 320,588 units in the last 10 days of the month, down from 338,236 units a year earlier. That amounts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.4 million units, using a Commerce Department formula. Sales in the latest period compare with an unusually strong annual rate of 8.9 million units for mid-May and an annual rate of 7.8 million units at the beginning of the month. In 1984, 7.9 million domestically made cars were sold in the U.S.  For all of May, the seven companies that make cars in the U.S. reported sales of 807,590 units, up 0.5% from year-earlier sales of 803,273 units. As with late May sales, the annual rate was 8.4 million units, down slightly from April's rate of 8.7 million units and roughly even with the overall sales pace for 1985 so far.  Import sales jumped significantly in May, to an estimated 263,787 units from a year-earlier total of 239,951 units, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of importers. Seasonally adjusted, imports sold at an annual rate of about 2.8 million units, up substantially from April's 2.4 million units and from March's 2.2 million units.
