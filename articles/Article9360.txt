 Letco Trading Could Be Setting a Precedent By Cutting Back Payment-for-Orders Program   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2001  "Due to the current trading environment, we believe the current level of payment-for-order flow is unsustainable and must be reduced," said Edward Boyle, a Letco managing director. Letco officials wouldn't discuss the extent of the cutbacks since these could change month to month at the firm's evaluation.  The bold move will be closely watched and is significant on many levels: By breaking away from its peers, many of which are paying for orders on their own even after exchanges withdrew their support, Letco could set a precedent among the firms, some of which are already toying quietly with the idea. By taking a stand -- basically declaring that depth and liquidity ought to be enough on their own -- the firm could incur the wrath and retaliation of brokerage firms, on which Letco still depends for customer orders.
