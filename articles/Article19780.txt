 Barron's Insight: Heinz Looks Appetizing   By Willoughby, Jack, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 4, 2004  One big plus for Heinz: 60% of revenue comes from outside the U.S., with 15% from booming China alone. Heinz could do very well if the economic recovery already evident in the U.S. spreads abroad and China doesn't rein in its own economy too severely.  Even if Heinz drops the ball, shareholders might not have anything to complain about, because that could make the ketchup maker a takeover target for a company such as Switzerland's Nestle or the Anglo-Dutch Unilever conglomerate. So, one way or another, Heinz looks appetizing to some investors.
