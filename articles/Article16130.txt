 Tyco Worries Send Stock Prices Lower Again --- Dow Industrials Fall 220 Points; U.S. Bonds Rally   By By Kate Kelly and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2002  Word of Tyco's $8 billion in unreported purchases set a gloomy tone for the day, brokers and traders said. As a result, Tyco shares fell $6.97, or nearly 19%, closing at $29.90. Stocks like General Electric and Williams Cos., both of which have faced questions about their accounting techniques, also were affected, dropping 5% and 14%, respectively.  In addition to fears about Tyco's unannounced acquisitions, bond traders voiced worries about news that the conglomerate will begin using banks instead of the commercial-paper market, a potential sign that Tyco is having problems tapping the key short-term financing market.  "We're just seeing kind of a morose Monday," said Hedi Reynolds, head of Nasdaq trading at Morgan Keegan & Co. "I think a lot of people were concerned about accounting issues before" problems at Enron and Tyco came to light, she said. But in general, with "all of the charges, and the pro forma and real earnings," she added, "it's very confusing what companies really earn."
