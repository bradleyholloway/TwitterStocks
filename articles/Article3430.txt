 Increasing Share Of U.S. Uninsured Are Immigrants   By Goldfarb, Zachary A, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  While the institute's study didn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, Paul Fronstin, the study's author and the director of the health-research programs at the institute, said what was most significant was how quickly immigrants are becoming a larger segment of the uninsured. "The immigrant population accounted for 86% of the growth in the uninsured between 1998 and 2003," he says. "That's up significantly from how much it accounted for from 1994 to 1998, when immigration accounted for about a third."
