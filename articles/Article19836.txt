 Franklin Grasso   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2005  Assorted moralists are denouncing Mr. [Franklin Raines] and the Fannie board for allowing him to "retire" next June, rather than being formally fired, thus easing him onto the golf course with a minimum of $19 million in severance pay, plus an annual lifetime salary of $1.4 million or so. And that doesn't count his claim on another $40 million or more in potential stock payouts. "I'm disappointed; this is not appropriate," laments Barney Frank, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. Liberal editorial boards are appalled at these "outrageous fortunes," and Fannie's regulator is now reviewing them with an eye toward revoking them.  Come to think of it, Mr. Frank and other Fannie enablers on Capitol Hill aren't any different from the New York Stock Exchange directors who voted to pay Dick Grasso his millions as CEO but then sacked him when the news became embarrassingly public. Focusing on Mr. Raines's severance has the political benefit of diverting attention from the Members' own role in creating the rigged system that most of them profit from, one way or another. We suspect that they aren't angry because Mr. Raines got rich; they're mad because he got caught.
