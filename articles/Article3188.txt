 Letters to the Editor: Beyond Sewage in Maine   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1999  The prison issue in Thomaston/Warren, Maine, is about more than who wants sewage ("Seeking Effluents: Two Maine Towns Fight for More Sewage," March 31). There are serious issues about the quality of the St. George River and even about the need for more prison beds.  There is also some resentment about the fact that the decision to move/expand the prison beds was made without consulting the people. Our local Maine state representative, Jim Skoglund, plans to put a bill in the Maine legislature to stop the Warren prison. You did not mention this in your article. Most residents of the Thomaston and St. George area are hoping he is successful.
