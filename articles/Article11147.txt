 Lockheed to Tap Ex-Pentagon Official For War Technology Unit, Sources Say   By By Eileen White Read, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1988  Lockheed Corp. is expected to announce next week the creation of a new division, headed by former Pentagon official Donald C. Latham, to develop ways to apply its space-systems technology to conventional warfare.  The industry executives described the unit as the brainchild of Daniel M. Tellep, who was chosen earlier this week to become chairman and chief executive officer of Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed next year. Lockheed's missiles and space-systems group, which Mr. Tellep headed, is the nation's largest Star Wars contractor, and is the prime contractor on a multi-billion dollar military satellite program.  Analysts said the hiring of Mr. Latham was a coup for Lockheed, whose electronics operations, including the recently acquired Sanders Associates Inc., haven't performed as well as expected. Mr. Latham, regarded in the aerospace industry as smart, aggressive and well-connected, resigned his post as vice president of a Falls Church, Va., division of Computer Sciences Corp. last month.
