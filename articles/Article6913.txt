 Buffett Didn't Get Deal Details; Berkshire Chief Tells Investigators He Knew Little About AIG Pact; Greenberg Plans to Take the Fifth   By Susan Pulliam, Ian McDonald and Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2005  Yesterday, Mr. Greenberg's lawyers said he will appear today at Mr. [Eliot Spitzer]'s offices for a deposition in the case and will choose not to answer questions by invoking his constitutional right against possible self-incrimination. Regulators are examining whether AIG and Mr. [Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg] improperly accounted for transactions to burnish its financial health. AIG recently admitted to a broad range of improper accounting, including the transaction with General Re, that could cut its net worth by $1.77 billion.  Regulators also asked Mr. [WARREN BUFFETT] about a 25-minute phone call he had with Mr. [Ronald Ferguson] in early November 2000, the people say. In the call, Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Buffett talked briefly about the AIG transaction, a person familiar with the matter says.  Exactly what was said during that phone call is now a matter of dispute between Mr. Buffett and Mr. Ferguson, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Buffett told investigators yesterday that he wasn't told about the details of the transaction, noting that he recalls speaking with Mr. Ferguson during the call mostly about Mr. Greenberg's apparent desire to boost reserves and Mr. Greenberg's frustration with Wall Street's criticism of AIG's reserve levels, the people say. Neither Mr. Ferguson nor his attorney returned calls seeking comment.
