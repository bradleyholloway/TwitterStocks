 Mom the Murderer   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1998  The facts are indisputable. One morning in June of 1992, Ms. Pixley of Washington, D.C., became annoyed with her wailing third child, six-week-old Nakya Dannyel Scott, and tossed her in the trash after smothering her with a blanket. She spent the rest of the day cooking and going out late for some barbecue with her then boyfriend. He learned of the murder the next morning and called the police.
