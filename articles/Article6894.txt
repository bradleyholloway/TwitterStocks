 Rolls-Royce Net Profit Soars 76%   By Daniel Michaels and Rod Stone, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2005  Rolls-Royce's net profit for 2004 rose to GBP 204 million ($379.2 million) from GBP 116 million in 2003, with sales, excluding joint ventures, rising 5.2% to GBP 5.94 billion. Profit was at the upper end of analysts' forecasts.  Rolls-Royce was boosted by strong sales of Airbus jetliners, where its engines dominate, and by a key win over GE in Japan. All Nippon Airways, long a GE customer, chose Rolls-Royce engines to power the 50 Boeing Co. 787 jetliners it ordered. ANA's order was the first engine selection by an airline for the planned 787.  Asia is a particular strong point across all of Rolls-Royce's products in aircraft engines, power-generation turbines and marine propulsion, and now represents 25% of the company's order book, he said. "For us, Asia represents an opportunity, not a threat," Sir [John Rose] said.
