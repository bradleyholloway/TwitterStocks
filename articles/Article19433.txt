 China's Scare Tactics   By By Claudia Rosett, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2001  Ms. Gao, in an interview on Wednesday at her home in McLean, Va., described similar scenes from her nearly six months in detention. "They wanted to use me for information on people here in the U.S.A.," she says. "They were asking me to identify names who might have worked for Taiwan or the FBI. They said, `You've got to tell us, otherwise you are risking the rest of your life.'" Ms. Gao says she refused to give names. The result was that "they brought me names to identify. I would tell them, yes, I know these people, but they are by no means spies."  Here's how it played out for Mr. Li, who told me of his journey through China's state security procedures, starting on the evening of Feb. 25, when he arrived at the Hong Kong border crossing for a routine overnight trip into China. As usual, Mr. Li handed his U.S. passport to a Chinese immigration official, who punched in his information, then told him to wait. Three hours later, a group of state security agents showed up and took him by van to a small hotel, where they told him they were detaining him. "I said, for what?" recounts Mr. Li. They said they did not know.  Ms. Gao describes a similar ordeal. Last winter, she went with her husband and five-year-old son to visit relatives in China. On Feb. 11, as they were about to fly home from Beijing airport, they were surrounded by state security agents and hustled off in three separate directions. Her husband, then a U.S. resident, and her little son, a U.S. citizen, were held incommunicado for 26 days, then deported.
