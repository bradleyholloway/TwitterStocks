 FEC Set Back in Christian Coalition Suit   By By David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1999  U.S. District Judge Joyce Green ruled that group's practice of distributing pro-GOP voter guides while keeping Republican campaigns informed of its tactics didn't violate federal election laws. The decision is a setback for the Federal Election Commission, which had charged the coalition, a nonprofit corporation started by television evangelist Pat Robertson and political consultant Ralph Reed in 1989, with several election-law violations since 1992.
