 The Economy; BUSINESS: High-Tech Titans Unite on Lifting Visa Caps   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  "The U.S. has succeeded because the right people have come from all over the world to be here," says Mr. [BILL GATES], the chairman of Microsoft Corp.

"A greater influx of talent definitely changes the balance of power here in the U.S."  "Most of these guys don't end up in jail," Mr. McNealy says, warming to his argument. "They don't end up on entitlements. They tend to pay taxes. They keep their yards nice and clean. They drive Priuses. They recycle."
