 Cleaning Up Wall Street: Morgan Stanley Goes to Washington --- Firm Quietly Seeks to Fend Off States Regulating the Industry; Spitzer Criticizes the Move   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  In Morgan Stanley's case, the concerns aren't damning e-mails. Instead, they are performance reviews, including evaluations of Morgan Stanley analysts, such as onetime Internet-stock star Mary Meeker. Top Morgan Stanley officials worry that by releasing these evaluations, Mr. [Eliot Spitzer] could gain a public-relations victory and force the firm into a Merrill-like settlement.  Morgan Stanley is now grudgingly handing over these records as part of a broad document request by Mr. Spitzer's office, but officials at the firm are worried because at Morgan Stanley, executives are evaluated not just by their supervisors, but also by their peers, a process known as "360-degree evaluations."  Under this system, Ms. Meeker would be evaluated by some investment bankers, whom she worked with to help generate deals for the firm. Executives at the firm worry that these evaluations -- which are designed to remain confidential -- could show that there was a close tie between banking and research, supporting Mr. Spitzer's contention that firms like Morgan Stanley provided overly optimistic research on companies that were investment-banking clients of the firm. Executives also worry that Ms. Meeker may have trumpeted her role in helping the firm generate investment-banking fees in her self-evaluations, much like Merrill officials did in e-mails that Mr. Spitzer made public to great fanfare.
