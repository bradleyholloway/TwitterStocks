To the Editor:  In his letter to the editor on Dec. 7 regarding E-COM, our new service for computer-generated mail, Robert E. Melling assumes the Postal Service is competing with private industry and getting into the telecommunications business. That is not the case.  v. e are not going into the telecommunications business, today, tomorrow or ever. Rather, with E-COM, we are marrying the speed and efficiency of private telecommunications carriers with our own unparalleled delivery system. Traditionally, we have adapted each new transportation technology to moving the mail - from stagecoach, to train, to motor vehicles, to planes. E-COM is just another step in this evolution.  With E-COM we are utilizing private telecommunications systems to ''transport'' computer-generated mail to 25 specially equipped post offices around the country. There, E-COM messages will be automatically printed, enveloped and placed in the regular mail system, getting two-day delivery anywhere in the continental United States.  I agree with Mr. Melling that ''the Postal Service should exert its maximum efforts on handling mail.'' E-COM is an example of how we are doing it. WILLIAM F.
