 IN THE LEAD: Doing More With Less, Avoiding Shoddy Work And Burned-Out Staff   By By Carol Hymowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2003  Debbie DeGabrielle, vice president of corporate marketing at WRQ, a Seattle integration-software company, faced that challenge last year. Her 50-person staff was cut to 22 at the same time she was asked to expand the company's brand. Among other critical employees, Ms. DeGabrielle lost her director of brand strategy and creative director.  TO HELP MANAGERS do more work with less staff, Mr. [John Seiple]'s staff streamlined work processes such as the company's accounts-payable system. He discourages multitasking as nonproductive. He insists cellphones and BlackBerrys are turned off during meetings. "It's so we can all focus and get through our agenda in 15 or 30 minutes instead of an hour," he says.  Staying focused in the moment requires discipline and some tricks. Whenever someone comes into his office to chat, Mr. Seiple moves to another chair. "That way I'm reminding myself that I'm starting a new conversation," he says.
