WASHINGTON, May 16â€” President Reagan accepted gifts last year that included a pistol, a chain saw, two riding crops, four hearing aids and a black sheep dog named Lucky valued at $400, according to a financial disclosure form released today.  The White House released the form, which included a list of gifts worth more than $100 that the President or his wife, Nancy, accepted from individuals.  Other gifts to the President were turned over to the Government.  The total value of the 15 gifts the Reagans kept was $7,156.  Mr. Reagan received four hearing aids, two each from Burton Associates of Santa Ana, Calif., and Starkey Labs Inc., of Minneapolis, worth a total of $3,000.  He also received a pistol engraved with his signature from Leopold Deters of Springfield, Mass, and a chain saw and accessories valued at $238 from the Secret Service.  Lucky, the 6-month old sheep dog, was given to the Reagans by Kristen Ellis, the March of Dimes poster child.  Mrs. Reagan received a $200 wool sweater knit for her by Loretta Pogson of Farmington, Conn., and six movie videocassettes valued at $210 from Frank Rothman of Culver City, Calif.  The first couple also got two riding crops valued at $130 from Eduardo Sanchez Junco of Madrid, Spain.  Vice President Bush listed 41 gifts valued at $8,500 on his disclosure form.
