 Southwestern Bell Offers Regulators In Texas a Swap   By By Randolph B. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1989  Southwestern Bell Corp. proposed to freeze basic telephone service rates in Texas for five years and to upgrade its network in exchange for being allowed to earn a higher rate of return and keep half of any excess profits.  The move appears to be a response to allegations by the commission's staff that Southwestern Bell is earning at least $90 million a year more than its 12% allowed rate of return. An investigation of those charges is under way. The company contends that its excess earnings amount to only $21 million.
