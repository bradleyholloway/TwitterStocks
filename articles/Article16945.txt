 U.S. News: Justices Appear Split Over Impact of TV Vulgarity   By Bravin, Jess, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2008  Solicitor General Gregory Garre warned the justices that the broadcasters who challenged the 2004 rule want the right "to use expletives, whether in an isolated or repeated basis, 24 hours a day, going from the extreme example of Big Bird dropping the F-bomb on 'Sesame Street,' to the example of using that word during 'Jeopardy' or opening the episode of 'American Idol.'" None of those programs has yet been accused of violating decency standards.
