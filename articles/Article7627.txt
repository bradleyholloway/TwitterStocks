 UAL to Review Pilot Union Bid For United Air   By By John Koten and Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1987  UAL Inc. said it would seriously review a pilots union proposal to acquire its United Airlines unit, but it also expressed reservations about whether the plan made good business sense.  In a statement, Chicago-based UAL said the proposed $4.5 billion buyout would handicap a separately owned United by saddling it with enormous debt. It also asserted that United would have fewer competitive advantages without its current association with UAL's rental car and hotel units.  The UAL reaction was expected by industry analysts, several of whom noted that the company couldn't flatly reject the union's proposal without risking shareholder lawsuits. Few said they expect UAL to eventually accept the bid, made by the United branch of the Washington, D.C.-based Air Line Pilots Association.
