 Phoenix Sweetens Investment-Unit Bid   By By Ken Brown, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2000  The parent company had offered $12.50 a share for 41% of Phoenix Investment Partners back in July, but that price was well below the going rate for asset-manager concerns and angered outside shareholders. Phoenix Investment Partners shares quickly surged past the offering price and never fell back, a sign investors were confident a higher bid was forthcoming.  Phoenix Investment Partners, which manages mostly institutional money as well as running about 40 mutual funds, hasn't done particularly well until recently in attracting new business. The firm was created through a series of money-manager acquisitions, including Roger Engemann & Associates Inc. and Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC. The firm has done better attracting new customers in the fast-growing business of separately managed accounts for wealthy individual investors.
