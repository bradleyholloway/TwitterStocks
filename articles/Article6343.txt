 Where's the Beef? Wherever Texas Shows Its Stuff   By By Brad Reagan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  A Texas contingent traveled to Poland in March, and now 10 Polish chefs will come here, as early as October, as part of the state's Go Texan promotional campaign. Under the two-year-old program, which doled out 19 grants totaling more than $436,000 this year, the state matches funds with a company or industry association that promotes Texas products. The state's share of this year's promotional effort is $61,500.  The state and the beef council are also sponsoring 10 Texas Beef Festivals in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia that feature Texas chefs preparing Texas dishes. To help create atmosphere, the council sends along decorative props including hay bales, bandanas and sheriff's badges.
