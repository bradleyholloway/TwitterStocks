 Earnings Disappointments Punish Major Stock Indexes   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 2004  The corporate disappointments came from companies including Yahoo, Alcoa, Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Siebel Systems. The news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes Alcoa and Wal-Mart, down 68.73 points, or 0.67%, to 10171.56. That marked the fourth decline in the quarter's first five trading days and left the blue chips down 2.7% this year.  Yahoo and Alcoa released quarterly earnings late Wednesday that, despite strong gains, fell short of investor hopes. Yesterday, Wal- Mart and Target announced disappointing June sales.
