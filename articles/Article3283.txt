 By the Numbers: Super Bowl Bound?   By By Allen Barra & George Ignatin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2000  Don't ask us how the Tennessee Titans and Tampa Bay Buccaneers did it. We saw the games on Saturday and Sunday, we watched the replays, and we still can't figure it out. Now the Titans and the Bucs are headed to this weekend's American and National conference title games, against the Jacksonville Jaguars and the St. Louis Rams, respectively. We'll give you our picks for who's going to win those games to go to the Super Bowl -- but first we'd like to figure out how the Titans and Bucs even got this far.  Well, actually, Tampa Bay isn't so much a mystery: After a soft schedule in their division, the Bucs won the home-field advantage against a not particularly formidable Washington Redskins team last Saturday. Tampa Bay tackle Warren Sapp, who seems to average about one big defensive play a game, set up a cheap touchdown by forcing a fumble, and the Bucs went on to win 14-13. Thus, a team that had outscored its opponents by a grand total of 35 points over a 16-game season, a team that didn't face the league's three best teams all season, suddenly finds itself just one victory from the Super Bowl. That is just sheer dumb luck -- dumb luck backed by persistence and a refusal to acknowledge one's limitations.  But it's Tennessee that's really hard to figure. The Titans allowed more points -- 324 in 16 games -- than Tampa Bay scored. (In fact, 54 more than the 270 points Tampa Bay scored.) They outscored their 16 regular-season opponents by just 68 points, which ought to be good for 9-7 or maybe 10-6 but not 13-3. Yet, they stuffed the Indianapolis Colts' Peyton Manning, maybe the AFC's best passer, on his home field Sunday, winning 19-16. And the road is where the Titans sustained all three of their defeats this year. Figure that out.
