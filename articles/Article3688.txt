 Facing Israeli, Arab Obstacles --- How a Palestinian Stone Maker Handles Crackdowns and Boycotts   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 20, 2003  Still, [Nassar] has not been spared the violence. Last year, during Operation Defensive Shield -- Israel's response to a wave of terrorist attacks -- Mr. [Hulileh] says troops occupied Nassar's stone-cutting complex in Bethlehem and used it as a base to interrogate suspected militants from a nearby Palestinian refugee camp, forcing the company to suspend operations for 48 days. In 2001, he says Israeli tanks shelled the factory, destroying $700,000 of cranes, fork lifts and other machinery. A spokesman for the Israeli army said it does not attack private homes or businesses unless militants are firing from them.  Israeli control of Palestinian borders with Jordan and Egypt also makes it harder for Palestinian firms to trade directly with third countries. Lebanon and Syria, meanwhile, boycott all Palestinian products, including Nassar stone, and other Arab countries worry about Israeli content in anything coming from the West Bank and Gaza. In 2001, a shipment from Nassar sat on the Saudi Arabian border for five days while customs officials checked it over for Israeli content.  Despite the obstacles, Nassar has continued to prosper by its wits. To protect itself from supply problems caused by Israeli checkpoints, it built up a three-year, $90 million reserve of stone blocks in a pit next to its Bethlehem factory. To get around restrictions on Palestinian vehicles entering Israel, it set up a separate company in Jerusalem operating Israeli-licensed trucks driven by Israelis. And to ease access to Arab markets, it has opened a stoneworks in Jordan, plans quarries and a factory in Oman, and is opening a sales and marketing department in Dubai.
