 Treasury View: James Baker Stresses Holding Down Rates Even if Dollar Suffers --- He Sees Liquidity as the Key To Calming the Markets And Avoiding a Recession --- Will the Germans Cooperate?   By By Alan Murray and Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1987  In an interview, Treasury Secretary James Baker said he wants to "make sure" that the Federal Reserve keeps "sufficient liquidity in the system." His goal is to calm the tremors in financial markets from the Oct. 19 stock-market crash and to provide enough money to fend off a recession.  Mr. Baker believes that tight monetary policy and rising interest rates contributed to the market plunge. In retrospect, administration officials now think that in September the Fed made a mistake in increasing its bellwether discount rate -- its rate on loans to member banks -- although at the time Mr. Baker supported the move.  Mr. Baker also said that after completing budget-reduction negotiations with Congress, he hopes to negotiate a new agreement with other industrialized countries that would get them to stimulate their economies and would help stabilize exchange rates. But he emphasized that he isn't going to try to maintain ranges for the dollar at the expense of U.S. monetary policy.
