 GDP both rose and fell last quarter under U.S.'s new co-calculations   By Harper, Lucinda, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1995  New estimates released by the Commerce Department show that US GDP for the second quarter either grew at a 0.5% annual rate or shrank at a 0.2% pace. The two measures of the change in GDP reflect exactly the same underlying data on consumer spending, investment, inventories and exports. The growth figure reflects an old approach to removing the effect of inflation, while the second figure reflects an approach the government will adopt in 1995.
