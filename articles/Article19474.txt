 Fast-Track Authority Faces Uphill Task As Trade Advocates Scramble to Get Votes   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Helene Cooper, Shailagh Murray and Jim VandeHei, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2001  GOP leaders are writing up a "call list" of lawmakers they want President [Bush] to personally lobby between now and Thursday's vote, according to a senior GOP aide. Thus far, Mr. Bush has disappointed House Republicans with what they see as his lukewarm campaign for the legislation. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer yesterday said Mr. Bush would step up his campaign, but administration officials privately expressed concern about putting the president out front on an issue that may fail.  Bush administration officials are talking with GOP leaders about indirectly linking the fast-track bill with the floundering economic stimulus bill, GOP aides say. To win Democratic votes, the White House is considering offering a more generous package for workers, which could draw more Democrats into the fold, and break the logjam on all three issues.
