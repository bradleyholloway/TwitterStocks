 Education: More States Give Schools Grades On Performance   By By June Kronholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1998  As states get increasingly concerned about improving their public schools, and as taxpayers get increasingly vocal, one of the most popular ways to assess the schools is with a report card. Click on the Texas Education Agency's Internet site, and you can learn that at Pebble Creek Elementary in College Station, for example, 91% of the third graders passed their state reading tests last year; there was one teacher for every 16.9 children; average daily attendance was 97%; 47.5% of the teachers had more than 10 years of teaching experience; the school budget was $1.6 million, and much more.  The Illinois report card, among the first in the country when implemented in 1985, is compiled every year and includes how many minutes each school spends teaching English, math and science each day; how many youngsters have missed 10 or more school days; and how many children move from one school to another each year. Georgia reports how involved parents are in their children's education. The report card for Cedar Shoals High School in Athens, for example, says parents averaged 3.7 teacher conferences a year and another 5.6 "verbal contacts."  Still, the Education Commission of the States, which tracks state education developments, says 16 states have comprehensive school report cards. That is, they report on myriad categories such as a school's discipline problems, dropout rates, teacher salaries and SAT college-entrance scores, then compare the school with district averages and with the rest of the state. Another 24 states report at least test scores and attendance. Still others are debating report cards.
