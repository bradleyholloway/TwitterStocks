 Nightmare Prospect of Nuclear Rogue State Makes North Korea the Hot Spot That Worries U.S. Most   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1999  SEOUL, South Korea -- It is a looming standoff with North Korea, not the headline-grabbing crises in Iraq and Kosovo, that is really worrying U.S. policy makers right now.  That's because they see glimmers of hope in those other places, or at least long-term policies that might contain those chronic problem areas. But with North Korea, they have no good answer as to how to deal militarily with a rogue state addicted to crisis that might soon possess nuclear weapons and the long-range missiles to deliver them.  U.S. policy toward North Korea is in flux and soon may change after former Defense Secretary William Perry completes a policy review for the Clinton administration. Mr. Perry declines to disclose what he will recommend, saying he is "perhaps a month away" from making his report. But administration insiders say he has concluded that the current policy is a failure. They predict he will recommend that Pyongyang be given a final chance to engage more vigorously, with a U.S. offer of much-wider-ranging diplomatic and economic contacts. If that doesn't work, Mr. Perry's second course, they say, would be to fall back and ignore North Korea to the extent possible, while doing the minimum needed to contain it.
