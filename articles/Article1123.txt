 Moet Vuitton's Chevalier Says He's Resigning   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 13, 1989  Mr. Chevalier, 57 years old, said the power struggle among large Moet Vuitton shareholders made it impossible for him to manage the company effectively. A professional manager who isn't a major Moet Vuitton shareholder, Mr. Chevalier said he fell victim to a rapidly modernizing French financial market in which investors rather than managers call the shots.  The departure of Mr. Chevalier leaves Mr. Arnault face to face with the Vuittons, who formed Moet Vuitton in a merger with the Moet Hennessy families 18 months ago. Even if the 39-year-old Mr. Arnault is named chairman, as expected, he must share power with a management committee that includes Henry Racamier, the Vuitton clan's tough 76-year-old leader.
