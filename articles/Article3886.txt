 Getting Going: Seven Ways to Shore Up Your Finances   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2005  Let's say you tried the written portfolio targets and that didn't do the trick.

Out will go the rotten stocks and underperforming funds and, in their place, you will build a sensible, well-diversified portfolio. At week's end, you will tear a page from your notebook, detail your portfolio holdings and happily mail the list to Fred.  Life-cycle funds offer one-stop shopping for long-term investors, by combining a broad mix of stocks and bonds in a single portfolio.
