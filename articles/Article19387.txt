 Morgan Stanley May Lay Off 1,000 Brokers   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2001  The total job cuts at the big Wall Street firm could total 1,500, with the remainder coming from support staff, investment banking, trading and research, this person says. Morgan Stanley, with 14,000 brokers, is the nation's third-largest securities firm. The total cuts would represent 2.5% of Morgan's full work force.  Brett Galloway, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment. The firm has said that staffing cutbacks are likely to be made on a business-by-business basis, and wouldn't be made across the board. As for the broker cuts, a person at the firm says support staff will likely be included in the layoffs, reducing the number of brokers that will have to leave. Yesterday, shares of Morgan Stanley fell $3.01, or 5.7%, to $49.34 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The Morgan move marks a turnabout. For several years, Morgan and other Wall Street firms have been scrambling to build their brokerage operations amid an increase in trading by small investors. Many brokers increasingly have generated revenue by having investors set up fee-based accounts, where they pay a flat fee for brokerage services.
