 'Ultra-orthodox' reject Rabin/Peres fantasy   By Kramer, N J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1996  N. J. Kramer responds to Jeremy Pressman's Jun 13, 1996 letter regarding the so-called "ultra-orthodox" vote in the Israeli election. Kramer disagrees with Pressman's view that the ultra-orthodox did not vote for security reasons, arguing that they do reject the "Rabin/Peres sychophantic-masochistic fantasy of rapprochement with Palestinian terrorists and their Jew-hating friends."
