 Wobbly LBOs: Leveraged Buy-Outs That Appear Shaky Are on the Increase --- Soft Business and Overpaying At Outset Are Blamed; But Some Still Fare Well --- A List of 10 to Watch Closely   By By Randall Smith and George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1988  In a leveraged buy-out, managers and a small group of outside investors rely almost entirely on debt financing to acquire a company. Already this year, $34.5 billion of buy-outs have been completed, and an additional $47.4 billion are proposed. Success in these deals requires tough moves: cost-cutting, asset sales and rapid repayment of debt. Successful buy-outs ranging from Motel 6 L.P. to Tiffany & Co. have produced huge profits for managers and investors.  Yet for all the success stories, bond analysts and Wall Street deal-makers currently see a growing number of wobbly LBOs. Among those they list are Fruehauf, Leaseway Transportation Corp., Morse Shoe Inc., Papercraft Corp., Gillett Holdings Inc., Synthetic Industries Inc., Trans World Airlines, Metropolitan Broadcasting, Allied Stores Corp. and Southland Corp. If the economy falls into a recession or if interest rates soar, the analysts say, some of these companies could default on their bonds. Executives of the companies themselves generally argue that their problems aren't as bad as Wall Street thinks.  Such lists are subject to change, of course. Some companies whose buy-outs and bonds were once thought questionable have done better than analysts expected. They include Burlington Industries Inc., a buy-out led by Morgan Stanley & Co., and Borg-Warner Corp., a deal led by Merrill Lynch & Co. Southland's bonds have actually strengthened as the convenience-store operator has paid down debt faster than skeptics expected.
