 The Americas: Brazilian Politicians: Changing the Old Populist Line   By By Roberto Maksoud, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1989  Trailing Mr. Collor by a wide margin is the old-time socialist Leonel Brizola. Mr. Brizola has gained on Mr. Collor quite recently. However, this is primarily due to Mr. Brizola's changing his rhetoric to include a newfound disdain for state-run enterprises and bureaucrats. In fact, Mr. Brizola -- who as governor of Rio de Janeiro did little else but encourage the growth of the state -- is now attacking Mr. Collor for having engaged in pork-barrel politics when he was governor of a small state in northeast Brazil. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Mr. Brizola can catch up with Mr. Collor's still-commanding lead before the general election. (A runoff in December -- which will take place if no candidate wins a majority -- also will likely favor Mr. Collor, unless there is some dramatic change of events.)
