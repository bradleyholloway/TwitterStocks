 World-Wide [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 24, 1989  The Armed Services Committee, voting 11-9 along partisan lines, set the stage for a test of wills between the Senate's Democratic leadership and the Bush administration. The full Senate is to make a final decision on Tower's nomination next week, and Bush is expected to make that vote a test of GOP loyalty as he seeks to salvage his nominee and isolate the Democrats. The former Texas senator's nomination has been dogged by allegations about his business and personal affairs.  The president, in Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, said he intends to move cautiously in his policy on the Mideast. He met with Jordan's Hussein, Egypt's Mubarak and Israel's Herzog, who all had sought the sessions to sound out Bush on his approach to the Palestinian problem. In Cairo, Shevardnadze, on a tour of the region, said the Soviet Union may resume ties with Israel if the Jewish state takes part in an international peace conference that includes the PLO.  Pro-Iranian militants in Beirut vowed revenge for the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," but didn't threaten three Americans they hold hostage. In London, Rushdie filed a book review with the Observer newspaper, and an editor said the naturalized Briton was coping with the pressure of Iran's death warrant.
