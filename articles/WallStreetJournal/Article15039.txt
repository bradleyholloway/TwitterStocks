 Oregon Utility Plans to Close Nuclear Facility --- Portland General Decides To Shutter Trojan Plant Now Rather Than in '96   By By Frederick Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1993  Portland General Corp., reversing earlier plans to shutter its Trojan nuclear plant in 1996, said it will close the facility permanently as soon as possible, a step that could leave the utility open to as much as $350 million in accounting charges.  Portland General said it decided to close the facility permanently because of doubts within the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission over its safety, doubts that Portland General said would make unacceptable delays in restarting Trojan, which has been shut down since Nov. 9 because of technical difficulties.  Portland General, through its Portland General Electric Co. unit, holds a 67.5% stake in Trojan and is the plant's operator. A 30% stake is owned by the Eugene (Ore.) Water and Electric Board, a government authority, and the remaining 2.5% is own by Pacific Power & Light Co., a unit of Portland-based PacifiCorp. In theory, the two other owners could veto Portland General's decision to close the plant. However, both are expected to follow the principal owner's lead.
