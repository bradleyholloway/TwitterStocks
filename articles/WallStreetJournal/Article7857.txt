 First Boston Plans Municipal Security To Aid Refunding   By By Alexandra Peers and Laurie Seidler, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1989  First Boston Corp. has designed a complicated security designed to allow an Omaha, Neb., government agency to lock in interest rates now for a bond sale nearly three years hence.  Today, the Omaha Airport Authority is slated to sell $37.7 million of the new security, dubbed refunding escrow deposits. Proceeds will be invested in 8.25% Treasury securities that mature on Dec. 31, 1991. The REDs will represent current ownership of the short-term Treasury obligations. When the Treasurys mature, the proceeds will be used to refund, on Jan. 1, 1992, tax-exempt municipals sold in 1984 that carry interest rates of more than 10%. Then the REDs will represent ownership of new tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds.
