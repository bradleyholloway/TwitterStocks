 Foreigners Still Find Korea Takeovers Difficult   By By Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2002  The breakdown of the Kumho deal comes just after the fifth anniversary of the South Korean government's request for emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. To mark the occasion, the Ministry of Finance and Economy produced an odd document, "Korea: A New Model Economy Beyond the Crisis." On the one hand, it celebrated the progress made by Korea since it succumbed to the Asian financial crisis. But on the other, with a presidential election looming Dec. 19, it warned that without persistent reform, "the prospects for continued economic growth will become quite bleak."  At the same time that the ministry put out its report, negotiations with Kumho Group by J.P. Morgan Chase's J.P. Morgan Partners Asia and U.S. investment concern Carlyle Group for the sale of Kumho's tire operations broke down, according to people familiar with the transaction. (Kumho yesterday said the talks had been "suspended.") The two foreign private-equity firms are among the most powerful investors in Asia and had been in talks with Kumho for almost a year. The deal would have brought Kumho about $1.1 billion for an 80% stake, these people say. At the end of 2001, Kumho had 5.5 trillion won ($4.6 billion) in debt.  Since Oct. 9, when the U.S. markets began to power up, Korea's stock market has been by far the region's stellar performer -- the Morgan Stanley Capital International country index for Korea is up about 30%. Moreover, the Korean economy has held up well, though third-quarter gross domestic product slowed to a 5.1% pace from a newly revised 5.8% in the second quarter.
