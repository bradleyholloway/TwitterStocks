 Employees Looking for Advice On 401(k)s Often Face Obstacles   By By Ellen E. Schultz, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1998  When Tama McAleese was hired by the union at U.S. Kobe Steel last year to teach the employees about their 401(k) retirement plan, she covered the usual ground: She explained how mutual funds work, then told employees how to evaluate performance and fees-which she said were high.  Byron Oliver, president of Cigna Retirement & Investment Services in Hartford, Conn., says Cigna was not trying to censor the content of the employee seminar. "We absolutely support full disclosure of fees," Mr. Oliver says. But he adds that Cigna was concerned by Ms. McAleese's characterizing the fees as high.  This unusual dispute is an example of how sensitive the concept of employee retirement "education" is becoming. Just about everyone agrees that when it comes to investing, employees often need-and want-advice. (Some tips for investors follow below.) Studies released practically each week show that employees don't understand what tax-deferral means. Some don't know a stock from a bond. And they tend to park their money in risk-free accounts that get slaughtered by inflation. That can be a big problem, since it could mean they won't have enough to live on in retirement.
