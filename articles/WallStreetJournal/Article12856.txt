 Detroit Revs Up The Car Deals --- As Sales Slump, Makers Push `No Money Down,' But Quietly Raise Prices on Some Popular Models   By By Sholnn Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2002  Last month, GM extended its "Zero, Zero, Zero," in which buyers put no money down, make no payments for 90 days and pay no interest for the life of the loans. Ford Motor Co. this fall rolled out its "Free Ride," which offers customers no payments and no money down for 90 days on 2002 models. Even some foreign makers, who had previously been more restrained in offering costly incentives, are jumping in. Volkswagen AG, whose sales slid 15% in October, this month introduced a "Green Light Lease" program that waives nearly all up-front costs.  GM extended the "Zero, Zero, Zero" program recently to cover Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saturn and Saab cars and trucks from the 2002 and 2003 model years. The program offers no monthly payments for 90 days and no down payments. On its leftover 2002 models, Ford has been offering a "Free Ride" deal that allows purchasers to defer the first loan payment until after January.  At the same time, car makers are raising the prices on popular models. J.D. Power & Associates, which tracks sales information through a network of dealers around the country, says its data show that transaction prices -- which reflect cash rebates and other discounts but not subsidized financing -- have actually risen in the past several months on some hot-selling models. Ford's F150 crew-cab pickup, for example, sold at an average of $27,079 in September, up from $26,308 a year earlier. GM's Chevy Tahoe SUV averaged $33,917 in September, up more than $1,300 from a year earlier and nearly $700 from the average price in August.
