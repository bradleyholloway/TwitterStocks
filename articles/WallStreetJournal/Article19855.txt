 Australia's WMC Seeks Buyers After Refusing to Back Xstrata   By Johnston, Eric, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2005  "They're obviously trying to get as much value out of the company as possible," said Ron Cameron, a resources analyst with Ord Minnett in Sydney. "So WMC have said 'If someone wants to pay top dollar -- we're here,' " he said.  "Naturally, Xstrata remains focused on acquiring WMC at the lowest possible price," said WMC's Mr. [Andrew Michelmore]. "While Xstrata has increased its offer and labeled this a final bid, it has clearly flagged it may pay more -- if forced to by another bidder," he said.  Xstrata said WMC is biding its time. "Our offer is clear. It is cash, it is in the range and nobody has offered more," said an Xstrata spokesman in London. "WMC has not rejected our offer and has not said that it is too low. They have simply said they would like more -- and have stalled for time."
