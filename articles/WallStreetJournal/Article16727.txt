 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Years After Bubble's Bursting, a Reinvention Continues; AllianceBernstein Aims To Be Anti-'Hot Idea'; Avoiding Data Overload   By Anand, Shefali, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2007  In June 2000, Alliance Capital, known among institutional investors for its expertise in the "growth" style of investing, agreed to acquire the smaller Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., a closely held institutional money manager known for its bargain-hunting "value" style. Back then, the acquisition was viewed as a hedge by Alliance for the day when growth stocks -- those of companies with rapidly increasing earnings or revenue -- would go out of favor and value investing would rule again.  Mr. [Bruce Calvert] retired in late 2004, beginning what some observers call the "Bernsteinization" of Alliance. The mutual-funds unit generally is led "by people with a Bernstein heritage," Mr. [Lewis Sanders] says. "The set of objectives, the mission, the values we're trying to promote . . . have a long heritage at [Bernstein] -- and, by the way, did too in parts of Alliance, but not all of Alliance."  Mr. Calvert, 59, says: "I don't particularly view it as an Alliance thing or a Bernstein thing." While Alliance had been successful, he says, the managers wanted more centralized management, a broader array of investment products and a bigger presence globally. "In many ways [the firm] has evolved the way we had envisioned it, maybe even better," he says.
