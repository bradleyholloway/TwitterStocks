 Hitting the Books Without Having a Clue   By Messenger, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2007  Mr. [Anthony T. Kronman]'s chapter on political correctness is a calm indictment of what multiculturalism and a misguided idea of "diversity" have done to our universities' humanities departments. "The more a classroom resembles a gathering of delegates speaking on behalf of the groups they represent," he writes, "the less congenial a place it becomes in which to explore questions of a personally meaningful kind including, above all, the questions of what ultimately matters in life and why. In such a classroom, students encounter each other not as individuals but as spokespersons instead. They accept or reject their teachers as role models more on account of the group to which they belong and less because of their individual qualities of character and intellect. And the works they study are regarded more as statements of group membership than as creations of men and women with viewpoints uniquely their own." Anyone who has perused the course catalog of a liberal- arts college -- Wesleyan's English department, for instance, offers "Chicina Lesbian Literature: Speaking in Tongues" and "Law, Race, and Literature: An Introduction to Critical Race Theory" -- will recognize what Mr. Kronman is talking about.
