 Rewriting History: How Mutual Funds Hide Mistakes by Closing Bad Performers   By By Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  This year, the $135 million-in-assets Berger New Generation Fund was merged into the $35 million Berger Mid Cap Growth Fund. Meanwhile, just before the end of April, the tiny Credit Suisse International Focus Fund suddenly became a $383 million fund, thanks to its acquisition of the $354 million Credit Suisse International Equity Fund.  Over the four years through year-end 2001, Credit Suisse International Focus clocked 5.7% a year, while the now-defunct Credit Suisse International Equity lost 2.2% annually, calculates Morningstar. Similarly, the surviving Berger Mid Cap Growth boasted a four-year annualized return of 15.5%, while Berger New Generation lost 3.2% a year.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has occasionally nixed such mergers. For instance, in 1999, the SEC opposed the merger of the large, but lackluster Stein Roe Capital Opportunities Fund into Stein Roe Growth Investor Fund, a far smaller fund.
