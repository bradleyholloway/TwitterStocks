 The Tortoise-Slow Art of Restoring Furniture   By By Barbara Jepson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1985  New York -- Svetoslao Hlopoff taps gently with the plastic handle of a palette knife on the brass and tortoise-shell inlay of a Louis XIV armoire panel. "This part is solid," he demonstrates, like a doctor examining his patient, "but here, it sounds hollow. The brass has separated from the oak carcass, or wood base."  Mr. Hlopoff, whom everyone calls "Nick" (he was born to Ukrainian parents in Italy, whence the anomalous, vowel-terminated spelling of his first name), is an expert on the secret lives of antique furniture. Beneath its seemingly static surface, wood is constantly expanding and contracting in response to temperature or humidity fluctuations. As a result, glues dry out, cracks appear in the carcass, and ornamental inlays loosen or fall off.  When this happens to a museum-quality piece of 18th-century furniture, chances are that Mr. Hlopoff will be consulted. The 60-year-old free-lance conservator is one of about a dozen individuals in the U.S. specializing in the restoration of fine French furniture from the Louis XIV to the Empire periods. And according to James Parker, curator of the European Sculpture and Decorative Arts Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he is "one of the best."
