 EMI Is Likely to Issue Profit Warning, Part Ways With 2 Top Music Officials   By Smith, Ethan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2007  The company has cultivated only a handful of current successful acts. One of these, Norah Jones, is set to release her third album next month. For the most part, EMI has relied on older catalog, such as the Beatles. The company's strongest seller in 2006 was "Love," an album of songs by the Fab Four that were remixed for a Las Vegas production by Cirque du Soleil. On the other hand, a recent album by Robbie Williams, another act frequently touted by EMI, was a sales disappointment for the company.  The news comes on the heels of a string of failed attempts by EMI to either acquire Warner Music Group or to be acquired by Warner. The most recent talks were scuttled after European Union regulators were ordered by a court to re-review the approval of the completed merger of Sony Corp.'s and Bertelsmann AG's recorded-music operations. That round of talks was only the latest in a string of such discussions since 2000.
