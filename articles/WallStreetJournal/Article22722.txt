 Bush Transition Panels' Members Gave Millions to GOP Collectively   By By Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2001  The Center for Responsive Politics, which tabulated the contributions, reported that more than half of the 470 members of the panels gave personally to Mr. [George W. Bush] and other Republican candidates. Many other members are affiliated with interest groups and companies that gave, including law firms that donated their services in litigation in Florida on behalf of the Bush campaign.  Major contributors who were named to the larger advisory panels include Dick Farmer of uniform maker Cintas Corp., who gave $685,000 to GOP candidates and was named to the Department of Veterans Affairs team; Charles Dolan of Cablevision Systems Inc., who gave $262,000 to Republicans and was named to the Federal Communications Commission advisory committee; and Steve Chancellor of Black Beauty Coal Co., who gave $244,750 to Republicans and was named to the Energy Department transition team.
