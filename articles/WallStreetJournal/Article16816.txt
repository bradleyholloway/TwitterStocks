 Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis; Investor IQ -- Quiz: How Well Do You Know... Closed-End Funds?   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  Closed-end funds also aren't mutual funds, though they're often referred to that way. Can you define the differences? Do you know what a managed payout policy is, or what the most popular type of closed- end fund is, or whether closed-end fund investors are richer or poorer than investors in mutual funds? If not, don't worry: The answers can be found below, along with a full explanation. If you do, then prove it!  One reason for the prevalence of muni bonds is that the structure of closed-end funds is suited to relatively thinly traded investments. In a mutual fund, if lots of investors withdraw their money, the fund has to sell investments to cash them out. That can be difficult to do in a thin market, at least without driving down the price of the securities being sold. In a closed-end fund, investors' sales of fund shares on an exchange don't affect the fund's size, so the manager is free to invest without fear of being forced to sell to meet redemptions.  ANSWER: C. Closed-end funds, like their mutual-fund cousins, distribute dividends and capital-gains income to shareholders. Because returns fluctuate from year to year, some funds commit to paying out, for example, 10% of their asset value every year. If the fund doesn't make a 10% return, it pays the rest by dipping into the fund's capital. The advantage for investors is a predictable cash payout. But remember that if the fund pays you partly by returning your own capital, the fund's asset value will decline by the amount of the payout, taking the value of your shares down, too.
