 Michael Foods Inc. Predicts Lower Profit; Stock Plunges $3.25   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1989  Michael Foods Inc. said slower-than-anticipated sales of its ultra-pasteurized liquid egg product will lower earnings for the rest of the year.  The company said it now expects third-quarter earnings to decline from last year's 34 cents a share, and that full-year results will fall from the $1.20 a share posted for 1988. One analyst, Ronald L. Strauss of William Blair & Co., said he is estimating per-share profit of $1 for this year and $1.15 for next.
