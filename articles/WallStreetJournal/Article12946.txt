 Merck Cements Spinoff of Medco As Probes Linger   By Landers, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2003  Under the spinoff, on Aug. 19 shareholders in Merck will receive 0.1206 shares of Medco common stock for every share of Merck they held on Aug. 12. Merck won't own any Medco shares once the spinoff is complete.  According to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Medco still will have to promote Merck drugs after the spinoff, even if that is sometimes detrimental to Medco's interests. The filing said Medco has an agreement with Merck that might force Medco to pay "substantial" damages to Merck if it fails to meet market-share targets for Merck drugs. The filing said Medco doesn't have such a provision with other drug companies.
