 Citing Cost Concerns, More Workers Leave Firms' Health Plans   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2006  "Large employers aren't stopping coverage," says Jim Branscome, survey statistician for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which conducts the annual survey. "But what they're doing is passing on more of the cost of insurance to their workers."  "It's a choice between our house payment and health insurance," says 25-year-old Mrs. [Sarah Landis], who has two young daughters. Apart from her husband's asthma, which requires the couple to pay $70 in prescription drugs each month, all four are healthy, she says. So when her husband left his job to become self-employed three years ago, the family went uninsured. He may take a law-enforcement job so the family can get coverage again soon. In the meantime, Mrs. Landis says, "we just hope we don't get sick."  Reaction to Target Corp.'s "consumer-directed" plans, made available to most of its 338,000 employees earlier this year, isn't known. (The company didn't return phone calls seeking comment.) The new plans' premiums are lower than the range of $17.66 for individuals to $74.19 for families that workers pay each week under the traditional plan, but the deductibles can reach as high as $4,200. A Target guide given to employees said the traditional plan would be phased out at some point.
