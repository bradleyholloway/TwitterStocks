 BankAmerica Says Its Quality of Assets Improved in Quarter   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 1990  Net income for the quarter was $267 million, or $1.17 a share, compared with year-ago earnings of $304 million, or $1.50 a share. However, analysts consider the current results to be a slight improvement over year-ago figures, which were lifted by $44 million from cash interest payments made by Brazilian borrowers.
