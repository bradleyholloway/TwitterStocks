 United Air Service Is Tied to Friction With Pilots   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2000  In April, United pilots' labor contract came open for renewal and pilots' wages "snapped back" to the levels of 1994, the year the pilots gave big pay concessions in return for buying a 25% stake in UAL. That month, some of the carrier's 10,000 pilots began refusing to fly extra hours, catching United flatfooted.  Another factor for the pilots undoubtedly is unhappiness with the prospect of the US Air acquisition, should it clear regulatory scrutiny. The Air Line Pilots Association branch at United has opposed the acquisition of the Arlington, Va., airline on the grounds that United didn't give its pilots adequate assurances that their needs would come first when their seniority list was merged with that of US Air's 5,000 ALPA pilots.  Without those assurances, the two groups' seniority would be merged according to the union's off-the-shelf rules. Capt. Rick Dubinsky, chairman of United's ALPA branch, said in an interview that those rules "have the potential to give US Air pilots a big windfall to which they're not entitled." US Air, which hasn't grown much in recent years, tends to have more senior pilots, who would vault over many of the more junior United pilots and get to fly bigger planes, earn more money and have access to better schedules.
