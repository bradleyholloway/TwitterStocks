 Sotheby's Chief Is Convicted Of Price-Fixing   By By Kathryn Kranhold, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  The government's key witness was Sotheby's former chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, who testified that Mr. [A. Alfred Taubman], instructed her to strike an agreement with her counterpart at Christie's on commissions levied on art sellers. She has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate antitrust laws, and Mr. Taubman's lawyers tried unsuccessfully to persuade jurors that she was lying to avoid a jail sentence. They portrayed her as a power-hungry executive who often made major decisions without getting Mr. Taubman's approval.  In addition, jurors said Mr. Taubman's executive assistant was an important witness because she reluctantly testified about a meeting between her boss and Ms. Brooks where they discussed financial terms of deals. Mr. Taubman's lawyers had claimed he didn't get intimately involved in running Sotheby's.  Mr. Taubman's lawyers, Scott Muller and Mr. [Robert Fiske Jr.] of Davis Polk & Wardwell, had portrayed Mr. Taubman as a boss who didn't deal with the financial details of his business. Defense witnesses testified he focused mostly on Sotheby's marketing issues and building design. The jurors disregarded this, noting that Mr. Taubman didn't become a rich man by ignoring the bottom line. Additionally, the jurors pointed out that he attended all the board meetings, some audit committee meetings, and discussed deals with Ms. Brooks.
