 British Public Relations Firm May Buy Unit of Foote Cone   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1989  Foote Cone & Belding Communications is close to selling its Golin/Harris Communications public relations unit, most likely to Shandwick PLC, an acquisition-hungry British public relations conglomerate.  Golin/Harris was the nation's 11th largest public relations firm in 1987. If Shandwick succeeds, the purchase would be one of the largest yet of a U.S. public relations firm.  Foote Cone is considering selling Golin/Harris because the ad agency hopes to be considered for the troubled Burger King account, which is currently at N.W. Ayer. Golin/Harris's major account is arch-competitor McDonald's; the two fast food chains wouldn't likely co-exist. "I wouldn't jeopardize our relationship with McDonald's after 30 years. It's a very close relationship after all these years," Mr. Golin said.
