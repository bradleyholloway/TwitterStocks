 UAW Files Protest To Delphi Bonuses For Top Executives   By McCracken, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2005  The PBGC argues that the plan isn't "a sound business decision that will aid" in Delphi's recovery. The PBGC is concerned that hundreds of millions of dollars would go to executives at a time when Delphi may not be able to pay $400 million due its pension plan in January.  Also objecting to the Delphi compensation plan are a trustee, Wilmington Trust, that holds $2 billion of Delphi bonds, and several pension funds that had stakes in Delphi and sued the company for alleged accounting fraud prior to Delphi's bankruptcy filing last month. The pension funds, including a Mississippi and an Oklahoma fund, an Austrian fund manager and a Dutch fund, allege the compensation plan would benefit the same senior managers these funds say fraudulently inflated the company's financial results.  "It is imperative that the debtor's key personnel are appropriately incentivized to maximize the financial performance of the debtor's operations," says Delphi in its motion supporting the compensation plan. "The alignment of an incentive program that tracks the debtor's goals is crucial to the debtor's ability to navigate through this process and emerge successfully from Chapter 11."
