 Jobs Data Brighten Economic Picture; Strong Payroll, Wage Gains Ease Concerns of Recession And Trim Odds of a Rate Cut   By Rafael Gerena-Morales and Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2007  The strong payroll gains "were certainly a surprise," given recent forecasts for waning job growth, said Nigel Gault, an economist at consultancy Global Insight. "It clearly points to a stronger economy than we've been thinking. This should help lay recession fears to rest."  "At this stage of the business cycle, more of the total [profit] pie is going to workers and less is going to" corporate coffers, said Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "Stronger wage growth is likely to persist for a substantial part of 2007."  Federal Reserve officials see the continued strength in employment as a bit puzzling given that overall economic growth appears to have decelerated. "That difference most likely reflected lags between movements in activity and employment, implying that growth in employment would probably slow over the next quarter or so," said minutes to the Fed's December policy meeting, released Wednesday. If officials still expect the labor market to weaken, they will be less concerned that low unemployment will generate inflationary pressure via higher wages.
