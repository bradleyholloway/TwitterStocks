 Armco Reaches Pact to Restructure Debt With Banks   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1985  MIDDLETOWN, Ohio -- Armco Inc. said it reached an agreement in principle with its major banks on a collateralized loan agreement that would complete the company's debt restructuring.  The steel products, oil-field equipment and specialty materials concern's 1984 financial statements, as previously reported, were qualified by its auditors partly because the outcome of negotiations between Armco and its banks couldn't be determined. The auditors, Deloitte Haskins & Sells, also mentioned uncertainty about the adequacy of provisions for losses on the disposal of insurance and other financial-service businesses.  Certain obligations of Armco subsidiaries currently guaranteed by Armco also will be extended, the company said. All borrowings under the agreement are to be collateralized with Armco receivables -- or money owed it -- and inventories, Armco said.
