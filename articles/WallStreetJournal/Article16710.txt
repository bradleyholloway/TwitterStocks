 Shipper APL Adapts Fuel Use For California Ports   By Machalaba, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2006  APL said it has started using low-sulfur diesel fuel in the auxiliary engines of its 23 ships that regularly dock in Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif. Auxiliary engines provide power to ships when they are in port. APL also plans a three-year, $1.3 million demonstration project on one of its ships to test new emission-cutting technologies. "We have a responsibility to address the impact we have on the environment," said John Bowe, president of APL in the Americas.
