 As Sacred City Draws Tourists, Merchants Want Slice of the Pie --- Pizza Shops, Other Attractions Spring Up Beside Temples Along India's Ganges River   By By Diane Brady, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1996  VARANASI, India -- After years of watching people come to bathe in the holy waters at Assi Ghat, Gopaul Shukla concluded that there was one thing missing from the perfect pilgrimage -- pizza.  Not anymore. Fluorescent pizzeria and Pepsi signs now sit perched between the ancient temples of this sacred spot in one of India's holiest city for Hindus. Mr. Shukla's year-old Vaatika Cafe is one of the latest -- and loudest -- new attractions designed to woo the growing number of local and foreign tourists passing through Assi Ghat, considered an especially auspicious Ganges River bathing area for devout Hindus. "Now we can feed real food like home to our foreigner friends," says Mr. Shukla, proudly pointing out the wood oven and Italian coffee machine.
