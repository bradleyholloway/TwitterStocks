 China Vows to Cut Its Trade Surplus With U.S. in 2006   By Ellen Zhu and James T. Areddy, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2005  Beijing says it is determined to respond to the trend. While dumping isn't the main factor explaining the country's growing export machine, Chinese officials recognize the importance of China being a fair trading partner. At stake are relations with some of its biggest trading partners, including the U.S., where a flood of Chinese imports is sparking protectionist sentiments among lawmakers.  Analysts said getting a handle on dumping won't be easy. The Ministry of Commerce is expected to update rules to impose harsher penalties for violators, people familiar with the plans said. A crackdown on dumping is "a good way to raise exporters' profits and improve the trade environment," said Mei Xinyu, a researcher with the Ministry of Commerce.
