 SmartMoney: Finding Gold in the Green   By Kapadia, Reshma, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  Does anybody remember the late-90s' technology boom? Just as those who bought everything with a ".com" after its name got burned, investors who buy any company that flies the green banner could be disappointed. But the tech boom did produce some winners, and the growth in environmental technologies is undeniable. Peter Suozzo, Citigroup's director of sustainable investment research, recommends that investors avoid companies with a narrow focus, and instead look for industry leaders with long-term strategies and a high barrier to entry. Mr. Suozzo also says that both federal and local regulations have helped to underpin some green businesses, providing investors with a measure of security.  Last year General Electric (GE) launched "Ecomagination," a strategy to promote clean-energy technology in two of its divisions. The move generated more than $10 billion in sales in 2005; sales are expected to increase 10% in 2006. While that's just a fraction of the conglomerate's $150 billion in revenue, sales of fuel-efficient locomotives, turbines and the like represent one of GE's fastest- growing areas, says Caris & Co. industrials analyst Mary Anne Sudol.
