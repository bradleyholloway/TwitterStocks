 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Ferment in the Americas   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1987  This past weekend the United States and Canada took the first important step toward a historic free-trade agreement, and Mexico's ruling party announced that a forward-looking economist, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, would become its next president. Both events are far from fulfilling their promise. In the U.S. and Canada, follies may intervene as legislatures move to ratify the free-trade treaty. And there is always a question, in Mexico's Byzantine politics more than most, of whether a new president will actually follow the policies he seems to embody.  One of the Western Hemisphere's leading intellectuals, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, has been leading protests against President Garcia's decision to nationalize private banks and other financial institutions. Rallies across Peru, at which Mr. Vargas Llosa was the principal speaker, drew huge crowds. The BBC estimated that one rally in Lima attracted 100,000 Peruvians.  Mr. Vargas Llosa's characterization of Mexico's 1982 bank nationalizations as doing little to help the poor drew a sharp attack from that country's ambassador to Peru. This in turn produced a defense of Mr. Vargas Llosa by the famous Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz and his associate Enrique Krauze. "These societies have a strong historic tendency toward statism," says Mr. Krauze. "We must reverse this tendency."
