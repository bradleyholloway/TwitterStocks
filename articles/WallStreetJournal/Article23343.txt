 Crunch Time Approaches for the BlackBerry Crowd; An Injunction in Patent Dispute Could Stop Service for U.S. Users, But Other Scenarios Are Possible   By Heinzl, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2006  RIM still has some legal tactics at its disposal that could postpone any BlackBerry shutdown. Indeed, there are many possible outcomes, and nobody knows exactly how the high-stakes legal drama will play out. RIM, for its part, insists there will be no interruption to BlackBerry service under any scenario; it has readied "workaround" software that would keep BlackBerry running while sidestepping NTP's wireless email patents.  Judge Spencer is expected to rule first on any damages he will award to NTP, which won a jury verdict in that court in 2002 that BlackBerry infringes on NTP's wireless email patents. NTP is asking for $126 million in damages and is expected to later seek further damages in the form of a percentage of RIM's BlackBerry sales and service revenue in the U.S., home to more than three million of the world's 4.3 million BlackBerry users.  Mr. [Jim Vergas] says he's happy with the BlackBerry he bought in June but says he will switch to Palm Inc.'s Treo wireless email device instead of installing the BlackBerry workaround. "We love these things because of their convenience," he says, but adds that he must be sure "that the rug's not going to get pulled out" from under him due to the legal battle.
