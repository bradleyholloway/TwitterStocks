 U.S. Banking Executives Oppose Laws That Would Restrict Offshore Dealings   By By David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 2, 2001  A recent probe by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee found huge amounts of illegal and questionable funds flowing through so-called correspondent accounts opened by offshore banks at major U.S. banks. The accounts provide holders access to the U.S. financial system and can be used to launder money and for other illegal transactions.  Both executives said their banks are now closely scrutinizing correspondent relationships, and they warned lawmakers against a flat prohibition on U.S. dealings with offshore banks, some of which are critical to international capital flows. "There are major [foreign] banks that use offshore banks for capital markets," Mr. [David Weisbrod] testified. "I think that the right solution would be to work internationally" to take away licenses from offshore banks that accept illegal deposits.
