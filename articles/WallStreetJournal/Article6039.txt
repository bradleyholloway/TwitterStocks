 Saudis Stir Anger, Suspicion With Plan to Raze Ottoman Castle --- Is Act, Reviled by Turkey, Part of a Campaign To `Purify' Islam?   By By James M. Dorsey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2002  JIDDA, Saudi Arabia -- A dispute between Muslim nations Turkey and Saudi Arabia over Saudi plans to destroy an 18th-century Ottoman castle in the holy city of Mecca is refocusing attention on the kingdom's strict interpretation of Islam.  Mr. [Istemihan Talay] says Turkey is demanding that Saudi Arabia reconstruct the castle, which is believed to have been partly destroyed last week. He says the demolition activity violated a pledge given by Saudi Arabia last year not to destroy the castle. "Cultural heritage in every country is public property irrespective of what its origin is or the period in which it was built,"he says. "Cultural heritage has to be protected."  Reflecting a widely held Saudi view of Turkey, [Okaz] derided Turkey's right to talk about preserving Islamic heritage. "Turkey did not hesitate to erase its history," the newspaper said, referring to the replacement in 1923 of Islam by a secular political system by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who created modern Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire.
