 SEC Inquiries Prompt Novell To Delay Results   By Winstein, Keith J, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2007  Novell delayed filing the 2006 annual report until May 2007 because of an internal investigation of whether its employees received backdated stock options. The company said then that it had discovered "incorrect measurement dates for some of the stock-compensation awards" and took a $19 million charge to its retained earnings. Novell said the misstatements weren't enough to require restating its past results.
