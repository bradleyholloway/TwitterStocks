 Impeachment Vote Looms Next Week --- GOP, Democratic Senators Join Forces to Shut Off Any Further Testimony   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1999  House prosecutors will be permitted to show portions of videotaped depositions of three witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, during a special trial session tomorrow. But by a 2-1 margin, senators refused to subpoena the former White House intern to testify before the full chamber about her relationship with the president and their joint efforts to conceal it from lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment lawsuit.  Twenty-five Republicans joined all 45 Democrats on the 70-30 vote. The tone was set early as young GOP conservatives, such as Sens. Wayne Allard of Colorado and Sam Brownback of Kansas, announced their opposition to subpoenaing Ms. Lewinsky. Voting 62-38, the Senate then authorized prosecutors and Mr. (President) Clinton's defense team to use the deposition videos tomorrow and during closing arguments Monday. Senators then intend to move directly to final deliberations Tuesday. Back-to-back votes on the perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges could come as early as Thursday.  Faced with a losing hand, the 13 House managers couldn't hide their frustration, which spilled over in arguments over both the Lewinsky subpoena and the rules governing tomorrow's video presentation. GOP Rep. Ed Bryant, who deposed Ms. Lewinsky on Monday, was hostile toward the young woman he had praised just days before. Asking that she be treated as an adverse witness, Mr. Bryant told senators that Ms. Lewinsky's answers had been "clearly tinted, some might say tainted" by her regard for the president. Invoking the 1950s movie "Witness for the Prosecution," the former Tennessee prosecutor cast her as the Marlene Dietrich figure and Mr. Clinton as the guilty lover, Tyrone Power.
