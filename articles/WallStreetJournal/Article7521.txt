 As Summit Ends, Leaders Emphasize 1987 Trade Talks   By By Art Pine, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1986  In an unusually strong communique, the seven sought to boost momentum for the new round of trade-liberalization talks that is scheduled to begin in 1987, endorsing a U.S. bid to have the negotiations cover investment, patent and copyright protection and trade in services, as well as trade in goods. And for the first time, the seven conceded publicly that they must all overhaul their agricultural policies to reduce world-wide overproduction before it sparks a trade war.  They also formally put into effect a plan by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker designed to heighten coordination of the larger countries' economic policies to help stabilize the volatile world exchange-rate system. As previously reported, the proposal calls for setting up an institutional framework for prodding countries to adopt more sensible economic policies.  At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Reagan tried to ease the political embarrassment for Japan by saying the summit had agreed to "greater stability in the yen-dollar relationship -- something that both the U.S. and Japan want to see." However, U.S. officials said later he was referring to Mr. Baker's new plan to heighten coordination of industrial countries' economic policies, whose aim is to help stabilize the entire global exchange-rate system.
