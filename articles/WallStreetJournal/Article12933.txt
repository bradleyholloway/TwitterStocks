 Banned on Wall Street, but Alright Overseas? --- Crackdown on Wall Street Is Threatening to Leave An Uneven Playing Field   By By Ann Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2003  That split is highlighted in a hostile takeover battle involving stock-market research by an analyst for Wachovia Securities about the acquisition target -- a Wachovia banking client, Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. of Raleigh, N.C. Salix is resisting a $236 million bid, and the analyst, Michael Tong, has criticized the offer as inadequate and urged shareholders to reject it. Since Canadian drug maker Axcan Pharma Inc. launched its bid April 10, Mr. Tong has raised his target for Salix's share price, revenue and earnings, significantly above most other analysts.  Just Wednesday, Salix cited Mr. Tong's positive reports as "Independent Research Analysts' Comments" in a presentation on the tender offer to proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. Wachovia isn't identified in the slideshow filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Salix's financial adviser; however, Salix has repeatedly announced Wachovia's involvement before, and the company says institutional shareholders are well aware of it.  In March 2002, Wachovia was selected as an underwriter for a secondary offering of Salix stock, which raised more than $50 million and generated fees for Wachovia. Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for Salix, says Wachovia's Charlotte-based bankers got the business because "Salix has had a longstanding relationship with Wachovia." Mr. Tong works in New York.
