 'Wow!' Is Word for Stock Funds' Returns   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1989  Investors in many stock mutual funds did just that in the third quarter. Swept up by a surging market, stock funds had an eye-popping three-month return of 9.21%, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.  This total return, or price change plus dividends, was the strongest by stock funds as a group for any quarter since 1987's first period. And it about matched the average annual return for stocks in the past 60 years.  Stock funds that invest partly or completely in foreign companies were among the best of the bunch, shrugging off currency gyrations to post double-digit gains. U.S. growth funds, which invest chiefly in stocks of small, rapidly expanding companies, jumped more than 10%. But bond funds barely broke even as they were dragged down by weakness in prices for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds.
