 Letters to the Editor: English Angles   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1987  In his letter of Dec. 19, Robert Kohler protested the omission of the comma before the last in a series of related words in a sentence, as espoused by Joseph M. Queenan (editorial page, Dec. 1). Mr. Kohler asserted that for the sake of clarity, the phrase "no ifs, ands or buts" should instead be written "no ifs, ands, or buts," with a comma after "ands."
