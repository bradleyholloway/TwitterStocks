 Blue Chips' Fall Sends Investors Scrambling for Defensive Positions   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  In the options on the Diamonds Trust, an exchange-traded fund tracking the industrial averge, an investor bought more than 16,000 contracts of the November 74 puts, likely to hedge blue-chip stocks in the portfolio since these puts lock in the right to sell the ETF at $74 until mid-November.  The Diamonds ETF closed down $2.27 to $73.12, dragged down by decliners such as General Electric and General Motors. At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, its November 74 puts gained 90 cents to $4.30 as 16,871 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 879 contracts.
