 History Hints This Rally Can Outlast July's --- Examination of Rises Off Bottom Suggests Stocks' Present Ascent May Fall Short of '32-'34, '74-'76   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2002  The biggest immediate challenge to the current rally, however, is the economy. The soft economy was what made last winter's rally run out of steam, and it remains the big question now. Earnings still are mediocre. The ability of this rally to continue will depend heavily on whether the economy perks up and companies begin reporting stronger performance in months to come.  So can stocks rally 75% now? The analysts have their doubts. Perhaps the biggest reason is that stocks aren't nearly as cheap today as they were in 1974 or 1932. In 1974, the S&P 500 traded at eight times its companies' earnings, and in 1932, at 12 times, according to Ned Davis Research. Today it is at 30 times earnings for the previous 12 months, and 17 times forecast earnings for the coming year.  Separately, Schering-Plough agreed to pay Biogen $45 million to $50 million in the fourth quarter to settle a dispute over royalties on U.S. sales of alpha interferon products. Schering-Plough fell 46 cents, or 2.4%, to 18.94.
