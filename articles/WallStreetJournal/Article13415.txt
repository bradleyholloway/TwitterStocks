 Apollo Talks With Arab Fund; Abu Dhabi Investment Could Precede an IPO, Private Equity's Latest   By Sender, Henny, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2007  Any possible deal would likely resemble Blackstone Group LP's sale of less than 10% of the firm to an arm of the Chinese government just before that company's initial public offering of shares. To avoid any potential backlash, the Chinese didn't want and didn't get any voting rights. If Apollo and Abu Dhabi were to reach agreement, the stake most probably would be nonvoting.  Analysts believe it may well be the largest investor in emerging- market stocks, and it has a long history of investing in private- equity funds and investing alongside them in some of their larger purchases. The organization also invests in hedge funds and property. It already has a close relationship with Apollo, since it took up about $600 million, or almost half, of Apollo's offering of an investment fund, AP Alternative Assets LP, that listed in Europe last year.  Such a deal would burnish Mr. [Leon Black]'s reputation as a savvy operator, though it could be complicated by his tough negotiating tactics. And it would also allow Mr. Black to keep pace with Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman, who took his company public last month, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. founder Henry Kravis, who filed to take his firm public earlier this week.
