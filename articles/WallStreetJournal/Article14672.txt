 World-Wide [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1989  The president, speaking in Brussels a day after concluding talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev, said the U.S. "will maintain significant military forces in Europe" despite changes sweeping the East bloc and a declining Soviet military threat. He also suggested that Gorbachev doesn't object to some U.S. presence on the Continent. Bush, who briefed the NATO allies about his weekend discussions off Malta, acknowledged that recent events in Eastern Europe "deserve new thinking," and had helped spur him into a greater willingness to cooperate with Gorbachev.  Warsaw Pact leaders met in Moscow amid rapid political change in the Soviet bloc and heard Gorbachev's report on his two-day meeting with Bush.  The Soviet Union joined four other Warsaw Pact nations that invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the "Prague Spring" liberalization movement and condemned the action as "interference." In Prague, more than 150,000 demonstrators filled Wenceslas Square and rejected a Communist-dominated coalition government presented Sunday. The protesters demanded free elections. It was the first mass rally since a Nov. 27 strike that brought government concessions. Also, thousands of Czechoslovaks visited the West as the government lifted travel curbs.
