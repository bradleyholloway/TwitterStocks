 Treasury to Announce Refunding Plan   By Lagomarsino, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2005  Given the steady outlook for long-term borrowing this quarter, what the Treasury may say about reviving the 30-year bond is a key point for the market. The issue has received increasing attention as Treasury officials have indicated they are more open to the idea. The Treasury stopped selling the long bond in October 2001, citing projected budget surpluses, which never materialized.  In a Dow Jones Newswires-CNBC interview in March, Mr. [Randal Quarles] said Treasury is "certainly open to hearing the case for reinstatement of the 30-year bond. The circumstances in which the issuance of that bond was discontinued have changed." Senior Treasury officials characterized his comments as an acknowledgment that the Treasury is always willing to listen to financial-market views on its issuance calendar, rather than a shift in policy on the long bond.  Analysts say it is only a matter of time before the Treasury will have to formally review whether it needs to start issuing longer-term debt. With three-year notes starting to mature next year and five-year notes in 2008, the Treasury will "be forced to rethink its strategy of relying on short-maturity debt issuance to meet its financing needs at some point before fiscal year 2008," Drew Matus of Lehman Brothers said in a research note. "At that time, the return of a nominal bond of some maturity is likely to be considered," Mr. Matus said.
