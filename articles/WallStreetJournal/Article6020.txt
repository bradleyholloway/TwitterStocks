 New Policies for Home Insurance --- Facing Record Losses, Insurers Cut Coverage, Raise Rates; Terrorism's Covered, Not Mold   By By Danielle Reed and June Fletcher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 2001  In the wake of the World Trade Center attack, it's probably not surprising that a lot of people have been pulling out their homeowner's policy and looking at the fine print. The only problem: Insurers have been looking hard at policies, too. Faced with the prospect of losing more money this year than ever before, more home insurers are pulling out of states, capping "replacement value" payouts and raising premiums ahead of inflation. And with claims through the first half of this year already at a record $5.5 billion, companies will likely only get tougher, says Merrill Lynch insurance analyst Jay Cohen.  You're most likely covered for any terrorism-related damage, though people who live in co-ops and condos may see higher rates soon. Terrorism may have been homeowners' big worry right after the attack, but things like fire, smoke or explosions are covered, regardless of the cause. "It doesn't matter if the airplane that hits your house is being flown by a United pilot or Osama bin Laden -- you're covered," says Richard Ort, of high-end insurer Chubb & Son.  As a result, many insurers have decided they just don't want to do business where mold is common. In hard-hit Texas, for instance, insurers like State Farm, Farmers and Allstate have stopped writing new comprehensive policies. The companies that remain have jacked up rates dramatically: Chubb raised its premiums by 25% this year. The industry is also looking to cap payouts for mold and to require homeowners to pay separately for coverage. In the meantime, homeowners who already have policies can expect to be covered if the mold was caused by a covered water leak. Some insurers are stripping that coverage out of new policies, however, so check the fine print.
