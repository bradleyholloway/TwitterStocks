 Deficit May Reach $900 Billion in Next Decade   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2002  The Congressional Budget Office, in an analysis requested by Sen. George Voinovich (R., Ohio), said that without offsetting Social Security surpluses, the deficit could grow to $866 billion by 2012. Including the Social Security program -- which is projected to generate surpluses through 2017 -- the deficit still would reach nearly $530 billion that year.  In a March analysis that assumed no changes in policy, the CBO projected the federal budget would be in surpluses through the decade. But by August, with the stock market still limping and federal receipts lagging, the CBO changed its "baseline" estimates to show deficits through at least 2005.
