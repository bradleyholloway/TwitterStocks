 Lou Dobbs Says He Chose to Quit CNN Instead of Curbing Role in Web Venture   By By Patrick M. Reilly and Sally Beatty, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1999  Mr. (Lou) Dobbs, the smooth-talking but sometimes volatile 53-year-old news executive and on-air host, abruptly ended a 19-year career at CNN yesterday, saying he was joining an Internet start-up called Space.com. The resignation cost CNN one of the biggest advertising draws in cable television, and raised questions about why TV's premiere business-news anchorman would jump to an as-yet-inactive Web site, albeit one that also has backing from a Rockefeller-family venture fund called Venrock.  Mr. Dobbs said he had told his superiors at CNN and Time Warner about a year ago that he had planned to be a passive investor in Space.com, and would hold about a one-third interest in the venture, which is intended to provide news and entertainment about outer space. He said those plans didn't meet with opposition until last week, when he said he started meeting "resistance," first from officials at Turner Broadcasting, of which CNN is a part, and then from Time Warner President Richard Parsons.  After going through several rounds of "arguing over percentages" about his equity holding in Space.com, Mr. Dobbs said he decided to convert to an active rather than passive investor in the venture and to leave his CNN posts. In addition to heading CNN's financial-news operations, Mr. Dobbs was chief executive of CNNfn, its fledging sister network dealing exclusively with business news that Mr. Dobbs founded in 1995.
