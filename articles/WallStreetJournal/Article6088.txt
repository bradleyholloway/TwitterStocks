 Tyco's Legal Woes Trigger Liquidity Concerns   By By John Hechinger and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2002  These concerns were sharply underscored on Friday, when Tyco's already-battered shares fell by nearly a third and its bonds declined as investors reacted to a delay in a critical public offering of Tyco's CIT Group subsidiary. Tyco and CIT corporate debt was further downgraded by ratings agencies on Friday.  If Tyco can't sell CIT, the company has said it will have no choice but to spin it off to current shareholders. Tyco executives have said they can't hold on to the firm because Tyco's troubles have hurt the credit rating of CIT -- and the lifeblood of a finance company is the cheap credit a good rating allows, since it must borrow to offer financing to customers.  Also spooking investors on Friday, Standard & Poor's lowered Tyco's debt to triple-B-minus, one notch above junk, from triple-B. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Tyco to Baa3, also one notch above junk, from Baa2. Moody's also downgraded Tyco's convertible bonds and some other debt to Ba1, at junk-bond level, from Baa3. The Moody's downgrade to junk will result in Tyco having to come up with $530 million in cash under a program it has for selling receivables to investors. S&P also downgraded CIT debt to triple-B-plus from A-minus.
