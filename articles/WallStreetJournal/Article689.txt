 Senate Votes Shoe, Textile Import Quotas --- A Trade-Policy Showdown With Reagan Seen; Veto Would Probably Stand   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1985  The Senate legislation would sharply limit imports of non-rubber footwear and would cut textile and apparel imports, especially from South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Earlier this autumn the House passed legislation limiting textile imports, primarily from Asian nations and Brazil.  A House-Senate conference committee still must work out differences between the bills. However, President Reagan already has argued that increased import protection would hurt the U.S. economy more than it would help it. In a letter to Sen. Daniel Evans (R., Wash.) released yesterday, Mr. Reagan said he wouldn't sign "any protectionist legislation that diminishes competition abroad or here in the U.S."  Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), a principal advocate of aid for the textile industry, said it would be "difficult but not impossible" to override a veto. But both the Senate vote and the 262-159 vote on the House bill indicate that there isn't sufficient support to provide the two-thirds vote of both chambers that is required to override a veto.
