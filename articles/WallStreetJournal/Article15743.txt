 Aetna Net Surged 80% in 3rd Period; New Unit Improved   By By Nancy Ann Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1998  Aetna's net income was $212.4 million, or $1.36 a diluted share, compared with $117.8 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations, which exclude gains and are used by analysts for their forecasts, were 96 cents, a penny higher than a First Call consensus of analysts' estimates. Those results include $36.5 million in expenses for fixing Year 2000 computer problems and exclude a $44.2 million after-tax benefit related to discontinued-product reserves in the recent quarter and a $103 million after-tax charge for increased reserves for health-maintenance-organization medical claims in Aetna U.S. Healthcare taken in the year-ago third quarter.
