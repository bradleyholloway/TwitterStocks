 Executives on Trial: Skilling Paints Himself Blameless In 2nd Day of Enron Testimony   By John R. Emshwiller and Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2006  Yesterday's events in the conspiracy and fraud trial of Mr. [Jeffrey Skilling] and former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay lacked some of the drama of Mr. Skilling's first-day testimony. Mr. Skilling showed none of his initial nervousness. While the jury still seemed generally attentive, the gazes of individual jurors appeared to wander more frequently as Mr. [Daniel Petrocelli] walked Mr. Skilling through details of such matters as how Enron prepared its annual budgets. Though mundane, the testimony seemed aimed at establishing that financial results were established through painstaking and legitimate means -- and not by the back-room manipulations alleged by the government. Mr. Skilling is expected to be on the stand into next week.  The former Enron president also disputed Mr. [Andrew Fastow]'s claims that he personally gave secret promises LJM wouldn't suffer any losses on two deals where the partnerships bought assets from Enron -- deals that prosecutors contend were used to illegally boost the company's reported earnings. Asked about Mr. Fastow's claim of a promised "bear hug" against losses, Mr. Skilling replied in a sharp voice that it was "inconceivable that I would do such a thing." One of the transactions, involving electricity barges in Nigeria, he dismissed as likely too "tiny" to even come to his attention.
