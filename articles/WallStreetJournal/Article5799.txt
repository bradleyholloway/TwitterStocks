 China Weighs Lifting Curbs on Foreign Firms --- Telecom Concerns, Others Likely to Be Affected Ahead of WTO Entry   By By Ian Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2000  China yesterday signaled a major regulatory overhaul that could lift restrictions on foreign companies and limit state control over Chinese banks, telecommunications companies and lawyers.  The proposals reflect widespread concern that the country's laws and regulations aren't compatible with the World Trade Organization, which China is likely to join in a few months. China last year concluded an agreement with the U.S. to join the WTO and is nearing a deal with the European Union, the last major trading partner holding back China's long-cherished goal of joining the Geneva-based body that sets global trade rules.  According to an article in the China Daily Business Weekly, Beijing is likely to revamp laws on foreign trade, joint ventures and foreign investment. "We will speed up making laws concerning imports and exports, foreign-trade agencies, border trade, the processing trade . . . ." China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, was quoted as saying.
