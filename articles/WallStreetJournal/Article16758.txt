 Green Thumb: Credit Cards Try to Lure Small Business   By Sidel, Robin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2007  For starters, don't even bother if you can't handle the debt on your personal plastic. Late fees and finance charges can add up quickly. A recent study by the National Small Business Association found that 71% of small-business owners carry a monthly balance. For a big capital expense, it could be cheaper and wiser to get a traditional bank loan.  In 2004, American Express introduced an "open savings" program that gives cardholders automatic discounts at specific merchants, such as FedEx Kinko's. And J.P. Morgan's new card -- the one aimed at contractors -- provides 60-day interest-free financing for purchases of construction materials of $1,000 or more.  The "small" cards can simplify bookkeeping, but aren't for everyone.
