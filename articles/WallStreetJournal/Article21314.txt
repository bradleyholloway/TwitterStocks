 New Argentine Economic Team Is Seen Making Few Strides on Debt Before Vote   By By Peter Truell, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1989  Argentine Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille and senior members of his team quit Friday after the ruling party's presidential candidate, Eduardo Angeloz, demanded their resignation.  Mr. Angeloz trails Peronist candidate Carlos Menem in opinion polls for the May 14 presidential elections, and his ousting of the economic team -- as inflation picks up and the value of the austral, Argentina's currency, sags -- is widely seen as an attempt to boost his election chances.  Juan Carlos Pugliese, who is 74 years old and leads the ruling Radical Civic Union Party in the House of Deputies, replaced Mr. Sourrouille as economy minister, a post he held in the mid-1960s. Enrique Garcia Bacquez will succeed Jose Luis Machinea as central bank president, a job he held in the first two years of Raul Alfonsin's presidency.
