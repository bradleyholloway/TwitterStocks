 Payment Woes Worsen On Riskiest Mortgages; Late Bills, Defaults Increase For Subprime Home Loans; Problem Expected to Deepen   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2007  The First American data show that in January payments were at least 60 days late on 14.3% of "subprime" loans that had been packaged into securities, up from 13.4% in December and 8.4% in January 2006. Subprime loans are those made to borrowers with weak credit records or large debts in relation to their incomes.  Together, subprime and Alt-A accounted for nearly 40% of the U.S. home-mortgage loans originated last year, according to Moody's Economy.com, a research firm based in West Chester, Pa.  Overdue payments and defaults will get worse in the months ahead, warns Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, in a recent report. For one thing, he notes, many borrowers will face higher monthly payments in the next couple of years as their loans "reset" to higher rates from their low introductory "teaser" rates. Because of tighter lending standards, many won't be able to refinance into loans with easier terms.
