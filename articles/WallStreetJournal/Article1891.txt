 Japanese Proposal on Third World Debt Disturbs the Peace at Economic Summit   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1988  The disagreement took place behind the scenes at the summit, and isn't expected to alter the final communique today, which is likely to be a self-congratulatory document declaring the world economy sound, and papering over disputes. The new Japanese plan isn't expected to be formally considered, and is separate from the expected summit agreement on the much smaller problem of loans owed to rich governments by the poorest countries, largely in Africa.  But the emergence of a Japanese plan on Third World bank debt -- mainly in Latin America -- signals a new effort by Tokyo to lead in an area traditionally dominated by U.S. policy. It is part of a generally more assertive Japanese role at this summit, in which Tokyo has been riding high on praise for its economic record and for opening its beef market to imports while President Reagan is bowing out as a leader.  The Miyazawa plan is only the latest in a string of proposals aimed at supplanting the Baker approach in the secretary's final months in office. Mr. Baker recently gave up an earlier fight against permitting other countries to write off their African debts, leading to today's expected summit blessing of that approach. And, while Japan isn't pushing its Latin debt plan for this summit communique, it is expected to remain on the international agenda, and could reappear at the September meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Berlin.
