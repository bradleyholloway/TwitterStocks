 Hooker Rejects Bid For Parisian Stake By Unit's Officers   By By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1989  Hooker Corp. rejected a $20 million bid for its stake in Parisian Inc. and is instead attempting to sell all its U.S. holdings as a group, according to retailing sources.  The offer for Parisian, a Birmingham, Ala., department-store chain, was made by members of Parisian's management last week. It included the forgiveness of certain liabilities, which the bidders valued at another $20 million. Hooker, a Sydney, Australia, retailer and developer, invested $66 million in a 1987 management-led buy-out and owns a two-thirds equity stake in the retail chain.  A spokesman for L.J. Hooker Corp., Hooker's U.S. subsidiary, declined to confirm that the Parisian bid was rejected. But he acknowledged that Hooker is considering all its options, including the sale of all the assets as a group.
