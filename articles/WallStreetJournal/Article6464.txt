 Me & My Car   By Welsh, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  A: Trading in a car after owning it for just a year isn't a good idea because cars tend to depreciate at a faster rate in the first year. Besides, your friends (the optimistic ones) make a good point: Camrys do have a reputation for racking up hundreds of thousands of miles with only basic regular maintenance. We've heard of some 4- cylinder models soldiering on for more than 400,000 miles, so you might be able to drive your current car for a decade before it dies. For more information about Camry longevity and other details, you might try visiting a Toyota owners' online forum like the one at www.toyotaownersonline.com. The site has a section called "Stories from the Road" that includes tales of extremely high mileage.
