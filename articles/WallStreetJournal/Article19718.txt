 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2004  For more on this general subject, go to the home page of the IRS site and click on "Phony Tax Arguments." The IRS warns: "No matter how some things are sliced, they're still baloney." Keep in mind that judges are authorized by law to impose stiff penalties on arguments they deem "frivolous." The IRS site includes a long list of cases in which people have been penalized. I'd be interested in seeing that letter from the IRS that your friend's husband cites.  What if you haven't owned it that long? That's the question I received recently from a friend who is selling his New York City apartment, which he has owned for only a few months, to move to Washington, D.C., for a new job. The short answer is that my friend is in luck since he is selling primarily because of a change in place of employment. That's one of the three general reasons that allow you to qualify for a reduced maximum exclusion, based on how long you owned and lived in your place. The other two reasons are "health" and "unforeseen circumstances." To figure out how much of an exclusion you can claim, see worksheet three ("Reduced Maximum Exclusion") of Publication 523, available on the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov).
