 Janus Plans for Life After the Tech Bubble   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  "The last few years at Janus have certainly been extraordinary, as we've experienced unprecedented growth in assets," Janus marketing chief Stuart Novek said in the internal memo to top executives written in late summer and more widely distributed to company officials last month. "With that said, however, we now need to recognize that the kind of top-line growth we've seen at Janus over the last few years is likely to be gone forever," Mr. Novek wrote.  Indeed, "top-line" revenue growth has ballooned as Janus's mutual funds grew to more than $300 billion, from less than $100 billion three years earlier. But Janus's heavy technology bets on investments such as Nokia Corp., America Online Inc. and Priceline.com Inc. have soured, and 12 of the 14 Janus stock funds are down for the year through Friday. That has cut into Janus's assets under management and the percentage-based fee it collects on those assets.  For shareholders, Janus's expanded emphasis on doing business via the Web could result in longer wait times holding on the telephone if Janus cuts back staffing on its phones. In his internal memo, Mr. Novek said Janus would work toward "empower[ing] people -- employees, shareholders, clients, business partners, stockholders . . . anyone who touches Janus -- to do more things by themselves." Even so, Janus says investors will "have the option of doing both" online and phone communications. "We wouldn't force people to do one or the other," an official says, adding that the firm has no plans to cut back its phone staff.
