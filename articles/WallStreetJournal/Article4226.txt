 SEC's Sheller Probe Is Said to Examine Foreign Investors   By By Michael W. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1986  Peter A. Cohen, chief executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said in an interview yesterday that the SEC has told him it isn't investigating transactions by any official or employee at Shearson. Mr. Cohen said that information came in a conversation he had yesterday with Gary Lynch, the SEC's head of enforcement.  As reported, the SEC has subpoenaed 15 Shearson employees, including Mr. Cohen, in its investigation of the $482 million purchase of Sheller-Globe earlier this year by a private investment group, including Shearson, a unit of American Express Co. Shearson put up about $33 million in cash and placed about $110 million in senior subordinated notes to help finance the transaction. Sheller-Globe is a Toledo, Ohio, maker of auto parts.
