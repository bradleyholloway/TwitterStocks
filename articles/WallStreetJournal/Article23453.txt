 Politics & Economics: U.S. Files Complaint On China to WTO   By Elizabeth Price and Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab announced the filing with the international trade body in Geneva Friday. "This case is about standing up for America's workers and manufacturers," said Ms. Schwab. She said the decision to bring the case came after lengthy discussions with the Chinese failed to resolve U.S. complaints about unfair trade practices. "We are seeking to level the playing field to allow U.S. manufacturers to compete fairly with Chinese firms."  The U.S. filing sets in motion a lengthy dispute process, beginning with a 60-day period of negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute. If those talks fail, the U.S. would be authorized then to ask the WTO to form a special settlement panel to consider the complaint. If the U.S. prevails in that process, the WTO would authorize it to levy tariffs on Chinese goods.
