 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1988  According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, Dukakis has appreciably cut the Republican's lead but still needs a near-miracle to win tomorrow's presidential election. The poll gives Bush 48% to Dukakis's 43%, showing that Bush's lead has dropped from 17 percentage points three weeks ago to only five in the weekend before the balloting. Both candidates crisscrossed the Western part of the nation in a final appeal for support as the presidential race neared its end.  A Soviet Foreign Ministry official, citing a worsening military situation in Afghanistan, announced Friday that the Kremlin was suspending its troop withdrawal and supplying its own forces and Afghan army units with new arms to counter rebel attacks. But Western and Soviet officials indicated that Moscow is unlikely to miss the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawing its soldiers from the country.  Soviet dissident Sakharov arrived in New York for a two-week visit to the U.S., his first trip to the West. The Nobel Peace laureate, who was freed from internal exile less than two years ago, is to attend a human-rights conference in Washington, and see his stepson in Boston. Sakharov, 67, also reportedly will seek medical treatment.
