 New Facebook Features Have Members in an Uproar   By Jamin Warren and Vauhini Vara, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2006  "We didn't expect so much negative feedback," Facebook spokeswoman Melanie Deitch said yesterday. "It's a busy day over here."  The angry response of many of Facebook Inc.'s users illustrates the conundrum faced by sites that rely heavily on their own users to create content. Cliff Lampe, a professor at Michigan State University who has researched how people use Facebook, said users of such sites feel that they should have a say in how the sites operate. "One of the questions this raises is, 'What's the relationship between the designers of a site like this and its users?'" he said. "According to its terms and conditions, Facebook can do whatever it wants to the site, but students, because they've created the content, have a sense of ownership."  "We're doing all this to generate attention towards the issue," Mr. [Kiyoshi Martinez] said. "It's not just my network. It's our network."
