 Corporate Injustice   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2006  In one sense, the memo's guidelines are just that -- internal guidelines for prosecutors. But as a practical matter, only a rare CEO will risk the death sentence that a corporate indictment represents. So "cooperation" as defined by Justice is hardly optional. It was on this point that Judge [Lewis A. Kaplan] took Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin Weddle to task last week. When Judge Kaplan questioned the fairness of pressuring companies to throw their employees overboard, Mr. Weddle replied that companies are "free to say, 'We're not going to cooperate.' "  "That's lame," the judge retorted. He then asked Mr. Weddle "what legitimate purpose" was served by insisting that companies cut their former employees off from legal support. Companies under investigation, Judge Kaplan noted, ought to be free to decide whether to support their employees or former employees without Justice's "thumb on the scale."  Mr. Weddle replied that paying the legal fees of former employees charged with crimes amounted to protecting "wrongdoers." This prompted the judge to remind the young prosecutor that the accused are still innocent until proven guilty. He also reminded Mr. Weddle that the Constitution's Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel. And for good measure, if the government is confident in its case, it shouldn't be afraid to allow "wrongdoers" access to an adequate defense.
