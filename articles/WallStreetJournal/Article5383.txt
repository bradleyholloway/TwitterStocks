 Tax report: Expired tax laws   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1996  A wide-ranging minimum-wage bill approved by the Senate on Jul 9, 1996 contains numerous tax provisions, including some that would resurrect several tax measures that expired at the end of 1994 or later. Among them is a business "research and experimentation" tax credit. Another provision would bring long-awaited relief to as many as 800,000 people who received help from their employers in paying educational expenses.
