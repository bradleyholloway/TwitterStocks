 Pennzoil Will Ease 'Poison Pill' Defense, Settles Proxy Fight   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1998  The settlement concludes all litigation between Pennzoil and Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, a shareholder who launched a proxy fight in an effort to win a seat on the board and neutralize Pennzoil's "poison pill" plan, which makes hostile takeover attempts prohibitively expensive for potential suitors. The dispute arose after Pennzoil fought off a $4 billion hostile tender offer last year from Union Pacific Resources Group Inc. The offer had been favored by many shareholders.
