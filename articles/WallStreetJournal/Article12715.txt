 Bush Faces Twin Tests in Campaign to Buttress Executive Privilege --- Queries From GAO, Congress Provide Test of Powers Eroded by Clinton Scandals   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2001  Mr. [George Bush]'s political adversaries said he should heed the GAO's request in order to dispel questions about undue special-interest influence and to fulfill his pledge to "change the tone" of political discourse between the White House and Capitol Hill. "What better way to do that than to let the sunshine in?" asked Hudson Institute analyst Marshall Wittmann, an adviser to Mr. Bush's antagonist John McCain, the maverick Republican senator from Arizona.  Now, the administration of the second Bush is following in the footsteps of the first, even if the path is uphill. In addition to withholding Mr. [Dick Cheney]'s meeting schedule, the White House rebuffed congressional requests for information about meetings between White House political counselor Karl Rove and executives from businesses in which he owned stock. White House attorneys dragged their feet in responding to Connecticut Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman's request for records on the Bush team's re-evaluation of [Hillary Clinton] orders setting new standards for arsenic levels in water, banning road development in national forests and regulating mining on public lands -- until Senate control shifted to the Democrats and subpoena threats were made.  Alternatively, the White House could "certify" that the release of specific information about the dates and times of Mr. Cheney's meetings, which the GAO has demanded, can't be allowed because it would "impair substantially the operations of the government." Such a letter would prohibit the GAO from filing a civil lawsuit but also would open the door to a congressional investigation, most likely by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee headed by Mr. Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate.
