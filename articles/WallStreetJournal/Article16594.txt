 Videogame Makers Try to Score More Ad Dollars With Research; Study Finds Many Gamers Don't Mind Product Plugs; A Pitch to Madison Avenue   By Wingfield, Nick, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2005  Better research on ads in games could help further pique Madison Avenue's interest in the medium, just as new game consoles like Microsoft Corp.'s hot-selling Xbox 360 are expected to greatly expand online gaming, a technological shift that will give advertisers greater power to figure out how frequently and what types of gamers see their promotions when they, say, hop on a virtual motorcycle and jump through hoops sponsored by a candy-bar maker. Internet-connected consoles could also increase interest in delivering fresh ads over the Internet.  The Nielsen study is part of an effort by the media-research firm and Activision to lay the groundwork for more-serious advertising in a medium that had $25.4 billion in world-wide sales last year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In a study last year, Nielsen found videogame playing is eroding television viewership among men 18 to 34 years old, results that have been echoed in other research of media consumption. While Activision has funded Nielsen's games research, Nielsen says results aren't influenced by the publisher.  Mr. [Bobby Kotick] says new game consoles -- including Xbox 360 and Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 due out next spring -- will also help build the foundation for more advertising in games because they are expected to be much more widely connected to the Internet than current consoles like the original Xbox and PlayStation 2. "You have ability to track millions of interactions" with advertisements, Mr. Kotick says.
