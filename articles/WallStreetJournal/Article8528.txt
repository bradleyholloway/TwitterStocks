 Retailers Report Sales Were Soft For September --- Lingering Warm Weather Is Blamed for Keeping Shoppers Out of Malls   By By Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1994  September sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.9%, according to an index of leading retailers compiled by Salomon Brothers Inc., and increased 4.4%, according to a similar index from NatWest Securities Corp. That's down from September 1993, when same-store sales rose 5.6%, and August 1994, when sales growth averaged about 5%.  While sales of consumer electronics and hard goods continued strong in September, apparel was the weak spot. Specialty-fashion retailers were especially hurt: Limited Inc. saw same-store sales fall 6%, while Gap Inc.'s same-store sales rose only 2%.  Department-store chains that pushed promotional and lower-price merchandise fared well in September. Dillard Department Stores Inc.'s same-store sales jumped 10%, and J.C. Penney & Co. said same-store sales increased 9.3%.
