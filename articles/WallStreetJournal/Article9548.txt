 Europeans Seek U.S. Pledge to Cut Budget Deficit   By By G. Thomas Sims in Athens and Bob Davis in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2003  The U.S. deficit has been downplayed by the Bush administration. But European policy makers view it as a symbol of the White House's disregard for budgetary discipline and worry it coincides with a large U.S. current-account deficit. The combination of both deficits could drive down the value of the U.S. dollar, European policy makers believe, and undermine European exports. The U.S. current-account deficit -- the widest measure of trade and investment -- is 5.2% of gross domestic product.  The Treasury official said the U.S. needs to run a budget deficit now in order to bolster a fragile economy and that when growth picks up, the deficit can be pared back. As for the trade deficit, the U.S. official said, European policy makers should stimulate their economy, making Europe a better market for U.S. exports.
