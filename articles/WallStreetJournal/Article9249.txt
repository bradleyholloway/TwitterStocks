 Letters to the Editor: Herding Political Cats Is Often Expensive   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2000  I chair the subcommittee that funds the departments of Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education. Our bill passed the Senate on June 30, tying the record for the earliest date of Senate passage; and we completed a conference report on July 27. Our strategy was to meet the president's figure of $106.2 billion, recognizing that it would take that sum to get a bill signed even though it was a substantial increase over last year. We believe our priorities give us the high ground with $600 million more for education and $1.7 billion more for NIH requests on those items.
