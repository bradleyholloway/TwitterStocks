 Health Costs: The Boss Says, 'Try This'   By McQueen, M P, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  "I could never have afforded this on my own," he says. "I feel more secure that my case was reviewed by two sets of experts."  Sometimes patients find the programs intrusive. Edite Donatelle, 46, of Park Rapids, Minn., resented repeated phone calls from her insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, meant to get her into an asthma-management program and her husband into a separate program. A physical therapist by training, Ms. Donatelle says she felt she was well cared for by her physician and didn't need the calls or the avalanche of pamphlets.  "I don't want to talk to a strange nurse on the phone," she says. A spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota declined to comment on Ms. Donatelle's case, but said 90% of patients who participate in their care-management programs say they are satisfied.
