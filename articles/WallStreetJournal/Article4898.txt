 New IRS Rules Would Give Real Estate A Tax Break of $1 Billion Over 5 Years   By By Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1992  Although the Treasury said the IRS actions won't reduce government revenue, data published by the congressional Joint Tax Committee indicate that new agency regulations defining "passive activities" would be worth about $1 billion to real estate companies over the next five years.  Large developers, in particular, are likely to prosper under the provisions, which have received little notice outside the real estate community since they were proposed in May. The IRS plans to hold a hearing Sept. 3 before adopting the rules in final form.  The new IRS regulations appear to give the industry a way around the passive-loss restrictions. As some real estate experts interpret the rules, companies would be allowed to break up their business activities into separate small categories, many of which could then be considered passive. In turn, losses from rental properties could be used as a deduction on the earnings generated in these different categories.
