 All the Dog Spots Using Spotted Dogs Sell Dalmatians --- Trouble Is, These Denizens Of the Firehouse Aren't For Home and Hearth   By By Jim Bartimo, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1991  That's how it is with Dalmatians, an ill-mannered breed if ever there was one. But the dogs' graceful good looks have made them stars of page and screen. Dalmatians appear in ads for Sears and Hewlett-Packard, J.C. Penney and Citicorp. One was on the cover of HG (House & Garden). And they are enjoying the sort of surge in popularity among dog owners that happened when Snoopy caused a run on beagles.  Unfortunately, as many new owners are discovering, Dalmatians can be unruly. Bred as coach dogs (another name for the breed), and associated with firefighters, Dalmatians frequently prove too rambunctious for house and apartment. They were born to run. Thanks to the gene pool, a quarter of the dogs also are deaf in one ear. (A wag might say that's why they obey only half the time.) And they urinate particularly high-proof uric acid, guaranteed to kill any lawn.  The registration numbers most likely understate the breed's presence. When a pup is born with a black patch covering an eye or ear, breeders who care will either drown (or "bucket") the dog or give it away unregistered. Dalmatians sometimes have litters of 10 or 15 and not enough teats to feed them all. Totally deaf Dalmatians (about 7% of the breed) are usually destroyed in their first weeks of life.
