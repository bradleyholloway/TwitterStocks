 Oil-Price Drop Doesn't Jolt Japanese -- But Neither Would Another Price Hike   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1986  Ask an official of Nissan Motor Co. what he thinks about falling oil prices, and you are likely to get a shrug. The same goes for Honda Motor Co., Kawasaki Steel Corp. and a host of other Japanese manufacturing giants.  The reason is simple. Although Japan still is the second largest oil importer, after the U.S., it has done more than any other major country in recent years to cut its addiction to oil. By protecting itself from some of the agony of any oil-price hike, it also has insulated itself from some of the benefits of a price cut.  The economy as a whole has made similar switches. Under a crash program, Japan has developed nuclear power, geothermal power hydroelectric power and coal. Since Japan produces virtually no oil, oil remains the leading single import. But Japan actually imports less oil today than it did in the 1970s -- 3.67 million barrels a day in 1984, compared to nearly 5 million barrels a day in 1973. Oil accounts for less than one third of all imports, down from 41% in 1981.
