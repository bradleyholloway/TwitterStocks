 O Christmas Tree, How Costly Are Your Branches; Why It's More Expensive To Decorate This Season; Skipping the Life-Size Santa   By Sara Schaefer Munoz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2006  "The prices are just getting quite expensive," he says. "Maybe next year I'll be able to buy more."  To keep tree prices down, some retailers are shaving off lights and branches. Web site ChristmasLightsEtc.com this year stocked more affordable options, such as the new Douglas -- a 6.5 foot tall tree with 1,048 branches, or "tips," and 500 lights. It sells for $204. A higher-end tree, the 6.5 feet tall Winchester has 800 lights, 1,435 tips, and retails for $285. Michael Streb, the company's director of sales and marketing, said he wouldn't sell anything with much fewer lights or branches because consumers may end up seeing bare spots.  -- Artificial trees should have at least 100 lights per foot of height for optimal effect. -- Manufacturers may skimp on branches. The space between the lowest branch and the floor should be no more than 18 inches and you shouldn't have a good view of the "trunk." -- Cheaper lights can be spaced closer together to save on wire costs, which can create a less desirable "line" effect. Ideally, lights should be six inches apart. -- Look for "anti-twist" mechanisms so the bulbs don't easily loosen and go out.
