 PaineWebber Alleges in Lawsuit That Morgan Stanley Lured Staff   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2000  The suit, filed late yesterday in a Nashville state court, accuses Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. "of a carefully planned, broadbased campaign to raid Bradford personnel and interfere with the merger agreement between PaineWebber and Bradford." The suit seeks a restraining order to prevent Morgan Stanley Dean Witter from hiring Bradford employees.  A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter spokesman hadn't any immediate comment. In a statement, PaineWebber said it is "determined to take the appropriate steps to prevent Morgan Stanley Dean Witter from unfairly interfering with its agreement with J.C. Bradford." Last week, PaineWebber announced its $620 million purchase of Bradford, which has about 900 brokers in 14 states, mostly in the South. The deal is an important part of PaineWebber's strategy to beef up its brokerage sales force, currently Wall Street's fourth largest behind Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
