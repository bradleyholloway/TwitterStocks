 Economy in Hand, Fujimori Tests Politics --- Peru Vote Comes Amid Strong Growth, Curbed Terrorism   By By Matt Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1995  On Sunday, Peru will test the political free market when it holds presidential elections. Buoyed not only by a resurgent economy but by his success in dismantling the once fearsome Shining Path guerrilla movement, President Alberto Fujimori is the front-runner, with an even chance of obtaining the 50% of the vote he needs to win re-election outright in the first round, analysts say. Still, in the past two weeks, polls have shown slight gains by his chief opponent, former United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.  In a runoff, in which the top two finishers would face each other next month, President Fujimori would still be the overwhelming favorite to win a second five-year term. But anything less than a first-round victory would weaken Mr. Fujimori's mandate to deepen economic reform. He wants to privatize the state oil industry and other national icons, revive long-stalled negotiations with foreign bank creditors and wean Peru from its dependence on natural-resource-based industries.  Mr. Fujimori's accomplishments, which include arresting inflation that had climbed to 7,000% and reining in a decade-long terrorist war, have cast a pall over the once promising candidacy of Mr. Perez de Cuellar. A year ago, before the 74-year-old former U.N. chief had declared his candidacy, he actually led Mr. Fujimori in many polls. But Mr. Perez de Cuellar has not only been hard-pressed to cope with Mr. Fujimori's strong track record, but also with complaints that he seems too old and too elitist to govern this country with its youthful, largely Indian population.
