 Mean Streets: AIDS Heaps Hardship On Washington Slum Called 'the Graveyard' --- Victims Are Hard to Get To With the Help There Is; The Barriers to Education --- Gay Blacks and Needle Users   By By Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1987  Inner-city AIDS victims have had particular difficulty coping with their fatal illness. Intravenous drug users, among whom AIDS is now spreading the fastest, live in the shadows. Gay blacks, who so far account for more AIDS cases than any other group in the black community (47% nationally), find themselves a minority within a minority, treated as pariahs by many people -- black and white.  At 8th and M, in the city with the fifth-highest incidence of AIDS in the U.S., the disease is impossible to ignore. Called "the Graveyard" by local drug users, this is a dingy neighborhood of $6 hookers and heroin shooting galleries, the last stop in life for many a local junkie. Talk of death here, which for years centered on gunshot wounds and overdoses, now focuses as well on the pneumonia that ultimately kills so many AIDS patients.  Still, few institutions in the inner city acknowledge the AIDS crisis. The church, traditionally the black community's pillar of strength and guidance, is ambivalent about even discussing the sickness. At the 6,000-member Shiloh Baptist Church, a huge brick structure at 9th and P, AIDS does get mentioned sometimes, but clergymen are still grappling with how to confront the disease from the pulpit. "It's tough," says the Rev. Ronald K. Austin. "We'll probably have to do something about AIDS, but we don't know what yet."
