 Earnings Digest: Lear Expects Stronger Ground; Other Auto-Parts Firms Also Edge Toward Revival; Visteon Issues Dim View   By Kosdrosky, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2007  Auto-parts supplier Lear Corp. expects to boost its core operating profit in 2007, emerging as one of the companies gaining ground in an industry slowly overcoming woes stemming from lower production by U.S. auto makers and high costs for raw material and labor.  Lear expects 2007 net sales, excluding the interior business, to rise 3.4% to about $15 billion, from an estimated $14.5 billion last year. It also sees 2007 core operating earnings, excluding the interior business, rising as much as 15% to a range of $560 million to $600 million, up from an outlook last year for $520 million to $550 million.  "Obviously, we're still working in a very challenging environment," said Chief Financial Officer Jim Vandenberghe at an automotive analyst conference in Detroit, but he added, "We think there are some positive impacts that will improve our financial results for 2007."
