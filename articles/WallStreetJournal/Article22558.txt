 Start-Ups Are Tough, Even When Mozart Created the Product   By By Eleena de Lisser, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  WHEN ROBERTA Pearle Lamb decided in November she wanted to start an opera company, she didn't look far for advice. Her husband, Chris, had taken the plunge, launching his own Internet-related business the summer before.  Case in point: Mr. Lamb, 41 years old, and his partner, Frank Slaughter, have already raised close to $6 million from venture-capitalist types. Mrs. Lamb says $60,000 would be "more than ample" to stage the kind of small company production she has in mind. For her first season, she raised a little more than half of that, mostly from her own and family funds.  That was the early 1980s, and Mr. Lamb had left International Business Machines and the East Coast to find his fortune running his own business providing computer enhancements. "I was ill-prepared to start a business," Mr. Lamb says. It closed down in 1983.
