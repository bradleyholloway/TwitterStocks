 Icahn's Stance on Texaco Has Traders Puzzled   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 9, 1988  Texaco has run up on heavy volume recently, although it lost 3/8 to 51 yesterday on 2.6 million shares, and there have been reports that Mr. Icahn and a shadowy partner were among the buyers. Mr. Icahn's supposed goal is to mount a second, more successful proxy fight to unseat James Kinnear, chief executive officer of the nation's No. 3 oil company. Then, the theory goes, Texaco would be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Mr. Icahn won't say if he has recently been buying or selling Texaco stock, with or without a partner. But he says Texaco "is an undervalued situation." Some people speculate his real plan is to get out of Texaco at a higher price and maybe go after USX Corp. next year, when Chairman David Roderick retires.  Texaco won't say if the board will discuss the payout at the meeting. But it apparently is interpreting the stock activity as a timely attempt to make its life uncomfortable. "The company is theorizing that (Mr.) Icahn is jerking around the stock and leaking stories to the press," says George Friesen, a Dean Witter analyst. Texaco had no comment.
