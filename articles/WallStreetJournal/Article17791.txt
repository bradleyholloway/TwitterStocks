 Salary Cuts at NatWest Investment Unit Shock Financial Community in London   By By Peter Norman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1987  News of a voluntary 20% salary cut by the top 10 managers at National Westminster Bank PLC's investment-banking unit sent shock waves through the City yesterday. The move to cut overhead in a subsidiary of Britain's biggest and most profitable commercial bank triggered expectations of cuts elsewhere, in the aftermath of October's stock-market crash.  Jonathan Cohen, chief executive officer of the NatWest Investment Bank group's County NatWest Ltd. unit, said a review of each operational area, to be completed in about two weeks, may lead to further salary cuts and dismissals.  London's financial markets had lost much of their luster even before NatWest's action. Since summer, declining activity in the Eurobond market has led to a wave of market withdrawals and staff dismissals at a number of securities houses. The equity market here also began to suffer casualties long before the Oct. 19 share price crash. In March, Midland Bank PLC withdrew from equity market making.
