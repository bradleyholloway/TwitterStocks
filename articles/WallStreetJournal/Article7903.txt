 Offer Is Made For Allegheny International   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1989  The offer, by Steinhardt Partners and Japonica Partners, was contained in a letter sent to the company, its various creditor groups and U.S. Trustee Harold Jones. Representatives of the groups met yesterday with Mr. Jones in New York.  The consumer products company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in February 1988. Since that time, several reorganization plans have materialized, only to fizzle after being snubbed directly by Allegheny or sharply criticized by creditor or equity groups. Mr. Jones offered to meet with the various groups in an effort to get parties to agree on a confirmable reorganization plan.
