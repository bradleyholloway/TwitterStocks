 The Economy: Journal's Bartley Is Awarded Presidential Medal of Freedom   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2003  Robert L. Bartley, who oversaw The Wall Street Journal's editorial page for 30 years, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, the White House said.  White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said President Bush called Mr. Bartley on Tuesday to tell him of the honor. "I am grateful and humbled to receive this recognition from the president," Mr. Bartley said.  "What I've learned over three decades is that in this society, rationality wins out, progress happens, and problems do have solutions," Mr. Bartley said at a retirement party last year. "This, I think, is what happens when a society incorporates the traditional editorial credo of my newspaper -- free markets and free people."
