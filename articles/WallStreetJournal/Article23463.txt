 Kudos for Spitzer   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2007  Mr. [Eliot Spitzer]'s reform would attack the system's destructive costs by imposing limits on what are inelegantly called "permanent partial" disability payments, which typically go to someone who's sustained a head or back injury. More than 40 other states have a cap on the number of weeks you can collect workers' comp once you've been "permanently partially" disabled. But not in New York. Once that status is conferred, you collect 'til you depart this mortal coil. Though only 15% of all claims, they're 70% or more of costs. The Governor's plan would end these payments for more than 90% of cases after eight years or less, under the theory that this is plenty of time for a person to be compensated, rehabilitated and retrained.
