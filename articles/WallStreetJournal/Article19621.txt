 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  Industry and inventors long have complained that Europe's expensive and time-consuming process for registering patents stifles innovation and leaves inventors at a disadvantage against competitors in the U.S. and Asia. The dispute was seen as a key test of Europe's resolve to overcoming national preferences and create a real functioning single market. Governments were loath to give up control over the process, particularly whether patents needed to be filed in their own languages and defended in their own courts.  Four armed North Korean fighter jets intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Japan, and one used its radar in a manner that indicated it might attack, U.S. officials in Washington said yesterday.  A ruling in favor of San Luis would not necessarily spell the fate of 180,000 similar individual claims currently clogging an overwhelmed court system. But its size and political significance -- San Luis is the home province of Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, a member of the ruling Peronist party and a front-runner in the current campaign for April 27 presidential elections -- means the case could set a powerful precedent for lower courts to follow. There is even speculation the court plans to use the occasion to give its view on the broader constitutionality of the peso conversion decree of February 2002.
