 SmartMoney.com: Retirement Planning on a Budget   By Todorova, Aleksandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  What if you can't spend that much? Over the past few years, large mutual-fund companies such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group have developed services that, for a small one-time fee or even no fee at all, will create a retirement saving and management plan. Lately, they've enhanced these services with a human touch: They now offer consultations with a personal adviser and annual follow-up conversations to tweak your retirement plan as needed.  That's not to say, of course, that the fund families' products are bad or don't belong in your portfolio. But finding the best funds for you, according to New York planner Gary Schatsky, is only the beginning of a sound retirement plan.  "I don't know if it would be a substitute for a comprehensive financial plan, but it can definitely help someone with their retirement goals," she says. "Usually, with a comprehensive financial plan you're looking at other things: life insurance, estate planning." For that, you would still have to work with an accountant and estate attorney, she adds.
