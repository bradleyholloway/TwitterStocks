 CPC Expects to Post Rise in Profit, Sales For the First Quarter   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1986  ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. -- CPC International Inc. expects to post improved first-quarter profit and sales, James Eiszner, president, said.  Mr. Eiszner said he couldn't specify how much the food concern's results will improve, compared with year-earlier earnings of $33.2 million, or 68 cents a share, on sales of $1 billion.  CPC makes products such as Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola corn oil, Skippy peanut butter, Thomas' English muffins and Mueller's pasta. It also refines corn into starches, sweeteners, oils and animal feed. Performance in the quarter will depend in part on how well glitches can be worked out at CPC's new Argo corn starch plant, he said.
