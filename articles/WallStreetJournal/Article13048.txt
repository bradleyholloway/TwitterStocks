 Love & Money: If a Quarter Buys Happiness, Why Not?   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2004  "She loves those machines. And, frankly, I think they save me money." That's a friend I've known for a decade, a mom with a five- year-old daughter. "If we're in a toy store and she wants 100 things, it's easier to tell her, 'I'll give you four quarters and you can pick out what you want'" from the machines," my friend says. "She loves it, and I'm out only $1."  "I know parents who are tougher on this, but they're not thinking about the fact that for just 25 cents or 50 cents they can make their kids really happy," my friend adds. "For all the adults who think you should just say no, I ask them, 'How many times do you grab a little bite-size Peppermint Pattie or some other little treat when you check out of the store?' It's just a little something that makes the moment more pleasant. This is a small, easy little indulgence, and it's so easy to say yes if you think about it."  Say yes every time, he says, "and you're not teaching your kids any limits." Youngsters don't have a real grasp on value. Though they may know the numerical difference between a quarter and $5, they don't recognize the quantitative difference between the two. You say yes 25 times to the vending machines and say no one time to the $50 video game, and all they know, my friend says, "is that 25 out of 26 times I can get what I want. And that one time seems terribly unfair to them."
