 To the Rescue: Group Of New York Firemen Begins Its Rebuilding --- On Sept. 11, Company Lost Seven Men, Specialized Gear And Many Years of Expertise   By By Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2002  The skills of Special Operations Command -- a department division that includes the rescue companies, as well as hazardous-material units and seven squads -- were in great demand at the World Trade Center, and 20% of its men were killed. Today the man whose job it is to rebuild the 77-year-old Rescue 2 company, Capt. Philip Ruvolo, balks at the idea of pulling more firefighters from other rescue companies. "It's not ethical for me to poach on other companies," says Capt. Ruvolo, one of two surviving rescue-company captains. "The other companies are hurting, too."  For more than three months, the company worked extended shifts at the World Trade Center. In that time, Capt. Ruvolo began to integrate new members to the company. He has picked them based on experience, recommendations and interviews. Vincent Tavella, who joined Rescue 2 from Squad 270 just weeks before Sept. 11, was given a few months to become accustomed to the work before Capt. Ruvolo brought on Mr. [Mike Brady] in November. John Fowler, a 10-year veteran from Engine 176, came in December. Mike Travers, who joined in January, was already trained; he was a skilled member of Rescue 4.  Capt. Ruvolo staggered their arrival to give them time to adapt. That means plenty of training. Before Mr. Fowler joined Rescue 2, for example, he didn't spend even a week a year in refresher courses at the fire academy. But rescue firemen spend as much as a month a year there. Training is supplemented by regular drilling at the firehouse. "I can only teach you so much a day," Capt. Ruvolo says. "If you're going to cram for a test, you can only retain a certain amount. `Good enough' never is."
