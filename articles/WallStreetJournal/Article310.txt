 Hyundai's Experience Shows India's Hermetic Market Is Opening   By By Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2000  Indeed, the fate of European, U.S. and other Asian manufacturers in India offers clues as to who will win in the global auto sweepstakes. The influx of foreign makers has already created a capacity mismatch in India. Some industry executives estimate India can produce two million cars and sport-utility vehicles a year, but domestic sales will be well below one million units this year. Most of those will be in the market's lower end, where Hyundai and another South Korean maker, Daewoo Motor Co., are winning market share.  To be sure, Hyundai faces some stiff foreign competition in India. Ford Motor Co., which began Indian operations a year ago, is already profitable and expected to move up to sixth place in sales this year. If Ford succeeds in buying Daewoo and merges the Korean car maker's India operations with its own, it would control a significant chunk of the market. General Motors Corp., meanwhile, has less than 1% of the market. But the U.S. giant has tie-ups with Fiat SpA and Suzuki, giving it several options in India. "General Motors is the sleeping giant of the market," Mr. [Arindam Bhatachariya] says.
