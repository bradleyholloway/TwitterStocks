 Glaxo Diabetes Drug Is Dealt Setback As SmithKline Proceeds With Merger   By By Stephen D. Moore and Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2000  The drug represents a novel approach to adult-onset diabetes -- the same disease treated by Avendia, a budding blockbuster medicine from SmithKline launched two years ago. A Glaxo spokesman said the condition of a few patients with heart problems worsened after treatment with GI262570 in clinical trials.  In addition, SmithKline said it will divest two drugs, Kytril and Famvir, in order to win U.S. regulatory approval of the merger with Glaxo. Kytril, used to treat nausea associated with chemotherapy, had sales of $107 million world-wide in 1999. Famvir, an antiviral drug for herpes, had sales of $62 million. The move was widely anticipated since SmithKline has similar products. Divestiture is necessary to comply with U.S antitrust regulations, including a possible negotiated settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.
