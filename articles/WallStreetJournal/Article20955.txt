 Another Shaky U.S. Ally   By By David Asman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1986  In all the country parallels being drawn with recent tumult in the Philippines, the government of Panama has hardly figured. Perhaps this oversight is a legacy of the late dictator Gen. Omar Torrijos, who bamboozled Western intellectuals into believing that Panamanians were as enraptured by his revolution and personality as were his gringo drinking partners. Or perhaps Panama's cordial relations with Fidel Castro, another legacy of Torrijos, somehow shields Panamanian military leaders from the scorn heaped upon, say, Paraguay's Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.  Nevertheless, the similarities to pre-revolutionary Manila are here. While a vigorous and vocal opposition to the current regime is tolerated, it is abruptly cut off whenever the regime senses a clear threat to its political or economic interests. Panama's legislative, executive and judicial bodies act, according to opposition claims, as a rubber stamp for the real power base -- the Panamanian Defense Forces and their chief, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. And the U.S. has key strategic interests in Panama -- home not just of the canal, but also of headquarters for the U.S. Southern Command and a base for more than 9,000 U.S. troops.  Nicolas Arditas Barletta, whose 1984 campaign was backed by Gen. Noriega, was forced out of office last September. His resignation came two weeks after Dr. Hugo Spadafora's beheaded body was found just over the Panamanian border in Costa Rica. Spadafora, a former minister in Torrijos's government, was a thorn in the side of Gen. Noriega. A physician-turned-adventurer who had fought at different times with African revolutionaries, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and finally the anti-Sandinista rebels, Spadafora had repeatedly accused Gen. Noriega of nefarious dealings, such as taking a cut from international drug dealers using Panama as a transit route.
