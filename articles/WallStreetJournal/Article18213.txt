 Men Who Aspire To Women Higher Have Lots to Learn --- Ms. Sayles Teaches Males How To Land a Sugar Mommy; Brutal Sacrifices Made   By By Jane Mayer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1991  If the eyes are the windows of the soul, then Ms. Sayles's big blues are a dazzling glimpse into a cash register drawer. And keeping that drawer filled these days is a product that may be perfectly pitched to the times. Ms. Sayles is selling courses (in various cities), tapes, private consultations and a soon-to-be-released book, all on a topic that seamlessly spans the distance between the Greed of the 1980s and the Family Values of the 1990s: "How to Marry the Rich."  In pre-liberation days this topic might have been thought the province of scheming females, like Lorelei Lee, the diamond-loving leading lady in Anita Loos's "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." But Ms. Sayles, who is not one to deny herself half the market, has tapped a new, lucrative vein: fortune-hunting men.  The first hurdle Ms. Sayles faces with her clients is getting them to discard quaint American notions that marriage should be first and foremost about love, that honesty is the best policy, even among spouses, and that work is necessary for a full life. Instead, Ms. Sayles espouses deceptive dating, strategic coupling and total financial dependence if possible. The ultimate goal is virtual adult adoption.
