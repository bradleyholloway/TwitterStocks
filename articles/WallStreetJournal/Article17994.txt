 Exxon Faces Fight In Use of Chemical In Alaska Cleanup   By By Ken Wells, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1989  Fishery and environmental groups have launched an intense lobbying effort to delay until further study the use of an untried Exxon Corp. dispersant to hasten cleanup of oil-encrusted beaches in Alaska's Prince William Sound.  Supported by the Coast Guard and a reticent Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Exxon has received tentative approval to use the chemical in an "expanded test" that could result in its application on two large islands in the western sound this weekend.  Should those tests prove successful -- and the chemical judged to be relatively harmless to the environment -- Exxon would likely get the green light to use the kerosene-based agent to tackle stubborn tarlike oil still clinging to hundreds of miles of Prince William Sound beaches following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March.
