 Senators Hear Opposite Views Of the Markets --- SEC Chairman, Fed Chief Differ Sharply on Need For Government Action   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1988  The nation's top two financial regulators appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver sharply different views of the health of the markets and the need for government action.  Calling the October stock market crash "a specter that hangs over the system," Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder said he isn't confident that Washington has responded adequately to the events of October. He also warned that continuing price volatility is rattling big institutions as well as small investors. He promised to deliver legislative proposals to Congress within a few days.  "What I'm primarily worried about is a repeat of Oct. 19th and 20th," Mr. Ruder told the Senate Banking Committee. "What I'm troubled about is the fact that we have been charged with a responsibility to try to prevent another Oct. 19th and 20th, and I'm not sure at this point that we have found that solution."
