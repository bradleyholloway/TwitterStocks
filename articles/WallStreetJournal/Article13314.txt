 Barron's Insight: El Paso Can Keep Climbing   By Doherty, Jacqueline, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  UBS analyst Ronald Barone arrives at a similar target by estimating the private-market value of each of the company's businesses. El Paso has the nation's largest natural-gas pipeline network, which he values at $19.7 billion.  The E&P unit exposes El Paso to energy prices. Natural gas rose as high as $15 per million British thermal units in December, fell to $5.18 as inventories grew, then rebounded to $7.26 as utilities worked to keep air conditioners humming in the heat. Investors should note that if prices tumble to $4 or so, El Paso's E&P unit probably wouldn't be profitable.
