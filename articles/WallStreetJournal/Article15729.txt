 IPO Shortage Challenges Fund Managers   By By Mara Der Hovanesian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  "Everything has been put on hold," said Peter Kris, managing director of Van Wagoner Capital Management, an aggressive San Francisco small-cap investor with a well-known taste for IPOs. "Right now we are just being careful," he said.  Not all IPOs can be Netscape Communications Corp., which went public at a split-adjusted $14 in 1995 and skyrocketed to $87. But the better the market, the better chance a fund manager has at getting a lift from a quality offering's flurry.  Three years ago was a boon for most funds investing in IPOs. A Morningstar Inc. report called one IPO-heavy fund, the $765 million American Century-20th Century Giftrust Fund, as "aggressive as they come." That's when the fund beat the Standard & Poor 500-stock index from 1991 to 1994 by double-digit margins.
