 Indonesian Police Increase Cooperation on Terrorism --- Move to Aid Regional Effort Comes Amid Complaints By Politicians in Jakarta   By By Timothy Mapes, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2002  A team of five Malaysian policemen, led by the head of the country's Criminal Investigations Division, arrived in Indonesia this week to pursue a regionwide search for Riduan Isamuddin, an Indonesian Islamic cleric better known as Hambali. An official from Malaysia's Interior Ministry is among the visiting team, which wants to gather information on Mr. Hambali's network of associates in Indonesia, a spokesman for Indonesia's police said.  Mr. Hambali is suspected of involvement in a plan to bomb the U.S. Embassy and other targets in Singapore, and in a failed 1994 plot to hijack and bomb 11 U.S. commercial airliners. Mr. Hambali also met with two men, later involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., when they traveled through Malaysia in January 2000, according to Malaysian police.
