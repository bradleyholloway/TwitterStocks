 How to Re-Create Fine Wine: Start by Taking a 'Fingerprint'   By By Michael W. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1986  IN AN AIRY 19th century warehouse on a mountain crest overlooking Silicon Valley, the wine makers of Ridge Vineyards taste their new vintages. They sip Cabernet Sauvignon fresh from oak barrels and swirl it about their tongues, just like generations of connoisseurs before them.  Ridge believes this technique -- normally used by doctors and chemists -- can help it capture the elusive ingredients that make certain wine great. In the last few years, the Cupertino, Calif., winery has been pouring distinguished wines -- its own and others -- into powerful analytic instruments that produce graphic "fingerprints" describing their chemical makeup. That information, Ridge figures, will let it adjust the production of its new wines until they yield similar fingerprints.  "Theoretically you could take a 1961 Chateau Latour and get its fingerprint," says Ridge wine-maker Paul Draper, speaking of a celebrated Bordeaux vintage, "and then work on a 1980 Ridge Monte Bello Cabernet to come up with the same fingerprint, and you would indeed have reproduced most of the quality of a very, very great wine."
