 Failing Grades for Teachers' 403(b)s --- Bush Proposal to Redo Retirement Plans Would Aid Educators, Advocates Say   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2003  The number of choices in some 403(b) plans can be overwhelming to participants as school districts typically provide less guidance than corporate employers on the general workings of retirement plans, and they may offer no assistance in selecting among the providers. Further, the primary investment choices within many 403(b) programs are annuities that are more complex and tend to have higher fees than the mutual funds that are typically offered in 401(k) plans in corporations.  It also appears that individuals currently saving in 403(b) plans would lose some benefits as the president's plan now stands. For one thing, some school-district employees this year have the option to fully fund a 403(b) plan and also put an equal sum into a 457 deferred-compensation plan. Governmental 457 plans, like 403(b) plans, would be replaced by ERSAs under the president's plan and individuals would no longer be able to "double dip," Ms. [Kristi Cook] says.  In addition, many 403(b) investors currently have the option to pull money out of a plan approved by their employers and shift it to any other 403(b) provider in a so-called 90-24 transfer. With ERSAs, as with 401(k) plans today, money would generally have to stay within the employer-offered plan or plans until the person changes employment or retires.
