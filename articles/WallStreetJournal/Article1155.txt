 A Word to the Wise In Iran: Don't Ever Wear a Tie to Work; Men, Too, Now Must Worry About the Fashion Police; Barber Shop Dos & Don'ts   By Higgins, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2007  The fashion blitz has run into flak from members of parliament and even some officials but, speaking at Friday prayers last week in Tehran, Ahmad Janatti, an ultraconservative ayatollah, vowed to resist their "carping and cursing." Outside the vast prayer hall, Islamic zealots handed out copies of Hezbollah, an intemperate hard-line paper. It cheered the assault on "indecency" as a "golden page in the book of honor" of Iran's police and reviled critics as part of a liberal plot by enemy agents.  Most Iranian men wear their hair short and avoid any unconventional flourishes, but a few youths, particularly in affluent areas, indulge in elaborate exercises of hair topiary. "Sometimes it looks as if they've planted carrots or cabbage on their head," says Mr. [Eftekharifard]. Some fashion-conscious young men have started shaping their eyebrows and even wearing makeup. Mr. Eftekharifard blames the trend on satellite television and the proliferation of unregistered, underground hair salons. He has three sons himself but says "they have a good understanding of my position so never went wild."  The absence of clear rules leaves much to the discretion of barbers. Hamid Bonakdar, the manager of a men's salon in central Tehran, says a young man visited recently and wanted to dye his hair orange. "I told him, 'This is not a good idea right now . . . They'll arrest you,'" recalls Mr. Bonakdar, who supervises five barbers. He says he told the customer how to dye his own hair at home but urged him to wait.
