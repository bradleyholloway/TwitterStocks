 Legal Theorists Say Stock Manipulation Is Too Vague a Term --- Law Review Article Proposes Abolishing the Concept As Basis for Valid Charges   By By Junda Woo, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1992  The article's authors -- University of Chicago law Prof. Daniel R. Fischel and David J. Ross, vice president of Lexecon Inc., a Chicago economic consulting firm -- propose abolishing stock manipulation as a legal concept. Currently, the Securities Exchange Act prohibits, but doesn't define, manipulation.  Tackling various commentators' definitions, Messrs. Fischel and Ross reject the term "inducing people to trade" as too broad because it could cover even a mutually beneficial trade. Another popular definition, "forcing a security's price to an artificial level," might punish a trader who genuinely -- though mistakenly -- believes a stock's value is higher or lower than its price. The authors conclude that only dishonest intent to move stock prices can be called manipulative.  Several securities law specialists balked at that idea, although they agreed manipulation is ill-defined. Recent high-profile manipulation convictions have either been overturned, such as one against GAF Corp., or didn't actually involve a legal charge of manipulation. "You're talking about maybe one out of every 40 securities convictions are manipulation cases," said Arthur Mathews, a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. Manipulation isn't "unheard of, but it's very hard" to prove, he said.
