 Finance Panel Can Look Back, Carry Forward --- Lessons of the 1981 Tax Cut   By By Lawrence B. Lindsey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1986  The 1981 tax cut was described as a windfall for the rich. It lowered tax rates 10% across the board but cut the top tax rate 28% -- from 70 cents on the dollar to 50. But when the numbers were in, the share of taxes paid by top-bracket taxpayers actually had increased, and the absolute cost of the rate reduction was substantially less than expected.  Even more surprising, the 180,000 taxpayers with the highest incomes actually paid more taxes with the top rate at 50% than they would have with a 70% top rate in effect. When the actual amount of reported income was compared with the level predicted by the TAXSIM model at the National Bureau of Economic Research, top-bracket taxpayers reported 20% more taxable income than they would have if there had been no tax cut. The taxes paid on this increased income more than offset the revenue loss from the rate reductions. On net, these taxpayers paid about $27 billion in taxes with the top rate at 50%, or about $600 million more than they would have paid under the old higher rates.  Our studies showed that increased reporting of taxable income for different income groups was very closely related to how much the tax cuts changed the amount of a taxpayer's income he was allowed to keep. The results suggested that for every 10% increase in the share of his income he was allowed to keep, the taxpayer would report about 7.5% more income. Since higher-bracket taxpayers saw a bigger increase in the share of their earnings they could keep, they reported a bigger increase in taxable income.
