 White House Throws Wrench In Farm-Aid Plan --- Budget Chief Threatens Veto of Overall Budget Bill If It Tops Spending Caps   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  Mindful of this, House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R., Ill.) and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) met with the appropriations leadership yesterday. Later at the White House, Mr. Hastert raised options with Vice President Cheney that might give negotiators more leeway in crafting the final package.  Both the White House and lawmakers support an additional $1.5 billion to improve state and local balloting operations, and one option -- raised by Mr. Hastert with Mr. Cheney -- would be for the White House to adjust its caps accordingly. In the case of education, the White House is objecting to Republicans already circumventing the limits set by Mr. [Bush], by adding $3.7 billion for the 2003-2004 school year -- but counting the money as an advance appropriation outside the 2003 caps.  Mr. [Mitchell Daniels Jr.]'s office insisted his position is "completely in line" with his past views, and pointed to a letter in June on the question of drought assistance. But 10 days ago, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said the Senate financing "appears to meet the administration's objectives in this regard." And the White House raised no specific objections Jan. 17 in a detailed statement on the underlying budget bill that includes the disaster aid.
