 Separating Welfare Fact From Fiction   By By William O'Hare, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1987  No topic is more complex, confusing and misunderstood than our welfare programs and the people who use them. The reason is simple. The U.S. welfare system is a chaotic collection of more than 100 programs that has evolved in a haphazard, piecemeal fashion and left us with a set of complicated and often counterproductive eligibility standards, benefit levels and responsibilities.  A large share of the people in poverty do not receive welfare benefits. Only about 60% of the poor received any welfare benefits in recent years, and only about a third received cash welfare payments.  One of the most obvious reasons for this is the fact that the government official poverty index is seldom used to determine eligibility for welfare programs. Of the 59 largest welfare programs, only seven use the poverty level to determine eligibility. None of the four largest welfare programs (Medicaid, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, food stamps and Supplemental Security Income), which account for 60% of all welfare spending, use the poverty level to determine eligibility.
