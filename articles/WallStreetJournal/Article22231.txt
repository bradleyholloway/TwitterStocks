 Business Brief: Reno Air To Cut Growth in 1997 To Boost Profits   By By Scott McCartney, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1996  Reno Air, one of the few start-up carriers to post a profit in the third quarter, plans to cut growth drastically in 1997 to avoid overexpansion, boost profitability and ride out increased fuel costs, Robert Reding, chief executive officer, said.  This time, Reno is making a less-dramatic incursion into Northwest's territory, offering one red-eye flight to Detroit a day. Under different management, the carrier launched three flights a day to Minneapolis in 1992. Northwest responded with a blitz that forced a Reno retreat and received a warning from Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. "We do not want to get into a major confrontation with Northwest again," Mr. Reding said.
