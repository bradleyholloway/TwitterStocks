 EC Authorizes France to Give Funds to Airline --- Plan for $368 Million in Aid Is Criticized by Analysts, Air France's Competitors   By By Martin du Bois and Brain Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1991  STRASBOURG, France -- The European Community Commission authorized the French government to inject two billion French francs ($368 million) into Air France.  Analysts viewed the decision, which was opposed by EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, as a signal of the commission's willingness to let EC governments bail out troubled airlines. According to people familiar with the commission, several other state-owned European carriers -- such as Spain's Iberia, Greece's Olympic Airways, TAP Air Portugal and Belgium's Sabena -- recently have applied to receive government funds. Air France itself is asking Paris for an additional one billion francs in fresh cash from state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris.
