 A Clear-Cut Case Spurs Debate About Tribal Land Practices --- Tatitleks Cashed In on Timber, But Some Now Lament A Wilderness of Stumps   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  Just to the east, the vista is impressive for other reasons. A larger bay is ringed with broad splotches of ugly clear-cuts. The Tatitlek tribe sold the timber rights here in 1986, and heavy logging in the years since has left scars that environmentalists say will take far longer to heal than any left by the infamous spill itself.  Since the 1980s, scientists estimate as much as 400,000 acres of virgin forest on Alaskan native lands -- an area about half the size of Rhode Island -- have been clearcut. The logging was fueled by partnerships between two-dozen for-profit Alaska Native American corporations eager to convert some of their natural resources into cash and timber companies seeking refuge from tightened restrictions on federal land.  The logging generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the timber companies and the tribes. The tribes often sold their timber rights at prices below market value to generate lucrative tax benefits, which they in turn peddled to corporations looking to trim their tax bills. But the resulting wilderness of stumps has angered many local residents and raised questions about tribal stewardship of ancestral lands.
