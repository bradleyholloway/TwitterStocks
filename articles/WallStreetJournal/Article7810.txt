 AT&T to Revamp Consumer Credit Management Sites   By By Janet Guyon, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1988  As part of continuing cost-cutting, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. told employees it plans to reorganize its five consumer credit management centers in next year's first quarter.  A spokesman said it is "too early to speculate" whether the reorganization, details of which will be announced in mid-November, will involve closings of centers or layoffs of the group's 925 employees. The centers currently answer inquiries from consumers about their bills for AT&T phones and long-distance service. Centers are located in Bloomington, Minn.; Providence, R.I.; Charleston, W.Va.; Atlanta; and Salt Lake City.
