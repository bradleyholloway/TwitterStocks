 U.S. Is Seeking to Extend Cargo Security   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2002  The approach represents a sharp departure from current cargo-security methods, under which screening and inspection take place when the cargo reaches the U.S. Particularly vulnerable are the 17 million containerized shipments that pass through U.S. ports each year, because only a small percentage -- about 2%, by some estimates -- are physically inspected.  Robert Bonner, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, says he is working with the Canadian government to screen cargo as it passes through Canadian ports to the U.S., and he is considering ways to collaborate with other U.S. trading partners on cargo security.  The U.S. has been able to protect its shores from other threats. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 required double hulls on tankers coming to the U.S. and insurance coverage in the event of an oil spill.
