 True Mystery: Who Sold Famous Batch Of Vintage Comics?; Ahead of Auction, Son Finds Big Hole in Dad's Trove; A Determined Paper Boy   By Silverman, Rachel Emma, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2006  How hundreds of the books ended up on the market in the early 1990s remained a mystery. "I felt gut-punched," says [Tom Crippen], when the auction company told him that many of his father's books had previously been sold. Although nobody knows the precise value of the original D books when they hit the market, they are estimated to be worth at least $1 million at today's prices. "How would you feel if your family's property turned out to have gone missing a few years ago and you had no idea? Or that millions of dollars belonging to your family had gone for a walk?"  Some collectors have speculated that [Davis Crippen] himself sold the comics and pocketed the income, without telling the rest of the family. Mrs. Crippen and her two sons say it's highly unlikely he sold or gave away the books. For one thing, Mr. Crippen was a hoarder, amassing piles of books, record albums, mugs and even opera programs with ticket stubs stapled to them. "He held onto everything and anything," says Mrs. Crippen. The Crippens also went through Davis's old tax returns and didn't see any sudden influx of income.  "He clearly was able to go back many times and get books," says Mr. [Stephen Fishler]. "I get a sense if something's questionable," he adds, but he had no reason to doubt the man's story, so he bought the books. Mr. Fishler recently told Alex Crippen the seller's name: Eric Kechejian.
