 Court Backs Unit Of GE in IRS Case Over Tax Shelters   By Weil, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  The case centered on GE's 1993 creation of the subsidiary, to which GE had transferred a number of aircraft along with $246 million in cash. At the time, GE was looking to reduce its risk in the aircraft- leasing business. It sold interests in the subsidiary to two Dutch banks for $117.5 million. For tax purposes, nearly all the subsidiary's income was allocated to the Dutch banks, allowing GE to avoid a large tax bill. The Dutch banks didn't pay U.S. income taxes.
