 Reagan Task Force on Market Crash to Recommend Limits on Daily Price Moves, Stricter Margin Rules --- Regulatory Plan Expected To Provide a Protest By Securities Industry   By By Alan Murray and Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1988  The presidential task force on October's stock-market crash will recommend a radical overhaul of the government's regulation of all financial markets, including daily limits on price movements in stocks and bonds and stricter margin requirements.  The task force made three major recommendations to address the potential for problems like those that arose during the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, which swept across the boundaries of the stock and futures markets. They are:  -- Setting daily limits on price movements in all types of securities, and a plan to halt trading across markets whenever those limits are reached in any market.
