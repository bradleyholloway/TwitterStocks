 Young & Rubicam Ends Drought, Winning Sears's Apparel Account   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1993  WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather had served the entire Sears account until the Chicago-based retailer -- at Ogilvy's suggestion -- decided to create a separate effort for its apparel business. Then Ogilvy was dismissed from the Sears review in April. Now Young & Rubicam gains a foothold in a massive account, worth about $200 million in advertising over all.  But John H. Costello, senior executive vice president and general manager of marketing at the Sears Merchandise Group unit, said in an interview he doesn't anticipate any further changes among Sears ad agencies. Ogilvy & Mather will remain the agency for Sears automotive and home accounts.  Now that Young & Rubicam won the coveted account, its challenge is just beginning. The closely held shop, with annual billings of $7.9 billion, must mold a new image for Sears as a major retailer of men's, women's and children's apparel. Many think of Sears as a place to shop for appliances and tires, not snazzy shirts and dresses. Yet apparel comprised 26% of Sears's $25.4 billion in revenue last year.
