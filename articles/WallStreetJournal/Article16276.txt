 Another Hussein-Regime Official May Turn Himself In to the U.S.   By By Jeffrey Zaslow and Christopher Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  There is no independent confirmation of talks regarding Mr. [Saddam Hussein]'s sons, but if true, it would mean that the two survived U.S. attacks and are hiding in Iraq. Though there have been reports of their flight as they moved around Iraq after the U.S. invasion, U.S. officials say they haven't been able to confirm that either of them is alive.  The American citizen is handling negotiations from his home in the U.S. He helped negotiate the surrender of Mr. Aziz, who is a family friend, by talking to him via a satellite telephone, while keeping in touch with U.S. officials. When a deal was struck, U.S. officials were directed to Mr. Aziz's location.
