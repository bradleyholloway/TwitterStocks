 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus -- Reviving Judaism: Consultant-Speak Goes Religious   By Naomi Schaefer Riley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2007  What does that mean? Instead of attending a traditional service, Rabbi Hayim Herring, Star's executive director, tells me, some people would do "Medi-Torah" or "Torah and Yoga." Others might attend a lecture or go to a musical service followed by a "latte cart." And still others might prefer to attend a Friday night wine-and-cheese reception.  As it happens, the Samuel Bronfman Foundation, whose mission is "to inspire a renaissance of Jewish life," gives money to the Synaplex project. Adam Bronfman, the foundation's managing director, tells me that "each individual accesses meaning differently." He himself was "born a Jew and decided to live a Jewish life," he says, and he wants "others to access that if that's what they choose."  This way of thinking is making its way onto college campuses, too, where Jewish leaders hope to persuade students to remain Jews and not drift into the surrounding secular culture. Wayne Firestone, the president of Hillel, the Foundation for Campus Jewish Life, says that the "millennials," the members of today's college generation, have "many different options" on campus. Their identity is "similar to a Windows operating system," with many programs running at once. The Jewish "program," in other words, has lots of competition.
