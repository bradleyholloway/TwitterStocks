 President Sarkozy   The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2007  Europe and the U.S. have a lot riding on the new President's success.

Mr. Sarkozy, a vocal anti-anti- American, brings the promise of closer trans-Atlantic links. Speaking to Americans in his victory speech last night, he declared, "You can count on our friendship." It was an unusual statement for a French victor.
