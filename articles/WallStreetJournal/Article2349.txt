 Pressure on EC Panel Grows to Improve Joint-Venture Policy After Shift on P&G   By By Martin du Bois and Bob Hagerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1992  When P&G agreed to set up the venture to make disposable diapers with Finaf S.p.A. of Italy in September 1990, the U.S. consumer-products concern quickly notified the EC commission. After a year of haggling, P&G changed some of the terms to resolve the EC's competition concerns.  In January 1992, the commission published a legal notice saying it intended to approve the deal. On April 2, however, the commission changed its mind, announcing that the joint venture violates Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. After 17 months, P&G still doesn't know where it stands -- and there's still no deadline for a final decision.  Despite such protests, several key officials in the commission's secretive competition department -- known as Directorate General 4 -- express strong resistance to change. While acknowledging that the current system "doesn't provide total legal security," one senior EC official rules out a far-reaching reform for fear that EC governments would use the occasion to take back enforcement powers from the commission. Those powers are based on a 1962 EC rule, which the official -- who declined to be identified -- decribes as "a sacred cow we won't even touch."
