 Vermont American To Acquire Clairson In $40.5 Million Plan   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1989  LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Vermont American Corp. said it agreed to acquire Clairson International Corp., a maker of storage shelves and related products, for an indicated $40.5 million.  Vermont American, which makes tools and lawn and garden products, said the acquisition calls for payment of $8 a common share for Clairson stock that isn't held by Clairson's two top officers.  Vermont American's offer topped by $1 a share an earlier bid for Clairson from Newell Co., of Freeport, Ill. Clairson had rejected that bid and extended until July 20 an option to Vermont American to make an offer to acquire the company.
