 GAO Says TVA Doesn't Deserve Stellar Ratings   By By Will Pinkston, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2001  TVA is the only electric utility covered by the agencies to boast a superior mark, according to the GAO. Most of the 119 utilities covered by Moody's garner a single-A rating, the GAO adds, two notches below TVA. As a result of their lower ratings, these utilities shoulder higher interest costs on their debt.  The GAO's new bond-rating examination follows a similar release by the congressional watchdog arm in late February that found TVA's financial condition, though improving, "compares unfavorably" to investor-owned utilities. According to the GAO, the nation's largest government producer of power sets aside 25 cents for every dollar of revenue to pay down its debt, roughly two-and-a-half times more than its investor-owned rivals. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who sought the GAO reports, has called for an audit into TVA's wholesale power prices, which are tied to its debt.
