 Nasdaq Agrees to Adopt Auction System To Trade Its Shares and NYSE Issues   By By Greg Ip and Terzah Ewing, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1999  The Nasdaq Stock Market took a competitive swipe at the New York Stock Exchange, announcing an agreement to adopt an electronic auction-market system to trade both its and its rival's issues.  When an order is entered in Primex, participants compete for it by trying to better the best bid or offer then prevailing in the country. This "auction" process is the heart of the Big Board, but there, only floor brokers and specialists compete in the auction. Primex promises to allow any participant in the country to compete.  Bernard Madoff said in an interview that he had talked to both Nasdaq and NYSE officials about adopting Primex. "We chose Nasdaq because it . . . . would include all the Nasdaq and New York securities, and we also felt the technology fits in better with Nasdaq," he said.
