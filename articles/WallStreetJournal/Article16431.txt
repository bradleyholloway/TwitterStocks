 Treasury Sticks to Plan On 10-Year Note Sales; Reopening Policy Is Kept Despite Improving Outlook On Federal Budget Deficit   By Deborah Lagomarsino and Campion Walsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2004  "Treasury will maintain its 10-year note reopening policy," Timothy Bitsberger, acting assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets, said at the Treasury's quarterly refunding. "We have examined the continuing need for large liquid issuance of our securities and believe that this need can best be met, given our projected borrowing requirements, with our existing issuance patterns."  Treasury officials made clear that their strategy is to cut auction sizes to accommodate the expected reduction in borrowing needs rather than tinker with the auction calendar, analysts said. "What the Treasury is trying to accomplish is to maintain the maximum amount of flexibility they can in the auction process, while at the same time responding to the improving budget situation," said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers.  Members of the Treasury's private-sector advisory panel agreed that no major issuance changes were needed now and that the Treasury could cut coupon sizes to accommodate lower financing needs. If the outlook for the budget deficit keeps improving, the Treasury could consider other changes, such as canceling the 10-year reopening policy.
