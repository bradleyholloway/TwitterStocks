 Real-Estate Woes Hurt Matsushita Holder   By By Peter Landers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2001  For the past 18 years, Matsushita Investment has been led by Tsuneo Sekine, the son-in-law of Masaharu Matsushita, the 88-year-old honorary chairman of Matsushita Electric. Last week, however, Matsushita Investment brought in Toru Doi, a 39-year veteran of Matsushita Electric and its mobile-communications subsidiary, as president to succeed Mr. Sekine. In addition, Matsushita Investment has hired a former member of the board of Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Keumaru Ogura, to serve as senior managing director. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, the successor to Sumitomo Bank after a merger, is the third-largest shareholder in Matsushita Investment.
