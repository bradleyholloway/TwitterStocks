 The Part-Time Entrepreneur: Want to Be a Success? Try Opening Only Twice a Week --- Some Small-Business Owners Find Limited Hours Can Be Just the Ticket   By By Barbara Marsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1994  Saturday Audio Exchange here is open Thursday night as well as all day Saturday, a total of 10 1/2 hours a week. "Retail as a hobby is a scream," Mr. Zimmerman says. "I am a guy who broke the rule that you are supposed to be open 50 hours a week for your customers," adds the 42-year-old retailer, whose main job is managing an unrelated family business.  The store succeeds because Mr. Zimmerman gears every aspect of his business to its restricted hours, retailing consultants say. Customers tolerate the store's odd schedule because he offers an unusually broad selection of bargains on new, used and discontinued stereos. He also specializes in sales and service of record turntables, a vanishing specialty.  But most stores with limited hours haven't been raging successes. Some that initially did well by handling closeout merchandise later lost their edge. They grew too big for closeout suppliers and were forced to stock more common items. Other part-time merchants lost customers to rivals that extended their hours, sometimes to 24 hours a day. "Customers now shop in a burst of time, and you don't know when that burst will be," says Neil Stern, a partner at McMillan/Doolittle, a Chicago retail-consulting firm.
