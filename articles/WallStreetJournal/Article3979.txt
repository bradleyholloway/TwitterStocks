 Trends (A Special Report): Steel; Putting the Pedal to the Metal   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2005  Labor costs are also being squeezed, both in developed and developing markets, as companies find new production methods that allow fewer workers to make steel and other metals more safely and efficiently. Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. and Korea's Posco are among those investing large amounts of capital in new technologies and processes to cut costs. "You must keep costs down always," says Nippon Steel's CEO, Akio Mimura. "Otherwise, you can never survive."  Some analysts disagree, suggesting that because most of the growth in demand for steel and other metals in China is centered in cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, it is bound to peter out sooner than many people expect. "When you say China has 1.3 billion people, you should disregard the first billion of those people, because they don't have any money," says Charles Bradford, a New York-based steel analyst with Bradford Research/Soleil Securities. "They are subsistence farmers." He expects rural areas of China to stay poor.  The image of steel and other metals also is getting a boost in the culture at large, as stainless steel and other metals increasingly are being used in theater, art exhibits and dramatic architecture, from "The Bean" sculpture in Chicago's Millennium Park to the Attack Theatre in Pittsburgh's recent production of "Games of Steel," which incorporated metal into a modern-dance routine.
