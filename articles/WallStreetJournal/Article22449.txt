 Backstage at the Opera   By By Erich Eichman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1998  Those who really know opera will tell you that, for all the passion, betrayal, comedy and histrionics that display themselves on-stage every night in opera houses all over the world, it is the scene backstage that has the real dramatic interest. Most of us get only an intimation of this -- when a diva cancels a big performance or a backstage spat leads to a spectacular falling out and the newspapers give the whole kerfuffle front-page treatment the next day. Otherwise we are content to believe that opera is merely a magnificent art form -- and not also (as it is) a way of life.  Manuela Hoelterhoff had the idea of spending some time with one of opera's greatest stars, Cecilia Bartoli, and getting to know her family and friends and the whole cast of busy people who hover around a sensational voice between performances. In "Cinderella & Company" (Knopf, 259 pages, $25), she follows Ms. Bartoli from Houston, where the mezzo performed her signature role in "La Cenerentola" in October 1995, to Rome, where she lives, across Europe, and finally to New York, where Ms. Bartoli triumphs in the Metropolitan Opera's own production of the Rossini opera two years later. Along the way, Ms. Hoelterhoff introduces us to a host of other star voices in today's opera world, both on-stage and off, and to the managers and impresarios who work the complicated machinery behind the scenes. It is, in many ways, an unscripted opera buffa of last-minute cancellations, feuding phone calls, deal-making brinkmanship -- and dedication, hard work and splendid art.
