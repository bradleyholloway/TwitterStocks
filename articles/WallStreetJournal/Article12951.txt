 Weakened by SARS but Not Defeated   By Phillips, Barbara D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2003  The picture-postcard-pretty town, a short distance from Niagara Falls and Buffalo, has had not a single case of the virus, but such is the power of fear that its Shaw Festival, which began its 42nd season this April and runs until Nov. 30, has seen ticket sales decline 15%, or about $788,000 (all figures have been converted to U.S. dollars), over this period last year. This at a theater festival that derives 77% of its revenue from ticket sales to its 11 plays, which this year include George Bernard Shaw's "Misalliance" and "Widowers' Houses," Betty Comden and Adolph Green's "On the Twentieth Century," Sean O'Casey's "The Plough and the Stars" and Brian Friel's "Afterplay."  Odette Yasbeck, Shaw's public relations director, said in a phone interview: "The city of Toronto, the province of Ontario and the rest of the country were seemingly all placing ads. We at the little Shaw Festival had to look at what to do to increase awareness of our offerings. So we created these mobile box offices to take our message directly to our key markets." After mentioning overall sales in the past few weeks that have "ebbed and flowed," Ms. Yasbeck put a positive spin on the results so far. In New York City, where the Shaw Festival is not well known to the average theatergoer, "we didn't sell tickets, per se, but we did see a lot of interest in our brochures and other materials," she noted. "The message is getting out. And closer to home, our plan seems to be working quite well. Not only are people buying tickets from the vans but mentioning the visits when they place orders by phone."
