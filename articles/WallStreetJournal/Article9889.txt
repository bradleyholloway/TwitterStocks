 Rockwell Firms to Sell R&D Unit   By Dennis K. Berman and J. Lynn Lunsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2006  Rockwell Scientific has been a stepchild since 2001, when Rockwell Collins was spun off from Rockwell Automation. The spinoff left Rockwell Scientific owned equally by both Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins. Since then, both companies have become more reliant on their own in-house research and development teams to develop their core products. Rockwell Collins is one of the top suppliers of radio and navigation equipment for both commercial and military aerospace. Rockwell Automation makes power, control and information systems used widely in manufacturing.
