 Shoot First, Talk Later: A Mideast Strategy   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2006  It's time to rename the Council on Foreign Relations as the Council on Foolish Relations. Mr. [Leslie Gelb] lauds the prior administration's arranging a cease-fire in Lebanon through Syria while neglecting to mention that it came at the cost of a Syrian occupation as well as an unprecedented buildup in the military capability of Hezbollah. He then urges "wide-ranging talks with Syria and Iran, and if necessary, indirectly with Hamas and Hezbollah." While acknowledging these parties as "untrustworthy," he gives no indication of how to negotiate with parties who have the will to destroy themselves while doing the same to Israel and Western civilization in general. As for Iran and "how they might envision evolving good relations with the West" it is a fantasy that the current regime would perceive this as anything but another sign of weakness. The only way to defeat a culture of death is to give them just that.
