 Defaults Take a Toll on Fannie Mae   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  For the first nine months, Fannie's net was $1.51 billion, or $1.17 a share, down from $3.46 billion, or $3.16 a share, a year earlier. The company, chartered by Congress in 1938 to help ensure a steady flow of funding for home mortgages, reported results for the first three quarters simultaneously. With Friday's report, Fannie returned to timely reporting of quarterly results. Reporting had been disrupted by a 2004 accounting scandal that forced Fannie to overhaul its procedures.  Fannie also had losses on its holdings of $76.2 billion of AAA-rated securities created by Wall Street firms and backed by subprime and Alt-A loans, a category between prime and subprime. The company recorded $400 million of losses on the portion of those securities held in its "trading" account and unrealized losses of $900 million on the rest of the subprime and Alt-A holdings, classified as "available for sale." The company said it hasn't written down those "available for sale" because it expects to hold them until the value recovers or the securities mature.
