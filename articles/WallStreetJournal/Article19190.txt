 Several Retailers May Just Cash In On Fall's Back-to-School Season   By By Brenda L. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1999  Many retail stocks have shown strong recovery since a downturn late last year, but some have the potential to stretch their gains, says a trio of analysts. Among their picks from California: Hot Topic, of City of Industry; Anaheim's Pacific Sunwear of California; and Vans, Santa Fe Springs. Some others, the analysts say, are in wait-and-see modes. Among those on their "hold" lists: Burlingame's Gymboree and K-Swiss, of Westlake Village.  Even with those caveats, Ms. [Janet] Kloppenburg and others find reason to be optimistic about the shopping season. "Companies have significant differences from one another," she says. "You can't walk down the mall anymore and say all the stores look alike."  This apparel and accessories chain, whose styles are inspired by popular music trends and artists, makes the "buy" lists of both Ms. Kloppenburg and Ms. [Kindra] Hix.
