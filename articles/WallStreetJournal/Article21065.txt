 Lending Imbroglio: Worries Deepen Again On Third World Debt As Brazil Stops Paying --- Many U.S. Banks Are Balking At New 'Restructurings,' But Politics May Prevail --- Impact on the Lenders' Profits   By By Charles F. McCoy and Peter Truell, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1987  A temblor was recorded in Brazil a week and a half ago, when it announced it was suspending payments on about $67 billion of foreign debt and freezing about $15 billion of short-term credits and money-market deposits lent by foreign banks.  Like other Third World nations, from Ecuador and Argentina to the Philippines, Brazil hopes to win a "restructuring" of its debt and possibly get new financing as well. That, for example, was what Mexico was able to negotiate last fall, in a deal expected to be concluded later this month. But unlike the other debtors, Brazil wants to negotiate directly with creditor nations' governments to resolve its debt problems.  But this time Mr. Volcker may be losing some of his tight control of the situation. Deep schisms have developed among creditors. New York's Citicorp has differed with other big money-center banks, insisting that the terms in restructurings be as strict as possible. More and more regional banks are refusing to lend money to sickly debtors and are arguing that the debt crisis can't be solved without write-downs and other actions.
