 Enron Accountants May Be Placed On Leave by Board   By By Rebecca Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2002  The men, Chief Accounting Officer Richard A. Causey and Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy, reviewed Enron's creation of several outside partnerships run by Enron officers and, records indicate, judged them beneficial to Enron. They also reviewed subsequent transactions with those entities. Recent disclosures that these partnerships greatly enriched a handful of Enron employees at Enron's expense contributed to the Houston energy concern's collapse into bankruptcy proceedings in December.  Before joining Enron in early 1991, Mr. Causey was an accountant for Arthur Andersen in Houston and had "primary responsibility for the Enron engagement," according to his company biography. Mr. Buy, before joining Enron in 1994, was a vice president at Bankers Trust, assigned to energy lending and trading in Houston and New York.  All told, the [Andrew Fastow]-related partnerships engaged in more than two dozen transactions with Enron that left the company, in many cases, holding the bag. The Enron special committee, in its report, which was released during the weekend, said that in some cases Enron settled some of its partnership ventures for far less money than what the committee felt was fair value. This suggests that the interests of the officer-controlled partnerships may have been put ahead of those of Enron.
