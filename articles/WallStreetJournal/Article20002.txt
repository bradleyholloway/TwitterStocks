 Politics & Economics: World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2006  The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, called Serbia's handling of the case "unprofessional" and accused authorities of misleading her on their progress in capturing Gen. [Ratko Mladic], one of the top war-crimes suspects from the Balkan wars of the 1990s.  The suspension of the talks, aimed at eventual EU membership for Serbia, triggered immediate political turmoil in Belgrade, where a shaky minority government has been one reason for authorities' reluctance to arrest Gen. Mladic. Serbia's deputy prime minister, Miroljub Labus, who was in charge of negotiating closer links with the EU, resigned to protest what he said was his nation's recklessness with its people's future.  The commission would set up a voluntary registration system for lobbyists and publish a code of conduct. "Let's clarify this landscape, let's have rules, let's have good behavior and also some register which gives benefits to those who are acting in accordance with these rules," said EU Commissioner Siim Kallas, who is responsible for fighting fraud.
