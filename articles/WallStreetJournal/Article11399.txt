 Nynex Documents Released by Officials In New York State --- Company Labeled Papers `Trade Secret' Material To Keep From Public   By By Mary Lu Carnevale, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1990  New York state regulators released documents that a Nynex Corp. unit had labeled "trade secret information" and fought to keep out of public view.  The documents, which came to light as part of a $1.4 billion rate case in New York state, also include a list of nine Nynex employees who attended the bawdy gatherings in Florida, nicknamed "pervert conventions" by participants.  The gatherings began before the Bell System breakup as private parties, but they evolved into organized gatherings of 40 or 50 attendees -- complete with guest lists and rooming assignments. All but a few attendees were either employees of Nynex -- mostly managers in its Materiel Enterprises unit -- or employees of suppliers, a combination that raised serious conflict-of-interest concerns.
