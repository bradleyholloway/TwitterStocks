 Sysco Is Pulled Into the Shadow Over Food Firms   By By Ken Brown and Jesse Eisinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2003  Among his concerns: The restaurant business is hurting from the economic slowdown, particularly the small restaurants that make up 56% of Sysco's sales and are its most profitable customer segment. Second, the price of Sysco's products is falling, which hurts the company's profit margins. Finally, the company's current quarter is the last one in which Sysco gets the benefit of a sales boost from its biggest recent acquisition, Canadian food distributor Serca Foodservice.  Meanwhile, the company reported $456.5 million in cash flow from operations, up 26% from the $361.6 million in the year-earlier six months. But the cash flow benefited from money that Sysco eventually will have to give to the government. To explain: In the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2001, Sysco formally set up what it terms a "co-operative" to centralize purchasing from vendors. This entity allows Sysco to defer income taxes for 18 months, according to J.P. Morgan. In the six months ended this past December, Sysco deferred $217 million, amounting to 96% of its income taxes in the period.  The big issue facing Sysco's rivals is the way they have booked rebate revenue from food makers. Sysco hasn't been accused of improperly booking this cash, but given the concerns in the industry, investors are trying to find out how big the vendor rebates are at grocery chains and food distributors. In the case of Sysco, the size of the tax deferral opens a window onto this area of vague disclosure.
