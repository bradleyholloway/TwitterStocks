 Vivendi Board Clears Bid for Cegetel --- Move Quashes Rival Effort By Vodafone for Control Of Profitable French Telecom   By By John Carreyrou, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2002  In the short term, Mr. [Jean-Rene Fourtou] made it clear his goal is to get access to Cegetel's cash. As it stands now, Vivendi can't tap any of the telecom unit's profits. However, by raising its stake above 50%, it will be able to force Cegetel to pay dividends. For 2002, Cegetel is expected to generate net cash flow of 1.3 billion euros, much of which can be earmarked for dividend payments.  Not all of the dividend proceeds will go to Vivendi, however. Of the 4 billion euros it needs to buy BT's stake in Cegetel, the cash-strapped conglomerate has had to borrow 1.3 billion euros from several banks. As a result, Vivendi will have to share its portion of the dividend proceeds with those lenders. The rest of the dividends will go to Vodafone, which still plans to complete its purchase of the 15% stake in Cegetel held by SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio.  Once Vivendi has bought BT's stake and Vodafone has bought SBC's shareholding, Vivendi will own 70% of Cegetel and Vodafone 30%. But the ownership breakdown of the crown jewel, SFR, of which Cegetel owns only 80%, will be more even: Vivendi will own 56% of SFR, while Vodafone will own 44%. The two sides are expected to rapidly negotiate a shareholder agreement.
