 Teamsters Take Control Of Fractious Wash. Local   By By Elisa Schement and Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1999  The discord prompted John Carter, principal of embattled Local 556, to ask the Teamsters' general president, James P. Hoffa, to place the local into temporary trusteeship. With members resigning, some workers allegedly antagonizing others in the plant and a petition circulating to decertify the union, Mr. Carter says, "I was not able to effectively lead this group anywhere."  State and national Teamsters officials say last week's trusteeship move was unavoidable. There is such dissent within the local that "it is to the point where the union has ceased to function," says Al Hobart, the principal of the local in nearby Yakima who helped negotiate the contract that sent workers back to production lines on July 9. Mr. Hobart was named trustee of Local 556 by Mr. Hoffa, who postponed Local 556 elections that had been set for October.  "They're trying to rob our union from us," says Maria Martinez, the chief shop steward inside the IBP plant and an outspoken leader of the dissident group. Ms. Martinez was slated to face off against Mr. Carter in the now-delayed fall elections, and was seen by some labor experts as having a fair shot at winning.
