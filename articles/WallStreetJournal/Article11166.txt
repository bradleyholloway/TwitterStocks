 U.S. Intelligence Officials Now Suspect PLO May Hold Some American Hostages   By By John Walcott, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1988  While the officials concede that clever disinformation could be throwing them off the track, they theorize from largely circumstantial evidence that the PLO may recently have taken custody of Mithileswhar Singh, the Indian educator who was released, and three Americans who were kidnapped with him on Jan. 24, 1987 by Iranian-backed Shiite terrorists in Beirut.  These officials, who asked that their names not be used, and a senior State Department official say the U.S. continues to believe Iran has influence over whoever is holding Mr. Singh's three companions, Americans Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner. Intelligence officials believe three other small terrorist cells, which are thought to be holding six more Americans, are more firmly allied with Iran.  U.S. officials base their theory that the PLO may currently control the hostages on a variety of signs. From the start, the kidnappings 21 months ago of Messrs. Polhill, Singh, Steen and Turner, all professors at Beirut University College, haven't fit the pattern of Iranian-sponsored terrorism in Lebanon, senior U.S. officials note. And four recent communiques from Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, the group claiming to hold the four, were strikingly different from hostage statements issued by Shiite fundamentalists.
