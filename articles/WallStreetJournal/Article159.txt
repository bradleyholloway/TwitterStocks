 Short Interest In OTC Stocks Declines 1% --- Drop Ends 7-Month Climb; Smallest-Stocks Total Was Up 6.1% in Month   By By Sara Calian, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1992  On the Nasdaq National Market System, where most of the biggest OTC issues trade, short interest declined 1.4% to 432.6 million shares from 438.8 million. That drop was partly offset by a rise in short-selling among the smallest stocks, which make up about one-third of the Nasdaq market. Short interest in these very small stocks rose 6.1% to 25.4 million shares.  Short sales are bets that a stock's price will fall. An investor sells borrowed shares, knowing that they must eventually be replaced for return to the lender. If the replacement shares cost less than those sold earlier, the short seller makes a profit. Short interest means the total amount of shares sold short at any point in time, in this case those reported as of Nov. 5 and settled as of Nov. 13.  Despite the negative sentiment suggested by heavy short selling, an increase in short interest is viewed by many large stock market watchers as potentially bullish, because shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying. And should the market or specific stocks turn upward, the short sellers fearing losses might rush to replace the shares they've borrowed -- causing "short-covering" that can add fuel to a pending rally.
