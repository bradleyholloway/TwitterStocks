 Nokia Enters Race For Communicator With a Weak Start   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2002  Finnish phone giant Nokia has just rolled out in the U.S. its $600 Nokia 9290, a combination cellphone, organizer, e-mail and Web device with a color screen and keyboard.  This design allows for a wider keyboard and screen than those on the Treo or RIM's BlackBerry, and that's the biggest advantage of the 9290. But the design also makes the new Nokia big and clunky by today's standards, and that's its biggest disadvantage. It's a fat, blocky affair with a slanted top edge that, on the whole, reminds me of Gumby, the old clay character from children's TV.  BUT THE NOKIA 9290 is riddled with limitations and compromises -- beyond its bulk -- that make it inferior to the less-expensive Treo, in my view. Like the Treo, it uses the GSM cellular system and is available in the U.S. over the VoiceStream network. But unlike the Treo, it can't be upgraded to the new, faster, data-friendly GPRS networks VoiceStream and others are rolling out. And unlike the Treo, the Nokia 9290, incredibly, can't be used in Europe.
