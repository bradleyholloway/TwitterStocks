 Politics & Economics: Jakarta Offers Financial Backing To Draw Public-Works Investors   By Wright, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2006  "The foundations for future projects are potentially there," says Karin Finkelston, associate director for East Asia at International Finance Corp., the World Bank arm for lending to the private sector. "The key now is how this is implemented."  At the conference -- where hundreds of domestic and foreign businessmen mixed with international donors and government officials -- Mr. [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono] appealed to foreign investors to help supply the $22 billion Indonesia says it needs to spend annually in the next few years to upgrade its infrastructure. "The government will provide only part of this funding," he said, "while the major portion will have to come from the private sector."  "The government has shown strong determination to move forward," says Muhammad Fadzil Abdul Hamid, business-development manager at Plus Expressways Bhd., a Malaysian toll-road operator, who attended the conference. "But we still need concrete evidence," he adds, that toll- road projects will proceed without legal wrangles involving land.
