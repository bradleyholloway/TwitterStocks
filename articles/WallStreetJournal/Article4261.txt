 REGIONS: Michigan May Quit the Cellar In One Business-Cost Ranking   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1987  BUSINESS-CLIMATE UPDATE: Michigan has been bedeviled for years by its reputation as an expensive state in which to do business, and a big factor has been the high cost of unemployment insurance to employers there. But take a glance over your shoulder, Michigan. A flock of states are gaining on you.  A good way to measure this employer cost is to look at the average amount of money employers are required to contribute to state and federal unemployment insurance trust funds. Although Michigan still leads the nation in this category, its tax burden dropped slightly last year. In 1986, Michigan's combined federal-state employer tax bite for unemployment insurance, averaged to a single worker, was $578.50, down from $587 a year earlier.  But while Michigan managed to trim its insurance tax cost 1%, next-door-neighbor Wisconsin saw its tax liability to employers jump 14% last year -- to an average $570.50 per worker from $502.50 a year earlier. That makes Wisconsin the second-most-expensive state in this business-cost ranking.
