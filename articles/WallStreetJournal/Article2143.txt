 Junk dealer : RTC unveils its S&L debris : bonds' $3.7 billion value has shrunk   By Anders, G; Duke, P, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 1990  The government agency said it holds 483 different issues of high-yield junk bonds, all acquired as part of its rescue operations for insolvent thrift institutions. These junk-bond holdings include some valued at just three cents on the dollar, as well as others valued at 80% to 90% of the initial issue price.  The RTC's largest three junk issues by face value are $75.5 million of Cooke Media Group bonds, $66.2 million of Integrated Resources Inc. bonds and $50.7 million of Busse Broadcasting bonds. Traders yesterday said that they hadn't any idea what the value of the rarely traded Cooke Media bonds might be, but that the Integrated bonds trade at three cents on the dollar, while the Busse bonds command all of 15 cents on the dollar.  "This is a smarter time for the RTC to be selling than six months ago," Robert Long, director of high-yield research at First Boston Corp., said. By his calculations, the total return on junk bonds, price changes plus interest, was a respectable 5.5% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, $7.5 billion of junk bonds have been retired this year by the corporations that initially issued them, while scarcely any new bonds have been issued. "The supply of junk bonds is shrinking by more than enough to offset any RTC selling," Mr. Long said.
