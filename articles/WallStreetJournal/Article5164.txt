 Jury selection process perverts true justice   By Seiffe, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1994  Roger Seiffe responds to the Sep 30, 1994 column "The Angry Juror," saying he must differ with Randall Kennedy's argument that "condemning jury nullification is, of course, the right response." Seiffe says that the current methods by which juries are selected and instructed pervert the fundamental requirement that juries not only pass on the guilt or innocence of the accused, but pass on the justice of the law in question.
