 Commodities Report: Cocoa Tumbles 10% on Selling By Speculators and Producers   By By Claire Grierson OsterDowJones Commodity News, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  Though cocoa futures have been traded since 1925, Guy Taylor, a spokesman for Nybot, said some historical price data on cocoa that was recorded on paper were lost when Nybot's former offices at the World Trade Center were destroyed in 2001. Its fully electronic databases weren't created until the late 1980s.  Yesterday, sentiment was damaged before the New York market opened by price declines on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Early losses there had caught many by surprise and were caused by the departures of what traders described as "stale longs." Long positions are purchases of futures made in anticipation of higher prices, but some long-position holders of cocoa got tired of waiting for fresh gains.  Ivory Coast has been ravaged by violent outbursts since an attempted coup d'etat in September. Fear of a disruption in cocoa supplies has driven cocoa prices higher. Despite the unrest, the arrival of cocoa at Ivorian ports has been on target.
