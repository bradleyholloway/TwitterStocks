 Rite Aid Chairman Defends President At Annual Meeting   By By Randolph B. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1989  HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Rite Aid Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Alex Grass, assured shareholders yesterday that President Martin L. Grass would be vindicated of a pending bribery charge, which the chairman dismissed as "outrageous" and "ludicrous."  Speaking at Rite Aid's annual meeting here, Alex Grass blamed the April 27 arrest of Martin Grass on the company's continuing regulatory problems with the Ohio Board of Pharmacy, which levied a $50,000 fine in January for violations at 69 Rite Aid stores.  "In our opinion, it {the criminal case} reflects an ongoing battle with the administrative staff of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy," said Alex Grass in his first opportunity to discuss the case with shareholders of the nation's largest drugstore chain. He also blasted the media for "sensationalizing" the case.
