 Pennzoil Takes Deep Write-Offs, Raises Dividend Sharply After Texaco Battle   By By Caleb Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1988  Pennzoil Co. took deep write-offs but sharply increased its dividend in a financial overhaul after the conclusion of its titanic legal battle with Texaco Inc.  The company also estimated that it faces an income tax liability of $912 million on the $3 billion legal settlement it received from Texaco in April. But company officials said they continue to expect deferring the tax liability by making an acquisition. The officials also ruled out Wall Street rumors that the company was preparing a big, one-time dividend payment to holders.  The disclosures came as Pennzoil reported second-quarter net income of $1.39 billion, or $34.68 a share, which included a $1.66 billion after-tax gain on the Texaco settlement as well as charges of $303 million, mostly from writing down the value of oil and gas holdings. A year earlier, the company earned $7.8 million, or nine cents a share.
