 Middle East Telecom Deal Hits $3.7 Billion   By Bryan-Low, Cassell, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2007  The move to acquire a 51% stake in National Mobile Telecommunications Co. KSC, which has assets across the Middle East and Africa, helps establish Qatar Telecom as a regional player. It is following in the footsteps of larger peers such as Egypt's Orascom Telecom Holding SAE and Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Co., which in recent years have expanded rapidly through acquisitions in the Middle East, Africa and beyond. On Friday, Orascom said it had made a bid for a stake in Brazilian phone company Brasil Telecom Participacoes SA.  Qtel currently has assets in Qatar and Oman. The deal will expand Qtel's presence into Algeria, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the Palestinian territories and the Maldives. It also boosts Qtel's client base to about 12 million from two million.
