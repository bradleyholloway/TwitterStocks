 Packwood Urges Delay in Indexing Of Tax Brackets   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1986  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood suggested to his conferees that indexing of tax brackets for inflation be suspended for one year to raise revenue to help the tax-overhaul effort.  The proposal, made late last night in a private session, is part of a larger offer suggested by the Oregon Republican to help bring together the House and Senate positions on tax overhaul. Senate conferees emerging from the closed-door session reacted positively to the suggestion, but they said they would meet again this morning before deciding whether to adopt it.  House conferees, however, are likely to reject the indexing delay because it would burden middle-income taxpayers. If additional revenue is needed, they instead would prefer an increase in tax rates from the Senate bill's to pay for added benefits lawmakers from both bodies want to retain. Senate conferees are working to prevent such a rise, contending that low rates are important to the measure.
