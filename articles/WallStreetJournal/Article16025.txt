 Japan's Economic Woes Fuel Turmoil Within the Ruling Party --- As Prime Minister Faces Confidence Vote, Signs Of a Leadership Gap   By By Peter Landers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  The confidence vote is spawning a strange political kabuki. Ruling-party leaders have said they will defend Mr. [Yoshiro Mori] in the vote but also are signaling they will soon try to dump him. The selection of Mr. Mori's successor -- if in fact the prime minister can be persuaded to step down -- would probably take several weeks. With elections for Parliament's upper house coming up in July, the new leader would face constraints in setting an economic-rescue agenda, such as having to consider any pain it could cause voters.  Amid the turmoil, Mr. Mori insists he doesn't plan to quit. In fact, he has put a reverse spin on Japan's economic woes, contending that this is no time for political wrangling. "Constantly debating about a change in government isn't an answer to the stock-price problem," Mr. Mori's top aide, chief cabinet secretary Yasuo Fukuda, said at a news conference Friday.  A vote for Mr. Mori "won't mean that Prime Minister Mori has gotten a stamp of approval," said Takenori Kanzaki, head of Komeito. Most observers still expect Mr. Mori ultimately will give in if party elders tell him he must go.
