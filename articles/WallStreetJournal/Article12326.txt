 U.K. Rate Boost to 7.5% Jolts Markets; Dollar Ends Off Against Mark and Yen   By By Kenji Hall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1998  An unlikely clutch of central banks rocked the foreign-exchange markets Thursday, temporarily boosting currencies from the pound to the rand.  But the Bank of England eclipsed all, surprising traders with its decision to raise official United Kingdom interest rates to 7.5%, from 7.25%. The rate rise was the sixth since Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party assumed the helm of the government in May 1997.  The unexpected move by the British central bank sent the pound sharply higher against the dollar and mark, as shellshocked traders scrambled to buy sterling. By the end of the day, however, the pound had given back most of its gains, after traders took stock of the rate increase's longer-term implications.
