 CIA Director May Join Powell At U.N. Speech --- White House Seeks to Quash Any Skepticism That U.S. Is Exaggerating Iraq's Role   By By Carla Anne Robbins and David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  Pressure on Mr. [Saddam Hussein], meantime, is building. U.S. officials confirmed yesterday that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak wrote to Mr. Hussein last week to urge him to comply with last fall's U.N. disarmament resolution. The letter told Mr. Hussein that he was facing his last chance to avoid military action by the U.S., officials said. One U.S. official said that Mr. Mubarak broached the idea of Mr. Hussein going into exile in the letter. But Mr. Hussein rejected Mr. Mubarak's overtures, the U.S. officials said.  The U.S. has asked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for limited military assistance in the case of war, mostly related to the territorial defense of Turkey, a NATO member. The country is likely to host some U.S. invasion forces, which could prompt Baghdad to retaliate against its northern neighbor with short-range missiles. To alert the Turks to any incoming threat, NATO is considering deploying its fleet of surveillance aircraft equipped with airborne warning and control systems, known as Awacs.
