 Burroughs Share Price Probably Will Decline If the Bid for Sperry Succeeds, Contrarians Say   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 1986  If Burroughs gets Sperry, Burroughs stock could be a good short sale, the contrarians say.  Michael Blumenthal, Burroughs's chairman, has said the merged companies could compete more effectively with industry leader International Business Machines. A bigger company with revenue of around $10 billion and operating profit of $1 billion, he said, would "remove the fear factor" from computer buyers who worry about Burroughs's and Sperry's prospects.  But the combined companies wouldn't be stronger, the bears say. Burroughs and Sperry have entirely different mainframe computer products and sales and service forces, which would retain their merits and drawbacks. Burroughs would pay about $4 billion in cash and securities for a company whose profitability has been as mediocre as its own. It would have to borrow even more if its offer for Sperry shares rises to $74 or $75 from the current $70, as many on Wall Street expect.
