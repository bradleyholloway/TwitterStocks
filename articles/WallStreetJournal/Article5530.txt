 College Football: Winners, Losers, Titles   By By Allen Barra and Allen St. John, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1997  Ohio State at Penn State tomorrow is the season's second-biggest game so far (after Florida-Tennessee Sept. 20, won by Florida, 33-20), with national-title ramifications in the balance. The Buckeyes (No. 4 in Max's rating) are outscoring opponents by 18.0 points a game, the Nittany Lions (No. 2) by 32.5. Max says Penn State has played weaker opponents, and on a neutral field the difference is a missed extra point. But the game is at Penn State, where the Lions have about a four-point advantage.
