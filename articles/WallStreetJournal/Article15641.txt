 Congo's Mining Moves Cast Pall On Future of Private Investment   By By Robert Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1998  The future of private investment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was thrown into doubt after an announcement by Congolese authorities Saturday that it would "re-examine" the terms of a second copper mining project.  Hard on the heels of its decision last week to cancel a mining deal with Arkansas-based American Mineral Fields Inc., Congo announced it would review the Tenke-Fungurume project headed by Canada's Tenke Mining Corp.  "When a deal is not a deal and a government starts pulling stunts like this, it's serious," said one senior investment banker in South Africa where many of the mining projects for Congo are financed. Since coming to power after the rebellion that toppled the regime of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last May, the government of President Laurent-Desire Kabila has called for private-sector investment to rebuild the country devastated by decades of misrule. Mining companies are seen as key since Congo possesses some of the world's greatest mineral riches.
