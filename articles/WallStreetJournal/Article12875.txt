 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review --- Do Annuities Belong in IRAs? --- Holding These Vehicles In Retirement Accounts Can Be Costly to Investors   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2003  Meanwhile, annuities typically carry far higher annual charges than ordinary mutual funds. While there are some low-cost exceptions such as TIAA-CREF annuities offered in retirement plans at many colleges and some school districts, U.S. stock portfolios held by variable-annuity holders have average annual charges of 2.22%, according to researcher Morningstar Inc., compared with average charges of 1.45% for U.S. stock mutual funds.  The NASD guidelines for annuities sellers say they should tell customers who invest through retirement plans the tax advantage of annuities is "unnecessary." Some American Express representatives failed to do that, the NASD said in the enforcement action. The self-regulatory body also said some of the company's representatives "failed to determine that [retirement plan] customers had a need for a benefit offered by a variable annuity, other than tax deferral."  If you are investing in an IRA, for instance, it is easy to "unravel" the annuity holding, says Robert Nestor, head of Vanguard Group's annuity-and-insurance-services unit. You simply choose an IRA investment, such as an IRA at a mutual-fund company, and fill out a form authorizing the new custodian to transfer over the funds from your existing IRA annuity. There is no tax due on earnings because the money is staying under the IRA umbrella. (Although Vanguard, the No. 2 fund company behind Fidelity Investments, sells variable annuities, it usually advises investors to not buy them for use in retirement plans.)
