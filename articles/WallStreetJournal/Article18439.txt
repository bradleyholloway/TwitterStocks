 Unlikely Sites: Why German Firms Choose the Carolinas To Build U.S. Plants --- Trained and Malleable Labor, Low Wages, Cheap Land Are All Big Attractions --- Cultures Do, However, Clash   By By Michael J. McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1993  Germans and Americans are trying to get used to each other all over the Carolinas. Baker is one of more than 200 German companies that have made the two states leading magnets for German industry. Together, North and South Carolina have attracted about $4 billion of the $42 billion German investment in the U.S.; that is second only to Texas, which attracts a huge share of overall foreign investment.  And with the German companies have come a lot of German managers. In fact, so many German speeders have been ticketed along one stretch of Interstate 85 that links the Carolinas that state troopers have nicknamed it "the Autobahn." Says Alan Schafer, who runs South of the Border, a fireworks bazaar in Dillon, S.C., "the place is crawling with Germans."  The newcomers have turned some economic-development axioms on their ear. The Carolinas haven't become an international transportation hub; but the Germans have been able to keep other costs, particularly labor, so low that they could afford to pay more for shipping. Never mind that the Carolinas lack the concentration of research universities that exists in New England and California; the Germans consider the Carolinas' top-notch trade schools more valuable than Harvard or Stanford. And German managers have found the laid-back Southern workers more malleable than some of the aggressive, unionized people up North.
