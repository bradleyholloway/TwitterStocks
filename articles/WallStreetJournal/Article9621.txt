 Phone-Service Bundles Could Backfire as Customers Switch   By Young, Shawn, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2003  "They give you the features you want and you can pay online, so why not?" says Mr. [Steve Jordan], who didn't care that IDT isn't as well-known as companies such as Verizon, AT&T or MCI, formerly called WorldCom Inc. As more companies use bundles to perk up sales and hang on to customers, consumers have an easier time figuring out their total telecom costs -- and hopping from one offer to another, since it involves switching just one account. That can lead to more price- cutting and more customer turnover, known in industry jargon as "churn." Furthermore, because of bundling, the local phone service that once tied consumers to their local provider, typically a regional Bell company, is increasingly a commodity, available at discounts from an array of suppliers. Analysts fear that a pending new rule that will allow customers to keep their phone numbers even if they switch between land-line and wireless service will greatly encourage churn.  "Down the road we really need to add those to the bundle," says Kevin Crull, senior vice president for marketing and sales at AT&T's consumer division. "When you get more of the pieces, you find you don't have to match penny for penny on every service."  "Price," says MCI's Mr. [Wayne Huyard], "is going to be the biggest element of most people's decision."
