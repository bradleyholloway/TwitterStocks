 Secretary Bennett Softens Earlier Image to Use His Post to Influence Nation's Education Agenda   By By Joe Davidson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1986  The hero's welcome, complete with band and chorus, is a far cry from the hostile receptions the controversial Mr. Bennett often sparked soon after taking his job in early 1985. Even his critics agree that he has changed an early image of a man who shoots from the lip, and that he is effectively using his post as a bully pulpit to influence the nation's education agenda. Lately, "his contribution has been more toward light than heat," says Anthony Podesta, president of People for the American Way, a civil liberties organization.  The blunt-speaking Mr. Bennett still stirs controversy. An example is his criticism of higher education, which Mr. Bennett believes needs "real, profound and much-needed reform." Recently, he said colleges raise tuition "because they can," but too often fail to offer students well-rounded educations. At a 350th birthday observance for Harvard University, he accused his alma mater of "a very high-minded negligence" toward students.  The Harvard remarks generated an angry outburst from Princeton University President William Bowen, who called Mr. Bennett "an embarrassment for American higher education." Mr. Bowen told the Daily Princetonian "it is regrettable that our government is personified" by Mr. Bennett. Harvard officials also protested. But even some academicians say Mr. Bennett is publicizing an issue of legitimate concern.
