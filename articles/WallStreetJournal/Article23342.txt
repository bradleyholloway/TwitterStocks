 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Academy Awards: The Fashion Oscars   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2006  That was the case with German fashion house Escada, which actress Kim Basinger chose to outfit her in 1998, the year she won an Oscar for 1997's "L.A. Confidential." Negotiations began with a call from the star's publicist, who said Ms. Basinger had admired an Escada gown on a cover of Vogue magazine and wondered if it could be recreated in black. "One of my assistants flew to L.A., via Paris" to meet with the actress, recalls Escada design director Brian Rennie. "She arrived in L.A. The dress did not. It was nervewracking."  The delay ended up being moot, however, when Ms. Basinger changed tack: Showing the Escada designers an old picture of the actress Grace Kelly, she asked if Escada could make a similar dress in black and white. Before the designers could get far with that plan, however, Ms. Basinger had reconsidered. "I ended up having to say to my head pattern maker, 'Do whatever she wants,' " says Mr. Rennie. After seven versions, he says, Escada finally hit pay dirt with the memorable green satin sleeveless gown Ms. Basinger wore. "They were literally sewing her into the dress in the limousine," he says. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Basinger says finishing touches were put on the dress the day of the ceremony, but she doesn't recall seeing a needle and thread in the car.)  When Michelle Pfeiffer was nominated for a best actress statuette for her performance in 1989's "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Armani executive Wanda McDaniel went to the actress's home in Santa Monica, Calif., to help her dress. That night Ms. Pfeiffer applied her own makeup and, lacking the right jewelry to wear with her Armani gown, even borrowed Ms. McDaniel's three-diamond wedding band. "She was blowing dry her hair herself, and I was yelling, 'Michelle, you're going to be late,' " Ms. McDaniel recalls.
