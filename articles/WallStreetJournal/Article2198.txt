 Direct Hit: By Performing in Gulf, Exotic Weapons Help Manufacturers as Well --- If Reviews Stay Good, Planes And Missiles May Acquire More Backing in Congress --- The Patriot's Comeback Story   By By Rick Wartzman and Bruce Ingersoll in Washington And Gary Putka in Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1991  In that instant, the Patriot went from an untested symbol of cost overruns and Pentagon waste that was nearly scrapped by Congress, to a heroic vindication of expensive high-tech weaponry. Yesterday, nine more Iraqi Scud missiles were shot down over Saudi Arabia by Patriots.  At General Dynamics Corp., the Pentagon's rave reviews of the Tomahawk have instilled the same sort of pride. "If you've got to go to war, you ought to do so with some bullets in your belt that can hit the target," says Brad Beaver, director of Tomahawk programs at the company's factory in San Diego, where the cruise missiles are assembled.  Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst for Kemper Securities Group, says missiles and bombs repeatedly employed by the Allies will have to be replaced. High on the list, he says, are Rockwell International Corp.'s GBU-15 and the Maverick, made by Raytheon and Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors Corp. The Tomahawk, built by General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas, is another likely winner. The Navy had planned to stop buying Tomahawks after 1992, but that could well change.
