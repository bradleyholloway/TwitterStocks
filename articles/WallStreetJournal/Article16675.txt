 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2006  Israel and Hezbollah gave no indication of flagging in delivery of ever-graver blows, and dozens more died. The deadliest incident was an Israeli missile strike on what Lebanon said was a produce plant near Syria, killing 28. Three Israelis died as nearly 200 rockets fell, some 50 miles inside. Three Israeli soldiers died in a grinding effort to push Hezbollah from border villages. Amid reports Iran was resupplying the Shiite militia, Israeli airstrikes dropped bridges on a highway to Syria, hitting targets even in Christian areas north of Beirut. Britain's Blair delayed vacation to work on a U.N. cease-fire draft.  Iraqi Shiites chanted "Death to Israel, death to America" at a big pro-Hezbollah Baghdad rally. Some were wounded in ambushes on buses passing through Sunni areas on the way home from the march. Violence elsewhere killed 40 Iraqis, including 10 at a soccer game, and two U.S. soldiers.
