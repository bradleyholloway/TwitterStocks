 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Giving Back   By Bernstein, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2005  HOW IT HAPPENED: Mr. [Art Modell], 79 years old, first became connected with the Johns Hopkins Heart Institute in 1996, after he moved his Cleveland Browns to Baltimore. A survivor of two heart attacks and a stroke, he had been involved with the Cleveland Clinic for more than 20 years, as a patient, trustee and president. Mr. Modell severed professional ties with the clinic after relocating his NFL team to Maryland. (He was so vilified in Cleveland after the move, the Cleveland Clinic removed a bas-relief of him that had been hanging in the atrium.) Mr. Modell then chose Johns Hopkins for his follow-up cardiac care. When he had chest pains while on vacation in California a few years ago, a cardiologist from the hospital flew out to bring him home. Mr. Modell, who dropped out of school at 15 to help support his family, made his fortune in TV and advertising. He says the $10 million donation is the single largest gift he's ever given.
