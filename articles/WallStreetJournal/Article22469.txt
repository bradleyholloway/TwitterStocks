 BMW's Rover Unit Gets New Chairman Amid Overhaul That Includes Cost Cuts   By By Brian Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1998  Rover Chairman Walter Hasselkus said at a news conference in London that he shouldered the blame for persistent losses at Rover, which BMW bought in 1994 and has struggled ever since to turn around. "When I look around, I look to myself," said Mr. Hasselkus, who became chairman of Rover, which is based in the United Kingdom, in 1996.  Mr. Hasselkus, 56 years old, will be succeeded by Werner Saemann, also 56, and, like Mr. Hasselkus, a longtime BMW executive. Mr. Saemann joined BMW in 1976 and, for the past six years, has been head of the German company's engine and chassis division. The company said Mr. Saemann was appointed to the BMW management board on Tuesday.  For BMW, the key to the deal with the unions is the introduction of flexible work arrangements that allow Rover to adjust its production schedule to meet changes in demand. BMW Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said that as a result of the deal, "we will be able to achieve our common aim of making Rover profitable again by the beginning of the next decade."
