 Lincoln National seeks bigger role in financial services   By Scism, Leslie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1997  Lincoln National Corp Chairman Ian M. Rolland wants to transform the big but obscure Ft Wayne IN-based company into one of the nation's premier sellers of life insurance, annuities, mutual funds and 401(k) plans. His efforts got a big boost on Jun 9, 1997 when Safeco Corp announced that it would pay $2.82 billion to acquire American States Financial Corp, which is 83%-owned by Lincoln National. Lincoln figures the deal will net it about $2.1 billion after taxes, the bulk of which will be used for acquisitions focused on financial services.
