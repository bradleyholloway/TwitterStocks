 The Great Ice Cream War   By By James Bovard, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1989  America was deluged by foreign ice cream last year: 576 gallons came in from New Zealand and 12 gallons from Denmark. In other words, foreigners "foisted" almost as much ice cream on "hapless" Americans as a large Safeway sells on a summer Saturday. Obviously, a crisis was imminent.  While many people relish American-made ice cream with deliberately foreign-sounding names, few people realize that the U.S. government restricts ice-cream imports to less than one-tenth of one percent of U.S. consumption. Jamaica, the Netherlands and Belgium are the only other countries allowed to sell ice cream to Americans, and with quotas so low and transportation costs high, they don't bother to ship us any ice cream at all.  The U.S. exports hundreds of thousands of gallons of ice cream to Canada, yet Canadian ice cream is banned from the U.S. Canada expressed its appreciation for this treatment last year by slapping a quota on U.S. ice-cream exports to Canada. (Dairy trade was exempted from last year's Free Trade Agreement.)
