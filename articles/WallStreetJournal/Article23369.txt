 PURSUITS -- Books: The Vatican's Architectural Epic; Building St. Peter's with Michelangelo and Bernini, popes and patience   By Rocca, Francis X, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  Ms. [Scotti] lucidly sketches out the major architectural challenges of the whole project -- above all, the building of a dome of unprecedented height -- but at the heart of her story are the extraordinary men who brought St. Peter's into being. Focusing on the relationships between the architects and their papal clients, the author renders miniature portraits of Raphael (the chief architect for six unproductive years) and his epicurean soul mate, Leo X; of Giacomo della Porta, the "unsung hero of St. Peter's," and the hard-driving Sixtus V, who made della Porta put up the dome in a mere 22 months; and of the "ebullient and worldly" [Gianlorenzo Bernini], who served as the basilica's chief architect for 51 years, more than half of them under the rule of two admiring pontiffs, Urban VIII and Alexander VII.
