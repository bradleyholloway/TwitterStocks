 The Euro Needs a Supply-Side Boost   By By David Roche, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  The euro tested new lows against the dollar Tuesday and Wednesday, sinking below 90 cents for the first time ever. Although many write off the 23% slide since the euro's launch in January 1999 as an example of the market's herd psychology, the fall is actually the result of a very reasonable perception that European governments are in denial about the new economy. However good the monetary policy of the European Central Bank, demand for euros isn't going to increase until Europe becomes a better place to do business. And for that to happen, Europeans are finally going to have to shrink the state.  At first glance, it looks as though the European state is shrinking. Government spending in Europe as a share of gross domestic product has fallen in the past five years. Government balances (excluding interest payments on past debt) have moved into surplus. Several governments, including those of France and Germany, have announced reductions in the direct tax burden on households and corporations, reducing the disincentive to work generated by high tax rates.  But once economic growth slows, things will look different. In real terms, government spending is rising throughout Europe, and so is state-sector employment. In large eurozone countries like France and Germany, government spending has risen nearly 200% in real terms since 1970. Government employment is up 50% in 30 years across continental Europe.
