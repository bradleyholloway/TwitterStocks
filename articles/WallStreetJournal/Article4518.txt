 Fusion Claim May Be Settled Soon by Test   By By Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1989  If tests find a relatively large amount of helium trapped inside the rods, that could verify the claims of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and his British colleague, Martin Fleischmann, that their battery-like device produces surplus heat by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at room temperatures. Helium can be produced by the fusing of two hydrogen atoms.  Helium's presence in the Utah experiment's palladium rods emerged as a major issue late Monday when Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann and nine other scientists presented results of their "cold fusion" experiments to more than 1,500 chemists who jammed a special night session on "cold fusion" at a meeting of the Electrochemical Society. A week earlier in Baltimore, physicists from leading U.S. government and university labs described how their experiments hadn't produced any excess heat and launched devastating attacks on the Utah experiments as faulty and lacking evidence of fusion.  During their formal presentation, Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann responded to several of the Baltimore criticisms and said one of their experiments has recently begun giving off excess heat in bursts lasting as long as two days. The heat produced during these unexpected bursts was 1,000 times to 5,000 times as much as could be produced by electrochemical reactions, they said, implying that the excess heat was coming from hydrogen fusion.
