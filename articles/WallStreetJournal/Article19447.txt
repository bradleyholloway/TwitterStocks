 Cable-TV Companies May Prove a Good Bet, As Americans Stay Tuned During Hard Times   By By Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  "Statistically, economic downturns are not a major item with these companies," says Morris Mark, president of New York-based Mark Asset Management, which owns shares of Comcast, Cox and AOL Time Warner. While Mr. Mark has refrained from buying additional shares, "we aren't selling either," he says.  Early signs are that the pricier services are holding up. Early last month, Cox said it was averaging about 12,200 new digital subscriptions and 8,600 high-speed Internet subscriptions per week. That is up from 9,000 digital subscribers per week and 8,000 high-speed Internet ones the year before. Since the attacks, according to a spokesman, the subscription pace remains strong.  James Easterlin, an analyst with Oak View Capital Management in Durham, N.C., considers the sector a good long-term bet. "This is a good place to put cash," he says, predicting that consumers' appetite for digital TV and other digital services, such as video on demand, will be huge. "The reason we're in the sector is because of the things you really can't see yet," he says. Companies such as AOL Time Warner, for example, are testing subscription services where customers can watch their favorite HBO shows at any time. Mr. Easterlin's firm owns shares in Comcast and Charter.
