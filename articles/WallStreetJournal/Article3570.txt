 Futures & Options: Hitting the Road With Pop   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  [ELVIS COSTELLO] has confused fans and record companies alike by embracing all types of music, from aggressive punk-style posturing to art-house crooning. He's collaborated with Burt Bacharach, worked with the soprano Anne-Sophie von Otter and sung with the Charles Mingus band. Now he's touring in support of his latest record, a throwback to his early days, and the Attractions, his crack backup band, play with him. Mr. Costello winds up in Atlanta June 24. Tickets vary depending on venue; here they're $38.50 to $48.50. Concert at 8 p.m.  CARE TO CATCH [OZZY OSBOURNE] before the next season of "The Osbournes"? He'll be on the road, uncensored, with his long-running summertime Ozzfest, a collection of metal and thrash bands (don't expect Sharon, his wily wife). The tour kicks off July 6 in Virginia and runs through Sept. 8. Besides the remarkably paternal but no-less-entertaining Mr. Osbourne, also on the bill are acts such as Rob Zombie and Drowning Pool. Ticket prices may vary by venue; for this engagement they are $39.50 to $77.50. The all-day music starts at 9:30 a.m.  [KENNY CHESNEY], country heartthrob, has had big hits with novelty tunes like "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy" and power ballads such as "How Forever Feels." Think of him as Garth Brooks for the millennium with a more rigorous workout routine. He's touring the country in support of his album, "No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems." He'll be joining other stars at a "Country Jam" in Grand Junction, Colo., next week, and continues his own tour of other states, finishing up in Pueblo, Colo., Aug. 30. Concert begins at 7 p.m. Prices vary depending on venue; they're $28 to $48 here.
