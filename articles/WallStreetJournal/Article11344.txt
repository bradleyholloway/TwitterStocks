 World-Wide [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1990  Former Politburo member Yeltsin won a landslide victory and many other candidates seeking quicker restructuring fared well in Sunday's elections in the Slavic heartland, according to early returns. But voting for the legislatures and local and regional councils in hundreds of districts in Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia was inconclusive and runoff elections are expected. While the progressives and nationalists scored significant gains, the outcome appeared to have fallen short of a complete purge of Communist Party officials.  The White House said there aren't any grounds for expecting the imminent release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon. But a spokesman said that many people, excluding U.S. officials, are involved in discussions on behalf of the captives. He emphasized that the U.S. is prepared to talk directly with Iran, but wouldn't make any concessions.  Palestinian leaders said Arabs from the occupied territories would serve on a delegation to talks with Israel chosen only by the PLO. Israel opposes any role for Arafat's group. The move by the Arab leaders came as ministers from Prime Minister Shamir's Likud bloc conditionally approved U.S. proposals for the Mideast peace talks.
