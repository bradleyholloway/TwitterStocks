 Korean VCR Makers' Invasion of U.S. Backfires as Profit Margins Disappear   By By Joseph P. Manguno, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1989  The general manager of Samsung Electronics Co.'s division of videocassette-recorder exports says there is unprecedented demand in the U.S. for his company's products. That doesn't please Mr. Park. "I wish our VCRs weren't so popular with Americans," he says. "We can't afford it."  Samsung, South Korea's No. 2 maker of VCRs, faces a conundrum: The more products it sells in the U.S., the more money it loses. Korea's other two VCR manufacturers, Goldstar Co. and Daewoo Electronics Ltd., are also victims of their own success.  South Korea's overseas sales of VCRs have nearly doubled over three years to $1.32 billion in 1988, pulling ahead of color television sets as the nation's No. 1 electronics export. But because of rocketing labor costs and a strengthening currency, which makes Korea's exports more expensive overseas, profit margins are collapsing. Mr. Park says Samsung lost money -- about 6% or 7% of the cost -- on every unit it exported to the U.S. last year.
