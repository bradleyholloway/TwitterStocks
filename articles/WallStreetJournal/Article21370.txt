 Lockheed to Take $165 Million Charges In 3rd Period, Post $35 Million Net Loss   By By David J. Jefferson and Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1989  CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. said it will take $165 million in charges against third-quarter operating profit, resulting in a net loss for the period of about $35 million.  The aerospace concern said the bulk of the write-offs reflect increased costs connected with its subcontracting work on the Air Force C-17 transport, built by McDonnell Douglas Corp., and its modification on the Navy EP-3E reconnaissance plane. Also included in the write-offs are adjustments on smaller fixed-price development contracts and certain other programs that Lockheed didn't identify.  News of the latest write-offs came after the close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, in which Lockheed shares rose 62.5 cents to finish at $49.75. Lockheed said it expects to report its third-quarter results late next week. For the first six months of 1989, Lockheed had net of $139 million, or $2.25 a share, on sales of $4.45 billion.
