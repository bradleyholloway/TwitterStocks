 Drawdown Talk May Spur Iraq Rebels; Increased Attacks Could Help Insurgents Claim They Drove Foreigners Out of the Country   By Jaffe, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2005  U.S. officials repeatedly have said that improvements in Iraqi security forces could allow the U.S. presence to shrink early next year. "The timetable [for withdrawal] depends on our ability to train the Iraqis. Then our troops can come home with the honor they have earned," President [Bush] said during a speech in Texas.  Not all U.S. military officials buy into the theory that a possible drawdown would provoke more violence directed at U.S. troops. Attacks on U.S. troops with remotely detonated roadside bombs have remained relatively constant in recent months, while attacks on Iraqi civilians and security forces have climbed.  "If you could snap your fingers tomorrow and have all U.S. troops leave," some of the insurgents would give up the fight, this official said. "For some in the insurgency, their only purpose is to kill Americans." The official, however, said other factions -- members of the old regime interested in preventing democracy from taking hold or religious extremists hoping to foment a sectarian civil war -- likely would continue fighting.
