 German Muslim's Radical Path Was Paved by Saudis --- Man With Link to Bomber Of Tunisian Synagogue Says He Was Recruited at Home   By By David Crawford and Ian Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  In the sealed police deposition reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Christian Ganczarski said he had been an apprentice welder in a Ruhr Valley factory in Germany when he was approached by one of the country's most prominent Muslim leaders, Nadeem Elyas, in 1991. Mr. Ganczarski, who had converted to Islam in 1986, said Dr. Elyas contacted him through his mosque's leadership and offered him a chance to study at a university in Medina, Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Ganczarski's deposition provides a glimpse of how Saudi educational institutions and religious leaders helped recruit young Europeans to study its puritanical strain of Islam. As investigators penetrate the deep structure of terrorism, they are finding more people like Mr. Ganczarski who were strongly influenced by the Saudis' strict version of Islam. "This is a pattern we see again and again," said a German domestic intelligence officer. "People like Ganczarski going to Saudi Arabia and coming back a radical."  Shortly before the attack, Mr. [Nizar Nawar] called Mr. Ganczarski, asking for his blessing. Mr. Ganczarski said both men knew his phone was being tapped and kept the conversation short. "In hindsight, it is certainly possible that he wanted to say goodbye," Mr. Ganczarski told police.
