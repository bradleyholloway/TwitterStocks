 Commodities Report: Frozen Orange Juice Collapses On Doubts Over Brazil Report   By By Susan Buchanan OsterDowJones Commodity News, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  CRUDE OIL: May crude futures surged late yesterday, as renewed concerns over potential threats to Iraq's northern oil fields induced traders to reverse previous sales and buy futures at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Close to the end of the trading day, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters at a Pentagon news briefing it was likely the northern oil fields of Iraq were wired for destruction. May crude settled 85 cents higher at $28.85 a barrel.  In an early estimate last December, the U.S. Agriculture Trade Office in Sao Paulo forecast the state's 2003-04 crop at 320 million boxes, below 360 million the year before. Dry weather and bearing stress to trees explained the lower projection. One Brazilian box equals 90 pounds. Sao Paulo is Brazil's top citrus state and its concentrate competes with Florida juice in the U.S. and world markets.
