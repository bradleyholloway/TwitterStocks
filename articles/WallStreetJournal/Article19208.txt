 Goal of Soccer Team, The San Diego Flash, Is to Be Public Entity --- Owner of Minor Leaguer Files To Make Initial Offering By the End of This Year   By By Anthony Palazzo, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1999  San Diego Soccer Development Corp., owner of the San Diego Flash soccer team, filed preliminary documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission signaling its intention to go public.  "I always intended for us to go public," Mr. [Yan] Skwara said. He has other big plans, including a $10 million soccer-only stadium in San Diego; the purchase of an indoor-soccer league franchise; and the eventual transformation of the Flash, a second-tier affiliate of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, into a major-league team in its own right.  The Flash is one of 30 teams playing in the A-League, as soccer's Division II league is called. While some star A-League players move on to MLS teams, it isn't a standard farm-team relationship, Mr. Skwara said. For instance, one Flash player was drafted by an MLS team last year but ended up staying with the Flash because it offered more money and playing time, Mr. Skwara said.
