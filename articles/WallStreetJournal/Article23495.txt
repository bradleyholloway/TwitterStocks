 Barron's Insight: Sales Pressures Could Take The Fizz Out of Jones Soda   By Williams, Christopher C, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  In recent days, shares have slipped amid disappointing results for this year's first quarter. Still, [Jones] (JSDA) trades for 146 times 2006 earnings of 13 cents a share, and 112 times analysts' 2007 estimates of 17 cents. That compares with price/earnings multiples in the mid-to-high teens for Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP) and Hansen Natural (HANS), the trendy maker of Monster energy drinks.  So has Thomas Barry of the Bjurman Barry Small Cap Growth Fund, which unloaded its entire stake earlier this year. "I'd be nervous buying the stock at these P/E levels with the earnings and revenue they've had," says Mr. Barry, citing Jones' flat first-quarter profits and less-than-expected uptick in sales.
