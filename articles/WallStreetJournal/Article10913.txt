 Despite Court Victory, NFL Faces Major Obstacles in Months Ahead   By By Hal Lancaster, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1986  Certainly, there are several bright spots. Recent courtroom victories have solidified the league's control over franchises and all but eliminated a troublesome rival. (The USFL voted Monday to halt its first fall season before it began, putting the league in a state of suspended animation that could easily become permanent.) NFL general managers now have a stronger hand in contract negotiations with players, accelerating a cost-cutting campaign that began last year. And the league's need for antitrust relief from Congress has eased considerably.  The decision in the USFL suit also gives NFL owners and executives a much-needed breather after years filled with lobbying and litigation. They can now concentrate on expanding the league's marketing reach, as in last weekend's exhibition game between the Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys in London. "The sleeping giant is getting to its feet," says James Foster, a former NFL marketing executive. "In the past, they would have never thought of playing in Europe."  The first obstacle is a new television contract, with negotiations scheduled to begin early next year. The USFL verdict frees the NFL to continue dealing with all three major networks, which helps its bargaining position. And Pete Rozelle has had a magic touch in negotiations with the networks in his 26 years as the league's commissioner; the five-year pact he obtained in 1982 was worth $2.1 billion.
