 Extreme Makeover: Los Angeles Edition   By Kotkin, Joel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2004  The cosmetic surgery doesn't stop there. Down the road from downtown's Bunker Hill, where most of Los Angeles's '80s-vintage office towers sit, the city has embraced another huge billion-dollar- plus entertainment, hotel, retail and residential center that would serve as a draw for the less-cultured crowd. Envisioned as a "Times Square West," this confection would service the convention crowds who now largely ignore the central city.  There's also a particular irony in L.A.'s new penchant for downtown monumentalism. From its earliest era, Los Angeles's planners and visionaries decided that they were going to build a very different kind of city. Instead of placing their emphasis on one dominant center, L.A. was to be a multipolar metropolis, with multiple centers surrounded by their own residential communities.  City Hall and its mandarins may bemoan the lack of street traffic around their downtown, but if they want to see crowds, they need only go to Santee Alley, in the garment district, which is about a 40- minute walk away. A magnet for tens of thousands of Los Angeles's widely diverse people, the area possesses a commercial vibrancy that exceeds New York's Canal Street and approaches the frenzied capitalism of Hong Kong's Mon Kok.
