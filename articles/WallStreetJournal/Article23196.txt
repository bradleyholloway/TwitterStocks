 Forex View: New Year Offers Fresh Opportunity For Dollar Bears   By Flint, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2005  The dollar exited from its third straight year of declines near its historical low against the euro and close to multiyear bottoms against a string of other currencies. Rather than enjoying the year-end bounce many analysts had anticipated, the U.S. currency resumed its long-term slide in the final weeks of 2004.  U.S. economic data set for release this week, culminating with Friday's nonfarm-payrolls report for December, could provide plenty of excuses to sell the dollar. Disappointing figures could trigger sharp dips, but good news won't necessarily offer much of a lift because of the underlying bearish sentiment.  The U.S. employment report for December has even greater potential to ignite a dollar selloff, should it come in below expectations. Jobs growth has been the weak spot in the U.S. economic recovery, and more disappointment in that direction could lead to another step down for the dollar. The consensus estimate is for the creation of 175,000 nonfarm jobs last month, with the unemployment rate expected to have remained steady at 5.4%.
