 Blue Chips Again Pull Back a Bit But Shares Display Holding Power   By By William Power and David Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1989  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after rising 173.75 points, or 8%, in January, declined 4.11 on the month's opening day Wednesday and a comparable 4.46 yesterday, to close at 2333.75. But despite persistent warnings from analysts that stocks are due for a "correction" after the rally, the Dow stays firm.  Ms. Del Signore, who's generally bearish on the market, is one of many traders who had envisioned a good-size downward move in the Dow yesterday after all its gains. "We went up way too fast, way too much," she said. But despite sinking nearly 16 points in the morning, the Dow largely held its ground.  Meanwhile, smaller issues that had been trailing the blue chips have started to catch up. For the second consecutive session, the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter stocks and the American Stock Exchange index both rose even as the Dow and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell slightly.
