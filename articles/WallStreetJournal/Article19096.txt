 Foundation Health's 3rd-Quarter Results To Include Pretax Charge of $175 Million   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1998  Foundation Health Systems Inc., a big California health-maintenance organization under mounting pressure to improve its financial performance, said third-quarter results will include $175 million in pretax charges for restructuring, staff reductions and asset write-downs.  The Woodland Hills, Calif., HMO said its quarterly report, set for release next Tuesday, will include earnings from continuing operations of 24 cents a diluted share. Analysts had been expecting per-share earnings of 28 cents, according to First Call Corp. In the 1997 third quarter, Foundation had net income of $68.9 million, or 57 cents a share.  Foundation also said it will report positive cash flow from operations during the latest quarter, compared with deficits in the first two quarters of 1998. "This represents very encouraging news," said Jay M. Gellert, who was elevated to chief executive officer in August.
