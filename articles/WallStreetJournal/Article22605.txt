 Once-Weak Russell 2000 Finishes Year up 20%, As Nasdaq Composite Index Hits Another Record   By By Raymond Hennessey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  The Russell 2000 small-stock index and the Nasdaq Composite Index, which includes large and small issues on Nasdaq, ended Friday's shortened session at record levels. That wasn't a surprise for the roaring, tech-stock driven Nasdaq Stock Market index, but it took the Russell until the last week of 1999 to catch up with the rest of the market.  "Our jaws are still not off the ground" in response to the Russell's late-year recovery, said Christopher Ely, portfolio manager at the Loomis Sayles Small Cap Growth Fund in Boston. "This borders on unprecedented."  In light trading, the Nasdaq composite ended 1999 at 4069.31, the 61st time this year it closed at a record. That gives the Nasdaq an 85% rise for the year. The Russell and Nasdaq were helped by strong fourth quarters. During the past three months, the Nasdaq pushed 48% higher, and the Russell gained 17%.
