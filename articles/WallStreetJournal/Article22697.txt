 Reed, Thomson Attempt to Buy Harcourt Could Face Tough Antitrust Scrutiny   By By Daniel Golden, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2000  Under the deal announced last week, [Reed-Wolters] would buy Harcourt for $4.45 billion and keep its scientific, technical and medical journals, as well as grade-school and high-school text-publishing units. It would resell Harcourt's higher-education and professional publishing businesses to Canadian publisher Thomson for $2.06 billion.  Reed had more than $1 billion in sales in its scientific and technical unit last year, while Harcourt had about $698 million in its comparable division. The Harcourt unit was the company's largest source of earnings, with $117.5 million in operating profits.  Mr. [Mark McCabe] said Reed Elsevier's biomedical journals had an average subscription cost of about $1,500 in 1998. One Reed weekly, Brain Research, costs $17,444 a year, according to the company's Web site. Harcourt biomedical titles averaged about $500, Mr. McCabe said. "There is the potential for the same kind of impact, and perhaps even higher, than what happened with Pergamon," he said.
