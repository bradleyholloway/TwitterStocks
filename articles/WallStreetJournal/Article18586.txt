 Pilots' Proposal To Help USAir Hits Resistance --- British Air and Machinists Oppose Plan to Swap Cuts in Pay for Equity   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1994  A plan by USAir Group Inc. pilots to help the struggling carrier by swapping pay cuts for partial ownership ran into swift and widespread resistance from a big shareholder and another union.  The 5,200-member USAir pilots union said it would agree to a $750 million payroll reduction for its members if other employees and management agreed to an additional $1.75 billion in concessions, and if big shareholder British Airways PLC, invested an additional $450 million in USAir.  But British Airways immediately balked. Already holding a 22% stake in USAir, the London-based carrier reiterated its intention not to invest another dollar until USAir completes a "satisfactory restructuring." After hearing details of the pilots' proposal, a spokesman for the U.K. carrier said, "It is clear that British Airways could not contemplate further investment."
