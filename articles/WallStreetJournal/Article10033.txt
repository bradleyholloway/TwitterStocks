 PURSUITS; Food & Drink -- Eating Out: Fine Food Nation; A trip to Seattle shows how 'national' restaurants are replacing local cuisine   By Sokolov, Raymond, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2007  The chefs at national restaurants typically have cooked in world- famous kitchens and keep their own kitchens at a big-league level, adding local ingredients, regional dishes and their own creations to the mix. The rise of such places, gradual and uncoordinated, signals a knitting together of well-traveled chefs and elite customers who now make up a viable market of feinschmeckers in what once were at best centers of regional cooking (New Orleans) or gastronomic podunks. While the "best" restaurants of cities like Denver and Kansas City got locally famous serving good raw materials plainly prepared -- grilled steaks and boiled lobsters -- national restaurants in those same towns now feature foie gras with housemade preserves or sushi-grade tuna, elaborately plated and garnished, instead.  In the not-so-long-ago old days, eating well in Seattle meant tucking into generous portions of fat and happy Dungeness crab or wild local salmon, preferably planked on alderwood boards, a technique derived from the campfire cuisine of indigenous Indians. Rover's pioneered in bringing French culinary technique to this not-so-brave New World city. Thierry Rautureau bought the old Rover's (named after a dog whose picture still hangs on a wall near the entrance) in 1987 and turned it into a steadily evolving laboratory for the glorification of local products, from white sturgeon caviar to locally farmed baby lettuce.  Nowadays, the young, classically trained chef Adam Hoffman is celebrating Rover's 20th anniversary with "20 Years Later Menus." The adventuresome diner might start with a "martini" of Dungeness crab with mango and blood-orange-argan dressing. This is a witty turn on the Pacific Northwest's old faithful crab cocktail, served in a martini glass with a ketchup-tinted dressing mixed from reddish citrus juice and a prized Moroccan oil.
