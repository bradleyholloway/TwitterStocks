 Coke, EU Officials Work to Resolve Antitrust Dispute   By Kanter, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2004  Settling the Coke case is important for Mr. Monti, who is eager to burnish his legacy as Europe's competition chief by winning immediate benefits for consumers. He was unable to reach an agreement with Microsoft in March. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, probably faces years of litigation to force the Redmond, Wash., company to implement the EU's demand that Microsoft modify its Windows operating system. Microsoft has asked the EU's Court of First Instance to overturn Mr. Monti's decision, including a record fine of 497 million euros ($610.8 million).  Coke already has offered to scrap the practice of requiring retailers to buy quantities of its noncola brands, such as Sprite, in exchange for discounts on the most popular cola products. Coke also offered to eliminate most "target" and "growth" rebates -- incentives for retailers to reach specific sales levels -- in geographic areas where Coke is judged dominant by regulators.
