 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2003  A: Eventually, the 64-bit processor, like those recently rolled out by Apple and Advanced Micro Devices, will make today's processors, which are 32-bit, obsolete for consumers. That's because it can handle twice as much data in one gulp, and handle much more memory. But we are years away from that point because, to fully realize these advantages, the 64-bit processor requires a whole new generation of operating systems, software and companion hardware.  A: No. The biggest limitation of the iTunes music-download store is that the songs it sells are in an encrypted format created by Apple that only its own iPod, among current players, can handle. Competing online stores, such as Napster 2.0 and Musicmatch, also use an encrypted format, created by Microsoft, but there are several players capable of playing it. The iPod isn't among them.
