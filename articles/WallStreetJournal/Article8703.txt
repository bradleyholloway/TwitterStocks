 Dollar Gains Against Major Currencies; Market's Direction Still Baffles Traders   By By Rebecca H. Patterson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1996  The dollar edged higher against most other major currencies yesterday, but traders are still unsure of the market's direction, particularly in terms of the U.S. and German currencies.  The market is divided as to the likelihood and timing of a German or U.S. interest-rate cut as well as the overall economic outlook for both countries, Ms. Finstrom said. That uncertainty, she said, "doesn't give us much direction on exchange rates."  Late in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4770 marks, up from 1.4745 marks late Tuesday in New York. The U.S. currency was also quoted at 105.43 yen, up from 105.24 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.5297, down from $1.5305. About noon Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 1.4850 marks and at 105.52 yen; sterling was at $1.5259.
