 Leading the News: Strategic Hotel Sues Marriott, Accusing It of Concealing Profits   By By Lisa Bannon, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2002  In the suit, SHC claims that Marriott has repeatedly failed to disclose relevant financial data about three SHC-owned hotels in Southern California, particularly charges for hotel programs and service charges designed to enhance the Marriott brand without any benefit to the owners. "SHC believes that these evasions are representative of a `culture of entitlement' whereby Marriott believes it is entitled to profit through an ever-expanding web of programs, third-party affiliations and other ventures -- all at the direct expense of SHC," the complaint says.  SHC says Marriott used confidential information about its hotels' guests and operations to develop a competing hotel in Laguna Beach, Calif. SHC also claims Marriott sold its hotel guest lists, which are owned by SHC, to third parties without sharing any profit. According to the suit, Marriott also accepts "suspect rebates" from vendors who sell goods to Avendra, Marriott's partly owned hotel-purchasing service. SHC claims Marriott entered into the purchasing agreement with Avendra without SHC's consent and without evidence that Avendra has competitive pricing, solely to enhance Marriott's profits.  Similar claims have been made by two other hotel owners. In Town Hotels Inc., owner of the Marriott in Charleston, W. Va., filed a suit in U.S. District Court in Charleston. Marriott denied the allegations. The 1993 Flately Family Trust, owner of the Boston Marriott Quincy Hotel, filed a countersuit in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to a suit filed by Marriott in Delaware asking the court to affirm its current management agreement. Marriott denied the allegations in the Flately case as well.
