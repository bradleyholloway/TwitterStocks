 Revenge of the B-List: To See Why MGM Is in Play, Just Take A Look in Its Vault; Studio Finds Goldmine in Fees On Titles From the Past; Dangerfield Gets Respect; The 'RoboCop' Boxed Set   By Merissa Marr and Martin Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2004  MGM has mined its library more aggressively than most studios. It has released more than 1,000 titles on DVD, from "Moonstruck" and "Annie Hall" to "Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine," a 1965 spoof about a mad scientist who plots to take over the world with seductive female robots. Many of MGM's other titles have questionable value, including such films as "Robot Holocaust" and "Necropolis."  The archives are also being tapped for remakes. Next year, MGM is reviving its classic "The Pink Panther," this time starring Steve Martin. Bond movies, "Rocky" and "The Great Escape" have been mined for video games. The company has set up a special "MGM on Stage" division, licensing titles such as "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" for the stage.  MGM has had mixed results abroad, where it has channels in 110 territories, mostly with partners. In India, the Zee MGM channel started off showing old MGM movies on a schedule featuring "Thrilling Thursday" and "Romantic Monday." But rivals such as Showtime have been airing more recent Hollywood blockbusters, posing tough competition. That's something MGM can't do, given that it produces only a handful of more-modest movies each year. As a result, Zee MGM has started buying movies from other studios as well.
