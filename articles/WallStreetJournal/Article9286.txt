 European Telecom Regulation Sparks Debate --- Intel, Other U.S. Firms Lobby for EU to Play Central Role on Policy   By By Brandon Mitchener, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2001  Chip makers, computer makers, satellite operators and phone companies are riled over a blizzard of European Union draft laws that would rewrite the rule book for the EU's 191 billion euro ($180 billion) telecom market. As initially conceived, the laws would create a single set of rules for competition within the 15-nation EU and as many as 13 prospective EU members, providing everyone with legal certainty and vast economies of scale. Intel is worried, though, that proposed amendments to the rules may leave Europe with a patchwork of national rules and case law that is no better -- or even worse -- than what exists.  Together with dozens of other U.S. companies represented in the EU Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, Intel is lobbying for EU regulators to have the last word in setting policy and settling disputes. That way, Europe would ensure that liberalization "doesn't take place in a piecemeal and inconsistent fashion, to the detriment of end-users," the EU Committee said last week.
