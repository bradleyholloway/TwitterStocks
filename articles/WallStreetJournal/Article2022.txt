 Bush Stands Firm Against Tax Boost, Congress Is Told   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1989  Appearing before the Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Boskin said, "We do not intend to raise taxes or bring taxes to the negotiating table." But he added: "We understand that the American people send the Congress and the president here to govern and not to bicker . . . . We will listen and discuss any proposal on its merits. We don't currently see the merits of a tax increase."  Those words are similar to statements Mr. Boskin and other officials made earlier this year. But two congressmen with different viewpoints told Mr. Boskin that the administration is signaling it might go along with taxes -- if Congress makes the first move.
