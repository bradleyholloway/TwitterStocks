 Ratings Take On Political Risk; Moody's View on South Korea Fails to Move Bond Investors; Governments Are Hard to Gauge   By Karmin, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2004  Who's right? Global bond investors don't seem to know: One week after the Moody's upgrade of the country's outlook to stable from negative, South Korean government bonds have barely budged, suggesting investors weren't moved to buy by Moody's vote of confidence.  Venezuela, for instance, is rated Caa1 by Moody's -- one of the lowest ratings, even among high-yield, or "junk," bonds -- and a full two notches below Brazil's B2 high-yield rating. Yet yields for Venezuelan bonds are comparable to those of Brazil. That means the market isn't demanding a higher premium from Venezuela, despite the lower rating.  Mohamed El-Erian, an emerging-market bond portfolio manager for Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, thinks Moody's has it about right. Venezuela's political situation has been highly volatile, and the deeply divisive President Hugo Chavez faces a referendum in August with the outcome uncertain. "Some think Venezuela's oil reserves are so large it can compensate for economic and political uncertainty," he says. "We don't agree."
