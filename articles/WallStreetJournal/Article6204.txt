 Freddie's Market Bomb   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2003  Freddie tried to limit the market damage yesterday, appointing a new executive team and pointing out that any accounting inspection will probably increase its earnings. But investors are worried less about Freddie's income statement than about the quality of its balance sheet. Freddie said its president and COO, David Glenn, was fired for failing to cooperate with an internal accounting review.  This raises the question of whether the company was manipulating its earnings, or, worse, attempting to disguise the amount of its credit or other risk. Fannie and Fred are huge players in derivative markets, as a way to hedge their interest-rate risk. But hedging is expensive, and some are asking if Freddie chose to skimp on hedging costs as a way to pump up earnings. Investors don't know the answer because Freddie hasn't yet filed the disclosure documents that it promised to file months ago with its regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (Ofheo). Fannie, by contrast, has.  The anxiety is all the greater because it seems that Ofheo hasn't known until recently what was going on. This takes some (lack of) doing, because Ofheo more or less exists solely to regulate Fan and Fred. Freddie alerted everyone in January that it was re-examining its earnings for the past three years. But not until Saturday did Ofheo Director Armando Falcon Jr. send a brusque letter to Freddie's board asking for the gory details.
