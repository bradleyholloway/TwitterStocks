 Bristol-Myers Reduces Profit To Boost Reserves   By Davies, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2005  Bristol-Myers declined to comment about a possible settlement of the accounting investigation. But according to a person familiar with the situation, the board was told by Justice Department officials within the past week that the agency is going to seek a "deferred prosecution" of the company. Under a deferred prosecution, a company averts criminal indictment by agreeing to certain settlement terms with the Justice Department. If the company complies for a period of up to several years, the Justice Department would then agree not to seek criminal charges.  A deferred prosecution, even with a settlement at a high price, would likely be a boon to Bristol-Myers. The accounting investigation has been a cloud over the company. In March 2003, it announced it had overstated revenue by $2.5 billion from 1999 to 2001 because of wholesaler incentives. Last August, Bristol-Myers agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $150 million to settle charges of accounting fraud related to the wholesaler issue.  Bristol-Myers said it has reserved $134 million for possible fines and penalties tied to the pricing, sales and marketing of Abilify. The $134 million represents the "minimum" reserve, and the impact of further reserves "could be material," the company said.
