 Administration Works to Draft Health-Care Bill --- Republicans Hope the Plan Gains Enough Support To Pass Before Election   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 20, 1992  The legislation would most likely contain measures similar to health provisions in the Democratic tax bill that recently passed the Senate: measures to make health insurance easier to obtain, set up large buying pools to help people and small businesses purchase health coverage at cheaper prices, and allow self-employed people to deduct the full cost of health insurance from their income tax.  Nevertheless, the White House is considering pushing ahead with similar health proposals but is likely to run into election-year politics in the Democratic-controlled House. "Up until now, we've been criticized for not having a legislative vehicle of our own," said Kevin Moley, deputy secretary of health and human services, at a breakfast with reporters. "We are working on the idea of having a bill we would adopt as our own." He said officials were waiting until the president has acted on the tax bill to decide whether to go forward with their own health legislation.
