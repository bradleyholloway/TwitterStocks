 UPS to Buy 60 Cargo Jets From Airbus   By By Rick Brooks and Jeff Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  The huge order is the latest victory for Airbus over U.S. rival Boeing Co. in the frenzied market for big cargo planes. Boeing has long been the primary supplier of airplanes to UPS's growing fleet of 240 jetliners, including 30 767-300 aircraft that are roughly similar in size to the A300-600 but usually fly longer distances. Last fall, UPS took delivery of its first seven A300-600s from Airbus, and expects 13 more of the planes to be delivered by the end of this year. The jets are likely to be priced at a significant discount from their list price, partly because of the enormous size of UPS's order.  UPS, which delivers an average of more than 13 million packages a day, will use its newest order of A300-600s as part of an expansion of capacity on shorter-haul routes in its international air network. While the routes to be flown by the planes haven't been determined, UPS officials said they expect to use the A300-600s for flights within Asia, Europe and Latin America. Planes being bought in the company's initial order will help haul the load as UPS expands its domestic network, flying primarily between regional sorting hubs.  UPS didn't say when deliveries of the 60 new A300-600 aircraft are expected to begin, but it could be at least a few years from now, air-cargo experts said. One reason is that UPS still will be flying only about two-thirds of its initial order of 30 A300-600 planes by the end of 2001. The first converted MD-11 freighters will enter UPS's fleet of 240 aircraft late this year.
