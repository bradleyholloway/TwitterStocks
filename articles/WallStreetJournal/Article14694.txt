 Big Profit Posted by American Savings Raises Questions About Thrift Bailouts   By By Charles McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1990  American Savings Bank's 1989 profit of $214.2 million, reported Friday, makes it the most profitable big thrift in the country and probably will add to the political storm over the cost of past thrift rescues.  With some of that assistance, American Savings achieved its 1989 profit despite a costly loss on junk-bond investments. The return on assets makes it not only the most profitable big thrift but probably would place it second to Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio, among large commercial banks.  In those deals, regulators often offered wealthy financiers generous tax credits, guaranteed returns and other inducements to take over dead thrifts, effectively protecting them from most risk. In addition to Mr. Bass, such financiers as investor Ronald Perelman and William Simon, the former Treasury secretary, were among those who received such sweeteners. Based on earnings of $107.8 million for the first nine months of 1989, Mr. Perelman's First Gibraltar Savings, Houston, may report full-year results that by some gauges of profitability, such as return on assets, could surpass those of American Savings.
