 Style & Substance: Pop Culture Gets Religion; Whether Reverent or Ironic, Christianity Has Become Cool; 'Homeboy' T's Speak to Teens   By Kang, Stephanie, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2004  The homeboy shirts' maker is Teenage Millionaire, an apparel company previously known for shirts with the slogan "Hot Punk." The new religious references are ironic, but the purpose isn't to shock, says Doug Williams, creative director at the Los Angeles company. "It's 2004. People have been shocked to where it doesn't work anymore," he says. "T's can be thought-provoking, and I hope these T's make people think."  Christian themes, often marginalized in the past, now are increasingly present in pop culture. Most noticeable has been Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ," which since its February opening has sold more than $360 million in tickets and ranks No. 7 in terms of all-time U.S. box office. "Joan of Arcadia," on Viacom Inc.'s CBS, about a high school girl who talks to God, won a People's Choice Award for best dramatic series this year. Meanwhile, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.'s United Artists is planning to release "Saved!", a subversive comedy about a girl named Mary at a Christian high school who gets pregnant by her gay boyfriend.  Makers of more-traditional Christian T-shirts also are taking note. Vic Kennett, president of Kerusso Inc., a Berryville, Ark., Christian apparel and gift company, says the bulk of his $5 million-plus T-shirt sales comes from shirts with traditional Christian references, with such slogans as "Tougher than Nails" or "Dead to Sin, Alive to Christ." These days, Mr. Kennett says, teens want "something cool, so they don't feel like the Church Lady from 'Saturday Night Live,' " Mr. Kennett says.
