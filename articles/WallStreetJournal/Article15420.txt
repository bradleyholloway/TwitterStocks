 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1996  The attack outside a crowded shopping mall came one day after another bomber killed 18 people on a Jerusalem bus. An unidentified caller told Israeli radio that the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas carried out the latest bombing. Victims included children in costumes and makeup for the holiday of Purim. Prime Minister Peres vowed to strike at Hamas anywhere, a remark interpreted as asserting Israel's claim to re-enter Palestinian areas vacated under a 1993 peace accord. "We will go to any corner where this twisted terror has begun to take root," Peres said in a statement after an emergency cabinet meeting.  Angry crowds gathered around the Defense Ministry complex in Tel Aviv, calling for Peres to resign for failing to stop the attacks.  Poised to take command of the GOP presidential race with a strong showing in eight primaries today, Dole said he looked forward to the end of the nomination fight. The Senate majority leader planned to meet today to map out legislative strategy with House Speaker Gingrich, who announced that he voted in advance for Dole in Georgia's primary. Dole said he wanted to return to the message of "fundamental policy change" embodied in the GOP's Contract With America.
