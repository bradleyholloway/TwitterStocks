 Gateway's Chief Executive Resigns; Inouye Quits on the Heels Of Disappointing Earnings; Chairman to Take Reins   By Susan Warren and Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2006  Mr. [Wayne Inouye]'s departure comes just a week after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter results. Wall Street has been unhappy with Mr. Inouye's ability to halt declines in the company's Internet and phone sales, as well as its sales of computers to corporate clients.  Mr. Inouye signed on as Gateway's chief executive in March 2004 with a four-year contract after Gateway's acquisition of eMachines, where he had served as CEO. Gateway said he now is leaving "to pursue other interests." Mr. Inouye couldn't be reached for comment.
