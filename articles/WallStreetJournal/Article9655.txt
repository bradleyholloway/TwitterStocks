 Readers' Forum: "Our family was blindsided by this monster tax"   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2004  We're still hearing from you about Tom Herman's Feb. 22 news story about the alternative minimum tax ("Dreaded Tax Law Could Ding You"). Across the country, readers feel they have been unfairly hit by the tax that was intended to keep the super rich from paying no taxes at all. Today, the AMT is hitting people of far more modest means. And more are likely to face it in coming years unless Congress does something to fix it.  My wife and I were hit with the AMT for the first time this year. Living in New York City, facing $700,000 "starter" homes in many suburbs and hoping for our first child soon, we were caught totally off guard by this tax. When meeting with our accountant last week, we asked, "Will we be hit with AMT?" He said, "I don't know until I run the numbers." We filed married jointly, I had no exemptions; she had one. We got an apologetic call shortly after -- our federal tax bill will be $20,000 and state bill $3,600!
