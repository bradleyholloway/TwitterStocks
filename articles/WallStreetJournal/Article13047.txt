 Auto Watch: Dealers Aren't the Only Ones With Loans   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2004  CapitalOne.com, one of the largest auto-financing firms, gives loan quotes in 15 minutes during regular business hours, the Web site says. If accepted, Capital One will mail a blank check that you can make out to the dealer for the vehicle's price. If you later decide to accept the dealer's financing, you can void the check and throw it away.  Once you have a good offer, you have leverage to bargain over an auto's purchase price as if you were a "cash buyer," Mr. [Philip Reed] says, and you are free to reject the dealer's financing offer.
