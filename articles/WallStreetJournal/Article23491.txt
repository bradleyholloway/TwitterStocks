 Health Costs: Rolling Over Dental Money   By McQueen, M P, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  Still, with the rollover plans, the higher annual limits in following years can be used to provide a cushion for extraordinary expenses such as tooth replacements, insurers with such coverage say. Since 2005, all dental plans offered by Guardian, for example, have been covering dental implants, which can cost as much as $3,000 each, and UnitedHealth expects to begin covering them later this year or early next. Cigna offers riders for implants for employers who want to add coverage for them to group plans.  As part of the prevention and wellness trend, more insurers also are covering new screening exams for oral cancer -- including ViziLite, an early screening for precancerous oral lesions that uses a chemical light, and Oral CDx, a brush biopsy used in the dentist's office to examine suspicious mouth lesions for cancer. Guardian began covering ViziLite in March. Cigna is covering the brush biopsy in all plan designs and ViziLite in some.
