 Mr. `Buy and Hold' Adjusts to Turmoil   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1998  As the market has slid recently, however, it has become harder to maintain this buy-and-hold philosophy. Last week, Mr. (Tom) Marsico, one of the industry's staunchest longterm fund managers, reduced positions in some longheld stocks. In his quiet corner office overlooking downtown Denver, Mr. Marsico met frequently with his team of senior analysts. The team carefully studied their portfolios' holdings, sometimes for several hours, systematically arguing through what to buy and what to discard.  As stock screens flashed up falling numbers, the group made some decisions. Based on the deteriorating foreign-currency markets, several positions in financial stocks, previously mainstays in Mr. Marsico's portfolios, were reduced. Cash levels in the portfolios went way up, to about 20%.  For Mr. Marsico, particularly, there is much at stake. The 43-year-old manager, who launched his own firm in October, specializes in portfolios of large-capitalization stocks. Until recently, the market had favored precisely these stocks. That helped fuel Mr. Marsico's performance, which in turn brought his new company, Marsico Capital Management, in excess of $2 billion in assets.
