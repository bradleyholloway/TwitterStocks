 Tull Directors Reject Inland Steel's Offer, Weigh Alternatives   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1985  NORCROSS, Ga. -- J.M. Tull Industries Inc. said its directors unanimously rejected Inland Steel Co.'s hostile tender offer of about $97.3 million, or $19 a share, and told Tull's financial adviser -- Kidder, Peabody & Co. -- "to explore various alternatives."  Tull, a maker and wholesaler of metal products, said its directors, in a letter to be mailed soon, urged its shareholders to reject the Chicago-based steel maker's offer as inadequate and not in Tull's or its holders' best interests.
