 For Norway's Crooks, The Hardest Time Is Before They Get to Jail --- Surge in Drugs, Thefts Means Waiting Years for a Cell; Mr. Sandli Comes Clean   By By Philip Shishkin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2003  In 1998, four months before he asked Ms. [Aida Hassan] for their first dance, Mr. [Sandli] was arrested with nearly 4 1/2 pounds of hashish. Norway's strict drug laws got him a three-year prison sentence. But because the country is chronically short on jail space and he hadn't committed a violent crime, Mr. Sandli was told he would wait months or even years to do his time. In the meantime, he cleaned up his life -- but didn't tell his new love about the ghost in his past. When he finally had no choice, "my whole body just collapsed," Ms. Hassan recalls.  Three months into the prison queue, Mr. Sandli spotted Ms. Hassan, but kept the conviction to himself. Every time Mr. Sandli thought he had found the courage to tell her, something got in the way. First, his girlfriend's estranged ex-husband and father of her two children committed suicide. Ms. Hassan's own father died about a year later, and then so did Mr. Sandli's. He quit asking his lawyer to put him behind bars as fast as possible.  On the day he confessed, Ms. Hassan first felt angry, and then sorry for Mr. Sandli. She told her two older children that the man they viewed as their stepfather would be locked up. The boys asked if he would have any food there. The next day, Ms. Hassan drove Mr. Sandli to prison, with the kids in the backseat.
