 Seats of Power: Reforms in Russia Depend on Outcome Of Governors' Races --- Saratov Incumbent Trounces Communist Challenger In Key `Red Belt' Vote --- `Permission to Spit' on Yeltsin   By By Neela Banerjee, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1996  The first elections were held Sunday here in Saratov, 750 miles east of Moscow, where final results show that with 60% turnout, the Yeltsin-backed incumbent, Dmitry Ayatskov, trounced his Communist challenger, Anatoly Gordeyev, 81% to 16%.  But the greatest threat to reform may come from the Kremlin-backed candidates themselves, mainly incumbents. The very election of these governors, most of them appointed by Mr. Yeltsin, gives them new independence from Moscow, even as they remain dependent on the Kremlin for their regions' finances. As their campaigns unfold, many are clearly bent on slowing or undoing some market reforms. They are talking about a return to everything from price controls on food to greater state interference in business -- exactly what the Yeltsin presidency has battled since 1992.  In the charismatic 45-year-old Mr. Ayatskov (a-YAT-skov), the Yeltsin camp found the key to breaking the opposition's hold on Saratov. A former poultry-plant director and vice mayor of the city of Saratov, the region's capital, Mr. Ayatskov ran against Mr. Gordeyev, an economic adviser to Mr. Zyuganov, and Vitaly Pavlov, a reformist candidate.
