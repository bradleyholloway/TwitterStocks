 Texaco Names Tilton to Succeed Bijur in Posts of Chairman, CEO   By By Thaddeus Herrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2001  Mr. [Chris Gidez] said the decision comes about a week before the combined Chevron Texaco is to announce key business team leaders for the new company. The merged company just completed planning its organizational structure, he said. A person familiar with the matter suggested that Texaco's board of directors may have encouraged Mr. [Peter I. Bijur] to resign. The Texaco board, said this person, saw the Texaco CEO as an obstacle to completing the merger with Chevron, San Francisco.  Mr. Bijur took the top job in July 1996. That fall, a former executive released tape-recorded conversations of Texaco officials making disparaging remarks about black employees that focused attention on a large race-discrimination suit against the company. Within weeks Mr. Bijur settled the suit for $176 million and committed to making changes in hiring and promotions.
