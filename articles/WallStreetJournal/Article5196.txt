 Business and Finance [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1995  GRAND METROPOLITAN agreed to buy Pet Inc. for $2.6 billion, or $26 a share, acquiring brand names such as Old El Paso Mexican foods and Progresso canned soups. Pet shares jumped 27%, but Grand Met shares slumped on fears about its debt levels. The purchase is the latest by a big food company looking for products to appeal to health-conscious consumers.  The Federal Reserve intervened in foreign exchange markets to prop up the peso. The intervention, although considered comparatively light, was enough to strengthen the peso, but Mexican stocks suffered their largest one-day loss in more than five years.  Colgate-Palmolive agreed to pay $1.04 billion for American Home Products' Latin American oral-care business, its biggest acquisition ever.
