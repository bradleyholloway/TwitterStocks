 Snow Hints at Rift On Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae Accord   By McKinnon, John D, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2004  "Anything less than what I've outlined here today as the essential elements of authority for the new supervisor would be inadequate, not credible reform," Mr. [John Snow] said. Mr. Snow also sought to underscore the lack of federal backing for the companies' activities, despite their lingering ties to the government as privatized agencies.  A spokesman for Mr. [Richard Shelby] suggested the committee would continue on its current path. "We are still seeking to craft a legislative proposal that can enjoy broad support in the committee, the Senate and with the administration," said spokesman Andrew Gray. "Sen. Shelby continues to believe that the new regulator for the housing [government-sponsored enterprises] should be located independent of the Treasury."
