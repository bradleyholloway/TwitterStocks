 Moving On: Good Mother / Bad Mother -- The Debate Over Staying Home With Kids Gets Ugly   By By Jeffrey Zaslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2002  Of course it does, but parenting is always about choices and less-than-perfect options. Last week, middle-school parents convincingly argued that bigger kids have bigger problems that need closer parenting. In response, I heard from readers insisting that values are best taught -- and bonds best formed -- if moms stay home in the younger years. Then even if they return to work, they will have the rapport to better engage their kids as they get older. Meanwhile, other readers said mothers should stay home the entire time from birth to college.  Among readers who favor staying home when kids are young, many mentioned a well-publicized recent study showing that when moms work full-time in a baby's first nine months, their children lag in intellectual development behind kids of stay-at-home and part-time moms. The study was led by Jeanne Brooks-Gunn at Columbia University's Teachers College.  Mothers who worked until their kids hit middle school challenge such harsh assessments. Marilynn Mobley of Marietta, Ga., quit a high-paying job at IBM when her oldest daughter started sixth grade. "Working while my kids were young allowed me to build my credibility so that I was able to start a consulting practice." Now she works only when her kids are at school and earns just as much money. "I plan my entire day around their schedule."
