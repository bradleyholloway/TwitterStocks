 Moving the Market: Merrill Adjusts Policy On Pension-Fund Fees; Changes Include Telling Clients About Dual Role, Issuing Some Refunds   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2007  Merrill also said it has changed the policy regarding its handling of fees collected from mutual funds, known as 12b-1 fees. Merrill had been keeping a portion of those fees to offset a pension fund's consulting fees, a practice criticized by observers as improper. Merrill said it will no longer retain any portion of 12b-1 fees.  Some critics aren't satisfied. "Pension funds who have Merrill as a consultant who haven't gotten a check should be asking why not, and pension funds who have gotten a check should determine whether that check is the full compensation that they are entitled to," said Edward Siedle, whose firm, Benchmark Financial Services Inc., specializes in investigations of pension abuses.
