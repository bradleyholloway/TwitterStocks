Records unit, is expected to take a top job at PolyGram N.V. as the high-flying music company continues to shuffle management.  A spokeswoman for London-based PolyGram declined to comment. Record industry executives said, however, that Mr. Eckstine was flying to London to discuss his fate with Alain Levy, PolyGram chairman. One music figure close to PolyGram said senior management is counting on Mr. Goldberg to help Mercury's artists "more fully develop their sales potential."
