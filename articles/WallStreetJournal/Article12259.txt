 SIA Board to Vote On Joining Group Against New Fees   By By Deborah Lohse and Patrick McGeehan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1997  Board members of the Securities Industry Association will vote tomorrow on whether to join a coalition of traders opposed to a Securities and Exchange Commission trading fee they claim is generating more revenue than intended.  The proposal, which is being presented to the 33-member board at its annual meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., would add the SIA to a coalition of traders lobbying to repeal the imposition of a 1/300 of 1% fee charged on trades between dealers. The controversial "Section 31" fee, which is ultimately paid to the U.S. Treasury but helps offset SEC funding, began applying to trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market as part of securities legislation passed in 1996.
