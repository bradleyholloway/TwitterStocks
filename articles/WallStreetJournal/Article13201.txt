 Rising Gas Prices May Force States To Suspend Tax   By Robert Guy Matthews, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  The Internal Revenue Service said it will temporarily allow all vehicles, including commercial trucks, to use dyed diesel fuel without being subject to a penalty. Dyed diesel usually is restricted to farming and government activities that aren't subject to excise taxes. Under the IRS easing, the usual diesel tax still will be owed when dyed diesel is used in nonexempt ways, but an additional penalty will be waived. California and Michigan also lifted state penalties on the use of dyed diesel fuel.  Georgia's one-month suspension of its gas tax and sales tax on gasoline is expected to cost the state $75 million, according to state officials. If Mr. [Brad Jones]'s bill is passed in Massachusetts, that state would lose an estimated $175 million. Oklahoma would see a $103 million decline in revenues under one state senator's proposal to suspend its 17 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel.  In the first eight months of the year, Georgia collected $75 million more in revenues than had been expected, due to an increase in sales- tax receipts resulting from climbing gas prices. The extra money will be offset by the one-month tax suspension. "We expect this to be revenue-neutral," said Shane Hix, a spokesman for Georgia's governor.
