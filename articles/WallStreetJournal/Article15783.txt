 Yeltsin to Fire Russian Tycoon, Possibly Signaling a Wider Purge   By By Andrew Higgins, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1999  The ouster of Boris Berezovsky as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, could presage a wider purge of senior officials embroiled in allegations of corruption, political analysts say. A Kremlin statement quoted by the Interfax news agency said Mr. (Boris) Yeltsin, who checked back into hospital last week with a bleeding ulcer, wanted Mr. Berezovsky fired because of "activities beyond his authority." Other members of the CIS must now endorse Mr. Yeltsin's decision, but this is largely a formality.  Mr. Yeltsin also signaled he might intervene to try to break a deadlock in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Yeltsin's chief of staff, Nikolai Bordyuzha, said the president might reshuffle Russia's negotiating team, make personal appeals by telephone, or take other steps. The IMF froze a $22.6 billion loan package for Russia last fall and talks to unblock it have made little progress.
