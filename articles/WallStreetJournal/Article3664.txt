 Favorite Son Candidacy   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2003  There is, for instance, Mr. [John Edwards]'s national finance co-chairman, Fred Baron (asbestos). Lawyers from his firm donated $56,250, people who lived at the same address as those lawyers gave another $24,000, and Mr. Baron provided a private airplane for the Senator on 15 different occasions. Of course, the Senator hasn't relied exclusively on Mr. Baron's aircraft -- he's used jets from four other law firms too, including those from Girardi & Keese (toxic chemicals) and Wilkes & McHugh (nursing homes).  We were trying to figure out what a secretary in Alabama earns these days when the Senator's campaign announced it would return $10,000 to employees of a Little Rock, Arkansas, law firm after one law clerk acknowledged that she expected her boss to pay her back for her $2,000 donation. Michelle D. Abu-Halmeh said that her boss, Tab Turner of Turner & Associates (SUV rollovers), "asked for people to support Edwards," and said "he would reimburse us." Mr. Turner then told reporters that he wasn't reimbursing her, because "apparently" it was illegal to do so. Apparently?
