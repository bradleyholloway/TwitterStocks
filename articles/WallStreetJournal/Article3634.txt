 IN THE LEAD: New Breed of CEOs, Raised in Affluence, Face New Vulnerability   By By Carol Hymowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2003  Similarly, P&G's Mr. Lafley, who took over in June 2000 following Durk Jager's sudden resignation, abandoned his predecessor's foray into pharmaceuticals and globalized brand names. Mr. Lafley, a 55-year-old understated but methodical boss, had employees focus on selling P&G's 10 traditional bestsellers, including Tide detergent, and Crest toothpaste. He cut costs through layoffs, and bet on dominance in the high-profit beauty business. He acquired Clairol for $5 billion in 2001 and is wooing customers to skincare, shampoos and cosmetics with a marketing campaign that blasts "Brand X."  No rubber stamps: These days, CEOs no longer approach board meetings as ritualistic events, where they make a formal presentation, elicit a few polite questions, then serve lunch. At GE, Mr. [Jeffrey R. Immelt], 46, made that clear last year when he increased the number of independent directors on the company's board, beefed up the auditing committee and asked two directors with business ties to GE to step down. The fees directors used to get for meetings have been abolished; 100% attendance is expected.  Reaching through the ranks. The 40-something CEOs tend to manage from the top all the way down the ranks. They candidly tell their employees that they don't have all the answers, and prefer to listen. GE's Mr. Immelt and P&G's Mr. Lafley have logged thousands of miles to visit employees. Gap's Mr. Presser, 46, plans to work in stores to see operations firsthand and to learn from employees.
