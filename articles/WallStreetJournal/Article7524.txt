 Insider Trail: --- How Detective Work Helped SEC to Crack St. Joe Minerals Case --- It Took 5 Years and Featured Tough Legal Skirmishing And Diplomatic Initiative --- Judge's Threat to Swiss Bank   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1986  In March 1981, Edgar M. Bronfman, the chairman of Joseph E. Seagram & Co., gave a glittering dinner party here in honor of his friend Giuseppe B. Tome, an Italian-born investment banker. Unbeknown to Mr. Bronfman, Mr. Tome had betrayed his trust and gone on an insider-trading spree two days earlier, making $1.4 million in illegal profits on advance word of Seagram's takeover bid for St. Joe Minerals Corp.  The pursuit of Mr. Tome (pronounced TOE-may) became the SEC's first -- and longest-running -- investigation of multimillion-dollar insider trading through offshore banks. The inquiry illustrates the difficulties of protecting U.S. markets from securities-law violators in Switzerland and other havens of banking secrecy. The St. Joe Minerals case has taken five years of detective work, diplomatic initiatives and legal skirmishes, with Mr. Tome and other defendants hiding behind phantom Panamanian companies and European bank-secrecy laws while their lawyers tried to thwart SEC efforts to obtain evidence.  On Tuesday, the agency won a victory. In a civil case, Federal Judge Milton Pollack found that Mr. Tome and an Italian business associate -- both of whom are in Europe and have refused to come to the U.S. -- had violated securities laws and ordered them to pay back their insider-trading profits with interest. In an unusual move, the judge also held Mr. Tome liable for the profits of his associate and certain still-unknown investors who traded on his tips about the Seagram bid. Mr. Tome's potential liability amounts to $5.8 million, including interest.
