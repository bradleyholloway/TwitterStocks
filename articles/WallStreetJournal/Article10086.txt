 Getting Going: Small Loss? Okay; Large One? No Way   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  "A 15%, 20%, 25% decline is a bummer," says Mr. [Charles Farrell], who is with Denver's Northstar Investment Advisors. "But it gets substantially worse as the declines get bigger."  "Let's say you're saving $10,000 a year in your 401(k) and you already have $30,000 in there," Mr. Farrell says. "If you lose a third, you can make that back with the next year's contribution. But if you have a $1 million portfolio and you lose a third, it can take years to get back to where you were."  Suppose you have half your nest egg in stocks and half in bonds. "If you're 50-50 and the stock market falls 20%, you might be down 10%," Mr. Farrell notes. "In fact, with the interest you get from your bonds, you might be down just 7% or 8% for the year. I'm a big advocate, especially in the later years, of being more balanced."
