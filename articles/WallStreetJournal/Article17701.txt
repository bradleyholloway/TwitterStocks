 ETA Systems Challenges the Supercomputer Giant --- But Hitches Are Slowing the Newcomer In Race With Cray Research   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1987  In late December, ETA, 89% owned by Control Data Corp., shipped its first supercomputer, boasting that its new line would run faster than the fastest Cray computer. The company's brash confidence is reflected right down to the bold red letters on its envelopes proclaiming: "We will win the supercomputer race."  It may -- someday. But for now, the new supercomputer, the ETA-10, is off to a slow start. Its operating system hasn't been debugged. Despite a crash effort, the company is behind schedule on writing software. And disagreements over the level of funding from Washington to purchase ETA supercomputers for university research centers have delayed early orders.  Not that ETA's problems with the machine are insurmountable; indeed, in some ways the new entry has changed the supercomputer business. Designed on computers and built largely by robots, the new machine uses chips, circuitry and architecture that likely will be imitated. ETA's highly automated factory is a model for low-cost production. Control Data and ETA executives believe the automation eventually will make the ETA-10 less expensive than Cray machines.
