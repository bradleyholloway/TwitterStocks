 Chrysler Plans To Close Plant At Detroit Site --- New Facility Is to Be Built, Two Subcompact Models Expected to Be Dropped   By By Bradley A. Stertz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1989  Chrysler Corp. is expected to soon announce it will close its aging and under-used Jefferson Avenue assembly plant here and discontinue production of the subcompact cars it builds.  The plant closing will idle about 2,000 hourly and salaried workers at least until Chrysler opens a proposed new Jefferson Avenue plant it plans to build adjacent to the old facility. Union officials at the old plant said yesterday they were unaware of any pending shutdown.  Although the United Auto Workers contract with Chrysler calls for a moratorium on plant closings, the Jefferson Avenue situation offers the auto maker a unique loophole. Chrysler can announce it will idle the old plant until the new plant's expected opening in 1992 and then shutter the older facility permanently.
