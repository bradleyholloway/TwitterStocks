 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: Private Properties   By Casselman, Ben, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2007  Ms. [Meryl Streep] and her husband, sculptor Donald Gummer, bought the property in 1995 for about $2.2 million. They put it on the market in 2004 for $12 million and cut the price twice. Ms. Johnson bought it in October 2005, public records show. Paula Del Nunzio, who's listing the property with Brown Harris Stevens colleague John Burger, wouldn't discuss the current owner, but says the home hasn't been renovated since it sold. She cited a rising market for townhouses and a "scarcity factor" for the higher price.  The Reeves bought the home 14 years ago for just under $1 million, records show, and renovated it to accommodate Mr. [Dana Reeve]'s wheelchair after the actor, best known for starring in the 1978 film "Superman" and its sequels, was paralyzed in a 1995 horseback riding accident. Mr. Reeve died in 2004 at age 52. Ms. Reeve, an actress who became a high-profile advocate for the disabled after her husband's injuries, died in March at age 44. The home went on the market shortly after Ms. Reeve's death, with an asking price of $2.95 million, which was later cut to $2.595 million.
