 The Mideast Peace Pact That Backfired --- Oslo Accord's Flaws Figure In Latest Violence in Israel   By By Amy Dockser Marcus, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1996  Following riots that left more than 75 people dead, President Clinton held meetings this week in Washington in an effort to get Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat back to the negotiating table. They agreed to begin nonstop negotiations this Sunday, aimed at setting a date for the redeployment of Israel's army from the West Bank city of Hebron.  Yet even if the two sides do show good will during the talks, the Oslo process -- named after the Norwegian city where secret negotiations between the parties began -- may be doomed anyway. That prospect is particularly dangerous in light of the current tensions, with Israeli tanks still lined up outside West Bank cities now under Palestinian control.  It wasn't supposed to be that way when the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Arafat shook hands in 1993 on the White House lawn and proclaimed the end of the 100-year Arab-Israeli conflict. Oslo was modeled on the 1978 Camp David accords signed between Israel and Egypt, the culmination of the idea that Arab-Israeli peacemaking should be done through interim arrangements that defer hard issues until later and help build confidence along the way.
