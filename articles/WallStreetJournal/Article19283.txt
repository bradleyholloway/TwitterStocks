 Treasury Takes Serious Look at Whether Workers Get Enough Details on Pension-Payout Choices   By By Ellen E. Schultz, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  William Wyatt, a 50-year-old computer consultant, left International Business Machines Corp. in July and had a crucial decision: either take his pension as a lump sum of cash, or as a monthly payment in retirement.  Yesterday, the Treasury Department confirmed it is taking a serious look into just this issue: whether employers are giving people like Mr. Wyatt enough information about their pension-payout choices. Making the wrong decision -- and the wrong decision, for many people, is choosing the lump sum -- can cost an employee tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Treasury, in a letter to be released publicly next week, noted: "For many individuals, the choice . . . is one of the most important financial decisions they will ever make."  The issue was raised after scores of employees at IBM complained that the company doesn't make the choices clear enough to employees leaving the company, according to a staffer for Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa). It was Sen. Harkin's January letter to the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service -- which referred only to a "technology manufacturer with over 100,000 employees" -- that prompted the Treasury's interest.
