 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  Sony Corp. is making progress toward its goal of capturing 10% of the global market for digital SLR cameras, a company spokesman said, an early sign of success for the company's push into the high-end camera market. Keiichi Ishizuka, a deputy senior manager in the Tokyo consumer-electronics company's camera division, said Sony had nearly reached its initial target of 10% of global SLR, or single-lens reflex, camera sales. Mr. Ishizuka added that sales were fading for the company's first SLR model released more than a year ago, and the "very latest figure was around 7%." He was confident Sony could attain the 10% mark this year. Sony's new digital SLR camera, the Alpha 700, will go on sale in November.
