 Stocks Decline in Bumpy Session, Dashing Some Hopes for Stability   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1987  Yesterday's trouble for the stock and bond markets started with a weaker dollar and sharp declines in European stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 63 points in the first 45 minutes of trading.  Lack of substantial progress by the White House and congressional negotiators to find ways to trim the federal budget deficit "put the jitters back into" the market, said Thomas Ryan, head of block trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York. He believes the market's recovery in the prior five sessions had been partly fueled by growing expectations that meaningful steps would be taken to close the budget gap.  The stock market bounced back in the final hour of yesterday's session and closed off 50.56 at 1963.53. Traders attributed some of the rebound to a statement by President Reagan in which he repeated his earlier stand that "everything except Social Security" is negotiable in this current round of budget-cutting talks. Traders said there were also rumors -- never confirmed -- that lawmakers in Washington were working on a package to trim $60 billion from the federal budget over the next two years.
