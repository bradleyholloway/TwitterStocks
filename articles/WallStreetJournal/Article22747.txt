 Letters to the Editor: Global Warming Has a Long History   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2001  Your comments about Dr. Keigwin's Sargasso Sea study reminded me that the the Journal on Jan. 18, 2000, had an article titled "Global Warming is 300-Year-Old News." I was so impressed with it that I cut it out and referred to it again yesterday. It included a chart showing the temperatures in the Sargasso Sea from 1000 B.C. to 1975 A.D. It shows temperatures varying from 71 to almost 78 degrees Fahrenheit. The two warmest temperatures were in about 900 and 600 B.C. and the two coolest were about 100 and 1600 A.D.
