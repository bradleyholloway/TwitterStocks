 Crude Oil's Ascent Causes Bond Market to Slip Despite Forecasts That Interest Rates Won't Rise   By By John Parry, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2000  Mr. [Kevin Flanagan] of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that depending on whether the next batch of first-tier economic data -- most notably the September U.S. employment report slated for release Friday -- confirm the U.S. economy is slowing, the yields of short-dated Treasurys could then fall below those of the long bond.  "Inversion" means that yields of longer-dated Treasurys are lower than those of shorter-dated ones. The trend began in January, after the government indicated it would start a program to buy back $30 billion of mainly longer-dated Treasurys this year, pushing the long bond's price up and its yield down.  Yesterday, many Treasury-market participants bought shorter-dated Treasurys and sold longer-dated Treasurys, noted Mr. [Dana Johnson] of Banc One Capital Markets. That was driving the inverted yield curve between two-year and 30-year Treasurys toward disinversion.
