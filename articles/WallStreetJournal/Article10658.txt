 REVIEW --- Books -- Five Best: A Personal Choice: Peter Collier --- on portraits of writers' lives   By Collier, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2012  There are extended set pieces, including a heartbreaking one on the murder of Amis's spunky cousin Lucy Partington by the infamous serial killer Fred West. Every memoir is a private investigation, but James Ellroy makes the connection explicit in this amped-up exploration of the brutal murder of his mother, Geneva, in 1958 when he was 10 years old.
