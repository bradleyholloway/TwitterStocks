 KPMG Is Ordered To Release Data Under IRS Probe   By Weil, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2004  The ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan of Washington marks the latest twist in the IRS's two-year civil investigation into KPMG's promotions of various tax shelters in recent years, some of which the IRS has designated as abusive transactions. In a December court filing on behalf of the IRS, the Justice Department accused KPMG of improperly withholding shelter-related documents from the agency and engaging in improper delaying tactics. Separately, a federal grand jury is conducting a criminal investigation into KPMG's former tax- shelter activities.
