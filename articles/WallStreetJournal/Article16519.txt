 Prosecutors Probe Lodi Financing For Purchase of Antonveneta Stake   By Gabriel Kahn in Rome, Alessandra Galloni in Florence and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2005  Netherlands-based ABN Amro Holdings NV had acquired 20.7% of Antonveneta and made an all-cash bid of 25 euros ($33.22) a share for the Padua lender. But ABN Amro was dealt a setback on Saturday, when Lodi and several allies mustered more than 51% of Antonveneta's shares and replaced Antonveneta's 15-member board with a slate of candidates put forth by Lodi. Antonvenenta's shares closed yesterday at 25.89 euros, down five cents.  The investigation, now in its initial phase, isn't targeting any individual or institution. But financial police in Milan found 18 bank accounts opened at Lodi in the past year by a group of individuals, many of them located in the wealthy city of Brescia, not far from the city of Lodi, a person familiar with the probe said. The accounts held a total of around 545 million euros. Investigators suspect the accounts were largely financed with loans extended by Lodi at favorable interest rates, and that a large part of the money in the accounts was used to buy Antonveneta shares, this person said. At least some of those shares were resold to other buyers, this person added.
