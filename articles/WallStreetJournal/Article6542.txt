 Suez's 2005 Profit Jumped 48% On Strength at Energy Division   By Anne-Sylvaine Chassany, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2006  "Electrabel is not for sale," Mr. [Gerard Mestrallet] told reporters when asked if he was open to cooperation between Electrabel and Enel. But he added, "We're always open to projects with anybody as long as they create value for our group."  Suez in August acquired the 49.9% stake it didn't own in Electrabel to capture 100% of the division's operating cash flow. The deal is expected to have a positive impact on group net results in 2007, Suez said.
