 O Canada! Quebec Agency Wields Clout --- Big Pension Fund Plays Activist Role In Cable-TV Battle   By By Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2000  The [Caisse], which holds a 17% voting stake in Videotron, first invested in a small predecessor company in the early 1970s. After Videotron's board agreed unanimously in February to sell the company to Rogers, the Caisse's Mr. [Jean-Claude Scraire] indicated the agency was withholding judgment on the deal -- even though it had two representatives on the Videotron board.  On the last business day before Videotron shareholders were to vote on the deal, Quebecor and a Caisse unit specializing in communications investments unveiled a joint proposal to buy Videotron. They valued the proposed deal at US$4 billion. Caisse also won a temporary injunction in Quebec Superior Court, blocking Videotron's founding Chagnon family from voting its shares.  The Chagnons cried foul, saying their understanding was that Caisse had tacitly accepted the Rogers offer. Other Videotron shareholders, such as Mr. [Stephen Jarislowsky], complained the board hadn't informed them of details of the Chagnons' pact with the Caisse, under which the Caisse claimed its veto power. Videotron's board has dismissed the current Quebecor proposal as too sketchy.
