 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Outside Audit: Icos Holder Dismisses Lilly's Offer; Hedge Fund Tells Board Cialis Maker Is Worth More, Based on Similar Buyouts   By Jones, Steven D, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2006  "The Icos board conducted a thorough and careful review and unanimously concluded that this transaction will deliver immediate, compelling value," Icos said Friday. "We are confident that this is a very positive transaction for shareholders."  John Schroer, an investment manager with HealthCor, said the deal was "extremely lucrative for Lilly shareholders and extremely lucrative for management," but left Icos investors "out in the cold."  HealthCor also questioned the severance package for Paul Clark, Icos's chief executive, that was amended the day before the deal was announced. Mr. Clark stands to receive more than $30 million in the value of options, accelerated option vesting, change-of-control payments and bonuses, HealthCor claimed. Eight other executives stand to gain an additional $40 million. The HealthCor letter called the compensation "egregious."
