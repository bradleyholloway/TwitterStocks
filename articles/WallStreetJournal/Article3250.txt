 Media Focus on Candidate's Fashion Showcases a Political Double Standard   By By Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1999  Take the report of a Dole campaign visit to home state North Carolina. Mrs. Dole "glided into fund-raising events in Greensboro and Winston-Salem in her lilac power suit and black pumps," a local newspaper noted at the top of a story about "the woman behind the rolled pearls who wants to be president."  Candidate Dole kept her humor about the media's fashion sense, said Dole spokeswoman Kathleen Harrington. "But it really ticked me off."  Many news stories on Mrs. Dole's campaign never mentioned her appearance, of course. But many did -- unlike most reports on her male rivals. In an interview just a day before she decided to end her campaign yesterday, Mrs. Dole cited examples of press attention to her attire. "I think this is proof that we still have sexist stereotypes to deal with in our society," she added, still sounding like she was wearing a smile.
