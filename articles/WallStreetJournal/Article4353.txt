 Viewpoint: Skepticism About the Soviets Is Alive and Well   By By Hodding Carter III, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1987  A specter seems to be haunting a large number of Americans who are paid to comment on public affairs. It might be called the ghost of "glasnost" future, when a gulled West lays down its arms and takes up its chains. Their commentary has peaked during this remarkable summit week in Washington, but their thinly veiled contempt for the intelligence of most of the rest of us has been just below the surface for a long time. As they see it, the sinisterly effective Soviet propaganda of the Gorbachev era has found a receptive sounding board in the Western public at large.  But far more serious people also profess themselves to be deeply worried. Some suggest that the Gorbachev phenomenon is weakening our awareness that "there can be no moral equality between a democracy and a dictatorship," as A.M. Rosenthal succinctly put it in a New York Times column this week. For Mr. Rosenthal, the ephemeral reaction in Europe and America to the seemingly spontaneous Soviet leader could presage an ominous, more permanent shift in public attitudes.  "Skepticism about glasnost is not quite fashionable in the world of political fashion," he wrote. What world is he talking about? What fashion? Certainly not the world reflected in the columns and commentary offered by the newspapers and journals read by most of us, whether in Washington, New York, Chicago, Houston or Miami. Who is awarding "the Soviet dictatorship full moral equality with the U.S.," to pull out another Rosenthal quote? Most of what I read and hear has caution firmly at the center.
