 Reagan's Budget: Conciliatory Approach -- Reagan Budget Aims to Deflect Criticism Launched at His Previous Fiscal Policies --- Less Than Half of Savings Result From Cutbacks In Domestic Programs --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1987  The budget President Reagan submitted to Congress yesterday shows signs that his administration is taking past criticism into account in shaping its approach to the nation's fiscal problems.  Congress remains unlikely to accept the priorities that Mr. Reagan has once again set forth -- higher military spending, accompanied by shrinkage in the size of domestic government. But perhaps the most striking feature of the new budget is the fact that among its $42.4 billion in proposed savings for fiscal 1988, less than half -- $18.7 billion -- come from cuts, terminations and restraint in the growth of domestic programs.  In an effort to preempt congressional critics who call him heartless, Mr. Reagan is proposing to increase funding for job training and for research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He is launching what he calls "initiatives" to help the homeless, although his most significant move in that area is to propose continued funding for an emergency program he previously tried to kill.
