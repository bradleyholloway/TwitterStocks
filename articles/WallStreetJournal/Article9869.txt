 Microsoft Is Curbing Use of PVC, a Popular Plastic   By Herrick, Thaddeus, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2005  Health and environmental advocates say PVC poses a threat because when produced or burned it releases dioxins, chemicals that potentially cause cancer in humans. Plasticizers in PVC known as phthalates also are opposed by critics concerned that they may cause reproductive disorders in humans. Plasticizers are needed to make brittle plastic soft and pliable.  The Vinyl Institute responds that the industry's emissions of dioxins are a tiny fraction of the total dioxin emissions in the U.S. The group also cites EPA data that show overall emissions of dioxins in the U.S. declining by 80% between 1987 and 1995.
