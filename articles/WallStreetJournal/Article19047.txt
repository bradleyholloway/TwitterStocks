 Unease Fueled Vote Against Bilingual Education   By By June Kronholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1998  Widespread unease over the performance of U.S. public schools helped fuel passage of the California initiative ending bilingual education for the state's 1.4 million non-English-speaking youngsters.  Proposition 227, ending 30 years of bilingual instruction in California schools, passed with about 61% of the vote, and was immediately challenged in court by immigrant-rights groups.  The initiative requires the state's schools to dismantle programs that keep children in bilingual classes for as long as seven years and substitute a year of English immersion for those programs. After that, students will be placed in classes with their English-speaking peers.
