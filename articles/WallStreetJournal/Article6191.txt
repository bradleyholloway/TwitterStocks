 Convertible Debt Issues Pick Up, But Deal by Wells Fargo Fizzles   By By Tom Barkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  Convertibles are fixed-income instruments that can be converted into shares of the issuer at a specified level. Some investors cited the Wells Fargo deal's conversion level and the relative stability of its stock price as key reasons for the issue's lackluster trading level.  Yesterday's deal has a 110.75% conversion level -- the steepest participants in the convertibles market could recall. Wells Fargo's stock price would have to more than double before the convertibles would be "in the money," making it attractive to convert them into shares.  The Wells Fargo deal was issued as a Rule 144a private placement, so underwriters are prohibited from commenting. Wells Fargo officials weren't available to comment.
