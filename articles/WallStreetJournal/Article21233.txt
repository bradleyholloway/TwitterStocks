 We Recommend Taking the Bus; They Say Parking Can Be Murder   By By Joseph Pereira, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1988  If you're in Connecticut and nuclear war should break out between the Soviet Union and the U.S., don't head for the hills. Head for a town like Mansfield.  Connecticut's 3.2 million residents were supposed to escape to New York, Vermont and Massachusetts in an emergency. Connecticut, however, had to revise its evacuation plans, in part because its residents were just not wanted elsewhere.  The citizens of Vermont had said, "Over my dead body you will seek shelter in our state," says Frank Mancuso, director of Connecticut's State Office of Civil Preparedness, which helped revise the evacuation plan. Without the revision, Connecticut risked losing $130 million in federal disaster aid.
