 Letters to the Editor: A Blanket Indictment Of Quilts as Art Form   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2002  I suggest that the assertion of Jonathon Glus, as quoted by Mr. Barnes, that institutions giving star treatment to quilts are "essentially lazy" more appropriately applies to your cheap shot against quilt artists.  It is true that many quilts throughout history were made to cover your mother's or grandmother's bed. But it is also true that many more quilts have been made only to grace walls in homes, businesses -- and in museums. Many of these works of art are very expensive, commissioned pieces.
