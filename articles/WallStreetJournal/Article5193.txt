 World Wire [4]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 9, 1994  Toyota Motor Corp. expects to expand its businesses substantially beyond its core auto-making in the next decade, said Iwao Isomura, executive vice president. Revenue from non-automotive lines is projected to increase to 10% from the current 2% to 3% of the company's total, which was $94.6 billion in the year ended June 30. Toyota opened a prefabricated housing unit in 1975 and has fledgling operations such as computerized auto-navigation systems and cellular telephone services.  An Anglo-French group won a $625 million British government contract to build 100 subway trains for the London Underground. GEC Alsthom will finance the project and maintain the trains, with revenue based on performance for two decades. The trains will serve the Northern Line, which has a fleet mostly dating from 1956-62 that subjects 108 million passengers a year to overcrowding, delays and breakdowns. GEC Alsthom is a venture of General Electric Co. PLC of Britain and Alcatel-Alsthom NV of France.
