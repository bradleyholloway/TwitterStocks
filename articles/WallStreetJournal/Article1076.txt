 Business Technology: Samsung Again Doubles Capacity of Flash Chips   By Ramstad, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  In announcing the 32-gigabit benchmark, Samsung's top chip executive, Hwang Chang Gyu, said he expects revenue for the chip division to hit a record this quarter. Samsung's previous record for chip sales was 5.09 trillion won ($5.32 billion) in last year's fourth quarter.  This year, Toshiba got a six-month head start on Samsung in sales of eight-gigabit flash-memory chips. Samsung had announced its capacity to build such chips in September 2004, but it started shipping them only two months ago, attributing the delay to difficulties with a new production process. Samsung said it resolved them for the 16-gigabit flash-memory chip, which should reach the market early next year.
