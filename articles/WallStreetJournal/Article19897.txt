 Love & Money: How Much We'll Need in Retirement   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2005  Consider today's column the sequel. While it's important to know what you're saving for, it's equally important to know what that might cost. After all, you certainly don't want to reach retirement only to discover your savings can't fund your expectations.  My starting point is the $4,000. That covers my family's basic monthly needs today. I exclude expenses such as education and child care because I'm confident those won't exist. But I include expenses such as the mortgage, even though we'll most likely extinguish ours before retiring.  Moreover, there's no guarantee my job, or [Amy]'s job, will continue until we hit 67, or that Social Security will provide what we expect. I'd rather save what we can while we can, in the event that we're unable to save as much as we need to later. If we wind up overprepared in the end, well, that beats underprepared any day.
