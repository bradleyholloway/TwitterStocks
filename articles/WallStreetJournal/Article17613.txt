 Boeing Wins Cathay Pacific Order for 747s --- Job for Hong Kong Carrier Could Total $1.6 Billion; Piedmont May Buy 737s   By By Roy J. Harris Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1986  Boeing Co., continuing its strong 1986 commercial-aircraft sales pace, won a potentially huge 747 order from Cathay Pacific Airways.  The company's Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. unit said it received an order from Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific for two 747-400 long-range jetliners, which sell for about $125 million each. Boeing said that if the options for other Cathay Pacific 747 purchases are converted to firm orders, the total sale could be valued at $1.6 billion, including spare parts.  The Cathay Pacific order brings to more than $6 billion the value of 747-400s sold in firm orders since Boeing's initial order by NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit last year. Cathay Pacific, which selected British-based Rolls Royce Ltd.'s engines for the planes, becomes the fifth airline to order the 418-passenger plane. Its 747-400s, with a range of 8,000 miles, will be delivered in April and May of 1989, Boeing said.
