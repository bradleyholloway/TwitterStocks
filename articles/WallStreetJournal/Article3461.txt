 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Ye Shall Be as Gods   By By Roger Kimball, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 2001  In Washington, before an audience of about 150 people, four distinguished commentators paid homage to [Whittaker Chambers]: the columnist Robert Novak; the writer Ralph de Toledano; William F. Buckley Jr., who enlisted Chambers to write for National Review when he started it in 1955; and Sam Tanenhaus, whose acclaimed biography of Chambers appeared in 1997.  In the extraordinary "Letter to My Children" that prefaces "Witness," Chambers insisted that the essence of communism lay not in its economics, its political system or even its tyranny. The essence of communism was its vision of mankind emancipated from God. Communism embodied what Chambers called "man's second oldest faith," "the great alternative faith" articulated by the serpent's promise to Eve in the garden of Eden: "Ye shall be as gods."  Such a statement is disquieting partly because, as Chambers saw, communism has no monopoly on the process of self-deification. At the heart of "Witness" was a warning about "the extent to which the Western world shares communism's materialist vision." Chambers spoke in this context of the "road that the logic of technological civilization points out."
