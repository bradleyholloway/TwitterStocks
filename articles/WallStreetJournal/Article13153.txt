 Ford Will Attempt To Trim 1,000 Jobs With Buyout Offer   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  An attorney for Mr. [Martin Leach] confirmed the settlement, but neither the attorney nor Ford would disclose the amount of the settlement. Mr. Leach was seeking $40 million in damages.  Mr. Leach left Ford in August 2003 after he was offered a job at Fiat. He won a court order barring Ford from enforcing a noncompete clause that prohibits employees from working for another auto maker within two years of leaving Ford. The auto maker continued to seek monetary damages, however.
