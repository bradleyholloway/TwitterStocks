 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus: To Some, All Moons Are Saturnine   By Varadarajan, Tunku, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2005  So the recent landing on Titan -- Saturn's largest moon -- of a probe dispatched from Earth all of seven years ago is but the latest fruit of the love affair between science and the human imagination. We've come a long way from Stonehenge.  In some cultures, however, science provokes neither admiration nor intellectual hunger but, instead, a fierce political resistance. V.S. Naipaul has written irrefutably of the conflict between the West and the Islamic world as being a conflict over modernity. In essence, the discord is about science and the imagination -- our open-ended science and their tightly sealed imagination.  Our Islamist antagonists have an underdeveloped sense of science, chiefly because of their inability to let the (sacred) Word slip out of the mullah's grasp. The empirical will always struggle to exist alongside the religious in lands where godly texts are not open to candid evaluation. How can there be data-testing -- and an impartial imagination -- if no one asks hard questions, if one is taught that all the answers to everything exist already, in the Book?
