 U.S. Charges Bond Bilked His Clients --- Fund Manager Faces '99 Kickback Case, Too   By By Jerry Markon and Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2001  Mr. [Alan Bond] held his accounts at Neuberger, while the trades were executed by Reynders Gray & Co. in Manhattan, according to officials at the companies. Charlton Reynders, chief executive of the Reynders firm, said he called both [Neuberger Berman] and Mr. Bond about six weeks ago to complain about a pattern of unprofessional trade cancellations and rebillings. He said the activity stopped after his phone calls.  According to the December 1999 indictment, Mr. Bond's clients paid commissions on trades to brokerage firms that employed an alleged accomplice of Mr. Bond's. Mr. Bond allegedly instructed the firms on how much of a markup to charge on each trade; the firms, in turn, allegedly kicked back 57% to 80% of the markups to Mr. Bond.  According to a separate civil case filed at the time by the SEC, Mr. Bond used the money to pay for a lavish lifestyle, which included buying 75 classic cars and spending extravagantly on limousine service, overnight stays at posh New York hotels and tickets to sporting events. Court documents said Mr. Bond ran up American Express bills of as much as $470,000 a month. The SEC case, in which Mr. Bond also denied wrongdoing, has been stayed pending the outcome of the criminal case.
