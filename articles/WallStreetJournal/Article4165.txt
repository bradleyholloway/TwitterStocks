 U.S. Is Urging Mexico to Meet Debt Schedule --- Talks Begin in Both Nations To Bar Unilateral Curb On Interest Payments   By By Art Pine And Mary Williams Walsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1986  Although Mexico, whose export earnings have fallen with the price of oil, still hasn't decided how to ease its financial squeeze, U.S. officials are worried about a number of possible moves by the government of Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado. These could include refusing to pay $1.8 billion in interest due July 1 or otherwise moving on its own to curb payments.  High-level discussions between U.S. and Mexican officials began yesterday in Washington and Mexico City. Mexican Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog is expected to meet soon in Washington with Treasury Secretary James Baker, Secretary of State George Shultz, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and officials at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  So far, Mexico hasn't received much sympathy from the U.S., the IMF or commercial banks. Although most officials concede that the U.S. would loosen its purse strings if that seemed necessary to prevent a political upheaval in Mexico, the Reagan administration has taken a relatively hard line by withholding financial aid until Mexico does more to restructure its economy.
