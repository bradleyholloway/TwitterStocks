 U.S. Expands Scrutiny of Home Lenders   By Efrati, Amir, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2007  Leonard DePasquale, an assistant U.S. trustee from Rhode Island, said in a November hearing in federal bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh that after reviewing cases filed since 2002, "we have a specific and grave concern that Countrywide" is trying to obtain money and property from debtors "under false pretenses." In one case he cited, Countrywide allegedly inflated the amount owed by the borrower by more than $7,000. He spoke of "the harm that's done to debtors who are in a financially disadvantaged position that cannot litigate and fight one of the world's largest financial corporations."  Tom Connop, a Dallas lawyer who has been defending Countrywide against U.S. trustee probes, responded in the hearing that the agency's efforts were "part of an ongoing attack on Countrywide that has been prosecuted without cause, randomly throughout the nation," and that "Congress did not empower the U.S. Trustee to initiate wholesale investigations at a whim." A judge is considering the agency's request.  Earlier this year, in a Houston case, Charles F. McVay, a regional U.S. trustee, deposed several Countrywide employees and the company's lawyers in connection with the filing of court papers that Judge Jeff Bohm said contained "inaccurate debt figures and inaccurate allegations concerning payments received from the debtor." Mr. McVay said the agency needed to determine whether "such accounting errors are pervasive and frequent." Judge Bohm is currently considering sanctions against Countrywide and its lawyers.
