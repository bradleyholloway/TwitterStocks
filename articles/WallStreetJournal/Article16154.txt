 The Bright Side: Lower Stocks = Lower Tax Bill --- Capital-Gains Distribution For Mutual Funds Falls, Offering a Bit of Relief   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2002  That's because funds are required to distribute annually nearly all of the net gains that they reap by selling securities within their portfolios. Those capital-gains distributions, most commonly made around year end, aren't taxable to people holding fund shares in 401(k) plans and other tax-sheltered accounts. But taxable investors must pay tax on those distributions, even if they don't take the payments in cash and instead reinvest in additional fund shares.  One factor affecting the magnitude of funds' gains distributions is the degree to which funds' holdings have appreciated or depreciated since purchase. By the end of 1999, the net unrealized appreciation in stock-fund portfolios in the aggregate had swelled to 36% of fund assets, the ICI estimates. That helps explain why stock sales by mutual funds in 2000 produced such large capital gains and year-end distributions.  -- TAX-LOSS HARVESTING. This time-tested strategy involves selling fund holdings that have declined in value since purchase. Losses taken now can be used on 2002 returns to offset realized gains, if any. Net losses can then offset as much as $3,000 in other income (or $1,500 if married filing separately). Excess losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
