 Leading the News: Scrushy Indicted on Fraud Charges; HealthSouth's Former Chief Faces 85 Criminal Counts Tied to $2.7 Billion Scheme   By Carrick Mollenkamp and Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2003  The indictment said Mr. [Richard M. Scrushy] had regularly awarded his chief lieutenants lavish pay to win their cooperation in the scheme and at other times employed threats and intimidation to ensure their silence. He allegedly placed employees under surveillance, read their e-mails and eavesdropped on their calls. According to prosecutors, witnesses in the case feared Mr. Scrushy's security team at HealthSouth, which spent $10,000 on weapons in August 2002.  The government said Mr. Scrushy received about $60.5 million in salary and bonuses and stock options valued at more than $206 million from HealthSouth from 1996 to 2002. The indictment seeks the forfeiture of $278.7 million in assets from Mr. Scrushy, including homes, a 92-foot yacht in Florida, aircraft and a Lamborghini. Federal law-enforcement officials arrived at Mr. Scrushy's Birmingham home yesterday in unmarked cars and began an inventory of his assets.  Mr. Scrushy, a native of Selma, Ala., and a former respiratory therapist, started HealthSouth in 1984 and built it into a nationwide chain of rehabilitation clinics and surgery centers. HealthSouth's new management, which fired Mr. Scrushy March 31, said it continues to cooperate with investigators.
