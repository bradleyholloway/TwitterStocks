 Tale of Two Prefab-Home Firms Is Darwinian Lesson   By Selz, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1991  A correlation is drawn between Oakwood Homes Corp and Manufactured Homes Inc, two North Carolina prefabricated home companies. Once equally successful companies, a slump in the pre-fab home market in the late 1980s caused the two companies to seek different survival techniques.
