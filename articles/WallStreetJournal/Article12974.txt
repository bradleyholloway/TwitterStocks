 Treasurys Weaken on Jobs Report; U.S. Government Bonds Start Week on Defensive; More Selling Is Expected   By Michael Mackenzie and Angela Pruitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2003  "One month does not erase all of the pain we have seen," said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers. "It's the first step in a longer process and marks a stabilization, not the huge upward swing in payrolls growth that the Fed needs to see in order to start timing a rise in the federal funds rate."  Ian Morris, chief economist at HSBC in New York, said the bank is sticking to its forecast of another cut in the fed-funds rate during the first quarter of 2004. Although the September payrolls report was "better than expected," it didn't show a lot of strength, Mr. Morris said.  In the investment-grade sector, Huntington Bancshares Inc. sold $300 million of three-year notes via Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley. Rated single-A1 by Moody's Investors Service and single-A by Standard & Poor's, the yield was set at 0.73 percentage point over Treasurys, or 2.81%.
