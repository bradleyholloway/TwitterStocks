 West Nile Vaccine Prompts Antibodies in Tests   By Windham, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2004  The results of the Acambis study come as public-health officials brace for the sixth summer of West Nile virus in the U.S. No human cases have been reported so far this spring, but officials have detected the virus in birds and mosquitoes in 14 states, said Lyle Petersen, director of vector-borne infectious diseases at the CDC. Mosquitoes acquire the West Nile virus when they bite infected birds. The virus spreads to humans by mosquito bites.  In the study of 20 people, 15 received the live West Nile vaccine, which is based on a modified version of Acambis's yellow-fever vaccine. The rest of the group received the yellow-fever vaccine as a control. The antibodies against West Nile were generated within 21 days of the injection.  Acambis's vaccine research has been partly supported by a $3 million NIH grant. Though Acambis is first to bring a human West Nile virus vaccine into human trials, several biotechnology companies are vying to be first to market. One company, Dutch biotech firm Crucell NV, is hoping to get its vaccine, which is designed to induce antibodies to block infection, into human trials next year, said Jaap Goudsmit, chief scientific officer of Crucell.
