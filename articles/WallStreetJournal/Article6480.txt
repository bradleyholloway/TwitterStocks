 Honda to Offer U.S. Customers First Motorcycle With Air Bag   By Sapsford, Jathon, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 9, 2005  The world's largest motorcycle producer, which also makes such cars as the Accord and Civic, said it will be the first motorcycle producer to put an air bag on one of its bikes, and that it has chosen the U.S. market to launch it. The air bag will be available next spring on the 1800cc Honda Gold Wing motorcyle.  Honda said there were many technical hurdles to overcome in development. It put vents in the air bag that allow some air to escape when the driver hits it, to avoid bouncing the driver off the bike. In many cases, the driver still will be thrown from the bike. But the technology will act as a buffer, "reducing the velocity at which the rider may be thrown from the motorcycle and helping lessen the severity of injuries," Honda said.
