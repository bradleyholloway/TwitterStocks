 Health Costs Keep Different Pace; Spending Grows Faster For Americans Under 65, Government Report Says   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  Of the $5,276 spent per individual on health care in 2004, $802 was out-of-pocket, $1,898 came from private health insurance, $221 came from other private sources such as workplace clinics, $1,032 was from Medicare, $918 from Medicaid and $405 from other public sources such as state and local agencies.  President Bush and Congress are engaged in a debate over expanding the SCHIP health-insurance program for low-income children. Congress wants to expand the program, but the president vetoed that, opposing the costs and raising the concern that children would be shifted from private insurance plans to the new government coverage. But the report indicates that didn't happen after SCHIP was launched in 1997. The main impact of the new program was on out-of-pocket expenses for the families.
