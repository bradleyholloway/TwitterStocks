 The Grand Old Man of 'Muscletown'   By By Richard Koenig, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1985  York, Pa. -- As I was growing up near this central Pennsylvania town, I once caught a glimpse of Robert C. Hoffman, the father of U.S. weight lifting. He visited my high school to give a fitness lecture and a strongman's show. As he stood at the podium, wearing a white dress shirt and keeping a correct schoolteacher's demeanor, he snapped a chain by swelling his mighty chest. He was then in his 60s.  It was heady stuff for a skinny but hopeful boy. I sometimes spent my allowance on the high-protein pills made by Mr. Hoffman's York Barbell Co. And, I confess, I kept a York barbell by the foot of my bed.  He first promoted weight lifting while he was an executive at a York oil-burner company shortly after World War I. Top lifters, some of them his employees, competed under the company name. They became the first of many of Mr. Hoffman's "boys" to make it big when they went to the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. About the same time, Mr. Hoffman also started his barbell business. Weight lifters became managers. York became "Muscletown."
