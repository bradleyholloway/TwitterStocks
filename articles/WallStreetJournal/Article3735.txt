 Hewlett-Packard, Kodak Fall, But Foot Locker, Nike Advance   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2003  Traders couldn't point to a single reason for the late-session fall. They noted that the overseas bombings were a contributor, along with concerns about security of the U.S., as well as big sales by institutional investors. "We had some very large sell orders come through, and it just knocked the stuffing out of the market in the last 45 minutes," said Tom Schrader, managing director of listed trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker.  Dow Jones Industrial Average component Hewlett-Packard dropped 62 cents, or 2.8%, to $21.59 after posting a 10% jump in revenue and saying it was profitable in all four of its business units during the fiscal fourth quarter. But the company raised its revenue forecast for the current quarter, although it didn't do the same for earnings. There was also talk by analysts of tighter gross margins, which is considered a negative.  The loss by Marvell may have kept a cap on positive comments by Dow component Intel, which cited indications that countries outside the U.S. are beginning to reinvest in tech, but ended up falling 69 cents, or 2.1%, to 31.83 on Nasdaq.
