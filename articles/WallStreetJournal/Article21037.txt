 The Tudor Hegemony   By By Dale Harris, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1987  Dance is the most exemplary of the performing arts. From the discipline, the skill, the pride, the sense of communality that come into view every time the curtain rises on a company like New York City Ballet or Twyla Tharp Dance, a whole code of ethics can be inferred. Can be and is, in all likelihood, inferred by thousands nowadays. How else to explain why the last three representatives of dance chosen for Kennedy Center awards in the performing arts have stood out from virtually all the other honorees by virtue of being achievers rather than stars, significant creators rather than beloved entertainers?  In 1985, when an award went to Merce Cunningham, the heroic originator of post-modern dance, his fellow honorees included such national favorites as Beverly Sills and Bob Hope. In 1983 -- there was no award for dance in 1984 -- Katherine Dunham, the great pioneer of black ethnic dance, who labors today in a ghetto in East St. Louis, shared the spotlight with stars as widely acclaimed and richly rewarded as Frank Sinatra and James Stewart. This year, American Ballet Theatre's "Choreographer Emeritus" Antony Tudor took his place in the president's box beside Lucille Ball, Yehudi Menuhin, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and Ray Charles, all of them known far and wide for their remarkable accomplishments, but all, with the exception of Mr. Tudor and Mr. Charles, executants, rather than originators, of art.
