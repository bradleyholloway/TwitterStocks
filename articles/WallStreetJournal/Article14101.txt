 A Stitch in Time: Quilting for Peace   By By Nancy Melich, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1985  Spark Matsunaga, the Democrat from Hawaii, was the first senator to sleep under the National Peace Quilt. Just before Thanksgiving, he snuggled under this 8-by-10 patchwork brainchild of youthful designers from 50 states. The quilt was stitched in Boise, Idaho.  The National Peace Quilt is a project of the Boise Peace Quilters, the ninth quilt completed by this grass-roots organization, which maintains "headquarters" in several Boise living rooms.  The two Boise women, wives and mothers of small children, felt compelled to do something to make the world a safer place. They discussed crocheting coverlets, selling them and giving the money to a peace organization. Then Ms. [Anne] Hausrath came up with "this harebrained scheme of making a quilt for ordinary citizens of Russia. Since we were ordinary Americans, I thought why couldn't we take some concrete step toward understanding and gaining friendship with the Russian people. We decided that making a quilt and sending it to the Soviet Union would be a start."
