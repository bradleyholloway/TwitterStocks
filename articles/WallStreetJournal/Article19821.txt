 The Bush Victory: Voters Force Colorado Utilities To Use Renewable Resources   By Smith, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  "This was not seen as an environmental issue," said Matt Baker, executive director of the Environment Colorado Research and Policy Center, a proponent of the measure, Amendment 37. "We showed it's good for the economy."  The state's largest utility, Public Service Co. of Colorado, a unit of Xcel Energy Inc. of Minneapolis, opposed the measure and contributed more than $500,000 in a bid to defeat it. Wayne Brunetti, Xcel chairman, said his firm supports broadening the state's energy- resource mix, but opposed the measure because it was "poorly worded" and could result in raising utility costs.
