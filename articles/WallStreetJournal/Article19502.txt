 TV: Giants of the Jungle --- `Gorillas' Goes Easy on Dian Fossey While Revealing a Fragile, Majestic Beast on the Brink   By By Tunku Varadarajan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2002  Bill Weber and Amy Vedder -- a husband and wife team -- are two of them. They worked with [Dian Fossey] at various times in their careers and are remarkably restrained on camera in their account of their time with her. (By contrast, they discuss Fossey with great frankness and detail in their book, "In the Kingdom of Gorillas," in which there is a gruesome description of an occasion when she pistol-whipped a man suspected of poaching on her reserve, and then supervised his prolonged torture at her camp, including the rubbing of stinging nettles on his penis and testicles. Drs. Weber and Vedder write: "He was then given enough Valium to send him into a state of extreme disorientation. When he came to, Dian told him that she had taken his mind away, then given it back. Next time she would keep it.")  "Gorillas," the documentary -- like "Gorillas in the Mist," the 1988 film based on Fossey's life, starring Sigourney Weaver -- chooses not to delve into the darker recesses of Fossey's story. In fact, Fossey's presence in the documentary is pretty minimal, with the narrator, Martin Sheen, glossing over her perversities in describing her merely as a "colorful and controversial woman." (One wishes, and here I digress, that Mr. Sheen had remained in the West Wing, for his delivery is pure, and unnecessary, Hollywood. He has too much hushed breathlessness for my taste, and it is all very distracting. Why the producers felt the need to add him to the cast is a question beyond me. Weren't the gorillas good enough?)
