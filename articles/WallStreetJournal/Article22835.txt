 City of Brotherly Thugs   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2001  When Mr. [Mark Schweiker] did so, it only emboldened protestors. "We're going to shut down the streets," J. Whyatt Mondesire, head of the NAACP's Philadelphia chapter told the Inquirer, and that's exactly what happened Friday when the NAACP and a group of black ministers blocked an intersection during rush-hour traffic. The day before, several hundred students walked out of classes. And earlier a crowd consisting mostly of unionized district employees marched on City Hall, where they disrupted the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony and drowned out the choir with their chants.  Now, a public school system where 176 of 264 schools are on the failing list and one out of two kids drops out before finishing high school leaves much to protest. But these folks aren't protesting performance; they're protesting Governor Schweiker's reform. The key bone of contention is the state's desire to give the private company Edison Schools a big say in running the system, including the direct control of 45 schools. With unions, the NAACP and other anti-reform activists vowing to keep the heat on, Governor Schweiker needs to remember that this is not just an education issue; it's a civil-rights issue.
