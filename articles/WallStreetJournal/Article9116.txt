 Frankel's Life on the Lam Ends in Arrest --- German Detectives Capture Financier At Hamburg Hotel   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Ellen Joan Pollock and Mitchell Pacelle in New York and Christopher Rhoads in Hamburg, Germany, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1999  Those three words capped a bizarre financial scandal that began when Mr. (Martin) Frankel, 44 years old, disappeared in early May from his $3 million Greenwich, Conn., mansion. Firefighters responding to an alarm found an abandoned house with burning documents, with a "to do" list that included "launder money." By then, a house of cards Mr. Frankel allegedly had built to finance his lavish lifestyle was collapsing.  A U.S. arrest warrant issued in May charged Mr. Frankel with wire fraud and money laundering; if convicted, he faces as many as 25 years in prison on those charges. Arnold M. Weiner, a Baltimore criminal lawyer who isn't involved in the case, says Mr. Frankel could also be charged with other offenses, including mail fraud and securities and tax violations, and that he is "likely to receive a very harsh sentence."  So far, the federal government has been reluctant to cut any deals with members of Mr. Frankel's inner circle and has seized the luxury cars Mr. Frankel provided for many members of his entourage. Mr. Weiner suggests the government may prosecute a large number of people because it is such a large case.
