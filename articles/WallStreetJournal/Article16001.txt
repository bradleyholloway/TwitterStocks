 Valuations Are Still Reaching for the Skies On Many Stocks, Clouding Rally's Future   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Ken Brown, Scott Thurm and Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2001  Adds AQR's Mr. [Clifford Asness]: "I think the dot-coms were made the scapegoat of the bubble." He says Wall Street wants investors to believe that all the excesses have been flushed out of the system -- many dot-coms are off 90% or more from their early 2000 highs -- and today's remaining high valuations are not a problem. "What Wall Street wants is reasons for the bubble that are over" because ongoing reasons "are not so good" for the market's outlook.  This sobering thought seemed to trickle through the market yesterday, when JDS and Juniper gave back big chunks of Wednesday's gains. As of 4 p.m. yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, JDS was down 11% or $5.75 to $47.88 and Juniper had declined 5.1%, or $6.69 to $125.31. But shares of Cisco and Nortel continued to climb.  "We think of GE as being overvalued even compared to industrials," says Kevin Johnson, head of research at Aronson & Partners, a quantitative fund manager in Philadelphia with a preference for bargain-basement "value" stocks. "When you recognize how much of GE is a finance company, then it becomes even more [expensive] relative to its peers. We've been eating crow for a long time, and 10% does not make us right. But as some people pay more attention to valuations among the smaller [stocks], will the bigger stuff come back to earth?"
