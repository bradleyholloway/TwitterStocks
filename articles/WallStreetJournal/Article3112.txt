 FASB Weighs Major Change On Reporting   By By Elizabeth MacDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1998  In a move that could increase earnings volatility, U.S. accounting rule makers are considering a controversial new proposal that may require companies to include in their profits the changes in the fair market value of all their financial assets and liabilities.  In other matters, the FASB is preparing a proposed rule saying that companies that reduce the price of their employee stock options after their stock drops in value must include in earnings the difference between the new, lower price and any subsequent increase in the share price. Currently, companies merely have to disclose in a financial-statement footnote the effect of their options on earnings.  The FASB has tentatively decided companies would only have to report these expenses when the option is actually repriced, not when companies merely say they will reprice in employee stock option agreements. In addition, Timothy Lucas, an FASB official, said the FASB would deem any cancellation and reissuance of stock options within a six-month period a repricing and thus subject to the proposal.
