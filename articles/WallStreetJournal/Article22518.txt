 With New Cast, MGM Aims for Revival --- Studio's Film Library Will Be Key for Kerkorian's Team   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1999  To complement Mr. (Alex) Yemenidjian, a casino executive who has never worked in the movie business, MGM coaxed Chris McGurk from Seagram Co.'s Universal Pictures to serve as MGM's vice chairman and chief operating officer. Mr. (Kirk) Kerkorian, who owns 90% of MGM, is preparing to invest nearly $500 million more in the company via a coming rights offering.  The first order of business appears to be proving to Wall Street and Hollywood that Mr. Kerkorian isn't simply preparing to unload MGM. Mr. Kerkorian is "very intent on building the company," Mr. Yemenidjian said. "Obviously, if he was going to sell it, there would be no reason to go through this rights offering and the management change."  As evidence the new team is there to build MGM, Mr. Yemenidjian said half of the stock options he and Mr. McGurk will receive have a strike price of $30 a sharenearly double MGM's Friday close in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, where it ended at $15.1875, up $1.1875, or 8.5%. The other half of the executives' options are set at $14.90 per share, the same as other MGM employees.
