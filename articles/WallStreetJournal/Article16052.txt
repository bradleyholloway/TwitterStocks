 Price-Curb Plan: Is It California Dreaming? --- Regulators Again Tackle Power Market That Remains Chaotic   By By John R. Emshwiller, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2001  Spurred by the rapid rise in out-of-market transactions, ISO officials abandoned the price cap in December. FERC then approved a "soft cap" price-control plan. Sales made at more than $150 a megawatt hour were subject to FERC review and possible refund orders if the price was found to be too far above the supplier's costs. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered over $100 million in refunds. Critics of that FERC soft cap say it was too generous in its calculations of production costs and far too limited in its scope. The cap only kicked in during a Stage 3 alert, when supplies were so tight that rolling blackouts were imminent. Some state officials and others argue that the FERC should be ordering billions of dollars in refunds for prices charged over the past year.  Plus, the new plan still fails "to take any constructive steps to eliminate or even to minimize the pernicious effects of `megawatt laundering,'" says a recent ISO filing with the FERC. Out-of-state sales still aren't covered by the latest plan, which leaves suppliers with a large potential loophole for reaping higher power prices. The volume of out-of-market transactions has remained high this year. In April, the price for such deals averaged $372 a megawatt hour.  Gov. [Gray Davis] and others argue that price controls need to be extended throughout the Western U.S. In its decision unveiling the new control plan, FERC acknowledged that more may be needed on the laundering issue. It opened an investigation into sales transactions around the West. The terms of such sales, said the FERC decision, might not be "just and reasonable."
