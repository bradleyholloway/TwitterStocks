 Kremlin's Budget Includes $7 Million Secret Media Fund   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2000  Relations between the Kremlin and the media are at their lowest ebb since Mr. [Vladimir Putin] came to power just over a year ago. The president was enraged by critical TV coverage of his role in the Kursk nuclear submarine disaster last month, and at a meeting with relatives of the perished crew he blamed Russia's media barons for the state of the country's armed forces. The government needs to counter their "lies" with an "information policy" of its own, he said at the meeting.  Russia's main news outlets, while often critical of the Kremlin, are heavily manipulated by powerful business interests, who pay journalists for favorable coverage. Analysts say that the Kremlin, which controls two nationally broadcast television channels but few newspapers, may be creating the secret media fund to get in on the action.
