 House Votes to Let States Deny School To Alien Children   By Davidson, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1996  The speaker's remarks drew an angry retort from Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas) who said Mr. [Newt Gingrich]'s comments were made for raw partisan gain. "I say shame on you, Mr. Speaker," Mr. Bryant said.  Cecilia Munoz, a lobbyist for the National Council of La Raza, which represents Hispanic interests, said the amendment wouldn't stop illegal immigrants from coming to the U.S., because they are drawn by jobs, not schools. If it does survive a court challenge, she said, "what you would have is a significant number of kids growing up in the U.S. and not getting an education and potentially not being supervised during the day."
