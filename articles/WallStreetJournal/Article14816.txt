 Canned Music: Coke to Offer Pop From Sony   By By Michael J. McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1991  Coca-Cola Co. today is expected to announce plans for a joint promotion with Sony Corp. -- called Coca-Cola Pop Music -- in which the No. 1 soft-drink maker will give away several million mini compact-disks in multipacks of Coke.  Meanwhile, PepsiCo Inc. is planning to offer special cards that give discounts to Pepsi drinkers on a variety of children's merchandise, among other products and services.  As they make their preparations for summer -- the biggest selling season of the year for soft drinks -- Coke and Pepsi are adopting a similar strategy but different tactics. In recent summers, the two rivals have used heavy discounts to increase sales. Now, however, the companies are trying to retain price increases that they've made in the past year or so. To do that, they're trying to give consumers another reason to buy.
