 Making Hedge Funds Less Secret; SEC's Registration Requirement Provides a New, Insiders' Look; That Old Underage-Driving Case   By Scannell, Kara, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2006  While the registration shines a spotlight on a secretive industry, it hardly completes the picture. Lawyers estimate that information won't be available for the 15% to 20% of hedge-fund advisers who are exempt from registration, either because they aren't soliciting funds from new investors or investors' money is locked up for two years. That includes some of the biggest funds, such as SAC Capital Management LLC, Kingdon Capital Management LLC, GLG Partners LP and Lone Pine Capital LLC.  For instance, on Andor Capital Management LLC's ADV, it says one employee has a criminal record, but without going into detail refers the reader to the brokerage industry's national database, known as the Central Registration Depository, or CRD. A spokesman for Andor indicated that the disclosure relates to an incident involving underage drinking by a junior employee while in college. Andor has been registered with the SEC since the firm's inception in 2001.  The point of the disclosure, the SEC's Mr. [Robert Plaze] says, is that in the past individuals who have been sanctioned from the brokerage industry have opened up hedge funds or offered other financial services. "You have some recidivists and con artists coming into the hedge-fund industry and using the hedge fund as a scam," he said. "These types of questions and vetting are important to stop those people."
