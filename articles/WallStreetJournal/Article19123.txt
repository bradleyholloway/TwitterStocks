 What to Expect From the `Governing Body' --- By John H. Fund   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1999  Today, Minnesota will swear into office as its new governor a former professional wrestler, Navy Seal, talk-radio host and bodyguard for the Rolling Stones named Jesse Ventura. But while Mr. Ventura's background is unorthodox, to say the least, his policy initiatives are likely to be more conventional.  Mr. Ventura has already announced he wants to be Jesse the Mediator, resolving disputes between the state House captured by the GOP in November's election and the Democratic state Senate. The first battle that Gov. Ventura will have to referee is over tax cuts. Last month, the state's budget director projected a surplus for the sixth year in a row, estimated to reach $2 billion. If there was a single issue that Mr. Ventura rode to victory on it was his pledge that, as one advertisement put it, "I'll fight to get those Democrats and Republicans to return the $4 billion in excess taxes they took from you. That's $1,000 for every person in Minnesota."  That's indicative of Mr. Ventura's general approach. Incoming GOP House Speaker Steve Sviggum was surprised when, during a meeting last month, Mr. Ventura told him: "I'm going to be pretty prudent, pretty slow. I will be taking baby steps." Shades of George Bush. "If people had known Jesse the Lionhearted was going to become Jesse the Lamb, would they have voted for him?" wonders Jason Lewis, a talk show host who has sparred with Mr. Ventura, a former on-air rival.
