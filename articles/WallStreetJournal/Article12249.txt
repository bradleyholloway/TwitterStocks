 Boeing Still Plans to Boost Deliveries, Despite Suspension of Some Production   By By Frederic M. Biddle, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1997  Blaming shortages of parts, the Seattle based planemaker announced Friday that it is immediately suspending production of additional 747 jumbo jets, its most profitable plane, for 20 manufacturing days to catch up on jobs on which its line has fallen behind. Boeing also delayed final assembly of the newest version of its short-haul 737 for 25 days, although the company said it would continue work on planes already begun, adding parts as they arrived.  The announcement of line stoppages is an embarrassing double-take for Boeing, which for months has played down the extent of its production bottleneck, claiming remedies were in place. Just last month, Boeing projected that production would be back on track by year end. But in an intervew since then, Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president, said delays would last into next spring.
