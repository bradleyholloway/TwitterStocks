 Barron's Insight: Mellon Can Squeeze More Out of Itself, Holders Say   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2005  At a recent dinner in New York with a group of institutional investors, Mellon Chief Executive Martin McGuinn was asked about the merits of a spinoff of Mellon's asset-management unit. Such a move would showcase the value of that division, which manages $766 billion and contributes about 65% of Mellon's profit. Mr. McGuinn says he responded by saying that Mellon's asset-management and custody operations are "complementary" and shouldn't be split up.  A takeover of Mellon seems unlikely because Mr. McGuinn and the company's board are against it. "We've said explicitly, with an exclamation point, that Mellon isn't for sale," Mr. McGuinn says. He adds that Mellon is interested in making an acquisition of an asset- management company. Such a move probably would sit well with Mellon's investor base, especially if it were accompanied by a sale of the company's custody business.
