 Doctors Need Computerized Offices   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2002  The medical error study, published this week in the journal Quality and Safety in Health Care, found that more than 86% of mistakes in family-care offices are administrative or process errors, such as filing patient information in the wrong place, ordering the wrong tests or prescribing the wrong medication -- the kinds of mistakes that clinical-information systems are designed to help prevent. Of the 42 doctors who volunteered to participate in the study over a 20-week period from May to September 2000, 73% didn't have computerized electronic medical records, and 83.8% of them had no access to the Internet.  Though it covered a relatively small number of doctors, the study is among the first of its kind to focus specifically on identifying what kind of errors take place outside the hospital setting. While hospital errors have been the subject of intense debate ever since a 1999 Institute of Medicine Report estimated that as many as 98,000 people die each year from errors in hospitals, experts say the need to reduce errors in doctors' offices is equally pressing.  Doctors in the medical-mistakes study were asked to report mistakes in two primary categories: "process errors," including administrative mistakes, failure in investigation process, treatment delivery problems, miscommunication and payment system mix-ups; and errors arising from a lack of clinical knowledge or skills.
