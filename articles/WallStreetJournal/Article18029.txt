 Japan's Steel Industry Is Booming Again But Its Troubles May Not Be All Behind It   By By Christopher L. Hill, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1989  Earnings of most major Japanese steel makers surged in the first half of the current fiscal year, riding the wave of domestic capital investment that is invigorating Japanese industry as a whole. Steel sales are expected to keep rising as long as that expansion continues. And indeed, there are few signs that Japan's economy will cool in the next year.  Steel industry analysts warn, however, that a recovery based on domestic demand may merely paper over the damage done by the loss of export sales in the mid-1980s following the rise of other Asian economies and the rapid appreciation of the yen. Some warn, moreover, that the steel industry's financial condition remains shaky.  Japanese steelmakers staggered under the twin blows of a strong yen and competition from South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian nations. Exports of raw steel, the industry's mainstay, plummeted as the price of the Japanese product shot up in dollar terms. With earnings falling, the steel makers branched out into such fields as electronics and synthetic fibers, while also embarking on painful restructurings.
