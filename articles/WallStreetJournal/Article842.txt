 Industrials Again Reach a Record, But Some Broader Indexes Ease   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1987  Although advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, broader blue-chip market indexes finished lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.35 to 259.95, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.17 to 149.14.  Traders said that although they were still seeing buyers for stocks, demand had eased a bit. In addition, the stock market didn't get any leadership from the bond market, which fell yesterday, and there were only scattered gains among the oil stocks that had been a major source of strength Monday.  The strength in the industrials came from a handful of issues. Westinghouse Electric rose 1 1/4 to 62 3/4; International Paper moved up 2 to 83 1/2; and Philip Morris rose 1 7/8 to 79 1/2; but Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing fell 1 1/8 to 117 3/4; Procter & Gamble fell 1/8 to 80 3/4; and Merck sank 7/8 to 126 1/2.
