 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2004  About the kindest thing one can say about the September sales reports that many retailers will issue this morning is they won't be as bad as the previous month's. Analysts estimate overall sales at stores open for more than a year were up 2.3% over September last year, says First Call. Aside from August's meager 1.2% gain, it would be the worst performance since May 2003. Even those jaded by retailers' tendency to pass the blame have to admit that -- with hurricanes and the wet weather brought with them -- stores got dealt a poor hand in September.
