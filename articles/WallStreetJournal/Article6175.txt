 For Bush, Outcome of U.N. Vote Could Have Effects Beyond Iraq   By By Carla Anne Robbins, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2003  Already, the bitter divisions on the Security Council may make it less likely the Iraqi leader will suddenly decide to give up his forbidden missiles and chemical and biological weapons to avert a war. In the long run, a decision to fight without the U.N.'s blessing could undermine British Prime Minister Tony Blair at home and make it harder for America to rely on the U.N. in the North Korean nuclear crisis.  In Britain, Mr. Blair could face a strong challenge to his leadership from within his own party, or even lose control, if he fails to get U.N. authorization and the war goes badly or lasts too long. Many members of his Labour Party are opposed to a war, and especially one without U.N. authorization.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Blair said yesterday that the prime minister was still working hard to get a second U.N. resolution, and she declined to speculate on the political implications if he had to go to war without one. However, a number of Labour MPs have said privately that they would join a political rebellion if war began without a second resolution. There is also widespread speculation that Mr. Blair could then face cabinet-level resignations. Indeed, International Development Secretary Clare Short said last night in a BBC interview that she will resign if Britain goes to war without a U.N. mandate.
