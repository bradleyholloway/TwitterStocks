 Stock Prices Get a Little Uppity   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2003  David Briggs, head of stock trading at Pittsburgh mutual-fund group Federated Investors, also has some worries. "The trader in me is wondering how long we will go before a significant move to the downside," Mr. Briggs says. "We have had 10 months without a 10% correction."  "As we go into 2004, momentum is positive," says Chris Conkey, head of stocks at Evergreen Investments, Wachovia's money-management unit. "Economic growth is good, the Federal Reserve has clearly said it isn't going to raise rates for a while, earnings estimates are being revised upward, and overall it is a reasonably positive environment."  The third group? They're downright nervous. These people warn that the current bull market is utterly different from the one during the 1990s. They see today's bull market as a "cyclical" affair. Instead of lasting for nearly a decade without even a 10% decline, as the last bull market did, they think this one will run out of steam at some point before its third birthday, possibly sometime next year.
