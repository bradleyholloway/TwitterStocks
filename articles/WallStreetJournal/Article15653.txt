 Cendant Posts Loss Of $345.3 Million After Big Charges   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1998  Before the charges, however, the results provide the first indication of the company's core strategy of cross-selling products and services. In the latest quarter, discount membership clubs generated 39% of its $1.42 billion in revenue, or $558.4 million, up 12% from the year-earlier quarter, said Cendant Chief Executive Officer Henry R. Silverman. That jump largely resulted from targeting customers buying another Cendant product, instead of the more expensive cold calls, Mr. Silverman said.  The $1.42 billion in fourth-quarter revenue was 28% above the $1.11 billion in revenue in the year-earlier period. In a quarter clouded by charges, acquisitions and new accounting procedures, Cendant had profit, excluding charges, of $244.5 million, up 51% from $162.2 million in the 1996 fourth quarter. Year-earlier results include both HFS Inc., Parsippany, N.J., and CUC International Inc., Stamford, Conn., which merged to form Cendant.
