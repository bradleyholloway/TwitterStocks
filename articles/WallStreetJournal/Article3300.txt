 China Rejects Call for Summit With Taiwan -- at Least for Now --- Beijing Says Talks Hinge on Accepting `One China' Policy   By By Russell Flannery, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2000  Making his first public comments since Taiwanese voters elected as president a candidate who has supported Taiwanese independence, Chinese President Jiang Zemin reiterated his government's willingness to talk with Taiwanese authorities if they accept Beijing's "one-China principle," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Mr. Jiang said in a meeting with visiting Congolese President Denis Sassaunguesso that "under this prerequisite, everything can be discussed," the report said. Mr. Jiang's terse comments showed that China is holding out for Taiwan to accept its principle that the island of 22 million belongs to China and that reunification should lead to one state governed from Beijing. "It's restating the same principle," said Julian Kuo, a political-science professor at Soochow University and an adviser to Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian.
