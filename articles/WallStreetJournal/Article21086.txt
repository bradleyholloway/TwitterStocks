 Levine Backtracks and Claims Lapses Of Memory, House Panel Sources Say   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1987  Mr. Levine, who testified at a closed hearing yesterday before the House Commerce Committee's oversight subcommittee, on several points contradicted what he had earlier told panel staff members, according to Rep. Ronald Wyden (D., Ore.) and other subcommittee sources.  The most glaring discrepancy involved the number of times that Mr. Levine said he tapped his network of contacts and alerted his superiors to impending corporate takeover bids, subcommittee sources said.  When he was debriefed last April at the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa., Mr. Levine told subcommittee staffers that on 20 occasions during his Wall Street career he gave information about imminent takeovers to his superiors, who would use it to line up clients, according to subcommittee sources. But yesterday, they said, Mr. Levine could recall only five such occasions.
