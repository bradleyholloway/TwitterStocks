 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2005  Part of why Starbucks's sales did so well last year was the introduction of new espresso machines, which significantly shortened customers' wait times.

In truth, productivity growth may be better than today's figure will suggest, says Hoenig & Co. Chief Economist Robert Barbera. Thanks to a snafu in the way Canada's government tallied up its November trade statistics, the Commerce Department's advance report last week of a 3.1% increase in U.S. gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was too low. After the GDP growth rate gets revised upward, it will raise the rate of productivity, too.
