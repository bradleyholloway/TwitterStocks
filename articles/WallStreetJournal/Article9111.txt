 Steroid Creams Sell Briskly (And Illicitly) as Cosmetics   By By Christine B. Whelan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1999  But after 10 years, white spots appeared under Ms. Deye's eyes, and her skin became ashen, crinkled and cellophane-thin. She stopped using the creams, but then her face erupted with rashes, acne and red welts.  Like many women treated by Dr. (Jonathan) Zizmor, Ms. Deye, now 52 years old, had been using steroid creams imported and sold illegally in the U.S. as cosmetics. She says she used Betnovate and Dermovate, both of which are prescription drugs made by Britain's Glaxo Wellcome PLC, as well as a Swiss-made steroid cream called Movate.  How these creams get from manufacturer to customer isn't fully known, but the route is believed to include black-market dealers. At the point of purchase, some of the steroid creams are packaged in pastel tubes and boxes and blend in easily on a cosmetics shelf. Others, like Betnovate and Dermovate, have a more pharmaceutical look. Not one of them is intended as a cosmetic. In fact, the steroid level is so high in the creams that U.S. dermatologists say they are circumspect in prescribing them. Doctors say they are seldom prescribed for facial use.
