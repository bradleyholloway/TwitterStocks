 Revolution Redux   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2001  Mr. [Mohammed Khatami] is no liberal, because all candidates in Iran are carefully vetted by the ruling clerics. But he won in a landslide precisely because he was not the regime's preferred candidate. Last year's parliamentary elections were a further slap at the clerics, with voters ousting the former intelligence minister and persuading former President Hashemi Rafsanjani to quit the Parliament after finishing 29th in voting for Tehran's 30 seats. This June Mr. Khatami won re-election with 77% of the vote.  All of which creates some new strategic opportunities for the U.S. We've long thought it's in the U.S. interest to talk with Tehran, and especially now that our anti-Taliban interests may coincide. But the Tehran protests show that our long-term goal has to be replacing Iran's theocracy with a more liberal order. The Iranian people are losing their fear, and so the clerics are vulnerable.
