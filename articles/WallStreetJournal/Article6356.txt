 Dollar Closes at Mixed Levels   By Simona Covel and Steven Vames, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2004  "What has happened over the last several days is that the market got a little long of dollars after [last week's nonfarm-payrolls number]," said Greg Anderson, currency strategist at ABN Amro in Chicago. "This week people said, 'There's no follow-through; we've got to square up.' "  "With Greenspan behind us, there is no obvious near-term catalyst for a big move higher in yields and the dollar," said Mansoor Mohi- uddin, chief currency strategist at UBS in London.
