 Niners Eke Out Another Win   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1997  San Francisco -- The victorious coach was addressing members of the news media, revealing his approach to the contest that just had been played. "We wanted to wear them down, and that doesn't happen in the first quarter," he said. "You wear them down as the game goes on. In the second half, we were able to do that."  Not long ago, that would've been the halftime score when those teams clashed, loosing offensive thunderbolts while taking turns winning a total of five Super Bowls in this decade if you count the Niners' victory in the January 1990 game that concluded the 1989 season. Some of the players who caused those flashes were on the field Sunday, but they were reduced to hoping for the quarterback sack or foe's short punt that might give them a chance to make the scoreboard numbers move. That's not hypothetical, by the way: A sack and bad Dallas punt set up the fourth-quarter touchdown that put the home team ahead to stay.  Such evidence of time's passage always is sad, but it's been saddest for the Cowboys. Champions the season before last, they've dropped four of their past five games to stand 4-5 in the won-lost column, and might not make the playoffs. The win upped the Niners' record to 8-1, best in the National Football League's National Conference. But, off Sunday's performance, other title contenders might believe their own chances to have been enhanced.
