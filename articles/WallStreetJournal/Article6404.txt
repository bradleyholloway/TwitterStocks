 Condos Exceed Single-Family Homes in Price   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2005  Last year marked the first time since such numbers were tracked beginning in the 1980s that the median sales price of a condo in the U.S. surpassed that of a median home price. The median price of a condo also rose faster than the price of a home in 2004 -- 17% compared with 8.3%.  Celia Chen, a senior economist with forecasting and consulting firm Economy.com of West Chester, Pa., said she was surprised to see the 2004 median existing home price was lower than the existing condo price. "This says condo demand is very strong in downtown urban areas, and some of that may be due to empty nesters returning to urban cores and driving up demand for luxury apartment buildings," she said.
