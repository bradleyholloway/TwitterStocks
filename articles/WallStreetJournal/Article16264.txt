 Deep in Budget Bill, a Milking --- Texas Rep. Bonilla Gets a Tax Deal for Dairies Near Disease Zone   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2003  The Catch-22 is that since most of the cows are healthy, the government isn't condemning the El Paso herds, but relying on the cooperation of the owners -- who reluctantly agreed, but asked that the sale be treated as an involuntary conversion so the taxes could be deferred. Among them are Bos Dairy and Desert View Dairy, whose principals, Tony Bos and Brad Bouma, are past backers of Mr. [Henry Bonilla]'s campaigns and own the largest herds.  Contributions tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics here show the two men together gave more than $42,000 to congressional candidates or dairy-industry political committees in the past four years. Mr. Bonilla's campaigns received $3,500 directly and an additional $5,000 from the political-action committee supported by Select Milk Producers Inc., a New Mexico-based dairy co-op that handles the larger producers in the El Paso milk shed. Of the $34,000 the PAC gave to House candidates in the 2002 elections, three-quarters went to lawmakers who sponsored the initial tax legislation that Mr. Bonilla championed.  Even sympathetic analysts say Mr. Bonilla's hasty fix overreaches and could be worth millions in future tax write-offs for the very largest of the dairy producers. That's because of the different tax rules covering depreciation for involuntary conversions versus what will happen under the Bonilla amendment.
