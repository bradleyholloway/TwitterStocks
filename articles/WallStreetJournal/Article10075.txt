 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Television: The Joys of Sex   By Finnerty, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  HBO's new drama, "Tell Me You Love Me" (Sundays 9-10 p.m. ET/PT) -- in which a therapist helps assorted couples address marital malaise -- is billed as a "provocative exploration of intimacy." It's also one, evidently, that strives to tear back bedcovers and television taboos. It's not surprising, therefore, that the show has benefited from overheated advance press.  "Tell Me You Love Me" is, per HBO's declaration, certainly "provocative." But is it "intimate"? While there is an intimacy to the shooting -- the camera gets into dark corners and lingers, sometimes uncomfortably, on the pained or ecstatic faces of the actors -- there are few revelatory episodes between the husbands and wives themselves. In the shared moments, the moments in which intimacy often occurs in real life -- not in bed or at the therapist's office, that is, but in the carpool, or the cooking of dinner -- the script falls apart. Instead of exploring marital relationships through these moments, or through intelligent conversation, the writers telegraph the couples' conflicts by having them engage in leaden repartee. Wife: "Honey, we don't do anything anymore . . . It's been almost a year." Husband: "We do. We do in my version of things." Wife: "What does that mean?" Husband: "It means I love you."  "The Camden 28," a "P.O.V." documentary (Tuesday, 10 p.m., on PBS; check your local listings) explores the theme of civil disobedience in America, and whether the rule of law can, itself, serve as an instrument of injustice.
