 Gould Inc. Posts 4th-Quarter Net Of $4.6 Million   By By Michael J. McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1987  ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. -- Gould Inc. posted fourth-quarter profit compared with a year-earlier loss, but earnings from continuing operations plummeted 67%.  The electronics company also said that it expected cost overruns in some fixed-price defense contracts could produce additional losses of about $74 million. In May, Gould restated its first-quarter results to reflect a $130 million charge to cover defense contract overruns. At the time, Gould said it had adequately provided for anticipated losses on its fixed-price contracts and didn't foresee any additional cost overruns.  For the fourth quarter, Gould's earnings from continuing operations dropped to $5.5 million, or 12 cents a share, from $16.6 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. After a loss from discontinued operations of $900,000, net income in the 1986 fourth quarter was $4.6 million, or 10 cents a share. After a loss from discontinued operations of $81.7 million, the net loss in the 1985 quarter was $65.1 million.
