 Australian Election Pits Man Against Distance   By By Geraldine Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1987  KALGOORLIE, Australia -- In most elections, voters go to the polls. But in Kalgoorlie, Australia's rugged West and the biggest electoral district in the democratic world, the polls often come to the voters.  Kalgoorlie's 891,000 square miles run the length of the country from the tropical coast of the Timor Sea in the north to the chilly waters of the Great Australian Bight in the south. In a region that's roughly the size of Western Europe, give or take Scandinavia, many of the 70,000 voters are so isolated that in Saturday's Parliamentary election, ballot boxes will have to be brought in by plane.  "There's one {voting district} in Canada that's almost as big, but where they have ice and snow, I've got deserts," says Graeme Campbell, the 47-year-old Australian Labor Party politician known as Old Gummy who is running for reelection as Kalgoorlie's member of Parliament. "The size stems from this quaint view we have that all votes should be equal."
