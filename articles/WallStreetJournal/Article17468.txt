 World-Wide [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1985  Intelligence sources said Reagan, in a report filed with Congress, said the aid to Nicaraguan fighters wouldn't be for military purposes. The report was viewed as a concession to congressional critics of the White House's Nicaragua policy and an effort to resume at least some assistance to the guerrillas. Both houses of Congress must approve a resolution releasing the funds.  Widespread Japanese news reports said the package also lacks tariff-reduction measures and that the most specific changes are in the telecommunications field, which already have been announced. U.S. officials aren't likely to be satisfied by the program and news reports said Tokyo isn't expected to announce specifics for months or years.  By approving the $1.5 billion package of emergency economic assistance, the committee ignored a White House request to withhold the aid until Israel took additional austerity measures. The supplemental aid would be spread over this year and next. It would be in addition to a proposed $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid for next year.
