 Power Broker to Dodgers: You're Out!   By By Paul E. Steiger, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2003  The 1956 season had always seemed a kind of anticlimax to me, after the triumph of 1955, when Johnny Podres pitched the Dodgers to victory over the hated Yankees in the seventh game of the World Series, making the Dodgers world champions for the first time. Although the Dodgers again won the National League championship a year later, they lost the Series in another seven-game battle to those same Yankees.  Los Angeles had secretly made the Dodgers a spectacular offer to provide at a favorable price enough prime land for them to build a magnificent stadium with acres of parking at the confluence of several freeways. The Dodgers didn't need to change cities; they did need a new stadium. Their battered old ballpark, remembered so fondly now, had poor amenities and a paltry seating capacity for fewer than 35,000 fans. Unlike many another sports entrepreneur, O'Malley was prepared to build his own stadium. But he couldn't afford to assemble the land in an attractive location without the condemnation powers of government.  I would go further. While the Dodgers and Giants were undoubtedly a loss to Brooklyn in particular and New York City in general, the city as a whole has hardly suffered in baseball terms. The expansion-team Mets brought National League baseball back to New York in 1962 and a World Series victory in 1969 (with former Dodger Gil Hodges as manager). The juggernaut Yankees, meanwhile, have won 15 pennants and nine World Series in the intervening years, more than the Dodgers and Giants combined.
