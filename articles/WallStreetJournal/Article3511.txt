 Citigroup Is Close to Bidding for Enron Operation   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mitchell Pacelle, Jathon Sapsford and Christopher Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2001  Citigroup's anticipated bid comes amid indications of a rising toll in the financial world related to Enron's collapse. Late Wednesday, J.P. Morgan said its exposure to Enron was nearly $1 billion more than the $900 million it had already disclosed. And yesterday, the lineup of insurers with announced exposure to Enron grew longer, as XL Capital Ltd., Bermuda, said it had pretax exposure to Enron's bankruptcy of $75 million through its insurance and reinsurance operations.  Blackstone Group, which is acting as financial adviser to Enron, has spoken to at least 14 firms about bidding on the unit. Martin Bienenstock of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, Enron's law firm, has said that striking a deal quickly is vital to preserving the unit's rapidly diminishing value. Following Enron's bankruptcy filing, its energy trading operations nearly ground to a halt, with the exception of trades with counterparties who want to unwind positions.  J.P. Morgan said Wednesday it had filed suit against 10 insurance companies in an effort to get reimbursed for guarantees on financing for trading in oil and gas contracts linked to Enron. In the lawsuit, J.P. Morgan said, it is attempting to enforce what it says is $965 million of guarantees from insurers to cover the bank's exposure to Enron. If the insurers fail to commit by a 6 p.m. deadline today, the bank will have to record part of that Enron exposure as nonperforming assets for the fourth quarter.
