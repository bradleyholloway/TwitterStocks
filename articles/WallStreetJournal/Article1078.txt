 Vanguard Expands ETF Offerings   By Spence, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  Before, brokers might lose a client to index funds. Now they can point them to ETFs such as those managed by Vanguard. Because ETFs trade like individual stocks, investors pay commissions to buy and sell shares. "Vanguard has a whole new 'customer-based' marketplace they're marketing to," Mr. [Dan Wiener] said.  Vanguard said adding the specialized midcap growth and value ETFs was the result of brokers calling for Vanguard to fill out its family of ETFs -- the pair complete the last two so-called style boxes that were missing from the lineup.  Vanguard's first midcap "style" ETFs, introduced in late August, are Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth ETF and Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF. Both are structured as separate share classes of the firm's regular index mutual funds.
