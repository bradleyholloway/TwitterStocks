 IPOs in 1998 Are Expected To Show Drop --- Torrid Pace of 1996, 1997 Can't Last, Some Say; Asian Worries Are Cited   By By Dunstan Prial, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1998  Mr. Cashman said it would be a "very good year" if the 1998 figures come in just behind those of 1997, which would make this year the third-most-active for IPOs.  The year just ended was the second-most active, with 607 deals completed and slightly more than $41 billion raised, according to CommScan, a New York data research firm. In 1996 -- the most-active year ever -- a total of 844 deals raised $46.6 billion.  Mr. Cashman cited the financial crisis in Asia as the primary reason IPO figures probably will drop in the coming year.
