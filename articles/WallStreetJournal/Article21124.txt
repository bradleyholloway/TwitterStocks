 States Do Good, Arab Economies Done Ill   By By Dennis D. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1987  Despite its loss of hundreds of lives, its exposure to even more such losses, and its expenditure of tens of billions of aid dollars, the U.S. will probably fail to secure its long-term geopolitical goal of peace and stability in the Mideast and North Africa. This is because these objectives ultimately depend more on what individuals there do to develop their own comparative economic advantages than on any good that their governments or the U.S. try to do for them. And, ironically, it is well-intentioned policies that still block the development of the region's comparative economic advantages.  Almost without exception the economies of the 16 Arab nations in the Mideast and northern Africa are declining or stagnating. Excluding Iraq, for which comparable data were not available but likely reflect even worse trends, the growth rate in real per-capita gross national product for the countries averaged 4.3% a year from 1973 to 1983. For 1983, the latest year for which figures are available, this rate had slowed to below 1%. Since then, evidence suggests real per-capita growth is still flat or even negative.  Also during this time, governments grew and took the major initiatives in economic development. For example, from 1965 to 1980, the economic plans of Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia gave 50% to 91% of total investment to government, leaving the rest to the private sector.
