 Facing Union Battles and Further Losses, Texas Air's Eastern to Continue to Shrink   By By Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 1988  Eastern Airlines, battling with unions and facing continuing losses, said it will continue to shrink after reducing operations 12% in the last year.  In a quarterly disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission, theTexas Air Corp. unit described a variety of problems, including restrictions on management flexibility created by recent adverse court rulings and the financial cost of bracing for a possible labor strike.  As Eastern continues to seek steep cost concessions from its machinists' union, the cost of preparing for a possible strike deepened the first-quarter deficit, the company said. "Strike contingency plans" cost $17.1 million in the first quarter. That included $7 million paid to Continental Airlines, a non-union unit of Texas Air, to provide services in the event of a strike.
