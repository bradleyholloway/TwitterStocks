 Young Police Chief Drives Hard Bargain In Donegal, Pa.; Ethan Ward Pinches Pennies, And Folks Appreciate It; His 10 Weeks Without Pay   By Maher, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2005  Mr. [Ward], who is single, grew up and lived in a small town called Prosperity before moving seven miles to Donegal when he was about 23. After high school, he worked for about a year as a welder for a steel company near Pittsburgh and did a six-month stint as a greens attendant at a country club. "I didn't take too well to that," he says. "I'm used to driving on dirt roads, and they're used to driving on paved roads."  Last fall, when heavy rains from Hurricane Ivan wiped out many of the township's roads and its entire budget, Mr. Ward persuaded other officials to let him go without pay for 10 weeks, until funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived, to avoid layoffs. "There was no way to make payroll," says township secretary Bess Hildreth. As the township shored up washed-out roads, it incurred $93,000 in expenses and was forced to lay off two road-department workers. It would have turned to the police department next, says Ms. Hildreth, if not for Mr. Ward forgoing his pay. "That saved me," says Sgt. Max Oravetz, 27, the department's other full-time officer. The third member of the force works part time.  Though he says he has had job offers that would have tripled his pay, Mr. Ward says he won't leave the township. "I got 10 pounds of fudge for Christmas," Mr. Ward says. "I couldn't tell you how good people are to me."
