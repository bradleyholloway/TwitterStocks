 Drug Stocks Help Sink Industrials; Lilly, Merck and Pfizer Post Drops   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2000  Several technology issues managed to ride Cisco's coattails to gains Wednesday. Vitesse Semiconductor, a force in the optical-equipment market that provided Cisco with a chunk of its performance, rose $9.38 to $70.31 on Nasdaq. Jabil Circuit advanced $4.50 to $56.06. Ciena added $7.44 to $156.13 on Nadsaq.  VoiceStream Wireless added $2.38 to close at $124.63 on Nasdaq, rising even though the Bellevue, Wash., wireless-services provider posted second-quarter results that showed wider losses than analysts anticipated. The stock benefited from a modest gain Wednesday in the American depositary receipts of Deutsche Telekom, which added $1.06 to $41.44, after the company said it would delay the initial public offering of its T-Mobile International unit. The German telecommunications maker agreed last month to purchase VoiceStream in a deal then valued at more than $50 billion.  Handspring gained $1.94 to $35.31 on Nasdaq. The Mountain View, Calif., wireless Internet-product developer reached a license agreement with Qualcomm to use that company's CDMA technologies. Qualcomm ended 38 cents higher at $61.44 on Nasdaq.
