 PORTALS: In Name of Innovation Some Let Technology Get Away With Murder   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  Ten days ago, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson ruled in favor of Grokster, a downloading service for pirated music and movies -- euphemistically called a "file-sharing system" -- that's a successor to Napster. In rejecting a complaint from the entertainment industry, the judge focused on a somewhat narrow aspect of copyright law, saying Grokster doesn't know about specific violations when they are occurring.  The problem is that Grokster -- like Napster before it -- isn't really a technology. It's a business that happens to use technology. Indeed, most of these file-sharing operations use generic technologies that are widely employed nearly everywhere on the Web. If you "banned" Grokster, you wouldn't be "banning," say, the FTP file transfer protocol. It would still be there for entrepreneurs and engineers to make legal use of.  BUT THE SOFTWARE is plenty smart, and plenty meddlesome, when it needs to be. Practically all of the services, including Grokster, install various forms of "spyware" that track a user's movements to sell ads -- indeed, that's how they make money on someone else's piracy. Some of the services can even tell when you've used programs like Ad-Aware to disable this spyware, and won't run until the spyware is enabled again.
