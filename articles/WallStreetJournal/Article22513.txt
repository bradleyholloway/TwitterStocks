 Details Ain't It Grand   By By Rebecca Lowell, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 2, 1999  And again and again and again. The player piano is back, but it's a far cry from the one you remember from Grandmother's parlor. In its new incarnation, the player piano looks like a baby grand, comes with a remote control and costs as much as a new car.  "If I put on jazz, you'll think you're in a cabaret," says Lawrence Larose, a New York lawyer, who bought a "self-playing" ConcertMaster from Baldwin Piano & Organ Co. last year. "If I play rock 'n' roll, you'll think you're at a concert." Neither Mr. Larose or his wife, Janet, play piano; instead, they use their new gadget (complete with remote control) in place of the stereo.  Computerized player pianos like the ConcertMaster and Yamaha's Disklavier have reinvigorated the piano industry. Total piano sales grew 12% in both 1997 and 1998 after hitting an industry low in 1996, according to Music Trades, a trade publication for the music-products industry, and the magazine says that growth came largely from the new generation of player pianos, which now make up 15% of all piano sales.
