 Health; Weighty Issues: Yes, we all need 'cardio' exercise; But here's why strength training should become a bigger part of your fitness routine   By Essick, Kristi, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  DR. [Karl Knopf]: In the 1970s, it was all about cardio. When people ask, "What's the most important muscle of the body?" everyone is engrained to think: the heart. But when you are older, it's the legs. If those legs go, so does your ability to maintain your independence. Cardio is one component of an exercise program, and it's important. But strength, balance and flexibility are underrated.  DR. KNOPF: Yes, but you can incorporate it into your daily life. You only need to lift weights twice a week, then do aerobic exercise -- and by that I mean walking -- three times a week. Stretching can just be a portion of that. As a young person, it's about how much, how fast and how hard. But when you're older, it can be LSD -- long, slow distance. I'm a real fan of water exercise. It's a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise.  DR. KNOPF: Remember, what you do today will determine how you age tomorrow. I'm sure most of your readers will say, "That's a wonderful article, and I'll start tomorrow." But just start now. Walk to the end of the corner and come back. Go to a water-exercise class and stay five minutes. And the activity you choose has to be fun and something you look forward to. Make sure it matches your personality. If you're a structured person, classes might be the best bet. If you prefer to go solo, take a walk or go for a swim. And break it up: One day play golf, and the next day go for a bike ride.
