 What's a Failing Dot-Com Worth? Not Very Much   By By Stephanie Gruner, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2000  In addition, some potential buyers know that taking their time to acquire a desperate dot-com only ensures a better price. Take Dressmart.com AB, a high-profile clothing e-tailer for which PricewaterhouseCoopers is helping wind down its British business. Dressmart's founders negotiated with three large retailers for two months without success. As discussions with the prospective suitors dragged on, the Stockholm company continued to burn through GBP 1 million ($1.4 million) a month, and its price tag plummeted. Last week, discussions with one remaining retailer collapsed, leaving Dressmart's future bleak.  Isn't the brand, at least, worth something? After all, it is in name recognition that many of these companies have made their biggest investment. Mr. [Nick Drewett] says this too is a tricky area. For one, brand is hard to quantify. Big retailers are struggling to firm up their own Internet reputations, which requires lots of cash. And even assuming the acquiring company would be willing to continue investing in the dot-com's brand, no amount of television, billboard and cinema advertising can reverse the bad press surrounding a troubled Internet company.  Perhaps most challenging, says Mr. Drewett, is the attitude adjustment dot-com founders must make. After being courted by venture capitalists and labeled millionaires by the media, it isn't easy to swallow low-ball offers. "If they haven't made the mental adjustment to their new situation," says Mr. Drewett, "then they may not take the deal on the table."
