 Cheerleaders For Internet Take Breather   By By Robert McGough and Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2000  Merrill Lynch Internet analyst Henry Blodget, a longtime Web bull, said he watched the action with "morbid fascination." On the road, he kept abreast of the market with a hand-held e-mail and Internet device. "I got market updates every 15 minutes, and every 15 minutes the market went down 100 points."  Yesterday, some of the biggest Internet cheerleaders put down their pompoms, and watched. During the long bull market, these analysts have led the charge, exhorting investors to buy stocks that often lacked any earnings at all, at lofty prices that terrified traditional investors. Many of these analysts encouraged investors to buy on any dips -- and it worked.  Instead, many Internet analysts are busy hedging their bets. Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, dubbed the "Queen of the Internet," last week told the firm's bankers to tone down their "selling memos," or marketing pitches for new Internet stock issues, according to people familiar with the matter.
