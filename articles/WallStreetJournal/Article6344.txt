 Iraq Attacks Stall the Flow of Crude; Sadr's Militia Threatens Pipelines in Basra Hub; Oil Prices Hit a New High   By Yochi J. Dreazen and Hassan Hafidh, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2004  Militia fighters loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al Sadr continued battling American and Iraqi security forces in Shiite areas of Baghdad and at least two other Iraqi cities, where U.S. officials say hundreds of militiamen have been killed since a truce between the two sides broke down last week. Dozens of Iraqi security personnel and civilians, as well as a handful of American military personnel, have died in the fighting.  Mr. Sadr's forces also have made a sudden show of force in the southern port city of Basra, Iraq's second-largest city and the gateway for most of the oil that Iraq exports.  The critical event that sent crude prices higher was a suspension in oil pumping between Iraq's two southern oil fields and two offshore oil terminals. Officials at South Oil Co., the state-run firm responsible for pumping and shipping most of Iraq's crude, said yesterday it stopped that pumping in the Persian Gulf after Mr. Sadr's men surrounded certain government buildings and threatened to destroy pipelines and other oil facilities.
