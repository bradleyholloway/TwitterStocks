 Winner, Loser of Boeing-Lockheed Bids Could Split Production of Fighter Plane   By By Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2000  The Defense Department could order Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. to build advanced Joint Strike Fighter military planes at two separate sites operated by the rival defense contractors, Pentagon acquisitions chief Jacques Gansler said in an interview.  Mr. Gansler stopped short of saying the government would split the production between the two companies.
