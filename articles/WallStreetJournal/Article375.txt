 Charitable Requests Can Still Solicit Headaches   By Whitehouse, Kaja, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2003  Would-be do-gooders tend to get caught in two ways: through solicitations for charities that don't exist, and solicitations by fund-raisers who pocket the bulk of the money collected -- sometimes as much as 90%. The latter category can be more frustrating because -- as long as they don't lie about how much they are giving when asked -- they aren't breaking any laws.  Then again, it isn't easy to "get a pulse" on charitable scams, said Tracy Thorleifson, a coordinator of the FTC's Operation Phony Philanthropy in Seattle. When consumers are cheated on a product or service, they react right away. "But when you're told your money is going to help a starving child in Africa, you generally don't have a way to check on that," she said.  It isn't up to the group soliciting you to offer information. A recent Supreme Court case makes it clear that it is up to the donors to ask the right questions. In Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates Inc., Illinois's attorney general's office charged Telemarketing Associates with soliciting funds on behalf of a charity called VietNow National Headquarters, and giving VietNow just 15% of the funds, about $1 million of the $7.1 million raised between 1987 and the end of 1995.
