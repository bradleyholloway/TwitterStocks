 Burger King Gets Fine of $500,000 In Child-Labor Case   By By Kevin G. Salwen and Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1992  Burger King Corp. agreed to pay $500,000 to settle Labor Department allegations that it violated child-labor laws.  The accord, which is expected to be approved by the U.S. district court in Miami in early December, would resolve charges filed by the agency in March 1990. The Miami-based fast-food chain was cited for allegedly assigning workers under 16 years old to work more hours than allowed under federal labor laws and letting the young employees work later in the evening than permitted.  The agreement settles charges involving only the 800 company-owned Burger King restaurants, though several of the changes required by the accord will affect all 5,700 Burger King restaurants, most of which are owned by franchisees. The fine, first reported in the Washington Post, would be the largest child-labor settlement by a single company.
