 Ahead of the Tape   By Eisinger, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2004  Retailing investors and analysts contend Sears's management isn't "merchandising" well. Merchandising is the great retailing skill, hard to define but easy to spot once it is happening. It is the ability to put the right amount of attractive products in easily accessible places in the store, all at the right price. Investors are coming to the conclusion that while J.C. Penney Chief Executive Allen Questrom has got it, Sears's Chief Executive Alan Lacy doesn't.  Investors continue to be concerned that the acquisition of Land's End hasn't worked as well as Sears had hoped. As many predicted, the prices on regular Land's End clothes appear to be too high for the general Sears customer, leading to markdowns. It also seems as though Home Depot and Lowe's are competing effectively in appliances, traditionally Sears's strength.
