 Workers in Hungary Find the Fast Track With Fast-Food Jobs --- Spread of Western Chains Brings Opportunity for High Pay, Education in Free Market   By By Sheryl R. Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1992  Sitting in the three-tiered, glass- and iron-trimmed McDonald's in the 19th-century Nyugati railway station, Imre Bordas speaks with an optimism to match his Western-style business suit.  Less than four years ago, the young Hungarian traded in his auto mechanic's overalls for a McDonald's uniform. Now Mr. Bordas, 24 years old, is a senior store manager responsible for a business with annual revenue of $3.5 million.  With unemployment of about 18% in Hungary, the spread of McDonald's Corp., Burger King and other Western chains looks like a moveable feast. The chains have created more than 1,400 jobs and 17 restaurants in four years in Hungary, and growth plans call for as many as 60 restaurants in the next seven years. As one might expect, promotions are coming fast and furious. About 75% of McDonald's store managers and senior operations personnel were members of the original McDonald's crew in Budapest in 1988.
