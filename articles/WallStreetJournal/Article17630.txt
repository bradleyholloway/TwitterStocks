 Rift Between United and Pilots Imperils Carrier's Proposal to Buy Frontier Air   By By John Koten, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1986  United Airlines' proposed $146 million purchase of Frontier Airlines is in serious jeopardy because of a longstanding rift between the big carrier and its pilots.  Officials of United and the pilots union said late last week that talks had broken off over a new contract for pilots at Frontier, a unit of People Express Inc., Newark, N.J. Both sides said they had rejected each other's final proposals. As of yesterday, new talks hadn't been scheduled.  In a statement, United said the Frontier purchase was "imperiled." Officials said the airline, a unit of UAL Inc., wouldn't make any additional offers to the union. They added that unless the union accepted United's last proposal, the acquisition would fall through.
