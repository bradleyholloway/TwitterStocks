 Citigroup Pursues Control of Nikko Cordial   By Morse, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2007  New York-based Citigroup and Nikko Cordial have long-standing ties. Citigroup recapitalized Nikko Cordial in 1998 and the two companies formed a joint venture investment bank, Nikko Cititgroup Ltd., which handles mergers-and-acquisitions advice and equity and debt underwritings. Citigroup still owns a little less than 5% of Nikko Cordial.  Taking control of Nikko Cordial would give Citigroup a huge presence in Japan, the world's second-largest economy. Nikko Cordial has a network of 109 branches across the country.
