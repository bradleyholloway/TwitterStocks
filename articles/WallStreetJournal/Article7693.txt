 Business Bookshelf: Raiders vs. CEOs: Battles on the Street   By By James B. Stewart, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1987  In "The Takeover Game" (E.P. Dutton, 390 pages, $19.95), John Brooks, a New Yorker magazine contributor and author of "The Go-Go Years," shifts the discussion over takeovers into a less philosophical arena. Mr. Brooks's method is that of an economic historian. Reviewing the past several years of frenetic activity, he concludes: "What we see is a mindless speculative merger spiral that has many of the recognizable features of a boom before a bust."  Mr. Brooks's work lacks the vivid characters and drama of some of the recent books on takeovers, but it compensates with thoughtful analysis. Indeed, it comes as a welcome change from the spate of books that have breathlessly -- and uncritically -- followed a few participants through the fast-paced machinations of a given takeover deal. Some of those accounts now seem ludicrous given the startling insider trading disclosures about Ivan F. Boesky, the former arbitrager, Dennis B. Levine, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker, and Martin A. Siegel, the former takeover specialist at Kidder Peabody & Co., all of whom played important roles in the takeover boom.  In Mr. Brooks's view, much of the blame for the takeover frenzy lies with investment bankers, and not just those with felonious tendencies. He begins with an account of a 1974 hostile takeover by International Nickel Co. of Canada, noteworthy not for the deal itself, but because INCO's investment bankers, the eminent firm of Morgan Stanley & Co., deigned to participate in a hostile bid. With that, Morgan Stanley "made aggressive action respectable," says one of Mr. Brooks's unnamed sources.
