 Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus Restructures Amid Consumer Caution in Germany   By By Cacilie Rohwedder, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1995  STUTTGART, Germany -- When Wolfgang Karches joined the board of Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG in January, he arrived at a trying time for the retailer.  Asko is having its fair share of hardships. Group sales dropped by 2% for the six months ended March 31 from the same period a year earlier. Continued consumer caution, high severance payments and a troubled furniture division already hurt last year's performance: for the year ended September, Asko's operating profit amounted to a token one mark, after massive losses for the two previous years.  Founded in 1880 as a small buying cooperative for railway workers, Asko has grown into a complex store empire with 940 supermarkets, discount stores and large suburban hyperstores; 300 clothing, furnishing and home improvement outlets and 21 billion marks ($15.22 billion) in sales last year. Asko is majority-owned by Metro Group, the Swiss retail titan. This year is expected to mark Asko's return to profitability: the company already has earned 126 million marks for the first half.
