 Review / A Surfer's Guide to TV: Lots of Laughs   By By Barbara D. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 2001  Ten real contestants (the "investigators") from around the country travel to fictional Sunrise (actually, Eastport), Maine, to solve the fictional murder of Abigail and Nate Flint in this new eight-part reality series. Each week -- under the guidance of the "lead investigator," real LAPD Sgt. Gary Fredo -- an ever-diminishing number of players will sift clues and narrow suspects from an initial list of 15 (portrayed by improvisational actors). At the end of every episode, two contestants will be picked by their colleagues to stake out two separate sites. One will return to headquarters with a vital clue, while the other will become the killer's latest (fictional) victim. You probably don't have to be an ace detective to deduce that the five men and five women competing to win $250,000 and a Jeep Liberty are uniformly telegenic, with nine in their 20s and 30s and none older than 45. No real Jessica Fletchers need apply.  In the decade since the antics of babies Tommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, Phil and Lil DeVille, and their nemesis, Tommy's overbearing older cousin, Angelica, first began entertaining kids and kids-at-heart, the cartoon tykes have gained a few friends and siblings and one new mom, made two big-screen movies, but aged hardly at all. In the winning "All Growed Up," an imaginary time machine rockets the babies into their 'tweens for a while -- where Tommy, at long last, sports a full head of dark hair, and Chuckie's anxiety now centers on girls.
