 Iraq Inc. -- Among the U.S. Postwar Tasks: Overseeing a Tobacco Company; With Economy in Their Laps, Officials Strive to Get a Fix On 48 State Enterprises; Saving Employees' Paychecks   By Luhnow, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2003  "Normally, you might not throw some of these companies a lifeline," says L. Paul Bremer III, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S.-led agency managing Iraq. "But with 60% unemployment, what do you do? Is a full-blooded 'big bang' approach of privatization and reforms the right way to go?"  Visiting its newer Baghdad factory, Col. [Brad Jackson] surveyed approvingly a row of modern cigarette-packing equipment. "When you first look at these machines, you think getting this place back up should be a no-brainer, especially because it employs nearly 2,000 people in one of Baghdad's poorest neighborhoods," he said. "But then you look at the financials, and you think, 'Geez, Louise.'"  While the tobacco company's old management is gone, in its wake comes an unfamiliar concern: job security. The U.S. decision to keep paying employees regardless of workload hasn't stopped rumors that the older Baghdad plant, at least, is going to be sold or closed. "This factory is like my home -- will the Americans take it away from me?" asks Aziz Ali, a 59-year-old electrician who has worked there for 40 years. Mr. Ali says he was the first employee back after the fighting stopped in April, using an AK-47 to ward off would-be looters.
