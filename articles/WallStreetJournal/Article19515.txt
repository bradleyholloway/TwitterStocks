 AOL Time Warner Sells $6 Billion of Global Debt, Up From Original $4 Billion on Investor Demand   By By Richard A. Bravo, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2002  AOL's issue had yield margins of 1.50 percentage points over Treasurys for a $1 billion, three-year portion; 1.52 percentage points over Treasurys for a $1 billion, five-year part; 1.68 percentage points over Treasurys for a $2 billion, 10-year maturity; and 1.98 percentage points over Treasurys for a $2 billion, 30-year portion.  Investors have also voiced concern about the possibility of more acquisitions by AOL, which they fear could result in its taking on more debt. AOL has been in talks for more than a year with AT&T Corp. over the purchase of AT&T's 25% stake in Time Warner Entertainment. That deal could see AOL spend as much as $10 billion, according to some estimates.  AOL was focused on responding to investor demand, said Raj Dhanda, head of U.S. syndicate at Morgan Stanley. "AOL anticipates being an infrequent user of the capital markets, and investors have embraced that strategy."
