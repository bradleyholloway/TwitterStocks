 Entrepreneur Puts Bet on Photofinishing   By By Pauline Yoshihashi, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1990  If Howard Ruby has his way, photographers will be processing more of their baby pictures and vacation shots at drug and discount stores, supermarkets and other retailers. He's betting that cheaper and smaller film processing machines will help retailers combat customers' flight to standard minilabs, which are usually located in shopping centers.  "What we're offering is a mini minilab," says Mr. Ruby. His company, Print Technology Inc., rolled out its Photogo film processing franchise system at the Photo Marketing Association International's convention in Las Vegas last month.  Besides approaching traditional photo-developing outlets such as supermarket chains, Print Technology is targeting video stores and other types of customers that are just getting into photo processing. Some, like the Music Plus chain of video and recorded-music stores, think photofinishing just isn't for them. "We've been approached about one-hour processing, and we feel it doesn't fit in with our focus on home entertainment," says Mitch Perliss, director of purchasing for Show Industries Inc., parent of the chain, which is based in Los Angeles.
