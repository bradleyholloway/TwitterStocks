 Good Realtors Deal in Golden Opportunities   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2005  Columnist Alan Murray's reference to Realtors as "a hardy breed of insect" is rude and ill-informed ("Brokers Fiddle as Real Estate Burns," Sept. 28). Why do more than 98% of buyers and sellers in New Jersey use the services of Realtors? Because it is hard work. Our society has two working parents, commuting one hour each way, then feeding the kids, picking up the laundry and taking the kids to soccer practice, etc. While they are out making a living and taking care of their family, I am showing their home to you or the other 99 buyers it takes on average to sell a home.
