 Germany's Pro-7 TV Is Restructuring Ownership to Ease Regulatory Concerns   By Rohwedder, Cacilie, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1995  The company is deliberately avoiding other media companies in looking for institutional investors, Mr. [Georg Kofler] said. "It won't be anyone who prompts concerns about media concentration," he said. "After all, one important reason we're doing this is to get the concentration issue off the table." Though regulators haven't been able to prove a business relationship between Mr. Kirch and his father, they have refused to extend Pro-7's broadcast license, due for renewal next summer, unless the family curtails its influence over the channel.  "We lost a battle but we haven't lost the war," said Mr. Kofler. He is hoping the Bavarian media authority, a staunch supporter of the project, will back H.O.T.'s plan to beam its programs by satellite to some parts of Germany outside Bavaria starting Dec. 14. To help things along, Pro-7 is selling its 50% stake in H.O.T. The new owners: Quelle, still with a 50% stake; [Thomas Kirch], with a direct stake of 40%; and Mr. Kofler, with a 10% interest.  "If I have to pay between $3 million and $5 million for a top American film, I might as well spend three million German marks on a good TV movie that can also bring good ratings," Mr. Kofler said. A 38-year-old from northern Italy, Mr. Kofler says he aims to make Pro-7 a "modern, fantasy-filled, passionate communications concern."
