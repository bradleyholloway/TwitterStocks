 Wooing Voters...and Wowing Investors?   By Seib, Gerald F, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2004  The administration's main macroeconomic initiative this year is likely to be simple: Defend the big, multiyear tax cuts passed in early 2003 and hope they continue to pay stimulus dividends. Its new tax initiative in 2004 -- tax-exempt savings accounts -- doesn't promise to have a similar stimulative effect on the overall economy. Instead, it will be designed to make voters believe they're getting more bang out of their personal savings.  The latest proposal for the accounts would allow far more dollars in tax-free savings than do the current maximum contributions to individual retirement accounts. A "lifetime savings account" would let individuals withdraw money tax-free at any time, for any purpose, without penalty. That's a flexibility unavailable from current IRAs or special savings accounts for education or medical expenses. A second account, for retirement savings, would aim to replace current IRAs. Money couldn't be withdrawn until a set age.  In each of the two new accounts, the yearly contribution limit of $7,500 per individual would dwarf the current $3,000 for IRAs, which is scheduled to rise to $5,000 in 2008. Both new accounts would work like Roth IRAs: Contributions wouldn't be deductible, but interest and investment income would build up tax-free and wouldn't be taxed on withdrawal. Unlike current IRAs, however, there would be no income caps; for instance, married couples with adjusted gross income of more than $160,000 don't qualify for Roth IRAs.
