 South Korea Relaxes Ad Content Rules And Ends `Locked-Time' System on TV   By By Namju Cho, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1995  Starting this month, any advertiser can in theory bid for any time slot on South Korea's three commercial TV networks. Until now, the state-run agency that controls sales of all TV and radio ad time allocated most openings to the same advertisers year after year. Under the previous "locked-time system," existing advertisers were allowed to keep using the same slots for as long as they wanted.  The state agency which allocates ad time, Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corp., or Kobaco, ended the locked-time system effective Oct. 1 in an effort to liberalize the local advertising market. The old system made it difficult, if not impossible, for latecomers -- mostly foreign firms and small to midsize South Korean companies -- to buy time on commercial TV.  The government's tight control of TV and radio ad time hasn't been all bad for advertisers. Worried about inflation, Kobaco has been reluctant to raise rates. KBS, one of the three commercial TV networks, charges about 6.5 million won ($8,471) for a 30-second spot during prime time. That compares with the 100 million won Chosun Ilbo, a major newspaper, charges for a full-page color ad on its back page.
