 PURSUITS; Books: The Democratizing Dandy; Yes, he was a snob, but Regency England's style czar had far-reaching effects   By Antongiavanni, Nicholas, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2006  It was of course also quite frivolous. Mr. [Ian Kelly] is properly skeptical of later French attempts to detect philosophical significance in Brummell's habits and "dandyism." The author notes that in 1863 Brummell's admirer Charles Baudelaire "argued that dandies spoke of a society on the point of huge change and appeared 'in all periods of transition.'" But Mr. Kelly recognizes that Brummell was neither thinker nor hero. Thus he wisely devotes attention beyond Brummell himself -- to the Regency high life that Brummell ruled for 17 years.  What a catty, riotous, raucous world it was! Mr. Kelly vividly depicts the sordid metropolitan underbelly of Jane Austen's manicured, bucolic England. Social cruelty was more than a way of life; it was an art form. Brummell's legendary wit was employed as least as often to wound as to amuse, and when he overreached, it was there to save him. During one alcohol-fueled gathering with the Prince of Wales, Mr. Kelly reports, "a comment of Brummell's so enraged the prince that he threw a glass of wine into Brummell's face. Brummell, sitting on his right, picked up his own glass and threw its contents into the face of the person on his right with the loud instruction, 'The Prince's Toast: pass it round!'"
