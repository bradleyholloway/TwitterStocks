 Matters of Trust: Super-Rich Set Up Companies   By Silverman, Rachel Emma, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2007  A trust essentially is an agreement to transfer an individual's assets to someone -- a trustee -- who looks after the funds or property for that individual's beneficiaries. Families set up trusts for a wide variety of reasons: to save on estate taxes, provide for future generations or incapacitated family members, pass on a family home or business, among others.  A few states -- including South Dakota, New Hampshire and Wyoming -- are chasing this money by enacting laws to help attract more trust business. Among the measures: Some states don't levy income taxes on certain trusts or now permit trusts to last for hundreds of years, benefiting many future generations.  Families often turn to private trust companies if they have special assets, such as a closely held family business, real-estate or partnership interests, that they don't feel comfortable handing over to either an individual or a big trust company to manage, or they want to ensure that the particular asset isn't sold. Family trust companies, which have boards and various committees, enable family members from many generations and branches to be involved in managing the family's wealth.
