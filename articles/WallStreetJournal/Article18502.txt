 World Wire [3]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1993  The mixup involves the proposed acquisition of the German spice group Karl Ostmann GmbH by two U.S. food concerns, McCormick & Co. and CPC International Inc., and the Dutch Rabo Merchant Bank NV. The EC was notified of the deal Sept. 15 and Germany requested the case be referred to its cartel agency.  The EC has a month to decide whether mergers pose antitrust problems, and may conduct subsequent inquiries. But an EC member's request for referral extends the initial study period to six weeks. In preparing a second-stage inquiry in the spice deal, the EC inadvertently missed the six-week deadline by a day, sending the case to German competition officials -- already angry because the EC rejected German jurisdiction in other cases.  Foreign business investment in China topped $15 billion this year through September. And the Trade Ministry approved 62,789 joint ventures and projects with contracted foreign funding totaling $83 billion, up 170% from pledged investment a year earlier. Foreign investors have burst into China since last year's opening of sectors such as communications, ports and power plants. Investment also grew after China, which had restricted foreign firms to manufacturing bases for exports, allowed them to sell products domestically.
