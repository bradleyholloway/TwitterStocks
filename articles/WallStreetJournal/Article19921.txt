 SmartMoney: Five Dividend Cinderellas Come of Age [1]  By Kapadia, Reshma, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2005  Now, increasingly sober stock market expectations, slowing earnings growth and low bond yields are adding a new glow to these stocks' dull image. "After stagnant returns, 2% to 4% [yields] start to appeal to people," says Scott Glasser, co-manager of Smith Barney's Dividend & Income fund.  The nation's biggest maker of jam and jelly has shown that with smart long-term investments, it can grow faster than the industry. This pleases some investors even if the stock and short-term profits pay a temporary price. Research from a Temple University professor, David Reeb, supports Smucker's strategy. His data show that family-run firms -- in this case, the founder's great grandsons -- have higher margins and net income than those not run by kin.
