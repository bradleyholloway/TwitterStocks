 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Karen Hube, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1999  Filing tax returns electronically is much improved this year, but some technological snafus and inconveniences have interfered. Last week, some tax practitioners were unable to file W-2 forms to the Social Security Administration to meet a March 1 deadline because of software-compatibility problems and overloaded telephone lines. Meanwhile, Intuit Inc. shut down electronic-filing its TurboTax customers for just over 24 hours after a 10-minute power failure snarled its filing systems. Certain "help" services on SecureTax.com, a tax preparation and filing Web site run by Universal Tax Systems Inc., were inaccessible last week because they were still being developed.  Robust growth in 1998 was driven largely by an 11.2% increase in personal income-tax revenue. Tax revenues would have been slightly higher had tax cuts not exceeded tax increases by $5.3 billion. Without the tax cuts, state tax revenue would have swelled 8.3%, and double-digit growth would have been realized in 11 states, including California, Colorado and Massachusetts.  Of 973 pieces of artwork claimed by 102 taxpayers, the IRS art-advisory panel agreed with 54% of taxpayer appraisals and recommended adjustments on 37%, the IRS says. In total, taxpayers valued the works at $216 million, and the panel recommended $65 million in adjustments. The average value of charitable donations reviewed last year was $81,975, and the average estate and gift item was $263,858. The panel agreed with 46% of taxpayer valuations on estate and gift items. For donated items, it agreed with 80%.
