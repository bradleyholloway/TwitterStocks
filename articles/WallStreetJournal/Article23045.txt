 Saudis Woo Russia With Oil Accord; Moscow Agrees to Curtail Output Surge if Prices Fall, But Promise Isn't Binding   By Whalen, Jeanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2003  "I don't think there's much here apart from words -- because I'm not sure what the two sides actually have in common," Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil analyst with United Financial Group in Moscow, said of the energy agreement.  Oil officials in Russia believe the Saudis have sought a meeting with President Vladimir Putin for months, in part to get an idea of how long Siberia's oil boom can continue. "I know they are intensely curious to find out whether the Russian economic miracle of increased production in West Siberia is real and sustainable, and I believe that's the purpose of their visit," said Robert Dudley, chief executive of TNK-BP, the newly founded company half-owned by BP PLC.  A U.S. official said Washington is pleased with the Saudi visit, viewing the kingdom as a stabilizing force in oil prices and yesterday's pact as a chance to press Moscow to push the Saudis to cut off funding to Chechen terrorists. "It will help us," the official said, "since we're pushing the Saudis on the same issue."
