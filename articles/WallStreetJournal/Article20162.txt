 Higher Cost Of EU Wheat Sends Ripples   By Kallal, Lisa, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  "Major markets have gone through the roof. . . . It's undiscovered terrain," says Stephane Delodder, Rabobank's associate director of food and agribusiness.  The effect of the high price of wheat has been seen in the baking industry. The U.K. operations of Archer Daniels Midland's ADM Milling Ltd. raised its flour prices by GBP 63.13 ($127.28) per ton in mid- August, saying the rise in wheat prices could no longer be absorbed. Summer earnings from Premier Foods, the U.K.'s biggest food producer, showed its bread bakeries were hit by the higher wheat prices.  Oliver Balkhausen, grain analyst for Germany-based F.O. Licht, said biofuel producers are showing signs of cutting back. Germany-based biofuel maker Vereinigte BioEnergie is reducing ethanol production at a plant in Schwedt/Oder, citing the "heavy burden" of high grain prices.
