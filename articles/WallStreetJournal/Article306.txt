 Give Credit Where It's Due   By By John Steele Gordon, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2000  William Boyle, who died this month at the age of 88, is not one of the major names in the history of American banking. But Boyle came up with an idea that was not only very profitable for banks, but changed the financial culture of America and the rest of the developed world: the credit card.  Credit was the second great economic invention. The first was money itself, a single commodity that was universally accepted in exchange for every other commodity. Money does many things. It serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Money also increases the number of possible transactions by orders of magnitude, and allows an economy to build wealth at a much faster pace than would otherwise be possible. It thus serves the same function in an economy as a catalyst serves in a chemical reaction. Interest rate guru James Grant called credit the "money of the mind" because it frees up the economic power of fixed assets, allowing a portion to be utilized in other ways.  But the trapezitai also quickly discovered the idea of credit as a means of increasing their profits as bankers. By its nature, credit was extended mostly to people who possessed assets that could be used as collateral. In other words, credit was for the capitalist class. Those with insufficient assets either could not borrow or had to pay much higher rates to cover the higher risks. While the Greek trapezitai usually charged 10% to 12% on loans backed by real estate, they charged up to 33% for uncollateralized commercial loans.
