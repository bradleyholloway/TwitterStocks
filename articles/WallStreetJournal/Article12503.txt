 Congress Is Set to Approve Bill to Let Satellite Firms Carry Broadcast Shows   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1999  Congress is poised to clear a bill that would let satellite-television companies carry broadcast-network shows, making the satellite-TV industry a stronger competitor to cable television.  A conference committee worked yesterday to iron out the last details on the bill, and final votes in the House and Senate are expected next week. The measure is aimed at resolving a long-running dispute between broadcasters and the satellite-TV industry. Satellite-service subscribers have been caught in the middle -- and have complained to their lawmakers. The bill would allow about two million satellite-TV subscribers who have been cut off from network shows or face cutoffs to continue receiving such programming for at least five years. Satellite services also would be allowed to carry programming from local broadcast stations.
