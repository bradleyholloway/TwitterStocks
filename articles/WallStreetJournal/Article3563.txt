 Telecommunications: AT&T Wireless Faces Possible Fine   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2002  The proposed fine comes after AT&T Wireless and most of the nation's largest wireless carriers missed an Oct. 1, 2001, deadline for beginning to deploy so-called enhanced 911, or E-911, services. The rollout is supposed to be completed by 2006. FCC spokesman John Winston declined to say whether it had opened investigations into the other carriers as well.  Those words may have come back to haunt it. Yesterday, the FCC proposed fining the company for failing to begin selling handsets with the location tracking capabilities by the October deadline without asking for a waiver. The agency also faulted the company for not upgrading its network in time and for failing to inform the commission that, contrary to the information in its partial waiver request, it had begun deploying an upgraded network without giving its customers location-tracking handsets.
