 The World's Most Expensive Cars   By By Jonathan Welsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  Never mind the stalling economy -- here comes the quarter-million-dollar car. While the market has always had a couple of super-pricey racers at its top end, now an entire fleet's coming at once: In the past year, Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Ferrari released models costing more than $200,000. And during the next year or so, car makers such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and even Ford will roll out outlandishly powerful two-seaters, including a few that will make this year's crop look like economy models (estimated price of Bugatti's Veyron: $750,000). In all, a dozen of these are expected to enter the market by 2004.  We wondered how much car you actually get for the money. So we took five of them out for test spins, including a Lamborghini, a Porsche and an outrageous-looking hotrod called a Saleen S7. Naturally, racetrack performance was a given: We could push them to 60 mph in four seconds, and they all clung to curves like a Versace dress. So we went looking for the less obvious: Can they haul groceries? Do the windows roll all the way down? Ferrari's [Ferrari Maranello], for example, lacked a hook for hanging dry-cleaned Italian suits. One car had a piece of suede peeling off the trim, while another actually scraped the driveway apron when we swooped in to show it off. How cool is that?  Automotive history, in fact, is full of defunct high-end car makers such as Vector, Bitter and DeLorean. The 1980s spawned speedsters such as the $250,000 Porsche 959 and $600,000 Jaguar XJ220, which arrived in the early '90s just as the economy cooled. Porsche lost thousands on each 959 it sold and some XJ220s sat unsold for years. (They now go for about $125,000 used.) Jaguar says it has no plans to build another car of this type, and recently pulled the plug on a less-expensive but much-talked-about prototype, the F-Type.
