 Getting Going: When the Wolf Is Polite Enough to Knock   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  "It's like 2000, in that people aren't thinking about the downside," says Minneapolis financial planner Ross Levin. "There are pockets of the market that are clearly overpriced. REITs are a great example of that. But the overall market isn't nearly as expensive as it was in 2000."  What if your time horizon isn't so long? What if you discovered during Tuesday's 416-point plunge that your appetite for risk isn't nearly as great as you imagined? It's your lucky day.  "You don't want to react to the decline by getting out totally," Mr. Levin says. "But it isn't a bad time to look at your portfolio and say, 'how much capacity for risk do I have?' If you decide you're taking too much risk, take a little off the table and put the money into certificates of deposit or Treasurys. Today, you can get yields close to 5% with CDs and low-cost money-market funds."
