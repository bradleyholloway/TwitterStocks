 Revived Japan Hope of Suspending VAT Helps Boost Yen Against Dollar, Mark   By By Michael Casey, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1998  Japanese leaders gave traders an excuse to buy yen, leaving the Japanese currency higher against both the dollar and the mark.  The head of Japan's Liberal Party, Ichiro Ozawa, revived hopes for a suspension in the country's contentious valueadded tax Wednesday. Mr. Ozawa, whose party is set to form a coalition with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said: "I still think a suspension of the national sales tax is necessary to stimulate the slumping economy."  "I think it is the VAT volley. Today's volley was that maybe they will suspend the VAT tax," said Susan Stearns, director of foreign-exchange sales at the Bank of Montreal in New York. "I really think dollar/yen has been trading in accordance with the (market's) take on VAT."
