 Ahead of the Tape   By Whitehouse, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2006  Yet from a statistician's point of view, the market's reaction to the jobs data is hard to fathom. Over the past six years, the economists' consensus has missed the reported number, on average, by about 82,000 jobs, according to Bianco Research. That might look like a big difference. But as a percentage of total payroll employment -- 135 million -- it's actually very small, less than one tenth of 1%. Because some miss is always expected, it would take a much bigger divergence from Wall Street's expectation -- say a number of more than 200,000 above or below consensus -- to be meaningful, says David Juran, a statistics professor at Columbia Business School.
