 Letters to the Editor: HMOS: You Left Out the Good News   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1990  Yes, the number of HMOs is less than a year or so ago -- but HMO membership continues to increase. The smaller number of HMOs is mostly the result of consolidation and mergers. HMOs continue to attract more and more new members.  Yes, HMOs have to find new ways to control costs and still provide a quality product and provide better data to employers. But great progress has been made and will continue to be and, contrary to your pessimistic view, the HMO, or "Managed Care Industry," is proving to be more and more popular as a way for employers and employees to meet health-care needs.  More encouraging news in the Foster Higgins survey went unreported: Employers who get the data they seek are more likely to believe HMOs save them money; the greater the number of employees enrolled, the more likely the employer is to be satisfied. Furthermore, where employers have the greatest experience with HMOs -- the Far West -- they are the most satisfied.
