 New Domicile For News Corp. May Spark Rally   By Peers, Martin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2004  "Basically now if you're an active U.S. investor you're more or less forced to pay attention" to News Corp. stock, says Larry Haverty, a managing director with State Street Research & Management. "What comes out of this is it's very attractively valued versus the other U.S. media companies." State Street held about three million News Corp. American depositary receipts as of Dec. 31, according FactSet Research Systems.  News Corp. is sure to mount a lobbying campaign to get approval for the deal. While News Corp., which also owns the New York Post newspaper, has long been effectively an American company, with most of its operations and its headquarters in the U.S., its Australian status has proved a drag for many years. When Mr. [Rupert Murdoch], chairman and controlling shareholder of News Corp., wanted to expand into U.S. television in the mid-1980s, he had to become a U.S. citizen and create a complicated structure to own TV stations in order to pass TV foreign-ownership rules. News Corp.'s use of Australian accounting procedures has prompted criticism in the past that the company was playing by looser rules than its U.S. rivals. News Corp. now publishes financial statements reconciled with U.S. accounting rules.  Perhaps News Corp.'s biggest problem was the restrictions that many big U.S. institutional holders face in owning foreign stocks, which usually trade as ADRs on U.S. exchanges. "Our presence as a foreign issuer in the U.S. leaves many of the world's biggest funds and investors unable to invest in News Corp," Mr. Murdoch told reporters on a conference call.
