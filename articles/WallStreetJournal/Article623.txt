 Maryland Names Conservators For Two Thrifts --- Move to Reassure Investors Is Result of Withdrawals At Old Court, Merritt   By By Steve Swartz, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1985  Maryland officials appointed conservators for Old Court Savings & Loan Association and Merritt Commercial Savings & Loan and took other steps to try to stem a growing lack of depositor confidence in the private insurance pool for 100 other state-chartered thrifts.  Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corp., the private insurer, was appointed Old Court's conservator after several days of what state officials called "massive withdrawals" by depositors. State officials said they would continue to seek prospective buyers for all or part of Old Court's business while the thrift is in conservatorship.  Carl O. Kamp Jr., president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which oversees federally insured thrifts in Maryland and seven other states, said that his office has received inquiries about federal insurance from a few privately insured Maryland thrifts since problems at Old Court began to surface.
