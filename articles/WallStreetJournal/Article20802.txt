 U.S. Study Concludes New Futures, Options Serve Useful Purpose   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1985  A study by three federal agencies of newer types of futures and options trading may reassure those who fear a regulatory crackdown on the futures and securities industries.  The study by the Federal Reserve System, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission concluded that non-commodity futures and options "serve a useful economic purpose" and don't threaten to drain money from securities markets. The futures and options have similar potential for "harm" as the cash markets they're related to, but their trading doesn't seem to have done "significant harm" to public customers or to the cash markets, the agencies said.
