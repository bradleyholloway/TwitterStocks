 Interest Rates Tumble Again As Bonds Soar --- Yield on 10-Year U.S. Note Drops Below 8%; Prices Of 30-Year Issues Jump   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1986  The yield on 10-year Treasury notes dropped below 8% for the first time in eight years. Bond prices soared. Prices of some 30-year Treasury issues rose about 2 points, or around $20 for each $1,000 face amount. Since Feb. 7, prices have jumped more than 13 points in one of the strongest rallies in history.  Some bankers contend that the Federal Reserve needs to drive interest rates down further to make sure the economy's long expansion continues. "The economy is growing at only a moderate rate, and there are more risks on the downside than the upside," said Charles Lieberman, senior vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.  February was the third-best month in memory for long-term Treasury bonds, according to Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, research director at Ryan Financial Strategy Group. Investors who bought 30-year Treasury bonds enjoyed a dazzling total return of 11.81% for the month, she said. Total return includes price changes and interest income. The best month in recent history was April 1980, she said. Zero-coupon bonds turned in especially spectacular results last month. The total return on 30-year zero-coupon Treasury bonds was 35.46%, she said.
