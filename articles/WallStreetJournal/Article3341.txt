 Federated Cautions Fingerhut Debt Woes Will Hurt Earnings   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2000  The news is a setback for Federated's management. Last year, Federated paid $1.7 billion to buy Fingerhut. Whereas Federated's department stores cater mostly to an upper- and middle-class clientele, Fingerhut has built a reputation by selling mostly to low-income consumers who can't get credit elsewhere.  Federated said some of Fingerhut's problems stem from broader economic conditions, such as higher gas prices and interest rates, which have hit Fingerhut's low-income clientele particularly hard. The retailer said it is taking steps to cut down on its delinquency by increasing collection activity and introducing stricter credit criteria.
