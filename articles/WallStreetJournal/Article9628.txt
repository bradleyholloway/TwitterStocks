 Personal Business: How Investors Can Beat the Dollar Blues   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2003  Everbank, a division of First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Fla., offers certificates of deposit denominated in a range of foreign currencies, with a minimum investment of $10,000. They are FDIC- insured just like regular CDs, but their value goes up or down based on the value of the currency you bought. The yields are also often higher: a three-month CD now pays 1.26% in euros or 2.91% in British pounds. Just remember those returns could be wiped out if the currency moves against you: FDIC insurance doesn't cover the currency risk.  If you're planning a trip and just want to lock in today's exchange rate, consider travelers checks. You can buy them in the currency of the country you are visiting. The downside: You won't earn interest. But it's a relatively safe way to simply hold money in another currency.
