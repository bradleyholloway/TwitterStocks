 Ahead of the Tape   By Sender, Henny, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2006  A look at the oddly named credit default swap market shows that investors think GMAC is more likely to improve creditworthiness than Ford Motor Credit. That reflects the market's belief that GM's planned sale of GMAC will result in greater security for the finance arm.  Meanwhile, some hedge funds have returned to taking negative views on GM itself and more positive ones on GMAC. That of course was one trade that went badly last spring. If a GMAC sale doesn't go through or doesn't result in improved creditworthiness, the GMAC bulls may sit on serious losses again.
