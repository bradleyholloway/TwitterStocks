 Gemcraft's Zdobylak Resigns; Firm Is Left Without Directors   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1988  A spokeswoman for First Texas Savings Association, which owns 50.9% of Gemcraft's stock, said the Dallas-based thrift was working to replace the Gemcraft board.  Sanford Miot quit last week as Gemcraft's chairman, chief executive officer and president following the resignations of the company's five outside directors. The resignations were prompted by First Texas' refusal to provide $5 million in needed financing unless the board agreed to a voluntary foreclosure of Gemcraft's homebuilding and mortgage units. The capital stock of those units had been pledged as collateral on about $22 million in loans.
