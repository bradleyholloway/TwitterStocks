 China Tries to Close Gaps in WTO Talks --- Trade Minister Flies to U.S. To Try to Resolve Issues Before Premier's Arrival   By By Helene Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1999  In a last-ditch effort to get his country into the World Trade Organization, China's vice minister of trade flew here over the weekend to try to close the remaining gaps between the U.S. and China before Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's arrival on Thursday.  A flurry of concessions from China over the past six weeks has brought the two sides close to a deal for the first time in 13 years of negotiations. But they have been stuck for the past week, with Chinese officials maintaining that Beijing has done enough. Meanwhile, the (President) Clinton administration, afraid of alienating Congress with a weak deal, wants more.  Mr. Zhu arrives in Los Angeles tomorrow to begin the first U.S. visit by a Chinese premier in 15 years; trade officials had hoped to reach a deal on China's accession to the WTO by his arrival in Washington on Thursday. Such an announcement would become the centerpiece of his U.S. trip.
