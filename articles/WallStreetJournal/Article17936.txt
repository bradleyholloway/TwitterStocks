 Bonds Gain, Helping Lift Stocks Too --- Markets' Resurgence Is Triggered in Part By Stronger Dollar   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1989  A resurgent bond market pulled stock prices sharply higher yesterday as investors temporarily shrugged off their inflation and interest-rate worries.  Encouraged by a firmer U.S. dollar, investors flocked to long-term bonds. The resultant gains in the bond market gave stock investors renewed confidence. The stock rally drew additional strength from several rounds of buy programs related to computerized strategies for trading stock-index futures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.67 points to 2265.71; volume was moderate.  "There's a psychological change taking place," said Peter DaPuzzo, chief of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. "People are beginning to feel that inflation is under more control than they had thought."
