 Amgen Studies Cost-Cut Options; Drug-Sales Slump Sparks A Slowdown in Spending; Layoff Rumors Circulate   By Chase, Marilyn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2007  "We haven't made any announcements about impact to staff," said spokesman David Polk, declining to speculate about future actions. Amgen closed facilities during the July 4 week in a long-planned move unrelated to its sales slump, he said.  When the company announced those results July 26, Mr. [Kevin Sharer] told analysts: "We're taking actions to restore Amgen....We adjusted our cost base to be more in line with revenue growth, seeking efficiencies and making tough-minded choices."  "We may be required to take further actions to reduce costs," Amgen added in the 10-Q, because of ongoing impact of strict new rules on anemia drug use by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and uncertain outcome of fall meetings of advisory panels to the Food and Drug Administration covering renal drugs and drug safety.
