 Design: What? A Comfy Sofa Bed?   By By June Fletcher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2000  BRAD GERMAN spent $1,500 on a sofa bed. Another sofa bed, the Model 1913 by Natuzzi Group, costs $1,600. An article in Friday's Weekend Journal incorrectly suggested that Mr. German spent $2,500 on his bed and that the Natuzzi bed cost $2,600. (WSJ Nov. 28, 2000)  Can you get a fairly comfortable sleeper sofa for $600? Yes. Can you spend almost $4,000 on a minimalist Italian number? Sure. The existential question is, do you want to? Does a sofa sleeper, no matter how fashionably packaged, ever transcend its sofa sleeper-ness? A recent survey revealed that 10 percent of high-end furniture dealers were cutting back on their sofa bed offerings; a third of the mid-range dealers surveyed said the same.  For $100 more, Mr. German could have modern-looking Model 1913 by Natuzzi Group in Santeramo, Italy. Twist its arms into various positions and you can convert the 1913 into a sofa, a bed or a chaise longue. A cool hidden night table slides out of the couch's belly. The bed is comfortable, but sleeps only one.
