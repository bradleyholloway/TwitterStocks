 Dynegy Says Its Short-Term Borrowings Of Nearly $1 Billion Aren't Enron-Related   By By Rebecca Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  Mr. [Rob Doty] says that Dynegy hasn't seen a loss of customers or trading volumes since the Enron deal collapsed, adding, "we have a very solid business operation." The recent borrowings of $400 million from the company's bank credit lines and $574 million in new commercial paper are largely to finance Dynegy's $600 million purchase of gas-storage facilities in the United Kingdom from British Gas PLC.  Dynegy issued the commercial paper at a 3.35% to 3.5% interest rate, costlier than normal. Mr. Doty blamed the higher borrowing costs on market worries after the failed merger and the fact that Enron has sued Dynegy for breach of contract and is seeking more than $10 billion in damages. Both energy companies have headquarters in Houston.
