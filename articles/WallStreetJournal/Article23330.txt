 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: Still Standing   By Vitullo-Martin, Julia, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2006  Rabbi Schmuel Spiegel says otherwise. "We're not abandoning our synagogue. And we're not leaving Rivington Street," he insisted, referring to the synagogue's address in the heart of the Lower East Side, surely the most famous Jewish neighborhood in the U.S. Like many of New York City's 3,000-plus historic religious institutions, Rabbi Spiegel's congregation has been losing members for years and is now down to around 100 congregants in a building that seats upward of 1,800.  Meanwhile, Rabbi Spiegel's Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim, or Gates of Heaven, had been founded in 1860 on nearby Hester Street. Its numbers were growing as those of the Methodists were declining. Architectural historian Andrew Dolkart says that Lower East Side Methodists (who had themselves replaced Presbyterians) were really missionaries who sought to convert Jewish immigrants -- though not very successfully. He unearthed the 1893 "Report of the Missionary Society" advising that "the existence of the church here attracts few. Our ordinary audiences are small, and contain almost no Jews."  Even in secular New York, most residents probably agree with Councilmember [Alan Jay Gerson] that First Roumanian should be saved as a synagogue. "Since 9/11," he says, "we've learned that spiritual infrastructure is every bit as important as physical infrastructure." That's something the synagogue's founders knew well.
