 About Advertising: TNN Embraces Populism, Aims for Top   By By Sally Beatty, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2000  Viacom's MTV Networks gained control of TNN (yes, the National Network is continuing to use the TNN acronym) five months ago following Viacom's merger with CBS. After extensive research and focus groups, Tom Freston, MTV Networks' chairman and chief executive, says TNN has the potential to become a billion-dollar business. That compares to the roughly $350 million in ad revenue TNN is expected to generate this year.  To get there, TNN is being overhauled from a narrowly focused Southern network to a broad general-entertainment network emphasizing popular culture. And it doesn't hurt that TNN is already getting a huge ratings boost from the World Wrestling Federation, which defected with its seven million-plus strong audience from USA to TNN.  TNN's broad distribution -- it is already in 78 million of the nation's 82.3 million cable and satellite homes -- is an enviable place to start. Still, drawing in more viewers without alienating TNN's current audience won't be easy. TNN is also about to lose its single highest-rated regular program excluding the WWF, the Nascar auto-racing events, which are leaving in November to go to Fox Broadcasting, General Electric's NBC and Time Warner's TBS.
