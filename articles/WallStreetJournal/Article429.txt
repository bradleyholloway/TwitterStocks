 Analysts Dig for Clues Amid Options Inquiries; Maze of Reports Swamp Investors Trying to Divine Firms at Risk; A Green Lining in Dark Cloud?   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2006  "The risk is that these companies buried other things" in addition to committing possible option-related improprieties, he said. "But as long as the cash flow looks solid and a careful examination of the cash-flow statement or balance sheet is undertaken, you can get comfortable that it isn't related to the business."  According to Sarah Friar, a Goldman Sachs analyst, around the dates of the option grants during the 1998-2002 period, 33% of Quest's options were priced at the lows for the 40-day trading period, a high figure compared with others in the business. Ms. Friar cut her recommendation of the database-managing software company to "neutral" from "buy" last week, worried that the option issue will weigh on the stock.  A Goldman Sachs analyst named Computer Sciences Corp. as a company that might come under scrutiny for its options. But late Tuesday, Computer Sciences said the company's grants of stock options have been "appropriately authorized in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations," and the Goldman analyst, Julio Quinteros Jr., later said the performance of the stock options "appears coincidental."
