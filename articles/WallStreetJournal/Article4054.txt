 Letters to the Editor: Contractors' Taxes   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1985  The method of accounting that defers taxes until completion of a contract was not conceived by defense contractors. It was developed to ease the tax burdens of the general construction industry, where the method has been, and is still, used extensively. It is also being used by the defense community; however, the IRS carefully monitors companies using this approach to ensure that "rollovers" do not occur. Also, contracts must extend over a year to be suitable for completed-contracts accounting.  So what causes seemingly intelligent business people to pursue defense contracts? Two things serve as an incentive: progress payments and tax deferrals via the completed-contracts method. Eliminating the completed-contracts method of tax accounting will only force a compensating increase in defense-contract profits, and we all know who will foot the bill for that. It won't be Rep. Fortney Stark for sure.
