 Abrupt Retirement of Hughes Aircraft Head Comes in Wake of U.S. Subpoena   By By Joseph B. White, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1988  The subpoena seeks documents relating to consultants retained by Hughes's Space & Communications Group between January 1971 and April 1988. The Justice Department is focusing on dealings between Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., and Latin American consultants who were hired by Hughes and who had links to a former high Intelsat official, according to a source familiar with the investigation.  Albert D. Wheelon, 59 years old, retired unexpectedly last Thursday, after the U.S. Justice Department named him in one of two subpoenas, dated April 20, that sought records from Hughes. The Justice Department is seeking consulting contracts that he either initiated or approved. Mr. Wheelon had been chairman and chief executive officer of Hughes Aircraft for just 13 months.
