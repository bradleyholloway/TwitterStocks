 The Search for Paradise on Dual Screens   By Wilkin, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  Ms. [Shirin Neshat]'s talent as a storyteller is noteworthy, but her celebration of her medium's possibilities is equally impressive. In "Fervor," black and white became a metaphor for polarity, while the double screens became uncrossable zones, each assigned to a different sex. In "Tooba," restrained color reinforces narrative, through contrasts of a bleached terrain with the blue of a cloud-laced sky, the leaves of the imprisoning tree, and the black clothing of the relentlessly approaching villagers. Using the camera's ability to take in enormous amounts of information and to accord equal weight, simultaneously, to near and far, she exploits the character of place, making our perceived distance from her images expressive, forcing us to shift our focus between the two screens, and allowing our attention to be claimed now by the entire panorama, now by significant details. Ms. Neshat's poetic exploration of a richly associative zone between fact and fiction, myth and reality, makes us re-examine our assumptions.
