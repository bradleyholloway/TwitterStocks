 EarthLink Starts Free-Thinker Campaign   By By Jennifer Rewick, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2000  "Most of EarthLink's value is in providing an open, high-quality connection to the Internet," says Dylon Brooks, an analyst with Jupiter Research. "The problem with that as a message is that ISPs are increasingly valued not on the access revenue they get every month but on the nonaccess revenue they're driving. It's what AOL gets in advertising and commerce-related fees that makes it worth so much more than the others." With 4.6 million subscribers, EarthLink is a distant second to AOL, which boasts 25 million subscribers. MSN comes in third with 3.5 million subscribers. EarthLink charges users $19.95 a month for unlimited access compared with AOL and MSN, which both charge $21.95.  EarthLink, whose previous marketing efforts concentrated on direct mail, says the point of a national brand campaign is to let consumers know that in the current here-today-gone-tomorrow environment of the Internet, EarthLink is a well-rooted company. Even so, it has seen its stock price fall 90%, to $6.50 from a 52-week high of $65 a year ago. Besides Galileo and Magellan, the $15 million EarthLink campaign also features the images of Darwin and Internet entertainment writer Harry Knowles, complete with the latter's signature phrase "Ain't It Cool?" Other ads feature a forest of computer-screen arrow pointers reminiscent of pine trees and the words "Net Hugger."  EarthLink is placing full-page ads in newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. The ads are the company's manifesto, proclaiming EarthLink "the GBP 1 provider of the real Internet," and declaring the importance of curiosity. "Curiosity frees us. From bad things, like boredom. And even worse things, like mediocrity." This isn't the first time EarthLink has taken potshots at AOL, which hopes to close its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. in the next few weeks. Earlier this year EarthLink ran a national outdoor ad campaign by Omnicom Group's BBDO that played off AOL's use of keywords. Ads read, "AOL Keyword: Frustration/satisfaction@earthlink.net" and "AOL Keyword: low/getconnected@earthlink.net."
