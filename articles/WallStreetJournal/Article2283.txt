 Japan's Growth Slowed Sharply In June Quarter --- Annual Rate for GNP Fell To 2% From the 11.2% Posted for March Period   By By Masayoshi Kanabayashi, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 1991  Japan's economic growth slowed sharply in the quarter ended June 30, leaving government officials and private economists divided over the strength of the nation's economy.  The Economic Planning Agency said the economy slowed to an annual growth rate of 2% in the April-June period, the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year, compared with an 11.2% growth rate in the preceding quarter ended March 31.  Yasuo Katsumura, vice minister at the agency, stressed that the economic growth "is slowing down, but {remains} firm," reflecting solid domestic demand. Mr. Katsumura added that the growth is solid enough that the government's economic growth goal of 3.8% in the fiscal year ending next March 31 should be met.
