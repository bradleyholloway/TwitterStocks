 IPO Outlook: Jackson Seeks Bigger Share for Minorities   By By Dunstan Prial, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1999  But longtime observers of the IPO process are skeptical that even Mr. (Jesse) Jackson's formidable presence can do much to change how stock issuers select their IPO underwriters. The only color that matters on Wall Street, the skeptics say, is green.  Few Wall Street professionals were willing to address the issue on the record. But one longtime syndicate desk manager said minority-owned banks are caught in a classic Catch-22. Underwriters are chosen for their experience, he said. Yet few IPO-stage companies are willing to provide that experience by taking a chance on an unproven underwriter during what may be the most important phase of their early development.  Mr. Jackson said the absence of well-regarded minority-owned banks in the IPO process amounts to a "politics of exclusion that creates partitions between markets." He argued that chief executives who exclude minority underwriters from their initial public offerings are neglecting their fiduciary responsibilities by limiting access to their stock. "By limiting market penetration, they are limiting the potential for talent and money (that exists) within the minority community, and that's irresponsible," Mr. Jackson said.
