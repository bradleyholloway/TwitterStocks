 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1995  Investors thinking about buying mutual-fund shares soon should be careful not to fall into a painful year-end tax trap. Stock-market mutual funds typically distribute income and capital gains to shareholders around the end of each year, usually December. If you invest in a fund shortly before such a payout, you generally will owe 1995 taxes on the entire distribution, unless, of course, you bought the shares for a tax-deferred retirement account.  This year, many stock-market funds are likely to make unusually big payouts because of booming stock prices. Thus, investors need to be especially careful to check with funds about year-end distribution plans before buying, warns Stephen W. DeFilippis of West Suburban Income Tax Service in Glen Ellyn, Ill. Ask how much -- and when -- a fund expects to pay.  In most states, individual investors don't owe income taxes on interest they receive on municipal bonds issued within their state, but they do owe tax on out-of-state bonds. For example, New Yorkers aren't taxed on interest from New York bonds but are supposed to pay tax on New Jersey bonds. An Ohio investor argued that the state unconstitutionally interfered with interstate commerce by taxing the interest on her out-of-state municipal bonds, while exempting her in-state bonds, but she lost in state courts.
