 Love & Money: Premier Soccer:The Readers Weigh In   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  Paul LeBaron, in Fountain Valley, Calif., says he and his wife have "struggled with the idea of allowing our kids to play in higher levels of competition," not because of the financial and time constraints but because of the "emphasis on winning at all costs, brought to the team by parents and coaches who have a mixed up set of priorities. The concepts of 'playing a game' and 'having fun' have been replaced by 'college scholarships' and 'draft-day material.'"  "However," he says, "it also came with a price. We quickly found an abundance of unhealthy expectations." In one episode, a parent encouraged Mr. LeBaron's wife to order additional personalized baseball cards of one son "because if he makes it to the major leagues they will be worth a lot of money. Unfortunately, she was absolutely serious."  More broadly, Mr. [Tom Lowry] says, entry into competitive sports "tends to suppress all other interests and talents." He says it's easy to see that two of his kids should have "balanced their time across a number of activities." As for the one who has found the most success on the field, Mr. Lowry wonders: "What would he be today if he'd been exposed to a broad range of activities?"
