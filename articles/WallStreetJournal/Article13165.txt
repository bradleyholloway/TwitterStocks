 Romania's Probe Of Big Oil Firm Prompts Concerns   By Cretzan, Cristi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2005  Local media, human-rights groups and business groups say Romania's eagerness to prove its anticorruption credentials has helped spur overzealous prosecutors who sometimes show little respect for the legal rights of those being investigated. "You don't really know anymore who's guilty and who's not," says Matei Paun, managing partner at BAC Investment Bank here. "The justice isn't functioning."  Mr. [Traian Basescu] declined to comment specifically on Rompetrol's case, but his office released a statement last week criticizing those who question the way prosecutors move against alleged corruption cases. "If the political parties, the media and the business community protest against the state's authorities when they try to get to the big corruption, then certainly our EU accession will remain merely a dream," the statement said.  The allegations against Rompetrol date to November 2000, when the company paid the Romanian state $50.1 million to buy a refinery called Petromidia on the Black Sea coast. Petromidia became the main driver of the company's success, helping it to become one of the country's most successful companies, with revenue of $1.44 billion in 2004, second only to oil-and-gas company Petrom SA, owned by OMV AG of Austria.
