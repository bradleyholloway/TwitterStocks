 New Role for Viagra Ingredient   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2005  Pfizer said the FDA approval of Revatio was based on the results of a clinical trial involving 277 patients with pulmonary hypertension. The study measured the exercise capability of patients after 12 weeks of treatment, among other things. Patients in the study were split into four groups. Three groups received varying doses of Revatio and one received a placebo pill. All three treatment groups showed highly significant improvements in the six-minute walk distance, a measure used to determine the effectiveness of the drug, compared with those in the placebo group.
