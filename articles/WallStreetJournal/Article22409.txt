 Failure to Predict India's Tests Is Tied To Systemwide Intelligence Breakdown   By By Carla Anne Robbins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1998  The U.S. intelligence community's failure to predict India's nuclear tests was not an isolated incident but the result of systemwide weaknesses in analysis, collection and management, according to an independent review by retired Adm. David Jeremiah.  Adm. Jeremiah also criticized top managers of the intelligence community for failing to devote sufficient attention and resources to the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a non-rogue state such as India.  Adm. Jeremiah said that just one analyst was regularly assigned to monitor India's nuclear-weapons program. An intelligence official later explained that there was one "imagery analyst" assigned to monitor satellite pictures from the Indian program. The admiral also said that some activity at the test site had been detected by U.S. satellites in the days before the explosions-activity that was either overlooked or discounted at the time.
