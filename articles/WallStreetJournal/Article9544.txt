 Deals & Deal Makers: Merger Business Faces New Order With Court Ruling on `Lockups'   By By Robin Sidel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2003  The case stems from a situation last year in which Genesis Health Ventures Inc. agreed to buy rival NCS HealthCare Inc. for $40 million in stock. NCS rejected an $83 million offer from unsolicited buyer Omnicare Inc., in part because NCS's controlling shareholders had vowed to support the Genesis deal. Those two shareholders were NCS's chairman, and its president and chief executive.  In Friday's decision, the court noted that a board has a continuing obligation to find the best deal even after a merger agreement is signed. "The deal protection devices adopted by the NCS board were designed to coerce the consummation of the Genesis merger and preclude the consideration of any superior transaction," the decision said. It also said that, "although the minority shareholders were not forced to vote for the Genesis merger, they were required to accept it because it was a fait accompli."
