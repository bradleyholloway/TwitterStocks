 U.S. Starts Its Threatened Banana Fight With Europe --- Tariff Sanctions Are Put On 15 Types of Imports; EU Reacts With Anger   By By Helene Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1999  In its action, the U.S. imposed conditional tariff sanctions on these 15 categories. The tariffs take effect at once, but may be removed later. Importers won't have to pay the new, higher duties until the World Trade Organization in Geneva tells the U.S. exactly how much it is allowed to impose in these tariff increases.  Furious U.S. importers of the targeted goods said the announcement will mean a shutdown in imports of the hit-list products, which include Louis Vuitton plastic handbags from France, pecorino cheese from Italy and cashmere sweaters from Britain. Chandeliers and greeting cards, which were on the preliminary list of the doomed, were given clemency and taken off the list. But for the others, D-Day was yesterday.  The U.S. and European Union have been fighting over bananas for six years now; three times the WTO has ruled against Europe's banana policy, which favors imports of bananas from former European colonies in the Caribbean and Africa over bananas from South America shipped by Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole Food Co., both U.S. companies. Yesterday, U.S. agricultural trade negotiator Peter Scher said the U.S. is fed up with Europe's refusal to abide by WTO rulings.
