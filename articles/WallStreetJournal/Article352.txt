 Home Depot Co-Founder Now Remodeling Atlanta Falcons --- Arthur Blank Cuts Ticket Prices, Offers James Brown, Pointer Sisters To Woo Fans for NFL Laggard   By By Tommy Craggs, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 23, 2002  It was a rare quiet moment as training camp hustled to a close, and a sign of how the Falcons' new steward -- a co-founder and former chief executive of Home Depot Inc. -- wants to fix up the long-suffering franchise. Mr. [Blank] has taken pages out of Home Depot's business plan, from aggressive marketing and slashed ticket prices to bonding with a new employee. The challenge is to carry the lessons of a home-improvement giant to a sports organization that has hammered its thumb for 36 years. The Falcons, who visit Dallas tomorrow for their third preseason game, will make their regular-season home debut on Sept. 15.  Earlier this year, a few players told Mr. Blank that they needed a lounge at the team's headquarters in Flowery Branch, Ga. He handed over the mailroom and told a group of players to design it themselves. "They looked at me like, `What was I smoking?' " says Mr. Blank, who adds that the team is weighing a uniform change and would again seek player input.  So far, the Falcons have beaten both of their preseason opponents, drawing good crowds of 43,000 and 67,000 to the 71,000-seat Dome. The Aug. 9 opener -- a 23-13 victory over Jacksonville -- offered a first test of Mr. Blank's handiwork, and for the most part it was a success. Tailgaters sipped beer in the stadium's weedy remote lots. Inside, clowns trolled the aisles, the crowd did the wave, and a crackle of fireworks punctuated every Falcons score.
