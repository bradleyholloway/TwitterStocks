 TEXAS JOURNAL --- Once Hailed as a Health-Care Visionary, Chief Of Methodist Hospital Now Seen as a Troglodyte   By By Laura Johannes, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1993  At several recent staff meetings of the prestigious Methodist Hospital here, Chief Executive Officer Larry Mathis stood before employees to make an announcement: Contrary to rumors, he declared, he hadn't been dismissed.  Once viewed as the embodiment of all that was right with Texas hospitals, Mr. Mathis now often finds himself pilloried as a health-care troglodyte. His insistence on offering nothing but the best doctors and technology, expense be damned, is seen as the kind of thinking that has led to the explosion in health-care costs. He has tangled with the state attorney general's office over Methodist's reluctance to do more charity work. And he has been slow to accept the major national health-care trend of the past decade: managed care.  It certainly is, and Mr. Mathis may have little choice but to change. But it's clear that any change will come reluctantly. While he agrees with some principles of President Clinton's health-care proposals, including universal coverage, Mr. Mathis opposes the plan's cuts in Medicare and Medicaid spending -- and its price caps on the private sector. These cuts, he says may make it difficult to continue to offer the most up-to-date technology.
