 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; Building Portfolios With ETFs; Advisers Cite Benefits Of the Low-Cost Funds; Not Right for Everyone   By Arden, Dale, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2005  Mr. [David Elan] manages money for individuals and nonprofit organizations with between $250,000 and $2 million. What are the obstacles to convincing a client that ETFs are the way to go? "It's not really that they're concerned about potential problems," Mr. Elan says. "It's just that we sometimes have to explain to people that switching to ETFs is like switching to compact discs after listening to music on vinyl records. It is the same music, but in a better storage medium."  ETFs are "sold as being much cheaper than traditional mutual funds, but there's also a big difference between the [fees] of different ETFs," says Dan Culloton, a Morningstar analyst. "It would be foolish not to compare relative differences between the costs of ETFs."  Investors also should beware of switching to automatic pilot after purchasing just one or two ETFs, he warns. "I'm afraid when investors think about ETFs, some are going to say, 'Oh, I can just buy a single ETF for my account and hold it,' " says Mr. [John Stoeser]. "That's not optimal because you're missing out on a whole universe of opportunities to further diversify the risk in a portfolio."
