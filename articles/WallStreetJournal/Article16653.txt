 Politics & Economics: U.S., 8 Countries Meet to Discuss Fighter-Jet Project   By Karp, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2006  There also is a lingering dispute with Israel, which is likely to be a big JSF buyer. The Pentagon halted JSF cooperation last year in protest against Israeli weapons sales to China. Limited contacts resumed recently, after Israel agreed to protect sensitive technologies. But Pentagon bosses aren't confident enough to restore full information sharing. For instance, they won't allow Mr. [Jon Schreiber]'s staff to disclose findings of JSF performance studies conducted at Israel's request. "Even though the dialogue is starting up again, we've still got one hand tied behind our back," Mr. Schreiber said.  Norway, which had complained about its share of subcontracts, recently reaffirmed its commitment to the program. And Britain, which threatened in March to quit the JSF, has been mollified by President Bush's assurance to Prime Minister Tony Blair that Washington's closest ally would get technology to operate and customize the plane independently. Details must still be negotiated over how the U.S. will share sensitive information, such as the plane's computer-software codes and details of its radar, engine and radar-absorbing skin.
