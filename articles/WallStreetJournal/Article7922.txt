 Bush's Get-Tough Drug Plan Shares Philosophy That Didn't Work for Rockefeller 20 Years Ago   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1989  A far-reaching drug plan that envisions tougher law enforcement -- with mandatory sentencing and a crackdown on small-time drug users.  It sounds a lot like the proposal President Bush unveiled Tuesday night. But to some people, it has the distinct ring of the doomed anti-drug effort that New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller led 20 years ago.  Nearly two decades ago, amid another "drug epidemic," Gov. Rockefeller sought to battle drug use by making his state what the Drug Abuse Council called a "laboratory" for a tougher government approach. Although the Bush plan is far more sophisticated than the relatively crude scheme proposed by the late New York Republican, they share a "get-tough" philosophy, an emphasis on punishing drug users and a reliance on mandatory minimum sentences.
