 Elan Permanently Halts Development Of Its AN-1792 Vaccine for Alzheimer's   By By Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2002  It is also a setback in general for efforts to fight Alzheimer's, the most common cause of dementia and the fourth-leading cause of death in developed countries. Elan's Alzheimer's vaccine had sparked hope because it was the only one to have ever made it to the midstage of human-testing. Elan had temporarily halted dosing of patients in January.  It isn't clear whether the patients suffered side effects because of the toxic effects of beta amyloid. But in January, Elan said it had halted dosing patients with the drug after four developed signs that indicated inflammation of the central nervous system, including headaches, stiff necks and fevers. Since then, 11 additional patients were reported with symptoms associated with such inflammation.  The clinical trials for the compound were conducted in the U.S. and four European countries, including France and Switzerland. Elan said it has several alternative products in the preclinical stage of testing as part of its collaboration with American Home to develop an effective and safe Alzheimer's vaccine.
