 Letters to the Editor: Regulators Nip an Industry in the Bud   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1998  In your article describing the potential of genetic engineering to produce a "supertree" (Marketplace, Jan. 13), you touched on many of the challenges faced by plant breeders, but neglected to mention one major pest: federal regulation. The Agriculture Department continues to impose unnecessary and hugely expensive field test design and other requirements on plants (including trees) that have been improved with precise genetic techniques. For example, gene-spliced plants being shipped or cultivated cannot be mixed with plants modified in other ways (which includes virtually all cultivated crop and garden plants), and all living plants must be destroyed at the completion of the field trial. The effect is to make a field trial with a gene-spliced plant 10-20 times more expensive than the same experiment performed with a plant that has identical properties, but which was modified with less precise genetic techniques.
