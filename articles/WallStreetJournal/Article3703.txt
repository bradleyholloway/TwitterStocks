 Saban Weighs New KirchMedia Bid; Possible Lower Offer Is a Bet Company's Weak Outlook Will Induce Renewed Talks   By Karnitschnig, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2003  Betting KirchMedia's bankruptcy administrators won't find another buyer for at least a year and that the company's earnings and debt outlooks have lowered its value, Mr. [Haim Saban] is trying to draw the administrators back to the table, people familiar with the matter said.  KirchMedia, Germany's No. 2 commercial broadcaster after Bertelsmann AG's RTL Group, went on the block last year after filing for bankruptcy. Though the auction offered bidders a rare opportunity to grab a big chunk of Europe's largest television audience, a depressed media market and concern about the company's debt kept bids below what creditors had anticipated and the process has dragged on for more than a year.  KirchMedia's creditor banks -- which include Bayerische Landesbank, HVB Group, Commerzbank AG and DZ Bank -- have greeted Mr. Saban's overture with skepticism, people close to the banks said. For an offer to succeed, it would have to match the original bid, one of the people said. Mr. Saban's planned offer would be well below ProSiebenSat.1's current share price of 7.20 euros on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
