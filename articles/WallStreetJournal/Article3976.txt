 Fuzzy Trade Math   By Panagariya, Arvind, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2005  The New York Times has editorialized that the "developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies," which "encourages overproduction" and drives down prices. The World Bank's president, Paul Wolfowitz, similarly referred to developed countries expending "$280 billion on support to agricultural producers" in an op-ed in the Financial Times. Oxfam routinely accuses rich countries of giving more than $300 billion annually in subsidies to agribusiness. Astonishingly, these estimates bear virtually no relationship to the subsidies actually at the heart of the Doha negotiations. Instead, they have their origins in the altogether different measure called the Producer Support Estimate (PSE), published by the OECD. The PSE includes all measures that raise the producer price above the world price, including border measures such as tariffs and quotas. All economists would find the identification of such a measure with subsidies unacceptable.  The U.S. has a comparative advantage in agriculture, so insists on within-sector reciprocity in the form of market access in return for its concessions on subsidies. The EU and larger developing countries including the Cairns Group, who have high agricultural tariffs, are in a position to offer this reciprocity. But the EU lacks comparative advantage in agriculture. Therefore, it will only be giving concessions in this sector and needs cross-sector reciprocity. Here again the larger developing countries have a crucial role to play. Industrial tariffs remain high in the Cairns Group developing countries as well as in India, China and Pakistan. They can offer the EU the necessary reciprocity.
