 Pioneer Agrees to Buy Evergreen In Bid for Natural Gas in Rockies   By Gold, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2004  Pioneer will pay about $38.47 for each Evergreen share, offering 0.58 shares and $19.50 cash per share. That is 5.3% below Evergreen's closing price Monday of $40.63 per share. While paying less than the market price is unusual, Mark Sexton, chairman and chief executive of Evergreen, said the company "already has a merger premium built into its stock price."  The combined companies will have about 3.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 426 million barrels of oil in proved reserves. The bulk of Evergreen's production is in the Raton Basin in New Mexico and Colorado. Pioneer has focused its exploration in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as well as in Africa and South America. Pioneer plans to finance the deal through $1.2 billion in new and assumed debt.
