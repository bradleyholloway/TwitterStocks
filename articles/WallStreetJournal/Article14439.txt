 Commonwealth Edison Increases Estimate for Plant   By By Bill Richards, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1988  Commonwealth Edison Co. has raised to $5.14 billion its estimate to complete its two-unit Braidwood nuclear plant, a move that could cost the utility's shareholders as much as $90.3 million.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commonwealth Edison blamed regulatory delays for at least part of the increase. The utility's last estimate of Braidwood's cost was $5 billion in November 1985.  Commonwealth Edison also moved up to June 30 from Sept. 30 the date it expects to put the second Braidwood unit into service. Braidwood 1 went into service in November. The Illinois Commerce Commission is conducting proceedings on whether Commonwealth Edison should be allowed to charge customers for the units, which have been criticized as being too big and too costly for present electrical needs. A final decision on the amount of money the utility can charge its customers for Braidwood isn't expected before the summer.
