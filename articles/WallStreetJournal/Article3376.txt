 Chesapeake Revises Results, Hires 2 Advisers   By By Queena Sook Kim, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2000  Paper and specialty-packaging company Chesapeake Corp. said it reduced its previously announced third-quarter results and restated financial results for the first two quarters of 2000 due in large part to accounting errors in the company's U.S. display business. The company also retained McKinsey & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Goldman, Sachs & Co. to explore strategic alternatives for its U.S. display business.  Since 1997, Richmond-based Chesapeake has sold off the timber, linerboard and tissue paper portions of its company and has been aggressively buying specialty-packaging companies in the U.S. and Europe. The company held onto its U.S. display business and has invested about $130 million to $150 million since the late 1990s only to post marginal profits.
