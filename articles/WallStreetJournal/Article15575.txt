 Are supply-siders all washed up?   By Moore, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1997  Stephen Moore says that higher tax revenues introduced by President Clinton in 1993 and the resulting increase in tax collections do not prove that supply-siders were wrong. Moore points out that tax receipts grew faster in the Reagan years, when taxes were cut, than in the Bush and Clinton years, when taxes rose.
