 Companies Betting Americans Like Fat In Their Food Again --- As Consumers' Concerns Fall, Raft of New Products Are Fat-Laden, Calorie-Packed   The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2000  CHICAGO (AP) -- Craving some fat? Sara Lee Corp. is betting you will like its new Calzone Creations microwavable sandwiches with as much as 12 grams of artery-clogging saturated fat, 60% of the recommended daily intake for an average person.  With Americans worrying less about fat and calories these days, food makers are rolling out a raft of fat-laden, calorie-packed new products at the supermarket industry's annual trade show.  Among the other new goodies: Oscar Meyer Lunchables sweet rolls that the kids can carry to school for recess and single-serving packs of dip from Dean Foods Co. that people can take to the office to make those carrots and other veggies go down easier. And there are new versions of Nestle SA's Power Bar, a staple of long-distance runners, that are essentially vitamin-fortified candy bars, with up to eight times as much saturated fat as the original.
