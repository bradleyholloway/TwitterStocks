 China Tempers Anti-Japan Rhetoric, Emphasizes Economic Ties   By Pottinger, Matt, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2005  "Lately, there has been a saying about China-Japan relations, that they are cold politically but warm economically," said the ministry official. "We really hope to avoid the emergence of coldness in both politics and economics. That wouldn't be in the interest of either country, and it wouldn't be in the interest of this region."  Japanese leaders also sought to strike a more moderate tone. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi yesterday said he welcomed Mr. Li's instruction to curb unauthorized anti-Japan protests as a sign that China has begun to seek to mend fences, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. "There was a clear tone [in Mr. Li's statements] that the 2,000-year-long history of friendship between Japan and China should be treasured," Mr. Koizumi told reporters, according to Kyodo. "We can share that idea."  Some seasoned anti-Japan campaigners appear to be heeding the government's message to tone it down. The Patriots' Alliance Web has posted notices on its Internet site to remind people to eschew violence. The site's Web master, Lu Yunfei, said the fervor for protests is dying down because the demonstrations have been successful. "With these protests, we've succeeded in drawing the attention of Japan and the international community to the fact that we Chinese are angry with Japan," he said.
