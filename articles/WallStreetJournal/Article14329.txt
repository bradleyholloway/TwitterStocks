 Red Greenbacks: The Dollar Is Strong In Poland, at Least, And Greatly Treasured --- People Use 'Lettuce' to Buy Hard-to-Get Merchandise In State's Pewex Catalogs --- Vodka's Internal-Export Role   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1987  The Poles, who have a joke for everything, have a joke about internal export. "In what way," it goes, "are Poland and America exactly the same?" Answer: "In America, you can buy everything for dollars and nothing for zlotys. In Poland, exactly the same."  Poland has a lot of American dollars mainly because America has a lot of Poles. Polish-Americans have sent cash to Poland for so long that old silver certificates turn up here all the time. The American Embassy still hands out short-stay visas to 60,000 Poles a year; many stay on illegally, work, and bring home the lettuce.  Quickly, Pewex grew. Sales last year reached $356 million, and more than $120 million went into the government's strongbox. Now Pewex runs 650 shops all over Poland. Warsaw has the housewares Pewex, a sports Pewex, a Lego Pewex. The street outside the Wrangler Pewex is East European gray. The floors inside are bright yellow, the walls dark blue, the counters dark blue, the shelves bright yellow. Everything is Western except the prices; jeans sell for $14.50.
