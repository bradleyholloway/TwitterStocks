 U.S. Car Makers Weigh Severe Cutbacks --- Production Plans Trimmed As Hopes for Rebound Fade   By By Gregory A. Patterson Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1991  Sluggish sales forced Ford this week to shut its luxury-car factory in Wixom, Mich., for the first time since the recession of 1981-82. The big Lincoln Town Cars, Continentals and Mercury Mark VIIs built at that factory alone contributed more than $1 billion of profit annually for Ford in the late 1980s. But Ford sales fell 14% in October, and the company has dropped 50,000 cars from its fourth-quarter production plans.  The 10 major U.S. auto makers still plan to increase fourth-quarter car and truck production by 15% to 2,502,403 vehicles. But that increase is from a year-ago quarter that saw U.S. vehicle production fall to the lowest level since the previous recession in 1982. The low year-ago U.S. production led to a combined $2.1 billion loss for GM and Ford in the 1990 fourth quarter.  Moreover, actual production rates already are falling behind the latest schedules. GM, for example, said it planned to boost fourth-quarter U.S. car production by 21% over a depressed year-ago level. Going into the fourth quarter, GM had lean inventories of certain models because of production cuts earlier in the year. But in October, GM built 19,000 fewer cars than it had scheduled, and dealers predict more cuts unless sales pick up.
