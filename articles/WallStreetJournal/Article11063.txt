 South Africa Frees ANC's Former Chief --- Release of Mbeki Increases Chances Mandela, Others In Jail Will Be Set Free   By By Roger Thurow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1987  The former chairman, Govan Mbeki, who along with Mr. Mandela was convicted of sabotage and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964, was released from Robben Island prison in Table Bay near Cape Town and flown to Port Elizabeth to be reunited with his wife. Mr. Mbeki, who is 77 years old, is one of seven black ANC members who were convicted at the famous Rivonia sabotage trial, and is the first to be freed.  The government hasn't specified its reasons for yesterday's action, other than to say it was part of a "continuous process." But over the past several weeks, government sources and political analysts have been speculating that the release of Mr. Mbeki might serve to test the waters for a possible release of Mr. Mandela, who is 69. Mr. Mandela is considered by a large portion of the black community to be their political leader, even though many in the community are too young to have ever seen him or heard him speak. In South Africa, it is illegal to quote Mr. Mandela or to publish a photo of him.  The reaction of the black community over the next several weeks will be watched closely by the government, which wants to gauge the impact of the release of Mr. Mbeki, who is also highly revered. Should his release inspire a new round of anti-government activity, the government may rethink any inclination it has to release Mr. Mandela. But should Mr. Mbeki's freedom and presence have a calming effect, the government might be emboldened to give Mr. Mandela his freedom, perhaps, some sources speculated, as soon as sometime next year.
