 CBOE Takes Yet Another Step Toward Hybrid Trading System   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2002  "Our greatest strength is the depth and liquidity of our market makers," said CBOE Chairman William Brodsky over a breakfast meeting at the 20th annual Options Industry Conference here over the weekend. "The best of both worlds is if we have a floor system that combines our price discovery and ability to handle complex trades with the speed and efficiency of electronic trading."  Despite these small steps, the CBOE is still a long way from the kind of "side-by-side" system where floor-based and screen-based networks co-exist to serve both investors who want instant electronic execution and those who prefer a floor auction. In fact, some CBOE members have likened CBOEdirect to a "Maserati kept in the garage" that the CBOE has yet to take out for a real spin. That gradual rollout is driven in part by political pressure; the CBOE can't use CBOEdirect as a primary trading system without a vote from its about 1,600 members.
