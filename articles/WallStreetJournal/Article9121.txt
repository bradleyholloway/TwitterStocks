 Guess Who's Logging In for Online Travel Talk?   By By Jane Costello The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1999  In April, Ms. (Mary Jo) Welsh announced her presence on FlyerTalk, a frequent-flier discussion group sponsored by the publishers of InsideFlyer magazine.  "I handle what I can and forward feedback to the appropriate people," Ms. Welsh said. She described FlyerTalk participants as "skilled and thoughtful users" of the program. Her decision to publicly identify herself to others on the Internet discussion boards "just seemed to make sense," she said. And while Ms. Welsh has chosen to go the extra mile and identify herself to FlyerTalkers, others at Northwest log on anonymously to monitor the buzz in cyberspace.  The company employs a clipping service to monitor various discussion groups, but Mr. (Jon) Austin said Northwest staff drops in from time to time to check out the newsgroups and respond to a posting, "especially if it's egregious enough." Iratetraveler.com There are myriad newsgroups, bulletin boards and chat rooms on the Internet dedicated to travel, including FlyerTalk, the Usenet newsgroup rec.travel.air, Yahoo Inc.'s travel bulletin boards and the discussion boards at Trip.com. There also are sites by irate travelers to encourage others to air concerns about airlines.
