 Yes, Tax the Guy Behind the Tree   By By Arthur B. Laffer and Martin G. Laffer, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1988  What we have in mind is a tax increase that could generate $40 billion to $60 billion immediately and lesser amounts on a continuing basis. And, rather astoundingly, the payers of this tax would be better off; and output and productivity could rise in its wake.  Many of us who pushed the idea of lower tax rates over the past decade believed that a spinoff benefit would be the rapid shrinkage of the underground economy, as the benefits of evading taxes were reduced and the penalties for evading them remained unchanged. How wrong we were. Estimates by the Internal Revenue Service of the "tax gap" as late as last year still showed more than 10% of what was due remained hidden.  Our mistake was to underestimate the enormous power of precedence in conjunction with fear. People who have cheated on their taxes find it impossible to fess up and pay now even if they never would begin to cheat under the current tax codes. Reporting income for the first time is seen as a sure way to trigger a federal inquiry. Past tax anomalies under the cold, bright light of the IRS would sooner or later lead to criminal indictment or civil fraud penalties and God-knows-what.
