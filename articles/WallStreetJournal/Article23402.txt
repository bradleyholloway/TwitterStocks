 Barron's Insight: Brokers' Bounty May Ebb   By Doherty, Jacqueline, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  The Federal Reserve's interest- rate boosts have drained cash from U.S. markets and made borrowing costlier, and foreign central banks are starting to raise rates, too. In time, investors are likely to have less appetite for risk, which could hinder the brokers' ability to underwrite stock and bond offerings profitably. Mr. [Charles Peabody], who has sell ratings on brokerage shares, says, "Earnings could drop 30% next year."  Wall Street's biggest brokers also have minted money by trading for their own accounts. There is no guarantee they'll maintain their hot hands, which helps explain the disparity in analysts' opinions about their future earnings. In short, the brokers have had the wind at their backs in recent years, and that is unlikely to continue. Investors sitting on profits in these stocks might want to lighten up, because the wind could blow the other way soon.
