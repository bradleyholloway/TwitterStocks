 Career Journal: The Jungle   By By Kris Maher, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  TMP's Monster.com subsidiary is the most widely visited career site by job seekers and lists more than 400,000 job openings. TMP announced its plan to acquire HotJobs.com, which lists more than 100,000 jobs, on June 29.  Mr. [Darren J. Farlow] believes FreeJob's Web site, which lists roughly 1,000 ads per month for free-lance opportunities that job seekers can bid on, would be threatened by the combined online presence. A HotJobs.com spokeswoman, who said she was aware of FreeJob's opposition, declined to comment. "This is just part of the process," a TMP spokesman said. "Any acquisition of this magnitude is going to go through scrutiny."  The after-tax discount for directors ranged from 20% to 40%, depending on the quality of the diamonds. According to GE's proxy, seven directors elected to make purchases, ranging from $25,565 by Silas S. Cathcart to $409,980 by Kenneth G. Langone. "Certainly this is out of the ordinary," says Judith Fischer, managing director of consultants Executive Compensation Advisory Services in Alexandria, Va. GE offered employees a similar diamond discount and "several hundred" took part. Mr. Cathcart couldn't be reached, and Mr. Langone declined to comment.
