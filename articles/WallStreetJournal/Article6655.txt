 Hot Topic: Wounded Warriors at Walter Reed   By Topic, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2007  Why didn't soldiers receive better care at Walter Reed? Of the nearly 24,000 soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, around 25% have been to Walter Reed. Officials admitted that the center's outpatient system became overwhelmed by an unexpectedly high number of soldiers returning from war, reaching a peak of 874 outpatients from a prewar level of about 100.  The challenge for the military has been helping wounded soldiers in the transition from inpatient care to outpatient care, where recovering soldiers have languished. Hospitals such as Walter Reed were unprepared to play long-term host to wounded soldiers. They have been hampered by staff shortages, leaving case managers burdened with more soldiers than they can manage.  Wounded soldiers also face a convoluted bureaucracy as they leave the Defense Department's care and transition into the veterans' health-care system. To get disability benefits, for example, soldiers must apply to a processing center, many of which have been overwhelmed. Soldiers tell of receiving excellent medical care immediately after their injury only to wait months, and in some cases years, to receive continuing care or disability checks provided by Veterans Affairs.
