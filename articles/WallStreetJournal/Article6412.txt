 Finisar, Digital River, AirTran Fall; Playboy Swings to a Profit, Sending Stock 5.8% Higher; Krispy Kreme Tumbles   By Schreiber, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2005  The market interpreted Cisco's outlook as "a barometer for other tech companies' growth prospects," said Michael Palazzi, director of equity trading at SG Cowen & Co. He also said investors were taking profits from last week's stock advance.  Chinadotcom, a Hong Kong software and mobile-applications company, rose 26 cents, or 7.4%, to 3.79. Pacific Growth Equities raised its investment rating on the stock to "equal weight" from "under weight" on expectations the company will meet the investment firm's quarterly earnings estimates.  Action Performance Cos. (NYSE) climbed 1.53, or 14%, to 12.66. Though the Phoenix company's quarterly net loss widened, the distributor of licensed motorsports merchandise said it is restructuring its distribution channels for its domestic wholesale die-cast business, a move the company said would provide greater margin opportunities and visibility into its business. The company also said it won't pay its quarterly dividend, coincident with the restructuring and will evaluate this policy quarterly.
