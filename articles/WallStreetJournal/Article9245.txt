 Congress Stays Bogged Down in Spending Bills   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2000  Kentucky lawmakers are attempting to use the bill to amend the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 to protect racetracks from risk of prosecution for betting on races simulcast at tracks. In testimony this past spring, a top attorney in the Justice Department's criminal division raised questions about whether such betting could be in violation of federal law. The testimony was "a little disconcerting," said an official for the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.  In a surprising turn, negotiators on the agriculture bill agreed to relax rules governing food-stamp beneficiaries to allow poor working families to own a better car and deduct more housing costs. But there was no such sympathy for fish-eating cormorants and white pelican birds, which are increasingly a problem for catfish farmers in Southern states. Tens of thousands of dollars were added to the agriculture bill to come up with means to "control" the birds, which, rather than migrating, are often settling in, given the ready food supply.
