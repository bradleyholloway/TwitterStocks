 IPO Slowdown May Mean Some Bargains --- Analysts Believe Buyers Hold the Upper Hand   By By Scott Reeves, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1994  "Neither the companies nor the underwriters had to consider the buyers in 1993, or early this year," said Charles Ronson, an analyst at Balestra Capital Management and publisher of IPO Value Monitor. "For them, the last quarter has been traumatic. But sobering news for them isn't necessarily an indication that the market has died. There is a new-issues market, and it's now conducted on the buyers' terms."  Dan Case, president of Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a San Francisco-based securities firm, said he expects IPO volume to remain at "healthy levels," but down from the "frenzied peaks" of last year.  "In the last three or four months, the IPO market has gotten a little tougher, meaning there's better value for buyers," Mr. Taylor said. "There's less hype now, and it's tougher to bring an IPO to market. So if you've done your homework and if you're right, you'll do fine."
