 GM Tripled Pay, Bonuses, Incentives Of Chairman Smith to $12 Million in '99   By By Gregory L. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2000  For the first time, GM also is tying part of its top executives' compensation to stock-market performance. In recent years, GM has sought to tighten the link between shareholder returns and management compensation. After several years of lackluster performance, GM last year outperformed rivals and some market averages, providing a return to shareholders of 26%, the company said.  In a preliminary proxy statement filed Friday, GM also said that it is nominating Lloyd G. Ward to join the board. The 51-year-old is president and chief executive of Maytag Corp. Four GM directors are leaving the board this year, including John Smale, who led the 1992 boardroom coup that brought Mr. [John F.] Smith and his team into the top jobs. Board members will elect a successor to Mr. Smale as chairman of the executive committee, the official representative of the outside directors to management, at their meeting in June, a spokesman said.  In the latest proxy, the compensation committee of the GM board said that bonuses for 1999, while high, were below the maximum level they had envisioned because of a failure to meet targets on market share and product quality in some regions. GM had record profits in North America, but results in Europe fell far short of the company's goals and its operations in Latin America and Asia lost money.
