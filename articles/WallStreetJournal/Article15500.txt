 Probe Studies if Texaco Officials Planned to Destroy Documents   By By Peter Fritsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1996  The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York took the unusual action in response to disclosures that company executives were taped in August 1994 discussing whether to destroy documents. At the time of the discussion, attorneys representing black Texaco employees in a suit against the company had requested the documents.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Okula yesterday prepared to issue grand-jury subpoenas to the Texaco officials involved, according to Peter Gass, a lawyer representing Richard A. Lundwall, a former Texaco human-resources coordinator in Texaco's finance department. "I have received a request from Mr. Okula to receive a subpoena, and we intend to cooperate," Mr. Gass said.  Mr. Lundwall, according to court papers filed in the civil discrimination case in White Plains, N.Y., recorded a discussion he had with other Texaco officials in which he offered to "shred" a key document in the case. He and the other officials, according to a transcript of the tape, also referred to minority employees with racial epithets, such as "black jelly beans" and "niggers." Mr. Lundwall couldn't be reached. The recording's existence was reported in Monday's New York Times.
