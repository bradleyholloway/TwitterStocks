 Monthly Mutual Funds Review --- Funds Search for a Place in the Stars --- Some Portfolios to Drop To Earth After Changes In Morningstar Ratings   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2002  Since 1985, when Morningstar launched its rating system soon after the company was formed, funds have been grouped into four categories when rated: U.S. stocks, international stocks, taxable bonds and municipal bonds. Starting June 30, however, funds will be sorted and ranked within 48 much-narrower Morningstar categories for stocks and bonds.  A: No. Morningstar currently awards five stars to about 1,000 funds or fund share classes, and that number will stay the same. But instead of only the top 10% of the current U.S. stock category getting five stars, the maximum celestial honors will go to the top 10% of each of the new categories for U.S. stocks. Morningstar had used the new categories for different ratings before, but not for its star ratings.  In defining size, Morningstar will move to a more flexible percentage-based system. Through last month, Morningstar defined large-cap stocks as the biggest 250 U.S. stocks as measured by market price times the number of shares outstanding. The next 750 stocks were considered midcap and the rest were small cap. Now, large-cap stocks are defined as those that make up the top 70% of capitalization of the U.S. stock market. Midcaps represent the next 20% and small caps get the rest.
