 Soviets Rethink Plan for Reform Of Economy --- Absence of Progress Divides Economists and Leaves The Public Pessimistic   By By Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1988  As Mikhail Gorbachev's plans for radical economic reform get increasingly bogged down in practical difficulties, Soviet officials are being forced to rethink parts of the overall strategy.  The result is growing confusion among economists and pessimism among the Soviet public. In an opinion poll published in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on Saturday, 33% of those surveyed thought long lines for food and other goods wouldn't be done away with "during their lifetime, if ever." A mere 0.3% were optimistic that the lines would disappear within a year or two.  Western analysts say changing the centrally fixed system of wholesale and retail prices and abolishing huge consumer subsidies is indispensable for the success of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reform package. But leading Soviet economists, fearing that the price reform could unleash inflation and create political unrest, now argue that it should be postponed until other problems related to it are solved.
