 Canadian Troops Board U.S. Freighter That Transports Arms Held in Dispute   By By Julian Beltrame, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2000  Peter Margan, president of Third Ocean Marine, said he wouldn't make any comment on the Canadian navy action until this afternoon. He had said he was prepared to deliver the cargo if Canadian officials guaranteed that his company would be paid US$190,000 of the US$294,000 he said was owed by Andromeda. Andromeda officials say delays caused by Third Ocean Marine resulted in cost overruns, a charge denied by the Maryland boat owner.
