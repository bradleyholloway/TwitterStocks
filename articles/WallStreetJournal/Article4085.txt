 Failed Canadian Bank Had Underestimated Its Loan-Loss Needs   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1985  A government-appointed investigator said that Canadian Commercial Bank, which failed last month, seriously underestimated its loan-loss provisions.  George Hitchman said in his report before the bank failed that it should provide for loan losses of between $910 million (Canadian) and $1.06 billion, or about 40% of total loans. The report said the bank's president, Gerald McLaughlan, had intended to report $45 million in loan-loss provisions for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31. Mr. McLaughlan couldn't be reached for comment.  Mr. Hitchman, a retired vice chairman of Bank of Nova Scotia, was retained by the Canadian government last June to examine the assets of Canadian Commercial Bank, which the government was attempting to rescue.
