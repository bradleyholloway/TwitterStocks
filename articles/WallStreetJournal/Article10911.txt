 Coke Scraps Its Plan to Buy Dr Pepper, Whose Owner Cites Litigation Prospects   By By John Helyar, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1986  Coca-Cola Co. scrapped its proposed acquisition of Dr Pepper Co. at the request of the Dallas-based concern's owner, Forstmann Little & Co.  Yesterday's action ends the latest chapter of the cola wars between Coca-Cola, a soft-drink and entertainment giant, and PepsiCo Inc., its Purchase, N.Y.-based rival. PepsiCo in January agreed to buy Seven-Up Co. from Philip Morris Cos. for $380 million. Coca-Cola countered in February with its proposed purchase of Dr Pepper, the nation's third-largest soft-drink concern. The proposed transactions would have given PepsiCo and Coca-Cola a combined 80% share of the domestic soft-drink market.  PepsiCo shelved its plans to acquire Seven-Up's domestic operations after the FTC expressed its opposition. But Coca-Cola had pressed on until now with the Dr Pepper acquisition plan. An internal company document in the court file suggests that the main purpose of the proposed transaction had been to scuttle the PepsiCo-Seven-Up agreement by stirring public and government opposition to such consolidations. Coca-Cola officials have denied such a motive.
