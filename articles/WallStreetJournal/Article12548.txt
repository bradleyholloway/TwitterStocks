 Drubbing of Internet Stocks Goes World-Wide, Spurred by This Week's Volatility on Nasdaq   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Craig Karmin in New York, Henny Sender in Hong Kong and Douglas Appell in Kuala Lumpur, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  At the same time, pressure is building on hundreds of European and Asian startups to delay their IPOs, or at least reduce the size or price of the issue. Some have already succumbed: HSBC Investment Bank Asia said yesterday that ColbyNet, a Hong Kong retailer with a business-to-business Internet strategy, would postpone its IPO until market conditions improved.  "There's no way I'm going to buy an Internet IPO now," said Eric Ritter, portfolio manager of the Driehaus Asia-Pacific Fund in Chicago and a big buyer of IPOs and technology shares last year. "You have to go back and take another look at the Old Economy stocks."  Hong Kong tech stocks hardly fared better. At the height of Internet mania in February, people lined the streets of Hong Kong for the chance to buy the IPO of tom.com. Yesterday, investors queued for the opportunity to discharge the unfashionable stock, sending the share price down 16% to 9.05 Hong Kong dollars.
