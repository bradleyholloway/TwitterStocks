 Merrill Reports 25% Rise in Net For 1st Period --- Securities Giant Had Boost In Revenue, Less Taxes; Analysts Differ on Data   By By Steve Swartz, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  Merrill Lynch & Co.'s first-quarter net income rose 25% from a year earlier, reflecting record revenue in some sectors and a lower effective tax rate.  The nation's largest securities firm earned $108.6 million, or $1 a share, compared with $86.8 million, or 85 cents a share, on fewer shares outstanding, in last year's first quarter, which was the industry's strongest ever. Merrill's earnings were depressed in the year-ago quarter by a $17.3 million charge for possible losses from the default of a customer in its Tokyo office.  Capitalizing on the current bull market, Merrill Lynch for the 1987 first quarter posted record commission revenues, asset management and custodial fees, and trading profits for its own account. Investment banking revenue also was up 68% to $257.4 million after strong increases in equity underwriting and high-yield, high-risk bond financings, company officials said. Mergers and acquisitions revenues were about flat for the quarter.
