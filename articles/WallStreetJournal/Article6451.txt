 Americas: A Young Defender of Democracy Faces Chavez's Wrath   By O'Grady, Mary Anastasia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2005  Ms. [Maria Corina Machado] is one of the leaders of Sumate, a nongovernmental organization resisting efforts by President Hugo Chavez's to turn Venezuela into a dictatorship. Because of its vocal objections to the many steps Chavez has taken to consolidate his power, Sumate has become an "enemy of the people," in the traditional language of tyranny. The conspiracy charge stems from the $31,000 that Sumate took for non-partisan educational work from the U.S.'s National Endowment for Democracy, which promotes free and fair elections abroad.  Ms. Machado could go to jail for up to 16 years. Yet, after the past two weeks, in which she met personally with President Bush in Washington and attended the general assembly of the Organization of American States in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., persecuting her would carry a high price, turning the millions of dollars Chavez has spent on polishing his image abroad into a waste of money. Her case has been internationalized by Mr. Bush himself as a means of showing Venezuelans and the region that he is watching Chavez's misbehavior.  Ms. Machado plays down her role in mobilizing the democratic movement. Instead, she passes credit to her Sumate colleagues, especially founder Alejandro Plaz also charged with conspiracy by Chavez, and others, like Oscar Valles who spoke for Sumate at the OAS meeting. Mostly, she emphasizes, "This is the hard work of thousands of Venezuelans who want to live in a democracy."
