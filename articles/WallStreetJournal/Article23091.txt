 Sweet Sabotage   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  We hear the ink was dry on 70% of such a trade accord -- until the sugar industry started agitating to exclude itself from Australian competition. Perhaps because it's an election year, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick suggested in an interview with a North Dakota radio station last month that he's happy to oblige. The U.S. "position," he said, "is not to have any increase in sugar from Australia." Mr. Zoellick's office later added that "We're going to try to keep sugar off the table but we don't know how successful we'll be."  The trade precedent here is also terrible. The U.S. has long had a "no exemption" policy while negotiating trade accords, for the obvious reason that after the first exception is granted, everyone wants one. Soon the deal is worthless. As free-trade Congressmen Cal Dooley (D., California) and John Boehner (R., Ohio) recently wrote to President Bush, "We are dismayed that you have now reversed your position and fear that the United States will pay a heavy cost for this decision."
