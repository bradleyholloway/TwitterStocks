 Pesticide Measure Is Passed by House And Sent to Senate   By By Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1988  The House passed a slimmed-down pesticide bill that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine more than 600 ingredients used in pesticides for health and environmental effects.  The bill would provide for any chemicals registered before that time to be more quickly re-registered, in part by shifting some of the re-examination cost burden to the industry. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has estimated that it would take the EPA 35 more years to register the older pesticides at the EPA's current rate of testing. The bill would set a schedule for the EPA to re-register those pesticides in nine years.
