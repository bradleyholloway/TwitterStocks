 Politics & Economics: Indian Unrest Ensnares a Doctor; 'Rights Activists' Such as Dr. Sen Caught in Middle   By Krishna Pokharel and Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2007  His backers say he was targeted simply because of his government critiques. "Dr. Binayak Sen is an unfortunate victim," says Mukul Sharma, director for Amnesty International in India, saying Dr. Sen is one of several "rights activists" subjected to harassment, arrest and torture in a nation that often takes pride in being the world's largest secular democracy.  The groups, known as Salwa Judum, have become an increasingly powerful force by filling a void left by ineffective government. "The government doesn't have the self-confidence to maintain law and order in the state," says Puran Lal Agarwal, chairman of the Chhattisgarh Chamber of Commerce. Instead, the Salwa Judum -- "purification hunt" in a local dialect -- regularly searches villages for Naxalite sympathizers, removes villagers from their land, purportedly for their own protection, and, say human-rights activists, regularly engages in killings, looting and rape.  The state is widely suspected of providing support for the Salwa Judum. A [Chhattisgarh] government spokesman said the state provides "moral support" for vigilante activities. "What can a state with a weak police force do other than help the people to defend themselves?" the official said.
