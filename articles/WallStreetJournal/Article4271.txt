 Futures Markets: Dollar's Drop Lifts Prices of Currencies And Precious Metals but Weakens Bonds   By By Scott McMurray and Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1987  Aggravating fears of resurging inflation and interest rates, the dollar's plunge sent foreign currency, precious metals and other commodities futures prices sharply higher but pounded bond and stock-index futures.  The rally to a high by Japanese yen futures and the strength of the other foreign currency futures was "like a slap in the face of the G-7 and the Fed," said Craig Sloane, a futures analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York. He referred to Wednesday's statement by the finance representatives of the seven leading industrial nations meeting in Washington, who reaffirmed their commitment made earlier this year to stabilize currency rates.  Gold for April delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York surged $12.60 an ounce to a six-month high of $432.80. The estimated volume was a heavy 80,000 contracts. May silver on the Comex soared 22.5 cents an ounce to $6.86 -- its highest level since Dec. 7, 1984, when prices stood at $6.888. An estimated 40,000 silver contracts were traded yesterday. Platinum prices also jumped; the April contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $20.30 an ounce to $579.80.
