 New Head of BBC Seeks to Overhaul Role of Governors   By Goldsmith, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2004  Michael Grade, a colorful broadcasting veteran, was named Friday to be chairman of the BBC, effective May 17, following the resignations this year of both its chairman and director general. They quit after a judicial report fiercely criticized the BBC's journalism in a report about intelligence leading to the war in Iraq; the report also condemned the broadcaster's board of governors for failing to exercise proper oversight.  Mr. Grade's appointment was widely welcomed by the BBC's 27,500 staff members, who have been wounded by the upheaval that followed the judicial report. Hundreds of staffers applauded him as he was introduced, and he said he would defend the BBC's editorial independence and put the past months' controversy to rest.
