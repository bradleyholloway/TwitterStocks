 Heard on the street: Foreign buyers are unwelcome at the station as giant Japanese railway offering rolls in   By Hardy, Quentin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1993  The Japanese are reportedly handling the upcoming issue of East Japan Railway, known as JR East, so that global investors, such as US mutual funds, are finding it very difficult to get in on the fund. The prospectus is written in Japanese and Japanese law bars all brokers from recommending how much to bid for a stock in advance of the auction. Complaints against Japanese handling of the offering are noted.
