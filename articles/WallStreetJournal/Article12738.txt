 Bailout Assured, Airlines Jockey for Funds --- Fate of Carriers May Rest With Greenspan's Panel   By By John D. McKinnon and Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2001  The administration has steered a wavering course between the industry's strong players, which can survive without long-term government help, and its weak ones, where survival was in doubt before the attacks. The rules it recently issued on dispensing $10 billion in loan guarantees have left great discretion to the panel that Mr. [Alan Greenspan], who opposed many of the bailout's provisions, will head. In the end, that panel may have to decide which airline companies survive, and which don't.  On Sept. 24, Mr. Greenspan quietly convened a meeting of about a dozen officials from the Fed and other agencies in the Fed's ornate boardroom. Officials argued over just how tough to be with the airlines, but agreed on one main point: the application process would be taken seriously, and no airline was assured help. In talks with industry representatives during the next few days, Mr. [Peter Fisher] repeatedly reminded the companies that the new law said airlines "may" get federal credit, and pointedly didn't use the word "shall."  Sen. [Jon Kyl] arranged for Mr. [W. Douglas Parker] to meet with Mr. [Mitchell Daniels Jr.]; Karl Rove, Mr. [Bush]'s top political adviser; and Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. In the hour-long session, "we talked about our views on how the loan-guarantee criteria should be developed," Mr. Parker says. "We were making the argument that requiring substantial amounts of collateral would have a very damaging impact on low-cost airlines and the economy in general."
