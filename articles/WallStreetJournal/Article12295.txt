 Film: Noir is Beautiful   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1998  Strictly speaking, Joel and Ethan Coen's "The Big Lebowski" is an absurdist neo-noir film about mistaken identity. But there's no reason to be strict about this big sweet teddy bear of a comedy, and no mistaking the identity of the actor who makes the whole thing so consistently likable: Jeff Bridges, in what might reasonably be mistaken for the title role.  He plays Jeff Lebowski, an amiable stoner who calls himself The Dude. This Lebowski lives, marginally, near the sandy edge of the American continent in Venice, Calif. His only valid I.D. is a supermarket discount card. Except for bowling with his whacked-out buddies, he has benched himself from the game of life. In short, he's the picture of contentment -- until his bungalow is torn apart by thugs who want to squeeze him for his wife's debts. They think he's Jeffrey Lebowski, the Big Lebowski of the title, an aging Pasadena millionaire (David Huddleston) in whose muddled existence and tortured loves The Dude is soon enmeshed.  With blithe good cheer, Mr. Bridges solves problems that have afflicted every Coen comedy -- including, for my part, "Fargo" -- since the endearingly clever "Raising Arizona." The Coens -- Joel directs, Ethan produces, both wrote this original script -- are control freaks; Mr. Bridges is the loosest of contemporary stars. The Coens can outshine McDonald's when it comes to archness; Mr. Bridges works so simply that he sometimes doesn't seem to be acting at all. And the Coens, whether by design or default, are chilly artists, while Jeff Bridges radiates warmth from some unquenchable -- though eminently bankable -- inner hearth.
