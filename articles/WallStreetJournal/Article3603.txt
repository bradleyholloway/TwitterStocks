 EDS Stock Plummets by 53% In Wake of a Profit Warning   By By Elliot Spagat, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  EDS has already taken a major hit from WorldCom Inc., which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and is one of its largest customers and suppliers. In 1999, EDS agreed to manage WorldCom computers for $6.4 billion over 11 years and pay WorldCom $6 billion during the same period to operate its telecom network and those of its customers.  "There are a number of issues here that belong to us," including higher-than-expected costs in Europe, says Dick Brown, EDS's chief executive. He declined to name the problem European accounts, but Stephen McClellan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, suggested EDS inherited them after last year's acquisition of Systematics AG, a German services firm.  P&G, of Cincinnati, was expected to sell its back-office operations to EDS and award a long-term contract valued at about $8 billion to manage the consumer-products company's human resources, finance, accounting and other functions. But P&G canceled a conference call with analysts and investors at the last minute, and said it was "undertaking additional discussions, which will take a number of days to complete." EDS, meanwhile, confirmed it was negotiating with P&G, after it withdrew its bid in July.
