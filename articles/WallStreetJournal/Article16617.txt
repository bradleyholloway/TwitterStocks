 Love & Money: Equal Gifts for Kids? Most Readers Say No   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2006  Beverly Flading, in Tucson, Ariz., says she comes from a family of three girls, all very close in age, "and I can assure you we all checked that one was not getting more than the other." Siblings, she says, "equate value of gifts with how much their parents love them, or which one is their favorite." Gifts, she says, are often the yardstick of love because "the competition among siblings for the love of their parents is very strong . . . even if that competition was all in our heads."  Today, Ms. [Kim Lenaway] says, "Mom is still doing it. She makes a point of telling us what things cost so we can add it up and see the equality." Ms. Lenaway says that [Amy], "as did my mother, is teaching that gift-giving is an obligation." Instead, she says, "gift-giving comes from the heart and should reflect the desires and age of the recipient, as well as the tastes of the giver. Some of my favorite gifts over the years have been little trinkets which were not very expensive, but were given from the heart, and which meant something to me personally. Do not lead [children] to believe they deserve 'the same' as everyone else."  Equally important, says Mary Hall, of Missoula, Mont., is recognizing the difference between "equality" and "fairness." She's mom to three sons and two stepdaughters, and is involved in the special-education system, where "there is a saying: 'Fair is not equal. Fair is that everyone gets what he needs.' "
