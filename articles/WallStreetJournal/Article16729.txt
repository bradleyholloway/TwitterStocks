 Channel Change -- Television's Power Shift: Cable Pays for 'Free' Shows; Broadcasters Want Cash To Carry Their Signal; Super Bowl Is Hostage   By Peter Grant and Brooks Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2007  [Barry Faber, Sinclair] is pushing even the biggest cable players, with the next showdown possible later this month: If it doesn't win cash from Comcast Corp., the country's biggest cable provider with more than 23 million subscribers, by the end of February, Sinclair says it may shut down signals in about 30 markets. So far Comcast isn't budging: "We don't pay for free TV," says David Cohen, a Comcast executive vice president. In January, Sinclair settled with Time Warner Cable, the No. 2 operator, for what it called "a mutually acceptable economic agreement" to carry the signals of 35 of its stations. People familiar with the deal say there was payment but not on the per-subscriber basis Sinclair sought. A Time Warner Cable spokesman declined to comment.  Last July, Mr. [Rocco Commisso], a former Bronx disco owner, called for a meeting with Sinclair Chief Executive David Smith, son of the broadcast company's founder, to resolve their differences "CEO to CEO." People at the meeting said Mr. Commisso warned Mr. Smith he wasn't easily intimidated, saying that in the rough neighborhood where he grew up, "I've had people hold a gun to my head and I've told them to pull the trigger." Mr. Smith wasn't intimidated either: He laughed out loud, say some people familiar with the meeting.  Sinclair's Mr. Faber wouldn't give details but said, "We're very happy and we didn't cave." Mediacom also agreed to dismiss all FCC and legal matters and to pay for Sinclair's legal fees from the dispute.
