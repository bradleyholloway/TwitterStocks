 Home Shopping's Talks on Merger With COMB Stall   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1987  CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Home Shopping Network Inc. and C.O.M.B. Co. said their merger negotiations reached an "impasse."  In composite American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Home Shopping shares closed at $38.625, down 62.5 cents. In national over-the-counter trading, C.O.M.B. shares closed at $25.25, down $4.75.  The disclosure last month by the two companies that they were discussing a combination created excitement both on Wall Street, where Home Shopping has been the past year's glamour stock, and in the rapidly growing television home-shopping industry. As previously reported, Home Shopping said it had held "preliminary discussions" to acquire C.O.M.B., a Plymouth, Minn.-based merchandiser that owns a 50% stake in Cable Value Network, Home Shopping's biggest competitor.
