 Europe Hangs Tough; Despite Negatives, Stocks Continue to Climb   By Falconer, Tim, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  "We believe market valuations are at low levels, comparative to history, so are already factoring a certain degree of slowing earnings growth," said Peter Jarvis, fund manager at F&C Asset Management in London. "There are also sectors that are still seeing upgrades, such as insurance and telecoms. Balance sheets and cash flows remain strong, which will lend further support."  Mike Lenhoff, chief market strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities in London, concurs. "Fundamentals aren't great, but they're not really that bad," he said.  "Mergers and acquisitions are likely to continue to be an important driver for markets, given companies' need to invest, and because of undergeared corporate balance sheets and reasonable corporate confidence," said Nick Nelson, a stock strategist at UBS in London. Still, he is cool on the financial sector, where a large portion of blame for lowered consensus earnings estimates can be laid. Banks make up about 19% of the Stoxx 600's market capitalization. Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group, UBS and Societe Generale all recently made hefty write-downs attached to their U.S. subprime exposures.
