 California Authority Cites Insurers on Rule For `Good Drivers'   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1990  California's Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie cited six insurance companies operating in California for their alleged failure to issue "good driver" discount policies as required under the state's Proposition 103.  Leading the list of cited companies is Allstate Insurance Co. of Northbrook, Ill., a Sears, Roebuck & Co. subsidiary. Allstate was cited for allegedly refusing to issue policies to good drivers who don't currently have insurance, haven't been employed or resided in the same location for two years. An Allstate spokesman said the insurer hadn't yet seen any documents outlining the state's allegations, but added that the company is confident it is "in complete compliance with the current state of enforcement of Proposition 103."
