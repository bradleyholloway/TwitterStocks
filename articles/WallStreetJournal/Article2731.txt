 Shell Bows to German Greens' Muscle --- Reversal of Plan to Sink Rig Shows Growing Clout Of Environmentalists   By By Cacilie Rohwedder and Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1995  Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, has learned never to underestimate the importance of environmental issues in Germany, Europe's biggest economy. It was a costly lesson.  Faced with furious protest from a large section of German society, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl and motorists who mounted an instant boycott of its gas stations, Shell last night abandoned its plans to sink the junked Brent Spar oil platform in the North Sea.  But above all, Shell's change of heart highlights a trend the company had sorely misread. In Germany, where sorting trash has become a national pastime, environmental issues have moved from the fringes of society very much into the mainstream. Environmental consciousness now cuts across the political and social spectrum and is having a profound influence on industry as well as politics. As Shell found, those who ignore this movement do so at their peril.
