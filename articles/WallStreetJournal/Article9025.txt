 Buying the Goods --- Buying Power: According to John Hagel, the Web is turning business on its head   By By David Bank, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1998  Last year, Mr. (John) Hagel created a buzz around the commercial potential of online "communities" with "Net Gain," his first book on electronic commerce. "Net Worth," his soon-to-be-published second book on the subject (written with Marc Singer), is more likely to provoke shudders.  Mr. Hagel, 48 years old, started and sold his own computer-systems company and then helped engineer the sale of Atari before joining McKinsey in 1984. He sat down with Wall Street Journal reporter David Bank at McKinsey's San Francisco office to discuss the trends that he says are changing some of most basic notions we have about ways of doing business.  Mr. Hagel: The key is the ability to capture information about customers and to use that information for commercial purposes. That becomes the key economic asset. Whoever owns that asset will be substantially advantaged in this electronic-commerce world. Our advice to clients is: Be very clear about what information is most useful to your business. Who's in the best position to capture it? There are many new kinds of intermediaries that may capture it before you do.
