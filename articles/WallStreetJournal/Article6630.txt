 Looking for Stocks to Celebrate in 2007   By Hadi, Mohammed, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2006  Still, this doesn't mean the U.S. economy doesn't matter. Benjamin Pace, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, is also "overweight" materials stocks. But that is partly because he believes the U.S. economy isn't heading into a recession.  "It's a transition that we are going through," explains David Reilly, director of portfolio strategy at Rydex Investments. "We've viewed cyclicality...on a domestic-only basis, and now we are considering economic growth outside of the U.S. as well."  "There will be task forces and hearings, and there's no reason to think the Democrats will not follow through with that desire [for a greater government role]. And that could have some negative implications for healthcare stocks," Mr. Reilly of Rydex says. He's gone from being "relatively bullish" on the drug sector to cautious about it since the midterm elections last month.
