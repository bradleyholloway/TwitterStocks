 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 1999 --- Capital Markets: The Year Of Living Cautiously --- Fears of Y2K, Rising Rates Made Raising Money Difficult and Costly   By By Paul M. Sherer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  Capital markets were dominated by fear in 1999: fear of rising default rates, fear of the year-2000 computer bug and fear of rising interest rates. These fears brought back painful memories of the credit crunch of 1998 and made it harder and costlier for many companies to raise money.  Throughout 1999, investors were cautious about the types of deals they would buy. Since the third quarter of 1998 -- when the junk-bond market shut down to new issues, the loan market was squeezed and trading in many securities halted after the global financial crisis reached U.S. shores -- buyers of corporate bonds and loans have become far more conscious of market liquidity. They wanted only what could be sold again quickly if necessary.  Companies launching smaller deals found it more difficult to raise money than they had for several years. Junk-bond issues smaller than $100 million have paid an average 0.54 of a percentage point more yield than issues larger than $300 million since 1994, says Steven Ruggiero, head of high-yield securities research at Chase Securities Inc. But the spread has soared since the fall 1998 credit crunch, to 2.5 percentage points as of mid-December 1999.
