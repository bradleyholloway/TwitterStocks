 Computer Users Fear Cost Leap On Phone Links   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1987  Mr. Campbell, an energy researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., spends about $60 a month calling up computer networks to find other hobbyists. "It's like a singles bar on Friday and Saturday nights," he says. "When a lady signs on, guys descend on her like a pack of vultures."  This possibility has mobilized computer hobbyists and industry officials to lobby the agency. "We're dead set against it," says Clark Woodford, an executive vice president at H&R Block Inc.'s CompuServe Inc. unit, which provides telecommunications services to computer users. (Dow Jones News/Retrieval, operated by Dow Jones & Co. -- the publisher of this newspaper -- is opposing the Bell proposal.)  Computer chatterboxes often don't pay long-distance rates to call out-of-state. Instead, they use such companies as US Sprint Communications Co.'s Telenet subsidiary and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Tymnet subsidiary, which charge cut-rate prices. These companies rent private telephone lines and spread the costs among thousands of computer users.
