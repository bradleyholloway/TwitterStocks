 Cheap Divorces May Cost More Than Advertised   By By Walt Bogdanich, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1986  Casual readers of New York City newspaper advertisements might conclude that the best bargain in town is a divorce. "Divorce, Annulment . . . $90," one recent ad proclaims. Another promises: "Uncontested divorce $88."  But spouses who see these ads as a cheap way to uncouple their lives may be disappointed, says the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. In a recent study involving 22 New York law firms advertising divorce services, the BBB took issue with all 22 -- on grounds including hidden costs and undisclosed limitations on offers.  The BBB says that some of the ads violate that organization's advertising standards and may run counter to New York City consumer-protection regulations. Moreover, some of them may violate lawyers' professional rules of conduct.
