 Big Five Firm Will Alter Name To Andersen   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  Of course, tinkering with such a widely known brand name is a somewhat risky move. In their e-mail, Messrs. [Joseph F. Berardino] and [Thomas L. Elliott] tried to allay concerns that the firm is distancing itself from its roots, which date to 1913 when the firm started. "We are and will continue to be very proud of the Arthur Andersen name and will be preserving its heritage and foundation of value while building the bigger brand through Andersen," the two wrote. The firm is named for its founder, Arthur Andersen, who at the age of 23 became the youngest certified public accountant in Illinois and soon afterward became the head of Northwestern University's accounting faculty. Mr. Andersen died in 1947, according to the firm's Web site.
