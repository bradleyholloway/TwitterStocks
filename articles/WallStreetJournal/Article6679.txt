 Big-Box Retailers Open in Cozier Quarters   By Hudson, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  The store downsizing by Best Buy, of Richfield, Minn., and Circuit City, of Richmond, Va., is more dramatic. Roughly 65% of Best Buy's U.S. stores measure 45,000 square feet. Yet most of the 90 U.S. stores Best Buy plans to open this year will measure 30,000 square feet or less. Similarly, most of Circuit City's stores cover 34,000 square feet, but the majority of the 160 new stores on its drawing board for this year and next will measure 20,000 square feet.  With more consumers buying entertainment online, Circuit City stocks 30% fewer CDs and DVDs at its smaller stores than in larger ones, primarily by keeping fewer of each title on hand. Meanwhile, televisions require less storage space now that prices are plummeting on flat-panel TVs. Likewise, laptop computers have increasingly displaced larger desktop machines. "Frankly, in most of our categories . . . the devices are getting smaller," Circuit City Chief Executive Officer Phil Schoonover said on an April 4 conference call with investors.  Another strategic concern: Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. are expanding their consumer-electronics selections. That could translate to more poaching of Best Buy and Circuit City customers unless the two wedge additional, smaller stores into big markets. Case in point: Best Buy wants its 45,000-square-foot stores to serve trade areas of 250,000 people. Its smallest format, at 20,000 square feet, serves populations as small as 100,000. "Whereas you used to lose by having too many stores, now you lose by having too few stores," Best Buy's Mr. [Pat Matre] says.
