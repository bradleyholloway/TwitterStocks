 Deals & Deal Makers: RJR Considers a Family Reunion --- Bid for Nabisco Is Chewed Over   By By Nikhil Deogun and Gordon Fairclough, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2000  While a deal may never materialize, such a maneuver may not be as far-fetched as it appears. Yesterday, Martin Feldman, an influential tobacco analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, added to the speculation of a bid from the tobacco company with a five-page research report with a bold headline proclaiming: "An Auction of NGH -- RJR May Be the Ideal Bidder."  The 1980s and 1990s may be long gone, but Nabisco continues to be a magnet for deal makers and raiders. Financier Carl Icahn, who has made three proxy runs on the company in the 1990s, got the ball rolling earlier this year by threatening a partial tender offer for Nabisco Group Holdings. NGH's sole asset is its 80.6% interest in Nabisco Holdings Corp., the powerhouse food company, whose brands include Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies and Life Savers candies.  The stock of NGH, the holding company, has been a huge disappointment to shareholders because of what some investors call the "tobacco taint." This refers to the possibility that, even though the tobacco and food holding companies are separate now, tobacco-liability plaintiffs might try to go after the assets of the holding company should Reynolds ever go bankrupt because of adverse legal judgments.
