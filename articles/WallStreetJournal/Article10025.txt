 Mittal, After Wrangling, Lifts Offer for Arcelor Brasil Stake   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2007  The move comes after Brazilian regulators ordered [Mittal] to buy out minority shareholders of Arcelor Brasil on the same terms as the offer for shares in the Luxembourg-based parent company. Mittal had earlier contested the Brazilian regulator's view that buying Arcelor meant a change of control in the Brazilian unit and would require a separate offer.  Mittal, which owns about 66% of the unit, said it would now offer 11.70 Brazilian reals ($5.76) in cash and 0.3568 class A common share of Arcelor Mittal for each share in Arcelor Brasil. Mittal said the price after adjustment for dividends and interest on cash would represent a total value equivalent to about 18.89 euros ($25.36), or 51.27 reals.
