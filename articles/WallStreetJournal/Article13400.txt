 Easing Investor Remorse   By Burton, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  "If you're always looking at what you uld've had, you'll never end up feeling secure about what you have," says Ross Levin, an Edina, Minn.-based financial adviser. "Now, regret is 'What's the opportunity I missed?' In 2000, regret was, 'Why didn't I get out of the market?' It's a combination of fear and greed."  "Focus on the things that matter and over which you have some control," Prof. [Terrance Odean] says. "Many investors put all their focus into timing the market or picking the right stock," and those are two areas, he adds, where "people tend to get themselves into trouble."  "With a scorecard, people are going to know where they stand," says Mike Chadwick, a financial adviser in Unionville, Conn. "Remorse occurs when people feel like they're behind the eight ball in regard to their goals. They act more aggressively, doing things they normally wouldn't have done had they known they could accomplish their goals by being more conservative."
