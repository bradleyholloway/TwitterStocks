 Technology (A Special Report); Web Watch   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2005  The classification is a little haphazard. Some of the menu items are subject areas, such as "military history" or "American Indian," while others are item types, such as "jewelry" or "home furnishings." This leads to a few conflicts: A silver Navajo shield ring ($75) doesn't show up in the list of "rings" but is classed instead as "American Indian." And some of the headings seem duplicative: Marked-down items like the studious frog are listed either under "Clearance," "Outlet Store" or "Special Values."  The best part of this Web site is the information. Each category offers a "shopping guide" explaining the differences between the various options. For "car bras," for instance, the guide explains how a "full front end"-style covering protects the front of the car from bugs, dirt and dents, whereas a "T-style bra" stretches back to cover more of the hood.
