 L'Oreal CEO Hopes New Products Will Push Double-Digit Growth   By Maxwell, Kenneth, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2003  It's also the effect Mr. [Lindsay Owen-Jones] is looking for on L'Oreal's earnings from a raft of new products set to hit stores between now and year end, as he seeks to steer the company to its 19th straight year of double-digit profit growth before extraordinary items. As well as the Lancome men's range, this fall will see the U.S. launch of Sensi, the fragrance L'Oreal produces for Italian designer Giorgio Armani; and Polo Ralph Lauren's Blue scent will hit European store shelves.  Insurer Allianz AG, which has a 43.6% stake in Beiersdorf, has indicated it wants out, and the Tchibo family, which holds 30.1%, recently voted to streamline its holding company, making it easier for Tchibo to divest its stake. (Institutional investors hold most of the remaining 26.3%.) People familiar with the situation, however, say L'Oreal isn't a likely buyer, citing antitrust concerns and L'Oreal's targeted acquisitions policy, which focuses on small, bolt-on deals. L'Oreal declines to comment on questions about Beiersdorf.  Citing ACNielsen data, however, L'Oreal says that in 2001, the French company's products had a 50.8% share of the U.S. market for women's hair-coloring products, while P&G's had 39.4%. For the first half of 2003, L'Oreal had 54.6%, while P&G had 34.7%.
