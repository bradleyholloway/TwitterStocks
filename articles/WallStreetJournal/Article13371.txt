 Style & Substance: For the Fashion Designers, Agents Are the Hot Trend   By Dodes, Rachel, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2007  "Fashion designers either don't have the business acumen, or they are creative types and they don't really care to focus in on the business side of things," says DMA founder Marc Beckman, who is married to [Alice Roi]. His company, he says, tries "to leverage that star factor they bring to the table."  Four-year-old DMA was the first company created exclusively to occupy this niche, but competitors have started sprouting up. In September, "American Idol" creator Simon Fuller launched a talent agency in London called 19RM. Its aim is "to take fashion into new areas of pop culture," Mr. Fuller told the British press at the time. His first deal was a dress-design collaboration for Gap Inc. with British designer Roland Mouret, who is a 50% owner of 19RM. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Fuller declined to comment about 19RM's plans.  Not all deals have turned out to be long-term successes. A collaboration between New York designer Tara Subkoff, known for her "Imitation of Christ" brand, with Jones's Easy Spirit line lasted several seasons. Her subsequent team-up with Los Angeles denim maker Blue Concept LLC was discontinued after a brief run. Jones's Nine West label didn't extend its recent one-season ventures with designers Vivienne Westwood, Sophia Kokosalaki and Thakoon Panichgul. "This is a constantly moving business," says Stacy Lastrina, executive vice president of marketing at Jones Apparel.
