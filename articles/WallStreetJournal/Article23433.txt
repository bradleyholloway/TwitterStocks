 MarketWatch: It's Time, Not Timing   By Burton, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  "Markets over the long term go up," says Roger Ibbotson, a Yale University finance professor and chairman of hedge-fund manager Zebra Capital Management. "You can get that by just having a diverse portfolio and holding it. You don't have to have timing magic."  "When everything's going up, everyone's time horizon is infinite," says Harold Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. "When everything's going down, it's infinitesimal. We don't invest in stocks if people are going to need the money two or three years from now."  A balanced portfolio, spread across stocks, bonds and cash according to your risk tolerance, makes a strong case for achieving your investment objectives. "Stocks historically have been one of the best- growing assets," Mr. [Mark Riepe] says. "That always has to have a place in your portfolio."
