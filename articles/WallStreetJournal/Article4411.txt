 Empire of America Plans More Changes To Cut Its Expenses   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1988  BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Empire of America Federal Savings Bank said it plans additional changes that will reduce operating expenses by $23 million a year, including a lengthening of the workday and consolidation of some branches.  The new cost-reduction efforts are required to offset the effect of rising interest rates for deposits, said Paul A. Willax, chairman and chief executive officer of the thrift institution, which has assets of $10.3 billion. Empire already has a freeze on hiring and capital expenditures, has curtailed travel expenses, and is phasing out commercial lending, except for loans to companies undergoing leveraged buy-outs, he said.
