 Japan Slaps Heavy Tax Penalties On Three Big Banks for Transfers   By By Marcus W. Brauchli, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1989  Three Japanese banks were slapped with heavy tax penalties for improperly reporting large cash transfers made to shore up overseas subsidiaries after the 1987 stock-market crash.  Japan's National Tax Administration Agency told the banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd. and Mitsui Bank Ltd., to pay tax penalties on wrongly declared profits they transferred to their offshore subsidiaries, mainly in London. The fines were imposed in April but weren't disclosed until this week, when the banks confirmed reports on the penalties that appeared in Japanese newspapers.
