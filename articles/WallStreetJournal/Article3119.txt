 Arterial Vascular Could Be Facing Problems From New U.S. Competitor, Pricing Pressures   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1998  The current U.S. leader in stents is Arterial Vascular Engineering, or AVE, of Santa Rosa, Calif. At last count, in June, it claimed about 45% of the estimated $1.5 billion U.S. stent market. And the stock has been jumping in recent days because the company's top executives have been promoting their products and plans at medical conferences.  But meanwhile, a new competitor is quickly taking U.S. business away from AVE. Boston Scientific, a big rival of AVE in Europe, got federal approval in August to sell its stent in the U.S. Some analysts see it capturing 25% or more of U.S. stent sales by the fourth quarter.  Even AVE executives acknowledge the threat. Says John Miller, chief financial officer, "In coming years, we anticipate three major players" in the U.S. stent market. The other big player is Guidant. It is possible that as soon as year end, Mr. Miller adds, the three majors will each have about 30% of the market.
