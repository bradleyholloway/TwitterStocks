 Back to Bailouts   By By Allan H. Meltzer, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2002  This policy reached a peak in the Clinton years, when Mexico, Russia, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina, and others received massive IMF, Treasury, and multilateral loans to bail out banks and pay off foreign lenders. Often, the foreign banks renewed their loans, on more profitable terms, after the IMF put in new money.  Uruguay was the exception. Its banks were full of deposits owned by prudent Argentines who had put their money abroad. Tourism is more than 15% of Uruguay's GDP, and many of the tourists are from Argentina. Argentina's decision to limit withdrawals from its banks limited spending, including spending on vacations in Uruguay. Many Argentines who had funds abroad withdrew them. Large withdrawals began to look like a run on Uruguay's banks, so that some were soon illiquid. A floating currency made peso withdrawals more costly but could not prevent the loss of dollar deposits. Slower growth in Brazil, Uruguay's large neighbor, added to Uruguay's economic problem.  This bailout ignores two crucial points. First, economics teaches that money can solve monetary problems, not real problems. The IMF is in the "money" business. Populist and nationalist policies are real shocks. The IMF should stay away because money cannot solve Brazil's political problem. Second, Brazil's total debt service prior to its October election is a fraction of its available reserves. There is no risk of default before the election. If the government candidate wins and maintains responsible policies, the money will return after the election.
