 Barron's Insight/By Tiernan Ray   The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  Motorola is having a tougher time selling phones like the Razr of late, dimming Brightpoint's prospects. But Brightpoint's profit can improve sharply this year with improvements at Motorola, and with Brightpoint's rising market share in many parts of the world.  For one thing, Brightpoint may get a larger slice of Motorola's business. Part of Motorola's problem is that resellers around the world buy phones from it in one market and sell them at a hefty profit in another, eroding Motorola's pricing power. Motorola may try and stem that arbitrage by giving more phones to Brightpoint, say analysts.
