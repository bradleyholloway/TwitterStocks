 Why Investors Should Consider Real Estate; Though Many Flee, Strength In Some Segments Makes Case For REITs and Other Vehicles   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  Apartment REITs also offer some potential, as former homeowners slip back into the rental market in the wake of the subprime debacle and the exploding number of foreclosures. The increasing legion of renters is pushing demand higher, allowing apartment companies to raise rents. That is a good combination for leading apartment REITs such as Home Properties Inc. in Rochester, N.Y., and Denver's Archstone-Smith, says Mr. [Bob Gadsden].  Unlike REITs that trade on Wall Street, private REITs are generally available only through financial planners, advisers and brokers. These REITs typically maintain a constant share price -- often $10 a share. And they generate income through their yield, often in the 5% to 7% range, and provide capital gains only when the portfolios are liquidated, sold to other real-estate companies or go public.  The benefit: income as well as price stability. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 400 points in February, "the value of my clients' REITs didn't move," Mr. [Dean Harman] says.
