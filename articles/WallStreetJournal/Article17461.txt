 TV Networks May Be More Vulnerable To Takeover Attempts Than in the Past   By By Bill Abrams and Jeanne Saddler, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1985  "It would be difficult, but I'm not saying it's impossible," Dean Burch, a Washington communications lawyer and former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, says. "I don't think the FCC has any interest in standing in the way of takeovers, friendly or unfriendly."  Last week, Atlanta broadcaster Ted Turner also popped up as a potential bidder for a network after one of his Washington attorneys, Charles A. Ferris, a former FCC chairman, met with FCC members to discuss the mechanics of acquiring a broadcasting concern.  Central to the success of any unfriendly offer would be approval by the FCC. All radio and TV stations operate under FCC licenses and, while the networks themselves aren't licensed, each owns five television stations and several radio stations.
