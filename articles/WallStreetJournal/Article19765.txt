 A Robert Still Rules 'Robert's Rules'   By Kaufman, Joanne, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2004  Since the manual's publication in 1876, it has gone through nine more versions -- the most recent, "Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised 10th Edition" came out in 2000 -- has sold some five million copies, and has demystified "incidental main motions"; "principles governing the debatability of motions" and of course "preference in recognition when no question is pending." Assemble, amend, announce, appeal, approve, accept, adopt, adjourn -- they're all here, the fine print and fine points of parliamentary law as derived from the rules for conducting business in the British House of Commons.  "Right after I was taught to read," he recalls, "my father held up a copy of the book and said 'your grandfather's book.' It was the way he spoke of him as 'your grandfather.' At four or five years old, a boy naturally looks up to his father as something superhuman compared to himself. So it seemed to me that my father's father had to be that much bigger and greater than my father was bigger and greater than me.  Since both books clearly state that three or four people in a meeting don't need any rules, the authors can disregard parliamentary law with impunity when they convene. "With a small group of reasonably intelligent people you don't need the 'Rules' to keep people in bounds," explains Mr. [William J. Evans], 75. "We have a chairman and that's me. Sometimes there's a debate across the table, but I do as little as possible. When a parliamentarian gets enthusiastic, it's hard to get him to stop."
