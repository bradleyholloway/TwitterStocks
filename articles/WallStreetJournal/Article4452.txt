 Television: McTV: No Whopper   By By Robert Goldberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1988  But "USA Today: The Television Show" (nightly on syndicated stations; check local listings) is going down the tubes fast. Critics are savaging it, audiences are avoiding it, and syndicators have begun searching for replacements in record time. Executive Producer Steve Friedman and the ever-successful Grant Tinker, president of GTG, are frantically trying to retool the show, but after a month on the air the basic problem remains: "USA Today," touted as the latest word in info-tainment, doesn't work as news or as entertainment. Here's why:  BIZARRE LITTLE FACTS. In both its original and its remodeled form, "USA Today" seems to thrive on arcane trivia and useless information. One example: "Seattle is the country's recycling leader." Most of these facts are presented without lead-in or explanation, just one sentence and no context. Of course, the bigger stories get several sentences: "Mark Oct. 22nd on your calendar. That's that day the cast of 'Gilligan's Island' reunites at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, Calif. All of the castaways, including Bob Denver, Jim Backus and Tina Louise, will be pitching in to raise money for the school's telecommunications department."  GRATING OPTIMISM. Inspired by the "journalism of hope" of "USA Today: The Newspaper," "USA Today: The Television Show" is more unflaggingly cheerful, more unremittingly upbeat than "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood." One lead item last week began, "A spectacular touch-down as Discovery returns and millions cheer across the USA today."
