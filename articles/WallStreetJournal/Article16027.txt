 Most Asian Markets Stumble Over Shadows Cast By U.S. Slowdown, Downed Plane and the Yen   By By Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2001  "All three legs of the stool look shaky now," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank. "In many ways, the Asian economies are even worse off than the economy in the U.S."  Indeed, the U.S. remains the No. 1 or No. 2 export market for several Asian countries. South Korea, for instance, sends about 20% of total exports to the U.S., says Mr. Sohn. For Taiwan, that number is 30%, and in Malaysia, as much as 80% of electronics exports head to the U.S.  Hong Kong, meanwhile, fell to a fresh 22-month low yesterday and is off 20% for the year. Traders attributed yesterday's 520.51-point decline in large part to concern about tensions between the U.S. and China over the downed U.S. aircraft, but the market had been underperforming several months before this latest conflict.
