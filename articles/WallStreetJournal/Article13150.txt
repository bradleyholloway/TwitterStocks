 Taking a Cautious Approach To the 'Upfront' Buying Season   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  Mr. [Joseph V. Tripodi]: Marketing has evolved. In the '50s and '60s, marketing was sales and promotions; in the '70s and '80s, it was about image; over the last decade we've been moving to a more interactive approach. There are many things driving these changes, such as fragmentation of consumers, more media choices, technology and marketing accountability.  The automobile and airline industries are stuck in the '60s and '70s model because they have built a platform around price and they have devalued their brands. It's now a price game, and that is not a sustainable business or marketing platform. Cheap is not a strategy unless you are Dell computer.  Mr. Tripodi: If two main competitors are talking about price aggressively, they are creating the impression in the consumers mind that your brand is expensive, even if it isn't. I go back to the Pepsi and Coke challenge. The fact that Pepsi said that consumers found Pepsi tasted better than Coke -- it painted Coke with the brush that it didn't taste good, even though that wasn't true.
