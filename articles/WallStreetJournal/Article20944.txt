 Cocoa Price-Stabilization Talks Collapse As Ivory Coast Refuses to Join New Pact   By By Frances Williams and John Valentine, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1986  An attempt by cocoa-producing and consuming nations to reach a new price-stabilization agreement collapsed abruptly after Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, said it wouldn't join.  The breakdown of the cocoa agreement, the fourth international commodity group to fall apart in the past two years, promises to hold cocoa prices down in coming months. The developments in Geneva helped push cocoa futures $25 a metric ton lower Friday, to $2,000 a ton for March delivery on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York, down about 7% from the depressed levels of a month ago.  Cocoa-consuming nations decided late Friday to withdraw from the negotiations, mostly because of the surprise pullout by Ivory Coast, producer of nearly 30% of the world's cocoa. The current agreement had been crippled by the refusal of Ivory Coast and the U.S., the world's largest consuming nation, to join. Ivory Coast, however, was active in the latest negotiations.
