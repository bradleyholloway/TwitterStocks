 Workday Etiquette: Know the Right Fork And Watch That E-Mail   By By Hal Lancaster, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1998  While the victim was gracious, the mortified perpetrator of this long-ago faux pas was now clearly on the defensive, and didn't get as much out of the meeting as he had hoped. Still, the damage wasn't long-lasting; the lemon squeezer's career has lasted long enough to write this column. But I never again squeezed a lemon without cupping my hands over the glass.  Gaffes like that don't usually unhinge a career unless they're chronic, but they don't help it, either. Joanne Mahanes, career development coordinator at the University of Virginia's College of Arts and Sciences, tells of a student who lost out on a job offer because he salted his food before tasting it at a lunch interview. The recruiter took this as a sign of hasty decision-making, says Ms. Mahanes, who also offers table-manners training to students and corporate employees.  E-mail: Because it's so easy to type and send, e-mail is ripe for breaches of etiquette, says sociologist Jan Yager, a Stamford, Conn., expert on business etiquette. As e-mail increasingly dominates business correspondence, she says, "the rules of formal writing just aren't being observed." Gender-neutral first names and fuzzy new job titles that don't necessarily convey status create awkwardness. Before clicking that send button, she recommends researching the mail recipient and carefully editing messages. Excessive familiarity and informality are two pitfalls to guard against.
