 When Picking Stocks Is Child's Play   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2004  Likewise, Mattel is finding demand for its ESPN Game Station, which lets kids play six different sports, but that's unlikely to send the stock out of the ballpark. Mattel shares are up to $19 from $16 since September, and the company's board last month approved a 13% increase in the company's annual dividend rate, a very healthy sign. Mattel has its hands full trying to turn around its Barbie line of dolls, which saw sales drop 26% in the third quarter, but sales of Mattel's more- expensive American Girl brands were up 9%.  Meanwhile, Hasbro's Color Video Now video machine, a portable movie player, is expected to do very well. Hasbro shares have climbed to $19 from $17 but they're still down about 9% in the past year, and are not expensive compared with Hasbro's earnings.  What about presents for grown-ups? Items hot this year include digital cameras, liquid-crystal and high-definition television sets and Apple Computer's iPod music players. That's why some investors like shares of Best Buy, the consumer-electronics giant. But popular products don't always make for popular shares. Best Buy's stock has fallen to around $56.50 from over $62 since mid-November because Wall Street had expected even more from Best Buy than the chain has been delivering so far in the shopping season, and sales of CDs and DVDs have slowed.
