 Southern Europe Takes Biggest Hit On Stronger Euro; Competition With China Over Low-Tech Exports Hurts Spain, Italy, Greece   By Marcus Walker and Carlta Vitzthum, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2004  The euro's steady strengthening during the past four years has made exports from the south more costly and less competitive. Italy's share of global exports has declined 13% since 2000. Spain has developed a trade deficit that economists say will cut its economic growth this year by more than one percentage point.  An increasing number of Spain's producers of toys, clothes and shoes are moving production outside the country, because of a combination of inflation and exchange-rate pressure. Hasbro Inc., of Pawtucket, R.I., closed its factory in Spain this year because of soaring production costs. Famosa SA, one of Spain's largest toymakers, now produces 70% of its goods in China. Besides the problems of the strong euro, wages in Spain are tied to inflation, which has been accelerating. Spanish toy exports fell 13% last year, and the industry association expects a similar decline this year.  Tecnica SpA, a sports-footwear company in Treviso, Italy, near Venice, has so far made all of its ski boots in Italy. Beginning next year, 20% of its output will come from China. "It's the start of a passage from euro-area to dollar-area production," says Alberto Zanappa, Tecnica's chief executive. "Our strategy is based on the expectation of a persistently weak dollar," he says. "We're preparing ourselves so that if the euro goes to $1.40 or $1.50, we can carry on selling shoes."
