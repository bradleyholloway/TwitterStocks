 Thrifts' Net Withdrawals in May Shrank To 'Slight' Outflow, Bank Board Says   By By Paul Duke Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1989  Net withdrawals at savings and loans, which hit a record $10.8 billion in January and exceeded $5 billion a month through April, shrank to a "slight" outflow in May, said Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Danny Wall.  If interest credited to accounts is included, Mr. Wall said, total deposits in federally insured thrifts increased $600 million in May, the first increase since a December rise of $259 million. If interest isn't counted, however, new deposits at savings and loans haven't exceeded withdrawals since April 1988, when net deposits were $1.2 billion. The deposit figure without interest gives some indication of whether customers are bringing more funds to thrifts or simply allowing interest to add up.  Mr. Wall, speaking at a news conference, wouldn't specify the outflow in May, saying that detailed figures will be released today. But a look at the amount of interest typically credited in recent months suggests the outflow was about $2 billion or slightly more.
