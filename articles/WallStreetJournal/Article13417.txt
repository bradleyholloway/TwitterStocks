 Texas Sues Mannatech Over Claims   By Sataline, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2007  In a lawsuit filed in state district court in Travis County, Attorney General Greg Abbott accused Mannatech of violating state and federal health and safety laws and deceptive trade practices. The company, the suit states, knew its free-lance sales force used illegal marketing tactics, "all the while enabling the system under which the claims are made."  Mannatech said it hadn't received a copy of the complaint, but that it "always advises consumers that the company's products do not treat or cure disease and should be used to supplement a proper diet and to complement standard of care therapy."
