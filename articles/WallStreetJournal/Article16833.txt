 The $2 Billion China Bet; New Local Pools Elbow Private-Equity Kings; Fang Pulls In Temasek   By Leow, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  As one of the world's largest sovereign-wealth funds, Temasek's total investment portfolio exceeds $100 billion. Singapore represented 38% of Temasek's portfolio at the end of March. That compares with 49% in March 2005, according to a financial review of operations posted on the investment company's Web site.  Backing Mr. [Fang Fenglei], one of the best-known deal makers in China, represents Temasek's latest effort. Mr. Fang retains his title as chairman of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co., a person familiar with the matter said, but will take a smaller role in daily management. A Goldman spokeswoman, speaking on Mr. Fang's behalf, declined to comment.  Mr. Fang's new businesses won't compete with Goldman's securities joint venture for underwriting deals, which have been its focus.
