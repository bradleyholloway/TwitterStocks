 1998 Year-End Review of Markets: As Art Lovers Duke It Out, Prices Hit Records   By By Eileen Kinsela, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1999  But the string of record prices that resulted masked some storm clouds on the horizon for the art business: Demand for the market's flagship, most-profitable sectors -- Impressionist art, jewelry and Asian art -- began to soften in 1998 and may not fully recover in the coming year.  The highlight of the year was Christie's sale of an 1889 self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh, which was the third most expensive painting ever sold at auction. The painting soared to $71.5 million, far past its presale estimate of $20 million to $25 million. The auction house also set other artist records, including one for 1980s art star Jean Michel Basquiat, whose graffiti-style "Self Portrait" ascended to $3.3 million as an astonished audience looked on.  Another notable Christie's sale was the firm itself -- to French businessman Francois Pinault in June for $1.2 billion. His purchase, which took the company private, sparked some controversy within England, where the auction house has been something of a venerable British institution since its founding in 1766. Also controversial at Christie's was the firm's move early in 1998 to split sales of 19th-century and 20th-century art into three groups of auctions held days or weeks apart. The move created considerable confusion among collectors and dealers used to a tidy two-week sales schedule twice a year.
