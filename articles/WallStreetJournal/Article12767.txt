 Charge Hits 4th-Quarter Results at Equity Office   By By Dean Starkman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  Equity Office said funds from operations, a commonly used measure of REIT earnings, fell to 55 cents a share from 75 cents a share a year earlier. The results include a charge of $124.1 million, or 27 cents a share, to write off a drop in value of some of its investments, mostly in HQ Global Workplaces, a provider of furnished offices that's majority-owned by Frontline Capital Group Inc., New York. Excluding the charge, Equity Office met analysts' expectations of 82 cents a share, according to a Thomson Financial/First Call survey.  Stuart Seeley, an analyst with UBS Warburg, said Equity Office "won ugly" in that it met earnings expectations only thanks to one-time lease termination fees of $24 million. But he was encouraged by the portfolio's outperforming of the national average. Equity Office shares fell 70 cents to $28.04 in New York Stock Exchange 4 p.m. composite trading.
