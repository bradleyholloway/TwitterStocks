 Russia's Oil Tumult Creates Problems for Beijing   By Hutzler, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2004  CNPC executives wouldn't comment on why Yukos suspended deliveries to the company and not its rival, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec. But a CNPC executive said the company is trying to get the shipments restarted and suggested Yukos was using the suspension in hopes of getting CNPC to lobby the Chinese government to offer assistance to the Russian company. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is scheduled to visit Moscow this week, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is to visit Beijing next month, with energy cooperation on the agenda for both visits.  China has looked to Russia to meet the demand. One of the issues Beijing hopes to settle: a decadelong effort to establish an oil pipeline from Siberia to China to replace expensive railway shipments. Russia has balked at the Chinese option amid fears of becoming dependent on Beijing as a customer, and in the face of vigorous Japanese and industry lobbying to route the pipeline to Russia's Far Eastern coast to serve the lucrative Japanese market.
