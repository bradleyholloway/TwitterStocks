 American Board Of Trade Loses Ruling by Court   By By Bill Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1986  American Board of Trade Inc. was defeated again in its efforts to be exempted from securities and commodity regulations.  The investment company, which calls itself an "alternative securities exchange," has waged a continuing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators over its securities and commodity business. Federal agencies have filed a series of suits to curtail the unorthodox investment activities of the firm, which argues that its investments don't fall under government rules.  Friday, the company was rebuffed by an appeals court here, which affirmed that commodity laws apply not only to options on futures contracts, but to options on the underlying commodities themselves. The opinion upholds a decision last year by U.S. District Judge Vincent L. Broderick, who ordered the company to stop dealing in certain commodity transactions and to pay $336,706 in damages and costs to customers and the government.
