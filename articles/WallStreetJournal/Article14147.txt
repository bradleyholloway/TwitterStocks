 The Clown Prince of Late Night Television   By By George V. Higgins, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1985  Mr. Carson, age 59, the monologuing "genius loci" of "Tonight," owns the company that produces both shows in association with NBC. This means that Mr. Letterman works for Mr. Carson. Mr. Letterman, 38, was so charming as one of Mr. Carson's many substitute hosts on "The Tonight Show" in the late 1970s as to prompt speculation that he would soon succeed Mr. Carson if that gentleman did not soon stop being cross with the network. You can see why Mr. Carson, however untidy his marital arrangements, gets full marks for professional neatness in arranging his business affairs.  Mr. Letterman and his cheerful company tape "Late Night" in the late afternoon of the day before in New York. That is roughly the same time at which Mr. Carson and his crew commence taping of fresh programs in Burbank, Calif. What you see after Mr. Carson is Mr. Letterman's nearly simultaneous effort. Mr. Carson generally makes no secret of the delay between performance and broadcast; Mr. Letterman strives to preserve the illusions that his guests are arriving in the middle of the night and his wacky phone calls are getting sleepy people out of bed.
