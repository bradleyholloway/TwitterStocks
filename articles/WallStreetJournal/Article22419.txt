 World Cup 1998: Into The Quarterfinals --- Footing the Price of Power --- Or, Why Is the U.S. so Lousy at Soccer? It's Saving the World for Democracy, That's Why   By By Roger Thurow, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  Now that America's soccer troops have beaten a hasty retreat from the World Cup -- which is the only thing they have beaten, given their inglorious defeats to the Germans, the Iranians and the Serbs on soccer fields all across France -- we need not hold our heads low in shame. Let the rest of the world laugh. When the snickering stops, we will point out what's really important, like. . . .  Consider this: Germany and Italy have won six World Cups between them, but together they couldn't win a single world war. Soccer supremacy, it seems, saps military might. Thus it should be a matter of grave national concern that U.S. soccer officials are deliriously babbling about winning the World Cup by the year 2010. Note to the Pentagon: Make sure that the Star Wars intercontinental missile defense mechanism is up and running by then.  Our being crummy in soccer provides the world with a sort of mutual-destruction pact that, in the end, prevents mutual destruction. Think of it: If all the other countries in the world can get their jollies by beating us at soccer, they will be less inclined to do something really foolish, like challenge us to a nuclear war. It is no mere coincidence that the one country that very nearly did challenge the U.S. to a nuclear war, the old Soviet Union, wasn't very good at soccer, either.
