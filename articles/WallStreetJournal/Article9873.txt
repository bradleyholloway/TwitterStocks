 Proxy Data Could Take Online Train; SEC Proposal Would Make Closed-End Wars Cheaper; Dissident Activists' Boon   By Pruitt, Angela, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2005  "From the dissident's side, it's very helpful. It can be very expensive to do printing and mailing," said Bruce Goldfarb, senior managing director and general counsel for Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., a proxy-solicitation firm. "There are potential savings and costs that may make a proxy fight a little more appealing," he said.  "I'm very cost-conscious. I try to do just one mailing," said veteran closed-end fund activist Phillip Goldstein, adding that printing and mailing costs come to roughly $2 per shareholder. "This could lead to more proxy fights and activism," Mr. Goldstein said of the SEC proposal. He noted, however, that the largest costs are related to the legal fees.  "Most funds do not want to incur the expense of holding a meeting unless it's absolutely necessary," he said. "With the potential cost savings the [SEC] rule may bring, funds may consider having more regular shareholder meetings."
