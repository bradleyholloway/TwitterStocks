 Hot Topic: Battle Brews Over Executive Privilege   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2007  What does Congress want? Congressional investigators want testimony under oath, internal emails and other documents from White House advisers to learn if some of the president's senior advisers discussed firing eight U.S. attorneys last year and, if so, why. The White House has offered private interviews with advisers that wouldn't be under oath and that wouldn't be transcribed or recorded.  What is the White House response? President Bush's rationale for invoking executive privilege matches those of past presidents: Advisers won't offer candid guidance to the president if they fear being forced to testify about those deliberations before Congress. The Bush administration has worked hard to re-establish executive authority that it believes was weakened by several post-Watergate presidents who conceded too much to Congress.  The administration takes comfort from a 2004 Supreme Court ruling that said the White House didn't have to reveal which energy-industry lobbyists met with Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force in 2001. And the administration won a procedural victory on Friday when a federal appeals court said that the American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the president's warrantless-surveillance program.
