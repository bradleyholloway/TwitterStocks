 Big Board Still Carries a Big Stick; NYSE Uses Its Political Weight To Soften Governance Proposals That Would Hurt Floor Trading   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2005  The new trade-through rule would require investor orders to be filled at the best price that can be executed immediately. That would take away best-price protection from slow orders handled manually on the NYSE floor, allowing them instead to be handled by electronic rivals of the Big Board. To avoid losing market share, NYSE chief executive John Thain has proposed a hybrid market under which electronic trading will co-exist with the exchange's traditional method of having traders buy and sell stocks on its storied floor in lower Manhattan.  The SEC initially proposed weakening the NYSE's best-price protection by making it optional in some circumstances, which would have sent trading volume to the NYSE's electronic rivals. The idea was popular with some large investors such as Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund manager, Wall Street firms such as Morgan Stanley, and some members of Congress and state and county officials who wrote to the SEC last spring.  There were more surprises to come. In November, Mr. Thain learned that the SEC was thinking about applying the trade-through rule in a way that could drain significant trading volume from the NYSE floor. Specifically, the idea would allow for electronic matching of orders across markets, not just for each market's best price, but for every order that had been placed on the markets' books. The NYSE feared the idea, known as "depth of book," threatened Mr. Thain's plan to expand electronic trading while maintaining a role for floor traders.
