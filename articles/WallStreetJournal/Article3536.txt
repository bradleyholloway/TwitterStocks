 Will PeopleSoft Lose Momentum After Buyback?   By By Mylene Mangalindan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2002  Momentum carried 110% of the costs for PeopleSoft to produce 25 of 170 modules in its latest software suite, hot-selling PeopleSoft 8. How so? In short, PeopleSoft took a $177 million charge in the first quarter of 1999 to capitalize Momentum. Momentum used the money to hire PeopleSoft software developers, paying PeopleSoft for "development services" as it conducted research on the software maker's behalf. Momentum received royalties from PeopleSoft on sales of the products.  When Momentum was being spun off in early 1999, the SEC looked into the arrangement, according to a person familiar with the situation. The SEC determined that PeopleSoft appropriately followed accounting rules at the time that allowed companies in other industries such as the pharmaceuticals industry to create and spin off companies solely for research-and-development activities. Kevin Parker, PeopleSoft's chief financial officer, says the company had worked closely with the SEC to complete Momentum's spinoff. More than a year later, the rules were changed to discontinue use of such accounting for new research-and-development spinoffs.  Dan Chung, chief investment officer at Fred Alger Management, which sold its PeopleSoft stake last spring on worries about Momentum, is among the money managers with concerns about the company's products and market share. He says PeopleSoft has to continue to move beyond its core human-resources software products to other big software markets. "The next stage for that company is they really need to show they can take market share in those other areas," he says. PeopleSoft is making inroads in these areas, he says, but he is holding off buying the stock until the issues with Momentum are sorted out. "I'd like to see a couple of clean quarters," he says.
