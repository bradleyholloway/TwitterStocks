 Sept. 11 Follow-Up Panel Says FBI Needs to Improve Terror Tracking   By Paltrow, Scot J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2005  Yesterday's review focused on how far the FBI and CIA have gone to overhaul their operations. The panel was headed by former 9/11 commissioner Jamie Gorelick, a top Justice Department official in the Clinton administration. It included former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who recently was chairman of another group that examined the FBI's efforts to improve counterterrorism efforts; John Gannon, a former veteran CIA official who recently served as staff director for the House Select Committee on Homeland Security; and Chitra Ragavan, a reporter who writes about the Justice Department and FBI for U.S. News & World Report magazine. The CIA and FBI came in for criticism during commission hearings last year, for shortcomings that the final report said contributed to the failure to detect and prevent the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
