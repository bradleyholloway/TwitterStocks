 At Home in Indonesia   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  It was good to see Indonesian President B.J. Habibie in the Journal last week talking about the importance of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese to the nation and its economy. Only last month, he was quoted elsewhere saying that if the Indonesian Chinese who fled for their lives during the May riots didn't return, they wouldn't really be missed because others will take their place. How much more reassuring to hear him now, urging Indonesian Chinese to return because "this is their home."  The concept of home is important here. One of the small but poignant images to come out of an otherwise horrific story of persecution and flight during the May riots was a description in a Journal news article of two Indonesian Chinese seen in a Singapore hotel lobby, still clad in batik shirts and smoking clove cigarettes as they waited for news from home. It underscored the fact that despite the barriers, many Chinese are as much Indonesian as anything, or anyone else.
