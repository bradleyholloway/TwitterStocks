 Bush Sets Focus On Health Care For 2006 Agenda   By John D. McKinnon and Sarah Lueck, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2006  The White House has been frustrated that the president isn't getting more credit for an economy marked by steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Talking more about health care is part of its response. "Health care is obviously a big challenge, and . . . creates angst on the part of the American people," Mr. [Bush]'s economic adviser, Allan Hubbard, said in an interview this week. "Employers are spending more money on health care, and that's robbing people of wage increases," he said.  The president is likely to sound similar themes in the State of the Union address later this month. In Louisville, Ky., yesterday, Mr. Bush called health care "an unmanageable cost" for businesses. Rejecting government-directed care as a solution, he said the ideal health system "is one in which there is a direct connect between provider and customer, [and] where there's transparency in the pricing system." In a likely signal of what is to come, the president urged Congress to expand health savings accounts, or HSAs. Created in 2003, HSAs allow Americans to set aside money tax-free to pay health costs if they choose high-deductible health insurance.  A slim new book, "Healthy, Wealthy & Wise," by former Bush advisers R. Glenn Hubbard and John F. Cogan, along with Daniel Kessler of the Hoover Institution, outlines the case for moving in the direction that the Bush administration is heading. It argues that "the unintended consequences of a handful of public policies" -- including tax and health-insurance rules -- "are in large part responsible for the problems of the health-care system" because they hinder "the proper functioning of markets."
