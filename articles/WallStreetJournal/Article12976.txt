As for life insurers, AmerUs Group (NYSE) led decliners, falling 1.94, or 5.1%, to 36.06 after posting third-quarter earnings that missed analysts' target. Fellow insurer Presidential Life slipped 20 cents, or 1.2%, to 16.23.  Demand for stocks picked up in the last hour of trading, however, as investors squared positions ahead of large cap Cisco Systems' quarterly report. As a result, the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks eked out a gain of 0.04 point, or 0.01%, to 538.91, holding on to Tuesday's three-year high.
