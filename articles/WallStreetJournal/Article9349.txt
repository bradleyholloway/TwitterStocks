 Southwest Securities Agrees to Purchase O'Connor, a Municipal-Bond Trader   By By Chad Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  Richard Bove, an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc., said Southwest Securities is emerging from a rocky period where its earnings were under "real stress." The firm has cut expenses and is now healthy enough to seek acquisitions that strengthen its business mix, Mr. Bove said.  Increasing consolidation in the industry will put pressure on Southwest Securities to be acquired in the future, Mr. Bove said. "I think it's got to be sold at some point," he said. "But since there are no buyers at the present time, I don't think a takeover is in the picture in the foreseeable future."
