 Digits   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2002  The sign on the dinosaur's cage read "Warning: DB2-Saurus," referring to IBM's database called DB2. Another truck bearing an accompanying billboard traveled close by to complete the message. The billboard asked "What's the fastest database on IBM's fastest computer? Oracle." Oracle, the top maker of database software, has been fending off rivals IBM and Microsoft Corp.  When most workers at Internet companies leave their employers for greener pastures, they might get a going-away party or a couple of company mouse pads. If you are David Risher, a top Amazon executive, you get a permanent tribute on the Amazon.com site. Amazon recently created a Web page thanking Mr. Risher, who told his employer in November that he would be leaving his position in March as head of world-wide application software, for his contributions to the company. The page is accessible through what is known in techno-parlance as an "Easter egg," a hidden surprise placed in software or Web sites by programmers.  Mr. Risher's Easter egg can be found by clicking on the "See More Stores" icon on the top of Amazon's Web page, scrolling to the bottom of the page and then hovering the cursor in the center of the screen directly beneath the Amazon copyright notice. The cursor will convert to a hand icon when it passes over an invisible link. Mouse click on the link and Mr. Risher's tribute page appears, with a picture of a grinning Mr. Risher and a doctored photograph: his head sits on the body of a Ken Doll in swimming trunks beneath the caption "Amazon.com's favorite site surfer." A message from Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos lauds Mr. Risher's contributions and says the page will reside on the Amazon site "in perpetuity."
