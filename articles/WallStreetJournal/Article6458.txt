 MarketWatch: Ten Ways to Win the Loser's Game   By Farrell, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2005  One of the best sources is Charles Ellis's classic "Winning the Loser's Game: Timeless Strategies for Successful Investing," written in 1975 to help his fellow money managers improve their game. Fund- industry veteran Jack Bogle credits the book as the inspiration for his first index mutual fund at Vanguard Group in 1976. (McGraw-Hill published a fourth edition of the book in 2002.)  1) Don't speculate. One big player says it's time to jump aboard now, calling the market a "muscle car mired in the mud," soon to be "unstuck." Another urges investors to gamble: "For higher returns, you need to get into riskier investments." Don't listen to the hype telling you to take on more risk in this volatile market.  10) Never trust your emotions. The new science of behavioral finance makes it clear that investors are their own worst enemies -- too optimistic against impossible odds. Professional players own the game. They have more information sooner than you do, more capital to play with. And they spend all day playing while you work for a living. You're an amateur. Admit it. Never play the game by "their" rules. Your emotions will trigger too many mistakes. Follow these 10 rules and you'll win the game.
