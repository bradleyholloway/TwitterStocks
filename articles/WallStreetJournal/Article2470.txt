 Democrats Mull Beating Retreat On Stimulus Bill --- Unemployment Benefits May Be Sole Survivor Of Senate Stalemate   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1993  The continued stalemate over President Clinton's economicstimulus bill is pushing Senate Democrats toward abandoning the initiative and retreating to a stripped-down measure that funds only unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.  The defeat would be the most serious yet suffered by Mr. Clinton in Congress, but the Republicans' use of filibuster tactics could raise longer-term problems for that party. With issues like campaign finance reform on the agenda, Democrats will be better positioned to paint the minority as obstructionist. And while both sides have indulged in overheated rhetoric, the partisanship of the Republican tactics has become more apparent as the stalemate has continued.  "The American people have said, `Let's slow down,'" Mr. Dole said in appealing publicly for bipartisan support. But the package was in fact crafted to be unpalatable to many Democrats and so ensure defeat. While demanding offsetting cuts, Mr. Hatfield had been willing to include more than $8.5 billion of the president's package. However, young conservatives privately feared that, by going so far, Democrats might be lured aboard. Thus, the final GOP package included none of the funding for mass transit or rural waste-water grants proposed by Mr. Hatfield, and highway funding was pared to just $1 billion, or about one-third of what the Oregon Republican and the president had proposed.
