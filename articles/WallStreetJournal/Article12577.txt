 CVS to Buy Most Of Bergen Unit For $124 Million   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2000  [Bergen] said it plans to take a thirdquarter charge of $250 million to reclassify [Stadtlander] and a separate medical-supply business as discontinued operations. Bergen last week disclosed an agreement to sell the medical-supply business to Cardinal Health Inc. of Dublin, Ohio, for $181 million. Proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce debt and invest in continuing operations, Bergen said.  Bergen said the loss on the Stadtlander sale would be mitigated by tax benefits and expected proceeds from the sale of the Stadtlander division servicing prison inmates, which isn't part of the CVS purchase. The CVS agreement also includes a provision for ProCare to buy $2.5 billion of drugs from Bergen during the next five years. The commitment roughly doubles the size of an existing drug-supply agreement, Bergen said.end.
