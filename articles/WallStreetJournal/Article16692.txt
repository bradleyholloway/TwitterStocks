 Home & Family: Side Air Bags Cut SUV Fatalities   By Spector, Mike, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2006  Federal regulations don't require side air bags in passenger vehicles, but more auto makers are installing them under a voluntary 2003 industrywide agreement to improve side-impact safety in SUVs and pickup trucks. The accord means virtually all cars, SUVs and pickups will have head-protection side air bags by 2010. Anne McCartt, an author of the study and the institute's vice president for research, said as many as 2,000 lives a year could be saved once all vehicles are equipped with head-protection side air bags.  Ms. McCartt said that isn't surprising. "Side air bags are relatively new, and the datasets still are small. This means fluctuations in the results are to be expected." She emphasized the consistent findings of both studies that side air bags reduced fatality risk "regardless of what model years we included."
