 A Muslim Leader With a Difference   By By Paul Wolfowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  In office barely three days, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, attended a prayer service at a Hindu ashram in Bali last week. Years ago Mr. Wahid studied at the ashram with its leader, a disciple of Gandhi, but his return as president was an unprecedented event in the overwhelmingly Muslim country.  After an ecumenical ceremony (including Hindu, Muslim, Protestant, Catholic and Buddhist prayers), Indonesia's new president -- and the former head of a 30-million-member Muslim organization, the largest in Indonesia -- stressed the need for religious tolerance and criticized the Ministry of Religious Affairs for having become the ministry of only one religion. "Although I am a Muslim, I also believe in Mahatma Gandhi's teachings," he said. "It is not right that we should be fighting because of religion."  Surprising, perhaps, from a leader one Australian newspaper called an "anti-Aussie Muslim cleric." But Indonesia's new president has lived a life devoted to democratic ideals: religious tolerance, freedom of thought and the rule of law -- ideals that his father, a leader in Indonesia's independence struggle, also lived for. Many years later, Mr. Wahid told V.S. Naipaul that the sight of people weeping at his father's funeral brought home the meaning of a life dedicated to those ideals. "Is there anything greater in life than being loved by so many people?" he asked.
