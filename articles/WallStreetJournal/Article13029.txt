 Politics & Policy; POLITICAL CAPITAL: Campaigns Eschew Substantial Issues For Phoney Charges   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2004  The origins of the attack are a Boston Globe article, written a decade ago, about a report by the nonpartisan "Concord Coalition" which left Sen. [John Kerry] off its "honor roll" for deficit reduction. An enterprising reporter by the name of Jill Zuckman, now at the Chicago Tribune, cornered Sen. Kerry in the U.S. Capitol to get his response. He was irritated at being left off the list and said the Concord Coalition's grading didn't accurately reflect "my $43 billion package of cuts or my support for a 50-cent increase in the gas tax." Neither Ms. Zuckman nor Robert Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, are aware of exactly when or where Sen. Kerry expressed his support for this tax increase. The strange episode might be seen as further evidence of Sen. Kerry's desire to be on all sides of every issue. But it's a huge stretch to suggest he currently supports a 50- cents-a-gallon tax.  MEANWHILE, THE Kerry campaign spent the week touting its plan to "create 10 million jobs" over the next four years. And it decorated its Web site with a flashy "jobs calculator." You can click on a state -- take Ohio as an example -- and find out that President [Bush-Cheney] "lost" 169,000 manufacturing jobs there, while Sen. Kerry will create 417,000 new jobs in the next four years.
