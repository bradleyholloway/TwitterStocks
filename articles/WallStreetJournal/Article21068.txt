 You Can Now Trust Those Over 30   By Compiled by the staff of American Demographics Magazine, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1987  In 1967, the oldest baby boomer was 21 years old, and the largest age group was 10-year-olds. This year, the largest age group (4.6 million people) will be 30-year-olds, and the number of 30- to 34-year-olds has increased 17% since 1980. By contrast, there are now only 3.3 million 10-year-olds, and the average growth rate for all age groups since 1980 has been 6%.  With such a large segment of the population in their 30s -- nearly one in every four adults -- there is a corresponding increase in the number of people who are thinking about such mundane matters as family stability, job security, financial well-being and the safety of their children.  Because it is at this age that many people can buy their first home, they also begin paying attention to property taxes, local schools and local politics. People in their 30s are much more likely to favor the status quo than when they were younger and had nothing to protect. They may be less inclined than before to experiment and more set in their opinions about what they like or don't like.
