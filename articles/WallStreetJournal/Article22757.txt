 The Class Conflict at the Heart of Manila's Convulsions --- Some See an Old Clash Of Wealthy Interests And Marcos Populism   By By James Hookway, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2001  Only four of the 11 figures Ms. [Gloria Macapagal Arroyo] accused of plotting or inciting rebellion were in custody yesterday. The most prominent among them is opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who disdains the ruling elite that Ms. Arroyo represents. Mr. Enrile's own colorful life reflects the gulf between Arroyo and [Joseph Estrada] supporters, and hints at the difficulty she'll have uniting the country after Tuesday's violence.  A rift began to grow between Mr. [Ferdinand Marcos] and his lieutenant in 1984, when Mr. Enrile began discussing the possibility that he might someday become president. Fearing arrest, he broke away from Mr. Marcos along with armed-forces chief Fidel Ramos, and helped overthrow the president in the People Power revolt of 1986. Mr. Enrile was appointed defense secretary by Marcos successor Corazon Aquino, but was sacked a year later for supposedly plotting against her. "Be a man. Or better yet, be a woman," Mrs. Aquino told Mr. Enrile at the time.  Political analysts say there is a hard core of politicians and ex-soldiers such as Sen. Gregorio Honasan, who, like Mr. Enrile, gained influence under Mr. Marcos and still exerts a populist sway over the poorer segments of Philippine society. The legal world, for example, is still dominated by Estelito Mendoza, Mr. Marcos's justice secretary. Marcos associates like San Miguel Corp. chairman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. and tobacco tycoon Lucio Tan are still two of the biggest players in Manila's corporate circles. Mr. Estrada himself made the jump from movies to politics under the patronage of Mr. Marcos.
