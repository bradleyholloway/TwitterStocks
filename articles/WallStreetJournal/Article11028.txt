 Frankfurt Surges on Japanese Buying; Shares Also Rise in Tokyo and London --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1987  West German stock prices surged on heavy buying from Japanese investors. But in Tokyo, volume was light as prices edged higher, while in London, stocks fluctuated in thin trading and also ended higher.  But heavy buying of West German shares by Japanese investors was the biggest factor in the market, brokers said. "It must have been big orders," a senior analyst at a big West German bank said. "We had some domestic orders, but not enough to account for the big gains we have been seeing."  Deutsche Bank surged 17 marks to 679 marks ($359.64), while Dresdner Bank moved up four marks to 351 marks. But Commerzbank had a rise of just 0.5 mark, to 292 marks.
