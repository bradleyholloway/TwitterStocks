 Boss Talk: Beyond Howard; Mel Karmazin Gets Sirius On Nascar, Auto Radios, Ads; Mr. Stern's Bathroom Break   By McBride, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2006  Mr. [Mel Karmazin]: I don't know if CBS is the standard in a lawsuit as to what Sirius should put in an 8k. I think they have this clear-cut vendetta against [Howard Stern]. Most of the people who have seen or commented on the lawsuit think it's pretty bizarre. We have said in our regulatory filings that we don't believe that the lawsuit has any merit at all. What it's done is it's put Howard back into the headlines again.  I've never seen anything like this. I've been around the broadcasting and media business, but I can't find another example of where a large company, after a talent left that made them a whole lot of money, has chosen to file a lawsuit against the talent. Particularly, about things that were said on the radio when they were in control of the radio station. They're telling [the Federal Communications Commission] that they're in charge of their station, and that they are making sure that [nothing legally indecent] isn't mentioned and yet, they were surprised to learn that he was talking about Sirius. All I had to do was listen to their radio station.  Mr. Karmazin: We don't have that as a target or as a date. I think there's been so much focus on Sirius versus XM. I think that the category is on fire. We're not interested in just beating XM. We're interested in making our company as successful and big as it could be, and if we hit all of our metrics and XM is hitting all of their metrics and they're doing well, I'm happy for them. This isn't a one- company-is-going-to-win and the other-company-is-going-to-lose. I'm not going to focus on their six million subscribers. We're focused on the people who aren't subscribers to satellite radio. There will be two successful satellite radio companies around for a long time.
