 Review / A Surfer's Guide to TV: Defining Moments, in Life and Oscar   By By Barbara D. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 23, 2001  The dishy [Archie MacDonald], a longtime Londoner, is about to launch a trendy fish restaurant with his equally ambitious and oh-so-stylish girlfriend, Justine, when he is reeled back in. Summoned home to Glenbogle, his family's immense loch-side pile in the Highlands (the series was shot at the real Cairngorms estate), he learns that his lovably eccentric parents, Hector and Molly (Richard Briers of "Good Neighbors" and Susan Hampshire of "The Forsyte Saga" and "The Pallisers"), have made him the laird of their crumbling castle and landholdings, which are drowning in seemingly bottomless debt. And he becomes reacquainted with his childhood classmate Katrina, now the local schoolteacher and environmentalist. This beauty becomes Archie's verbal sparring partner and sparks more than anger in our handsome young laird.  This two-part biopic narrated by [Judy Garland]'s younger daughter, Lorna Luft, is no "Mommie Dearest." Scenes in the second half show just how difficult it was to be Judy Garland's daughter, but they emphasize the strong, warm bond Garland forged with her three children before her death at age 47. And the miniseries covers the by-now-familiar highs and lows of Judy Garland's life and career, the insecurities and addictions, with insight, empathy and first-rate production values.  There are loving recreations of sequences from "The Wizard of Oz," "Girl Crazy," "Meet Me in St. Louis" and "A Star Is Born," as well as Garland's famous show-stopping comeback performances in the '50s at New York's Palace Theater and in 1961 at Carnegie Hall, all placed in the context of Garland's offstage dramas and lip-synched to her incomparable singing voice. Robert Allan Ackerman directed Robert L. Freedman's teleplay, which was adapted from Ms. Luft's "Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir."
