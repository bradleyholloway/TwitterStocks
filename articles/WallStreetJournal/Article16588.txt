 Angola Possesses A Prize as Exxon, Rivals Stalk Oil   By Ball, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2005  Exxon is confident there is more oil to be found in Block 15: "That's probably the greatest single prize out there at this point," said Terry McPhail, Exxon's top manager in Angola.  Exxon has become one of Angola's biggest oil producers. How keen the company is to expand production in the waters off Angola was clear on a recent day as Mark Albers, president of Exxon's development unit, led a tour of Kizomba B.  As he walked around the ship in an orange jumpsuit, the 48-year-old Exxon executive assumed the role of salesman, stressing Exxon's record of reliability and efficiency. Largely through a process Exxon calls "design one, build multiple," a kind of cookie-cutter approach to developing huge offshore projects, Exxon got the Kizomba B project built for $3.5 billion, about 10% less than the $3.9 billion the company says the project otherwise would have cost. Exxon boasts that the project also was up and running several months ahead of schedule.
