 Alcatel to Acquire Optical-Filters Firm For $175 Million   By By Kevin J. Delaney, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2000  Alcatel said the deal is driven partly by expectations that the company will be able to integrate Innovative Fibers' products with its own optical components. Those components are key to the French company's activities in dense-wavelength division multiplexing, which allows many streams of data to travel quickly over the same fiber.
