 Washington Leads Bulls to Slaughter   By By Lawrence B. Lindsey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2000  Vice President Al Gore's analysis was that "markets go up and markets go down." It's an insight that's hard to argue with, but it implies that there is no link between public policy and the market's sudden reversal. But the facts show the tone of public policy shifted during the past few weeks, and that the market noticed. Politics is taking its toll on prosperity, while areas in need of government reform continue to be neglected.  The Nasdaq Stock Market began its decline during the second week of March, when biotechnology stocks suddenly plunged. The cause was a statement issued on March 14 by President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, asserting that knowledge about the human genome should be made available to all of mankind. Of course, what belongs to all of mankind cannot be easily patented, and thus the products the biotech industry is developing didn't seem as profitable to investors. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down about one-third since then.  Then on April 3, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his Microsoft ruling. That day and the next were among the most volatile in stock-market history. The Nasdaq swung as much on those two days as did the Dow during its famous 1987 crash. Whatever the legal merits of Judge Jackson's ruling, it created massive uncertainty for the fastest-growing segment of our economy.
