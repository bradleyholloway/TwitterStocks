 Kendall-Jackson Seeks a Buyer; Sale Price Could Hit $2 Billion   By By Nikhil Deogun and Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  Should a sale occur, it would be one of the largest deals in the wine industry. A spokesman for Kendall-Jackson, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Diageo said, "Kendall-Jackson is a great wine brand," but declined to comment on whether Diageo would bid for the winemaker. A spokeswoman for Allied Domecq said that "the company has focused on wine as an area of strategic growth" and added that Allied Domecq is "looking at well-established brands with great export potential or existing export capabilities." A spokesman for Brown-Forman declined to comment.  Kendall-Jackson's biggest market is selling midprice Chardonnays in the range of $10 to $12 a bottle, and the company in fact pioneered and has dominated this segment of the wine industry, analysts say. The company had an estimated $362 million in revenue last year, selling 3.65 million cases. Mr. [Jess Jackson], Kendall-Jackson's founder and a former lawyer, is known as a scrappy marketer who went up against the traditional heavyweights in the industry, such as E.&J. Gallo Winery. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Mr. Jackson's net worth at $1.3 billion.
