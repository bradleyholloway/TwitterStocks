 Journal Exchange -- The Informed Reader: Insights and Items of Interest From Other Sources   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2007  Crowd in a Box and Inflatable Crowd both sell inflatable vinyl torsos that movie producers can dress up and use to expand the apparent size of a crowd of extras. They appeared in crowd scenes in "Million Dollar Baby" and "Ocean's Thirteen" and "Be Cool."  A major finding in the nascent field of "metagenomics," writes Emily Singer in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Technology Review, came in a Washington University School of Medicine study of obesity that suggested that overweight individuals tend to have different kinds of microbes in their gut than lean people. Follow-up research on mice revealed that the kinds of microbes that obese humans had in abundance break down food more efficiently than other kinds of microbes. This means an obese person could eat the same food as another person but extract more calories from it. (The result even made it to a "Cathy" cartoon strip, with the diet-plagued title character complaining her intestinal microbes weren't working hard enough.)
