 Letters to the Editor: Taking the Measure of Welfare Reform   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  If the goal of welfare reform was simply to reduce caseloads, that could have been accomplished with 100% success by eliminating welfare programs entirely; if the goal was to reduce the need for assistance, we are far from succeeding. Why not examine instead whether most ex-welfare recipients have found jobs providing above-poverty wages (at least $14,630 for a family of three) and health insurance to replace lost Medicaid coverage? If Texas' experience is any indication, any claims about welfare reform's "successes" sound hollow indeed.
