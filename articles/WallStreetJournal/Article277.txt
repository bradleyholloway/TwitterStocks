 Small-Stock Focus: Indexes Slip a Bit, Partly on Late Internet Fizzle; NBTY, Sigma Designs and Cole National Decline   By By Thomas Granahan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1998  Smaller stocks and Nasdaq issues managed to outperform blue-chip stocks but finished lower after the latest surge in the Internet group fizzled late in the session.  "The market has come a long way, and those investors that are buying are buying blue chips," said Peter Coolidge, head trader at Brean Murray. "The values that were uncovered by the fall sell-off in small caps have been unearthed, and while one can argue that the value is still there, it's not as plentiful as it was before the rally in small stocks."  NBTY, a Bohemia, N.Y., maker of nutritional supplements, fell 1 5/16, or 18%, to 6. The company posted fourth-quarter net income of 10 cents a diluted share, better than its eight cents a share of a year earlier but three cents below expectations. Revenue, meanwhile, jumped to $146.4 million from $116.3 million.
