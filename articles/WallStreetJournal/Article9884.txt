 Politics & Economics: Bill to Overhaul Asbestos Litigation Seems Headed for Senate Rejection   By Mullins, Brody, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2006  Mr. [Arlen Specter] has spent two years working on the legislation, meeting dozens of times with manufacturers, insurers, unions, trial lawyers and asbestos victims in order to find a compromise. Mr. Specter gets significant support from Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, who has made the bill a top priority for the year, and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who lent the bill bipartisan support.  More troubling for the bill's prospects is that a number of Republicans say they could support Mr. [Harry Reid]'s filibuster unless major changes are made on the Senate floor. One member of that group, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said "there are a significant number of Republicans who are uneasy" about the legislation and are considering joining a Democrat-led filibuster.  On the other end of the political spectrum, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) believes the bill is "both unfair and unworkable" because it lets companies off the hook for asbestos liabilities. "It does not provide a reliable guarantee of just compensation to the enormous number of workers who are suffering from asbestos-induced disease," Mr. Kennedy said.
