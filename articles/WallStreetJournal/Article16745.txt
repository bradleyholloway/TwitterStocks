 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Fund Fiend -- Investor Stress Test: Can You Tolerate More Market Jolts?   By McDonald, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  Tuition wasn't cheap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 416-point plunge on Tuesday -- driven by losses in Shanghai and worries about the global economy -- was jarring. The benchmark was down more than 500 points at one stage and selling was so furious that the index's fall wasn't tracked correctly. The day had a sky-is-falling feeling for a little while there. With a 120-point drop Friday, the index closed its worst week in over four years.  At least some fund investors have taken on more risk in recent years.

At the same time, persistently low yields overall enticed some investors to favor riskier bond funds.
