 States Win AIDS-Drugs Discounts; By Joining Forces, Officials Save $65 Million Annually After Talking to Companies   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2003  The initiative, which involved more than four months of negotiations, marks the first time that all 56 state and territorial AIDS drug-assistance programs have joined forces in their talks with manufacturers. Drug makers have traditionally offered some discounts on AIDS treatments to the programs, but the deals have been struck largely on a state-by-state basis.  The AIDS drug-assistance programs are state-run but largely federally funded efforts that provide drugs to low-income people who lack insurance. About 84,000 patients, or one-third of the U.S. market for AIDS drugs, get medications through such programs, at a total cost of about $850 million a year.  Roche, which is offering discounts on six AIDS treatments and related drugs provided through the programs, declined to say how much of a discount it is giving on Fuzeon. Because of the novel way it attacks the AIDS virus, the new drug has been seen as a lifeline for patients who no longer respond to other treatments. But its average wholesale price of $20,000 is more than double that of the next- costliest treatments, prompting many programs to offer it in only limited quantities.
