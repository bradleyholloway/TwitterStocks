 Katrina Prompts Record Pace of Giving; With More Than $400 Million Collected, Charities Take Steps to Show Money Is Spent Efficiently   By Bernstein, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  Despite the massive amounts of money pouring in, aid organizations say they need more. After the tsunami, many relief groups cut off donations when they felt they had raised enough money to pay for their services. But with the needs so great after [Katrina] for everything from immediate food and shelter to long-term medical care to relocation assistance, charities say they haven't reached that point yet. "There will never be enough money," says John Spain, executive vice president of the Baton Rouge Area Foundation, which raises funds to assist evacuees. The Red Cross says it will need at least $1 billion for the relief effort.  This time around, the Red Cross says that all money earmarked for Katrina will be used only for that purpose. The Salvation Army has created a special fund, Katrina Disaster Relief Fund, and says all money earmarked for Katrina will go toward that relief effort.  The watchdog groups, too, have set up lists of charities working on Katrina relief, with details on their evaluations and tips on how to give wisely. Charity Navigator, www.charitynavigator.org, features a list of relief agencies on its home page that get three- and four star-ratings -- the highest the group gives out -- including Feed the Children, World Emergency Relief and Church World Service. The Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, www.give.org, and the Internal Revenue Service, www.irs.gov, also provide information on recommended charities.
