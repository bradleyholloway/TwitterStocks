 The Not-So-Ugly Duckling   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  If charter schools feel like the ugly ducklings of the American education system, it's not hard to see why. Conservative support has generally been lukewarm, seeing charters as a halfway house to vouchers. The teachers unions and public-school establishment bitterly oppose charters because they threaten their monopoly. Indifference and hostility notwithstanding, 10 years after Minnesota became the first state in the union to open the door to them, charters are today blossoming into the kind of bird that public education might really take pride in.  Sure, charters could use the $175 million the [George W. Bush] education bill has earmarked for buildings and facilities. But what they really want is the freedom to breathe. Though 38 states now have laws allowing charter schools, in many the chartering authorities are the biggest enemies of charters. New state rankings from the Center for Education Reform (www.edreform.com) show, for example, that 80.8% of the nation's charters are in states that provide multiple chartering authorities. In sharp contrast, states that require the local school board to sign off have only 5.6% of the nation's charters.
