 Critique: Grand delusion: French films vs. GATT   By Sokolov, Raymond, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1993  Raymond Sokolov discusses the insistence by the French on a cultural exception to the GATT talks that would allow them to continue to subsidize their film industry while restricting the role of foreigners. Sokolov says that the best deal would preserve the status quo while limiting the ability of French officials to impose new restrictions on foreign films and TV programs.
