 Commodities Report: Corn Is Likely to Fall Further As a Record Crop Is Expected   By Johnson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2003  The U.S. Department of Agriculture currently pegs the crop at a record 10.27 billion bushels, based on a record yield of 142.7 bushels an acre with 72 million acres harvested. This summer's near-greenhouse Midwestern weather conditions are prompting talk of an even bigger crop. Agriculture Department crop ratings as of July 13 pegged 74% of the corn crop in good to excellent condition, which is nearly unheard of in mid-July. On that date a year ago, only 49% of U.S. corn was rated top condition.  Weakness in the cash market should translate into additional pressure, with new-crop cash bids currently under the government guaranteed-loan rate of $1.98 a bushel. On top of that, farmers are holding almost all of the ending supply from 2002-03, as early this year many farmers put corn from last year's crop in the nine-month loan program. That means much of the crop under loan will exit during this year's harvest. Farmers have the opportunity to sell that corn in the cash market and repay the loan, or forfeit the crop to the government.
