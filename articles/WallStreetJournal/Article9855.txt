 Push for 'Made In' Tags Grows in EU; Trade Groups Urge Europe To Impose Origin Labeling; Fashion Houses Are Divided   By Galloni, Alessandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2005  The petition -- signed by 225 entities, including luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Trussardi -- is intended to support Italian government efforts to pass an EU law that would impose mandatory origin labels for certain categories of consumer goods, such as clothes and shoes. Italian officials say a green light on the matter could come by year's end, though it is unclear whether the idea has enough support from fellow EU nations.  Unlike the U.S. and Japan, the EU doesn't require importers to stick a "made in" tag on their goods. Pushed by Italian manufacturers, which are losing business to cheap Chinese imports, Italy's government two years ago proposed that the EU introduce a measure requiring companies to indicate where their products are made.  Some manufacturers that signed the petition would like the "made in" labels to be required for products made in any country. But a five- month consultation led by the European Commission last year concluded there wasn't enough support throughout the EU for such a widespread labeling plan -- partly because it would increase costs for businesses and would be difficult to enforce, according to an EU document.
