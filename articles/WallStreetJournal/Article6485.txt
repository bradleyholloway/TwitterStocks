 Intel to Unveil New Chips for Servers; Processor With Two Brains Is Designed to Close Gap In Performance With AMD   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  AMD beat its bigger rival to market in April with "dual-core" server chips, which offer two electronic brains on a single piece of silicon. Aided by the additions to its Opteron line, AMD's share of the world-wide market for x86 server chips rose to 7.4% in the second quarter from 5.6% in the first period, according to the market- research firm IDC. In one niche, x86 servers running at least four chips each, AMD grabbed nearly 20% of the U.S. market, up from 11.4% in the first period.  Most server makers are expected to adopt the new Xeons. Dell Inc., the one major vendor that doesn't use AMD's Opteron, has announced machines using the new Intel products. "They are very anxious to get their dual-core server products out the door to compete with the Opteron systems," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at market research firm In-Stat.
