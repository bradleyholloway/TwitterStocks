 CBS Taps Digital Deal Maker To Place Bets on New Media   By Barnes, Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2006  While working to expand and better organize CBS's myriad of Web sites and mobile initiatives, Mr. [Quincy Smith] is charged with spotting digital companies to acquire when they are still under the radar. "I want to make sure we're in as many conversations and discussions with entrepreneurs as we can," he said. "It's those six guys in the garage that we're interested in."  Mr. Smith's close relationship with Google, whom he has been advising for several years on its strategy in areas such as acquisitions and partnerships with media companies, is especially notable. "Virtually all of the significant acquisitions, much of the media strategy was co-developed with Quincy," says Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who talks to Mr. Smith every week or two. "Quincy knows as much about the company as any of the executives at Google."
