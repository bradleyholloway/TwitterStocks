 Central European Bond Markets Offer Some Eye-Popping Returns and Risks   By Bonte-Friedheim, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1996  The region's debt markets aren't for the meek. In mature markets, "fixed income" is often a synonym for relatively predictable investing backed by some fancy forecasting of inflation, budget debts, and so on. In Central and Eastern Europe, these skills don't mean much.  For buyers of Russian T-bills, the outlook for inflation may mean less than the state of Boris Yeltsin's health. Investors in Croatian debt must pay less attention to the trade balance than to the timetable for the retreat of NATO forces (which depends, in part, on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election). And the size of Poland's hard-currency reserves may matter less to T-bill prices than investors' attitudes toward emerging markets generally.  "Emerging-market debt sometimes trades just like equity," says Simon Nocera, who manages GT Fund Management's $1.4 billion emerging-market debt fund. GT invests some 30% of its portfolio in Eastern Europe. "It's equity on the country."
