 Battle of the Computer-Magazine Titans --- Ziff Pulls Ahead Of Main Rival In U.S. Market   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 24, 1989  The flamboyant Mr. McGovern practically invented the computer-magazine business back in 1967 and dominated it for nearly two decades -- until the reclusive Mr. Ziff came along.  Ziff Communications Co., in New York, has pulled ahead in the U.S. because of its strength in the personal-computer field. It is led by PC Magazine, which has over $100 million in annual revenue and a 700,000 circulation. "We're in hypergrowth," says Mr. Ziff, who moved into computer publications just six years ago.  Ziff's success mirrors changes in the computer business itself, where smaller computers -- especially PCs -- are taking business away from larger computers. In contrast to Ziff's PC focus, the most profitable magazine for Mr. McGovern's International Data Group, Framingham, Mass., is Computerworld, designed for corporate data-processing managers who buy mainframes and minicomputers. Last year, Ziff had 34% of the computer-magazine industry's $552 million in ad revenue, while IDG had 27%, according to Daniel McCarthy, an editor at Communications Trends Inc., a Larchmont, N.Y., advertising-research firm. In 1986, IDG led, 25% to 21%.
