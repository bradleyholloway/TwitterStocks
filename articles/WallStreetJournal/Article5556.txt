 If You Deck the Halls With Folly, Undecking Them Isn't So Jolly   By By Christy Cagle Terral, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1998  For nearly 30 years, Mrs. Arnold has been adding to the Christmas items inside and outside of her home. She decorates her yard and occasionally the neighbor's yard, filling them with wooden cut-outs of a sleigh and reindeer, a snow family, Santa's workshop, Mr. and Mrs. Claus and children caroling. Red lights line the roof. Swags of greenery tied up with pink bows adorn each window.
