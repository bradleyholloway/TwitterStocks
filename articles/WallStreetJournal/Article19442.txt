 Cellphones Help KPN, Telefonica Results   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Almar Latour in London, Keith Johnson in Madrid and Dan Bilefsky in Brussels, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  For KPN, the problem child of Europe's telecom industry, the main issue is debt. The company, which only last year aspired to be Europe's third-largest operator, is under a 23 billion euro ($21 billion) debt pile, while its market capitalization is shrinking to new lows every day. Resembling a cash-strapped start-up, KPN, which broke off merger talks with Belgian counterpart Belgacom Friday, has enough money in its coffers to stay in business only until June. It will need to either sell off assets or put itself on the block to meet its debt payments.  KPN's situation is the more drastic, and the company gave no clear indication of how it means to climb out of its predicament. Several buyout firms are circling the company, hoping to fetch its fixed-line telephone network or its E-Plus mobile unit in Germany at bargain prices. Chief Financial Officer Maarten Henderson dismissed suggestions that KPN's cash-generating fix-lined business or the E-Plus mobile unit would have to go on the block.
