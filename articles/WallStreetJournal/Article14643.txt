 Toiling on the Farm -- A Special Report --- A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1989  Some growers can't find enough workers to pick strawberries in California and cucumbers in North Carolina, but the 1986 immigration law didn't create the predicted huge 1989 labor shortage. It has forced farmers to boost pay to lure and hold legal immigrants and other hired hands. Farm workers averaged $5.23 an hour in July, up 33 cents from a year ago. Wages of piece-rate fruit and vegetable pickers, in greatest demand, jumped almost 25% to $6.08 an hour.  "There's a great deal of competition out there for labor," says Al French, an Agriculture Department labor analyst. Growers are developing worker-referral systems, busing in workers and offering better benefits. The pinch may mean fuller employment for farmhands and more migrant workers following harvests northward.  For the American Farm Bureau Federation, repeal of the wage floor would be ideal. Short of that, the nation's largest farm group will settle for scuttling the revived version of the Democrats' bill that President Bush vetoed. "Our members are already paying more than the proposed $4.55 minimum," says lobbyist Libby Whitley. The group will make its stand against the bill in the House, where it has more friends.
