 Vermont Utilities Told to Sell Stake In Seabrook Plant   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1985  MONTPELIER, Vt. -- State regulators ordered Vermont utilities to try to sell their 2% stake in the unfinished Seabrook 1 nuclear plant and to press other utilities to cancel the project.  The Vermont Public Service Board also set a hearing for Thursday to consider whether Central Vermont Public Service Corp. and Vermont Electric Cooperative should be ordered to stop making payments for construction of the Seabrook, N.H., plant. Seabrook 1, which is about 85% complete, so far has cost about $3 billion and its total cost is expected to reach $4.6 billion if it is completed.  By itself, the Vermont action isn't likely to force the cancellation of Seabrook 1 because utilities there own such a small share. But it adds another obstacle to completion of the long-controversial unit, which also faces regulatory problems in Massachusetts and Maine. Seabrook 2 isn't likely to be completed.
