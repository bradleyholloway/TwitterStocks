 The Economy: Washington Wrestles With Tax Bill --- Tensions Increase as House Proposes Options at Odds With White House, Senate   By By John D. McKinnon and Shailagh Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  May 2, 2003  The House plan would produce strikingly different winners and losers than Mr. [Bush]'s proposal. Possible winners, some analysts say, include companies that avoid paying a lot of U.S. tax now -- an outcome that could be troubling to the White House, which pitched its plan as a tonic for corporate tax-dodging.  Many alternatives now under consideration are "camel's-nose-in-the-tent kind of stuff," said Goldman Sachs economist Ed McKelvey. It's not a pretty picture for the Bush administration, which built its economic-growth package around the full 100% dividend break. But with each passing day it's less likely that Mr. Bush will be able to win support for his original, $725 billion plan. Here's a look at the alternatives vying to take its place:  Winners: Assuming the administration keeps all the bells and whistles of its original plan, winners here would be companies that already pay a lot of tax, such as food companies. That is because Mr. Bush's original proposal tried to help them most, by tying the amount of tax-free dividends a company can pay to the earnings on which it actually pays taxes. Also, firms that don't pay dividends now could be winners, because Mr. Bush's original plan let them share in the benefits too, through a complicated mechanism that gives shareholders a capital-gains break.
