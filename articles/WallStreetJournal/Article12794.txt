 As Hopes Dim, Radical Plans for Mideast Emerge --- Unorthodox Peace Proposals Include Israel in the EU, Bosnia-Style Protectorate   By By Yaroslav Trofimov, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2002  With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a virtual prisoner of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon after a wave of Palestinian suicide bombing attacks, the framework of the peace process that began in Madrid a decade ago now lies in tatters. Palestinians who seemed to agree on a two-state solution increasingly contest Israel's right to exist. Israelis who allowed Mr. Arafat to return from a lifetime in exile increasingly oppose any Palestinian state presided over by a man they consider a terrorist once again.  "I don't know if we would have gotten peace in Bosnia if part of the problem there were terrorist suicide attacks," cautions Reginald Bartholomew, the [Clinton] administration's special envoy to Bosnia and U.S. ambassador to Lebanon from 1983 to 1986. "Suicide terror attacks against civilians have as an object not getting Israelis out of the West Bank, but of getting Israelis out of Israel," he says.  The European Union's favorite security idea is to dispatch an international "protection force" to separate the combatants. The Palestinian Authority always liked the plan and Israel always opposed it, saying that such international troops would be useless against suicide attacks -- but extremely efficient in preventing any Israeli retaliation. Israel is traditionally suspicious of any European interference, viewing the EU, its main trade partner, as hopelessly pro-Arab. That feeling was reinforced in recent days as some of Europe's left-wing parties called on the EU to cancel the free-trade accord with Israel and even to severe diplomatic relations.
