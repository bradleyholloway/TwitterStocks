 Tax report: One remarkable feature   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1996  One remarkable feature of 1995 was the "total absence of large tax increases" by state governments, says the Center for the Study of the States at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. "One has to go back to 1979 and 1980 to find a year when tax increases were so scarse," the report says.
