 Finding the True Power Of a Pungent Bulb   By Johannes, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2007  When garlic is cut, allicin, a sulfur-based compound, is released -- giving garlic its distinctive smell and believed to be garlic's defense against microbes, fungii and other natural enemies. Scientists have found garlic and allicin extracts kill bacteria in the lab. It may also kill viruses, but evidence is less compelling, says Larry Lawson, an Orem, Utah, chemist who studies garlic and garlic supplements.  A catch is that garlic, and some supplements, can cause bad breath. Getting allicin into your bloodstream also is tricky. Most pills involve a powder that is supposed to make allicin when it dissolves, but stomach acid harms the enzyme that makes allicin. Many pills are coated to keep them from dissolving until they pass the stomach -- but often the coating works too well and the pills are never digested, scientists say. Scientists say it is most plausible that garlic will be effective when used topically, like in creams to treat toenail fungus.
