 National's Ellspermann, USW's Davis Amicably Craft Innovative Steel Pact   By By Mark Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1986  Stanley Ellspermann, chief negotiator for National Steel Corp., spent many late nights in past months playing poker with Buddy Davis, his counterpart at the United Steelworkers union. Mr. Davis, who frequently won, would needle Mr. Ellspermann by chortling: "I hope you're better at negotiating a labor contract than you are at playing poker."  Mr. Davis has little reason now to question his fellow negotiator's prowess. The two men last week were the principal crafters of one of the most creative steel industry labor accords ever. The 39-month agreement would give National Steel's 7,200 workers Japanese-style job security and profit sharing. It provides the nation's No. 6 steel producer some wage concessions and the ability to make major work-rule changes.  Steel industry officials credit the innovativeness of the National-USW proposal to the two labor bargainers -- and, to a degree, to the influence of the Japanese labor-management style, with its predilection for giving workers job security for life. Not coincidentally, National Steel is jointly owned by National Intergroup Inc. and by Japan's Nippon Kokan K.K.
