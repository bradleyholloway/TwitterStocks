 Coming Up Short: Firms Had a Hand In Pension Plight They Now Bemoan; Relying on Arcane Rules, Some Have Drawn Down Assets For Corporate Purposes; Now, Asking Congress for Relief   By Schultz, Ellen E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2003  One way some companies eroded or reversed their onetime pension surpluses was by tapping the pension assets to pay for staff reductions. Lucent Technologies Inc., the big maker of telecom gear, used about $800 million in surplus pension assets to pay termination benefits as it cut 54,000 employees from its payroll in 2001 and 2002. The Lucent pension plan, meanwhile, went from having $5.5 billion more funds in it than legally required on Sept. 30, 2001, to being $1.7 billion "underfunded" on Sept. 30, 2002.  "Using these surplus pension assets to pay for retiree medical expenses makes good business sense," says an SBC spokesman. "The retirees' medical benefits paid with the funds from [the pension] are the same retirees that are in the pension plans, so the same group of retirees receives benefits either way."  The byzantine accounting of cash-balance plans has a striking consequence: They tend gradually to become underfunded. That's because companies calculate their pension liability using an interest rate that makes this liability lower than the sum the company would need to pay the benefits. For instance, a company with a cash-balance plan might credit employees' pension "balances" 3% a year, but calculate its current liability for future payouts using a rate that made the liability appear smaller. That would reduce the company's need to pump money into the plan.
