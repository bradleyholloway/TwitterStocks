 U.S. Trade Gap Hits $68.51 Billion; Auto, Petroleum Imports Lead to Another Record, Fueling Jitters in Congress   By King, Neil, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2006  Imports of refined oil products rose by $1.17 billion in January, while imports of various food products, including wine, also rose. The U.S. for years ran a trade surplus in food and agricultural products, but now runs a regular deficit in that sector. U.S. imports of autos and auto parts shot up 5.6% to $22.68 billion.  The Commerce Department report was released as the furor intensified over the Bush administration's approval last month of a deal that turns over certain operations at five U.S. ports to a state-owned company in the United Arab Emirates. Ironically, the U.S. runs its third-largest bilateral trade surplus -- at $696 million in January -- with the UAE, one of the world's largest purchasers of Boeing Co. aircraft and other high-end U.S. products.
