 SBA Hopes to Revitalize Flagging GreenLine Program --- Some Restrictions Would Be Eased, Increasing Availability of Smaller Loans   By By Michael Selz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 2, 1994  The SBA launched its GreenLine program on Aug. 30 to expand small businesses' access to revolving loans, which offer greater financial flexibility than the term loans historically backed by the federal agency. The SBA predicted the initiative would generate $1 billion in loans during its first year. But so far, only nine loans totaling $2.5 million have been made.  That's why the SBA plans to eliminate certain GreenLine restrictions for monitoring revolving loans of $200,000 or less. John Cox, the SBA's associate administrator for financial assistance, said the agency intends to notify bankers within two weeks about these loosened procedures. He said the move should reduce such loans' costs without increasing the agency's risk.  Under the expected revisions, Mr. Cox added, these smaller loans no longer will require semiannual personal inspections of a borrower's collateral. He said the SBA also will stop requiring a separate account into which proceeds from receivables and inventory for repaying the loans are immediately deposited. Doing business with a lender specially trained and approved to participate in the GreenLine program also no longer will be necessary, he said.
