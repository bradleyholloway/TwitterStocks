 Azerbaijan Opposition Calls Election Fraudulent   By Chazan, Guy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2005  There also has been some willingness on the part of Azeri authorities to ensure a free and fair vote. Mr. [Ilham Aliyev] appealed to regional governors in May not to meddle, allowed opposition politicians television airtime for campaign ads and permitted foreign- funded exit polls. Then, days before polls opened, the president decreed that voters' thumbs should be sprayed with ink to prevent multiple voting. "These elections are much better than the ones in 2003," said Ilgar Gadzhiev, an observer for Azadliq. "Then, the police kept kicking us out of polling stations, and there was no one left when they got to counting the votes."  "We really wanted to recognize the result, but it's impossible," said Mr. [Ali Kerimli]. "There was vote rigging on a catastrophic scale." He said the opposition would launch a "constitutional, nonviolent struggle to cancel the results of this election."
