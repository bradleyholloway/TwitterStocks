 Opera: A Triumphant Massacre   By Waleson, Heidi, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2009  Act IV, for example, went from the plotting of Saint-Bris and his Catholic friends to a huge chorus scene in which three robed priests, backed up by a mass of robed enthusiasts carrying large black crosses, blessed the undertaking and stabbed a Christ figure with the tip of a processional cross. Aided by skillful lighting, the director created some striking tableaux that looked like Old Master paintings, and his choreographic style with crowds made the final massacre, with cassocked men slitting the throats of women, into a horrific dance of death.
