 Southern Co. To Post Charge Of $226 Million   By By Timothy K. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1987  Southern Co. said it will take an after-tax charge of $226 million by next Jan. 31 to reflect an increase in the cost of building the Vogtle nuclear power plant.  The utility holding company is taking the charge because construction costs have exceeded a self-imposed limit beyond which costs are passed along to shareholders rather than to customers. It said it hasn't yet decided in which period it will take the charge, but that it will do so no later than next January, when a new accounting rule takes effect.  Southern Co. had fourth-quarter net income of $181.3 million, or 64 cents a share, on revenue of $1.6 billion. For 1986, net income was $883 million, or $3.17 a share, on revenue of $6.85 billion.
