 REVIEW --- Books -- Five Best: A Personal Choice: Delia Ephron --- on books about animals, including a dog, a stallion and a certain trumpeting swan   By Ephron, Delia, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2012  If your dog has only walked on cement and frolicked in a dog park -- and never tumbled down a snowy mountain, braved rapids, tangled with an elk or outsmarted a coyote -- you may find this book the most romantic possible account of someone else's life with a dog. Jeffrey Masson and Susan McCarthy have assembled an encyclopedic collection of anecdotal evidence showing that animals feel what we do: love, fear, joy, friendship, rage, jealousy, kindness.
