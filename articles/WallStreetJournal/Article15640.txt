 Trading Results at Big New York Banks Expected to Clip 4th-Quarter Earnings   By By Jane Kim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1998  Hurt by recent volatility in domestic and especially emerging markets, most big New York banks are expected to report weaker fourth-quarter earnings.  But excluding the trading results, the group is fundamentally strong, analysts said. Bank earnings are expected to benefit from modest revenue growth, productivity gains and continued share repurchases, said Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst Robert Albertson. Meanwhile, credit quality in the banks' domestic card business continues to stabilize, and corporate-finance revenue remains strong, analysts said.  J.P. Morgan & Co., because it relies heavily on trading and shouldered the bulk of canceled underwritings in emerging markets, is expected to show the greatest earnings shortfall, Mr. Albertson said. Earlier in December, the so called whiteshoe investment bank warned that "unsettled market conditions globally" and "lower levels of client activity and lower trading revenues" would hurt its fourth quarter.
