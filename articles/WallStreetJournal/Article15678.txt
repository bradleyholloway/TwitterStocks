 European Stocks Jump on Outcome of EU Summit; Italy's Market Rises 4.4% and Germany's 4.1%   By By Sara Webb and Silvia Ascarelli, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1998  European stock markets galloped higher, giving a resounding welcome to the outcome of the weekend European Union summit. The markets also breathed a sigh of relief after fears of a rise in U.S. interest rates eased last week.  The good news from the Brussels summit was that EU leaders selected the 11 founding members for European economic and monetary union, or EMU, as expected. They also indicated the exchange rates at which European currencies will be fixed when Europe's common currency, the euro, is launched next January.  The move toward economic and monetary union "was a very difficult agreement -- it took years to put it together, so is it surprising that there should be a little political punch?" Mr. Chapman added. And after last Thursday's positive economic news in the U.S., which bolstered European stocks, it would have taken something "really negative" to steer European stock markets off course.
