 Philip Morris May Pay $1 Billion In EU Accord to Stop Smuggling   By Echikson, William, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2004  Philip Morris, a unit of New York-based food and tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., said it hoped to reach a final agreement "within weeks." EU Budget Commissioner Michaele Schreyer said talks had been under way for "several months" and EU governments now were reviewing a draft agreement.  In the Microsoft case, regulators found the software maker guilty of antitrust abuses. This time, the issue is smuggling and money laundering, and both sides said any payment would end all potential litigation. In 2001, the EU filed a lawsuit in New York accusing Philip Morris and other tobacco giants of complicity in smuggling by intentionally oversupplying countries neighboring the EU. Although the lawsuit was dismissed in 2002, a U.S. appeals court gave the EU a green light in January to refile a new lawsuit based on money- laundering laws.  Fighting smuggling has become a priority because of the EU expansion on May 1, when 10 mostly Central and East European countries join. The new members tax cigarettes much less than current EU members, according to the International Tax and Investment Center, an independent nonprofit research and education foundation. Excise duties on a pack of cigarettes run to 211% in the United Kingdom -- but only 10% in Latvia.
