 Speculators Lift Cocoa Futures Amid Lack of Ivory Coast Rain   By Guerriere, Alison, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  The main fundamental supporting the market was news of minimal rainfall in Ivory Coast cocoa-producing regions. "The dry season started early this year in June, and the weather has been [touch and go], and that has been supportive to the market," a cocoa-desk trader said. "If the rainfall picks up [in Ivory Coast], that will help to push the market lower."  Cocoa-growing regions in Ivory Coast saw little rainfall in June and July, with several market analysts anticipating a smaller main crop for the 2004-05 season versus 2003-04. The main crop runs from October through April. The International Cocoa Organization estimated 2003-04 production at 1.3 million metric tons.
