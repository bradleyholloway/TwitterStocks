 Berkshire Hathaway's Buffett Sees `Terrific Results' Ahead   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2002  Berkshire ended the first quarter with about $37.3 billion in investable cash -- probably more than any other company on the planet, Mr. [Warren Buffett] said. He and Berkshire vice chairman Charles Munger indicated they weren't pursuing any company at the moment.  Reviewing its primary business, insurance, Mr. Buffett said that while Berkshire believes it has capped its risks in insuring asbestos liabilities, he feared that other insurers hadn't. The result, he predicted, could be an opportunity for Berkshire to buy some of those companies on the cheap when they fail.
