 Grecian Formula for Anti-Americanism   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2003  Here's a trick question. In which country would you take a poll and find that: a) 87.8% of citizens polled are against military intervention in Iraq even with U.N. approval; b) more respondents have a positive view of Saddam Hussein than of President Bush; and c) when asked "which country is more democratic -- the U.S. or Iraq," 57% answer neither, only 34% say the U.S. and almost 8% say Iraq.
