 World Wire [3]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1993  Governments, unable to afford high-tech care for aging populations, will cut treatment provisions, said the report by Andersen Consulting and Burston Marsteller. The study polled 2,752 health specialists in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.  "The proportion of total health-care spending accounted for by the public sector is expected to decrease" in all 10 countries, "while funding from private insurance, company programs and household spending is expected to increase," the report said. Health-care spending could rise to 7.88% of the countries' gross domestic product by 1998 from 7.49% in 1990.  The director of the agency that manages Hungary's strategic industries and assets resigned following revelations that his $130,000 salary is paid by the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund. The fund is one of several U.S. governmentsponsored projects set up in 1989 to promote private enterprise in Eastern Europe, but whose activities are now under scrutiny by the U.S. Congress. The pay disclosure raised questions about possible influence-peddling by the fund in Hungary's economic policy-making. The official, Pal Teleki, said media attention about his pay at the agency, known as the AVRT, made his work impossible. Officials at the fund defended the salary subsidy, saying it is a common practice.
