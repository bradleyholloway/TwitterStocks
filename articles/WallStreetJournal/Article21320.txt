Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1989  Boise Cascade Corp. became the latest company to establish a large employee stock ownership plan, under a program that would take about 15% of its common shares outstanding out of public hands.  The Boise, Idaho-based forest products concern said it will sell $300 million of a new issue of convertible preferred stock to an ESOP covering its about 7,000 salaried workers. The stock, whose annual dividend hasn't yet been set, will be convertible into about 5.8 million common shares.
