 Tandon Disk Patent Was Not Infringed, Trade Panel Aide Says   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1985  The decision by Administrative Law Judge Sydney Harris is a setback for Tandon, which previously settled similar complaints against two other Japanese concerns, Sony Corp. and Teac Corp. Tandon had accused the two companies of infringing its patents on its floppy disk drives and flooding the U.S. market with low-cost copies. This past summer, both companies agreed to pay Tandon undisclosed amounts to settle the claims.
