 Steel Group Fears Overcapacity In China Could Pressure Profits   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2005  China added about 50 million metric tons of steelmaking capacity in 2004 and will add more than that in 2005, taking that country's annual steelmaking capacity to about 400 million metric tons, according to Mr. [Nicholas Lardy]. That is enough to meet the country's annual demand until 2015, he said. Mr. Lardy said government efforts in China to consolidate steel capacity and limit expansion could take longer than expected, largely because of resistance from Chinese provincial governments that seek to foster local steelmakers.  The IISI said China's steel demand of 300 million metric tons in 2005 is a 10% rise over the 272 million metric tons consumed in 2004. It expects demand in China to increase another 7% to 10% in 2006 to about 330 million metric tons.
