 Converse Sneaker Seeks Statement Of Fashion Instead of Foul Shots   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1993  Where the sneaker isn't appearing is on highly paid basketball player endorsers, even though Converse started out as a basketball shoe. With 10 million pairs of Converse All Stars sold last year, parent Interco doesn't feel the need to follow in the footsteps of its larger and much flashier rivals, including Nike and Reebok International Ltd., which pay big bucks to such athletes as Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan.  The company, based in North Reading, Mass., also is not spending the usual hefty sums associated with athletic shoe ads. While Nike and Reebok spent more than $80 million apiece on advertising last year, Converse spent only $12 million, according to Leading National Advertisers, which tracks ad spending. Converse says privately that it spent $5 million last year advertising the All Star. According to the newsletter Sporting Goods Intelligence, Nike and Reebook are first and second in the market for athletic footwear, while Converse is sixth.  Some Converse shoes are plugged by basketball stars, such as Larry Johnson of the Charlotte Hornets and Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns. The company also has a longstanding contract to pay $1 million annually to Earvin "Magic" Johnson. Though the contract doesn't expire until August 1994, Mr. Johnson hasn't appeared in ads since he criticized Converse in July 1992 for not properly using him in their marketing or promoting him in the high profile way Converse rivals promoted their athletic endorsers.
