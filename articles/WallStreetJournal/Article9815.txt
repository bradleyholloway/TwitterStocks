 Entertainment -- The Weekend Adviser: Adapting 'Guns, Germs and Steel' for Television; Bestselling Book Hits PBS, John Irving Mines His Past, And Baseball's All-Stars   By Spencer, Jane, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2005  When Major League Baseball's 62 All-Stars take to the field in Detroit on Tuesday, it might look like a changing of the guard. The teams will feature 11 first-time starters -- the most since 1976 -- and a number of the regulars won't be playing. Barry Bonds and Curt Schilling can blame their absence on injuries, but not so for Sammy Sosa and Randy Johnson, who've had rocky starts this season.  Newly minted All-Stars include the Orioles' Brian Roberts, who leads the American League in batting, with a .354 average. (His best effort over the last four seasons has been .273.) The Cubs' Derrek Lee leads the National League in both batting average (.377) and hits (116), as of yesterday. The Cardinals have the most All-Stars of any team, with six players, including first-timer Chris Carpenter, who has racked up 12 victories and 121 strikeouts so far. Scott Podsednik of the White Sox and Roy Oswalt of the Astros were named All-Stars in fan balloting that ended last night. (Tuesday, 8 p.m. EDT, Fox.)  Children coping with the absence of a parent has been a persistent theme in Mr. [John Irving]'s writing for the past two decades. But Mr. Irving says "Until I Find You" is his most autobiographical book yet. Like [Jack Burns], Mr. Irving never met his own father. In addition, Jack is sexually abused by an older woman in the book, a scene based on an incident from Mr. Irving's childhood.
