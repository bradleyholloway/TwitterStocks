 Sears Asks Holders To Reject Proposal On Minority Firms --- Resolution Would Require That Retailer Report Dealings With Concerns   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1985  Sears, Roebuck & Co. is asking holders to reject a resolution that the company be forced to report annually on its dealings with businesses owned by women and minority groups.  The resolution, sponsored by several religious groups that own stock, also asks Sears to outline each year its goals for increasing business with minority-owned concerns.  Dara Demmings, director of the Interfaith Center's Equality/USA program, said the goal is to encourage Sears to boost its business with companies owned by women and members of minority groups. A similar resolution was withdrawn before the 1983 annual meeting, she said, after Sears provided general information about its minority economic development efforts.
