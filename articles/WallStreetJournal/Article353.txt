 Bush Seeks to Help Party -- and Himself --- Efforts for GOP Contenders Is Part of Strategy to Prepare for Second Run at Oval Office   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 23, 2002  Mr. Bush already has visited Pennsylvania twice to raise money for the GOP gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Mike Fisher. The president has also traveled to Florida repeatedly to boost the re-election prospects of his brother, Jeb Bush, with policy announcements and fund-raisers. Just last week, the president hosted fund-raisers for GOP gubernatorial candidates in Wisconsin and Iowa, states Mr. Bush lost by 0.2% and 0.3% of the vote, respectively, in 2000.  In addition, a presidential visit can help gubernatorial candidates dominate the local news media. When Mr. Bush delivered an address to 850 supporters of incumbent Republican Gov. Scott McCallum in Milwaukee recently, Mr. McCallum ignored a nearby chair and stood throughout the speech just behind Mr. Bush's right shoulder, well within range of local TV crews.  So far, the test isn't going well. In the GOP primary, Mr. Bush's political aide Karl Rove made no secret of his desire to see GOP moderate Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan chosen to take on incumbent Democrat Gray Davis, who Republicans believe is vulnerable because of his handling of last year's energy crisis. But Mr. Riordan lost the primary to the conservative Mr. [Bill Simon].
