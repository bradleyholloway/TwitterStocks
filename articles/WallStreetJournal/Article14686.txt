 Pennzoil to Dispose Of Car Filter Unit It Bought in 1988   By By Caleb Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1990  Pennzoil's purchase of the unit, Facet Enterprises Inc., in May 1988 was the first visible move engineered by its then-new president and chief executive officer, Randal McDonald. He explained at the time that Pennzoil, the nation's biggest seller of motor oil, hoped to reap extra benefits by selling auto filters as well.  But early on, Mr. McDonald acknowledged that the Facet acquisition wasn't working out. In an interview about eight months after the purchase, Mr. McDonald said Facet hasn't "performed as well as we expected it." He said that Facet was losing market share and margins were falling. "We hadn't planned on the fierce competition," he said, though he insisted he was still optimistic about the unit's future. Facet has at least 30% of the auto filter market and has delved into some industrial filtration products.
