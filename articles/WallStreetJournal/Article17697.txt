 Oil Prices Surge Amid Increasing Signs OPEC Will Hold to Fixed-Pricing Policy   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1987  Traders said the daily price gain -- the largest in four months -- reflected the stepped-up efforts of Saudi Arabia in recent days to exhort fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to refrain from undercutting the oil cartel's fixed prices, which have been in effect for a month.  Some brokers said OPEC's firm stance was evident, for instance, in a report that Qatar chartered two crude carriers to store unsold oil rather than sell it at a discount, as well as news that France agreed to buy 25,000 barrels a day of Saudi crude at official prices through July.  Other traders and analysts were more cautious. "While the Saudis have staying power, the smaller OPEC members don't," said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York. He cited pressures on Nigeria, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates, among others, to sell crude at below OPEC's fixed prices in the coming weeks.
