 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Travel: Takeoffs & Landings   By Andrea Bennett and Stan Sesser, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2005  The books are composed of satirical reports on hundreds of mythical hotels and tips from contributors. (One example: Avoid sites of cultural or historic interest because that's where pickpockets tend to hang out.) Tom Gleisner, one of the three authors, says the idea for the Jetlag series came when he and co-authors Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch visited Portugal several years ago. and noticed that everyone was looking more at their books than at the sites. "Everywhere we looked," he says, "people were carrying travel guides, clutching onto them almost like life rafts. If you said, 'Look at the church on the hill,' they'd ask, 'What page it is on?' "  A CONTROVERSIAL POSTER for a film called "Hollywood Buddha," which depicts the star perched on top of a Buddha head with his feet dangling, has prompted the Tourism Authority of Thailand to distribute a tourist "Do's and Don'ts" guide to hotels, travel agents and airlines. Both the pointing feet and the touching of a Buddha head are considered serious insults, and Buddhists have staged hunger strikes in Thailand, Cambodia and Sri Lanka to protest the image. The Thai government's booklet includes such advice as not touching other people on the head; tucking your feet below your chair to avoid pointing them at others; and, for women, handing items meant for a monk to a man first.
