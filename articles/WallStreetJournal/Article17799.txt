 Year-End Review of Markets and Finance: Public Limited Partnership Sales Are Expected to Continue Slump   By By Earl C. Gottschalk Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1988  Sales of public limited partnerships earlier last year were strong. For the first nine months of 1987 they had been running 33.8% ahead of 1986 sales, according to Robert A. Stanger, president of a Shrewsbury, N.J., firm that tracks partnerships.  Sales of master limited partnerships, partnerships that are traded on stock exchanges, will be hit especially hard, Mr. Stanger said. He projects a 74% drop in master limited partnership sales, to around $750 million this year from an estimated $2.9 billion in 1987.  Legislation passed by Congress late last month subjects some new publicly traded partnerships for operating businesses to federal income tax. In addition, it eliminates an important tax break for individual investors by reclassifying income from publicly traded partnerships as portfolio income instead of so-called passive income -- which had generally been defined as income from activities in which investors aren't directly involved in management. As a result, investors won't be able to use the income to offset losses from older, tax-shelter investments.
