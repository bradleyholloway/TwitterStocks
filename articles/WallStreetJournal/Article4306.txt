 Kidder Declares Wigton Will Not Rejoin Firm, Despite Statements by Its President   By By James B. Stewart, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1987  Mr. Wigton was suspended by Kidder in April following his indictment on insider-trading charges. Max C. Chapman Jr., Kidder's president, said last week that Mr. Wigton "has been asked to rejoin the firm," adding that Mr. Wigton would "have no managerial responsibility" but would devote his time to his legal defense.  The charges against Mr. Wigton and two others, Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co., and Timothy Tabor, a former Kidder arbitrager, were dropped in May after the government said it needed more time to prepare its case. Kidder said its decision to resume paying Mr. Wigton's legal bills and compensation reflects the policy of Kidder and its parent, General Electric Co., to make such payments for employees until they are indicted.
