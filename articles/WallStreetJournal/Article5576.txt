 Damage Out of Control   By By Russ Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1998  As of Jan. 21, when charges emerged that Mr. Clinton had an improper relationship with the former White House intern, the political culture was flipped upside down. "Spin Cycle" contains behind-the-scenes details of the Clinton administration's attempts to manipulate the press (leading one to wonder why Mr. Kurtz didn't publish them in his Post column to begin with), but even the juiciest anecdotes seem almost quaint now. For example, when he describes a Star magazine story in which former Clinton guru Dick Morris's illegitimate daughter was called a "love child," Mr. Kurtz feels it necessary to add the disqualifier, "in the overheated parlance of the tabs." Today, the major TV networks discuss whether oral sex can be classified as adultery.  "Spin Cycle" is largely the story of Mike McCurry, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, an affable man who assumed his post after the 1994 GOP juggernaut. As the book begins, Mr. McCurry is eager to ingratiate himself with the press, sharing dinners and late-night cocktails with reporters. But he soon learns that reporters are only after The Scoop, so he becomes more devious, pitting one journalist against another, as he did with Time's Margaret Carlson, to whom he complained that the New York Times's Jeff Gerth had a vendetta against Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey. Ms. Carlson didn't take Mr. McCurry's suggestions verbatim, but she did, as Mr. Kurtz notes, "take (Mr. Gerth and his reporting partner, Stephen Labaton) to task, criticizing them by name."
