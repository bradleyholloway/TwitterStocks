 Lottery Operator Gtech Wagers on Some New Markets   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1999  Gtech is talking with Transaction Network Services Inc., one of the biggest providers of credit-card authorization machines to retailers, about possible joint ventures that would use the networks Gtech built to run lotteries. In Brazil, millions of people already pay their utility bills at 11,000 satellite-linked Gtech lottery terminals. In the Netherlands, lottery kiosks tied to Gtech central computers also sell transportation and theater tickets.  With nearly $1 billion in annual revenue and contracts to operate 81 state and national lotteries world-wide, Gtech still dominates the lottery field. But the company has been buffeted by scandals and has been struggling with softening lottery sales at home, where new casinos are drawing more bettors and fat state coffers have reduced the impetus for new games. Gtech Chief Executive William Y. O'Connor, who became chairman last year following bribery allegations involving his predecessor, believes the company can still reap big gains by transferring its online technology to other industries.  For instance, Gtech handles lottery bets at a cost of 1.5 cents per transaction, he says, while ATM or debit-card transactions typically cost 25 cents each. Mr. O'Connor says Gtech has handled as many as 8,000 transactions a second when lottery action has heated up, as it did last July, when the 20-state Powerball jackpot reached $295 million. By comparison, some Internet stock-brokerage firms have seen their systems crash when handling over 100,000 trades in a few hours.
