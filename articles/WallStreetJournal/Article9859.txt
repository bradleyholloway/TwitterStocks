 Front-Office Fireworks; As Executives Get Younger, Managing Baseball Grows Into a Far More Complex Job   By Stefan Fatsis and Jon Weinbach, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2005  Yet the demands and pace of the GM's job often require the energy of a 20-something, a reality that has fueled the rapid rise of junior executives like Mr. [Theo Epstein]. Steve Phillips was named general manager of the New York Mets in 1997 at age 34. His six seasons on the job included a daily news conference and death threats. "I joke that it's like dog years, so I was a GM for 42 years," says Mr. Phillips, now an ESPN analyst. "I feel like I'm still recovering."  At a news conference last week, Mr. Epstein cited "complexities" in his relationship with Mr. [Larry Lucchino], president and part owner of the team, but he didn't blame them for his resignation. "In the end, it just wasn't the right fit," he said. Mr. Lucchino didn't return a request for comment. In an email responding to questions, Red Sox principal owner John Henry said: "Differences are common in management."  Still, Mr. Epstein's departure was startling to other GMs. "I'm not disappointed that he's out of Boston," says J.P. Ricciardi, general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, who play in the same division as the Red Sox. "But we lost a good guy. If he's unhappy enough to walk away, sometimes it makes you sit there and say, 'Is it worth it?' "
