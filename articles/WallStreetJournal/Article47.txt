 The Americas: The Systematic Destruction of Faith in Nicaragua   By By Nina Hope Shea, The Wall Street Journal,  May 22, 1987  Mr. Vallejos was arrested by the Sandinista State Security police on April 1, 1985, and held without charges for 25 days in the State Security jail in Esteli. Throughout detention, he was interrogated about his religious activities and means of support as pastor. His interrogators taunted him: "If you believe in God, why isn't God helping you get out of jail?" He was told he must spy on his congregation or he would be discredited in the media or deported. He was pressured to name congregation members with relatives in the Contras. The previous year, all the men in his congregation were imprisoned without charges for four months. Soon after release, Mr. Vallejos fled to Honduras.  Another Nicaraguan pastor in the Honduran camp is Andres Seledron, from Waslays, Zelaya. Mr. Seledron was jailed for eight months in 1980. Though told he was being punished for not taking up arms for the Sandinistas, he believes the real reason he was singled out was because of his religious activism, combined with his refusal to attend Sandinista Defense Committee meetings. In jail, the interrogation focused on his religious beliefs: "The State Security agents asked me, 'Do you believe in God? Show us he is here!' They pressured me to renounce my religious beliefs by forcing me to stand in a latrine and to maintain kneeling positions." After release, Mr. Seledron and his family went to live in a remote mountain settlement with about 40 other displaced evangelicals. In 1981, a Sandinista army battalion discovered their camp and opened fire, killing his eight-year-old brother and his father.  Ramon Garcia, a Catholic lay deacon with an evangelical movement in Jicaro, Nueva Segovia, was prohibited from preaching in 1985 because he had ignored a Sandinista command to instruct congregations to attend Sandinista Defense Committee meetings. A 20-year-old president of the Evangelical Youths in Nueva Segovia who had resisted Sandinista pressure to join the Sandinista youth wing was also ordered to stop preaching and was told by State Security that "the Bible comes from the U.S. It is an imperialistic tool."
