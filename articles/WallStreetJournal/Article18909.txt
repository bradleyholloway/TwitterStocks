 The Next Wave: Global Forces Push Europe's Firms, Too, Into a Merger Frenzy --- U.S. Rivals Set Example; Old Business Relations, Nationalism Are Hurdles --- Blasting `Wild West' Tactics   By By Thomas Kamm and Matt Marshall, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1997  Last week, Mr. Mestrallet showed he meant business: After weeks of rumors, Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux SA, a water-distribution and communications company, confirmed that they are in merger talks that could result in a European utilities and services giant, with a market capitalization of more than 80 billion French francs ($14.14 billion). Details of the deal will be unveiled next Friday.  Germany even seemed poised for one of its first-ever hostile-takeover bids last month. But in a sign that capitalism still isn't as unbridled in Europe as in the U.S., diversified Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp hastily retreated from its attempt to take over Thyssen AG and settled for a friendly merger of both companies' steel operations. This, analysts say, shows that European culture and traditions continue to stand in the way of U.S.-style raids.  And nationalism can complicate some deals. This week, the French government was embarrassed by disclosures that General Electric Co. PLC of Britain (which isn't related to the similarly named U.S. company) might submit a bid for defense company Thomson-CSF, which is being privatized. With the European Union's single market, there is little France can do to block a bid from a European company, but France was hoping to sell it to another French company as part of a restructuring of its defense sector.
