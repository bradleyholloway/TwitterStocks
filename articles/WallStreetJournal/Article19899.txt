 Strategies for the Nest Egg   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2005  "The first thing is, don't go spend it," says Craig Brimhall, vice president of wealth strategies for American Express Co.'s American Express Financial Advisors.  -- To guard against outliving your assets, withdraw no more than 4% to 5% a year. This could be one of the biggest challenges for retiring boomers, Mr. Brimhall says. "We're the self-indulgent generation, and we're going to go do stuff," he says. Mr. Brimhall worries about what his financial advisers will be able to do "when these folks overspend $20,000 their first year in retirement."  "People jeopardize their own retirement plans" to do this, Mr. Brimhall says. "Not only isn't this the best thing for you, but it might not be the best thing for them. Are they going to bail you out when you run out of money?"
