 Deals & Deal Makers: New York Life Is Set to Acquire McMorgan & Co.   By By Christopher Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2001  "It's a natural expansion into a market that's been attractive for years," said Gary Wendlandt, chairman and chief executive of New York Life Investment Management. The acquisition greatly expands New York Life's exposure to that market. New York Life Investment Management currently has $2.5 billion in Taft-Hartley funds. At the end of last year, McMorgan ranked second behind Allianz and its $28.6 billion in Taft-Hartley accounts, according to Standard & Poor's.
