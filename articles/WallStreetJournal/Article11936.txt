 Auto Makers Make New Cuts In Output Plans --- Mixed February Sales Cited; Firms Stay Confident Over Market's Future   By By Oscar Suris, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1995  General Motors Corp. said it trimmed its first-quarter schedule for U.S. production of cars by 13,000 vehicles, or 2%. The cut follows a reduction of 21,000 vehicles that was made last month in response to a crippling plant strike in Flint, Mich. Now, GM expects to build 725,000 cars in the U.S. during the first quarter, down from plans set a month ago that called for 738,000.  Meanwhile, steady demand for light trucks has kept GM's truck production schedules from faltering. In fact, GM boosted its first-quarter schedule for light-truck production by 7,000 vehicles. GM now expects to build 507,000 light trucks in the U.S. during the quarter, up from a previous plan that called for 500,000.  Likewise, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. made similar cuts to adjust to softer market conditions. For example, Ford is again idling the Oakville, Ontario, plant that builds its Windstar minivan, although the vehicle had its best sales month in February. This is the second time that Ford has idled the Oakville plant this quarter. The auto maker also recently announced rebates on the Windstar minivan that have prompted analysts to cut earnings estimates for Ford.
