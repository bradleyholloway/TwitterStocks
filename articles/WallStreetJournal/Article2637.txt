 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1994  There are pitfalls, however. For example, after selling a bond, an investor shouldn't rush out and immediately buy back the same bond or one that is "substantially identical" to the one just sold, Mr. Garner warns. That would violate a "wash-sale" rule and knock out the current deduction for the loss, he says. Transaction costs can also be hefty. Mark L. Shifke, of New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, warns that investors should never let investment decisions be dictated purely by tax factors.  A bill to correct technical mistakes in old tax laws and to simplify various other provisions already has cleared the House. It enjoys widespread support, and many tax lawyers agree it is badly needed. Even so, the chances that Congress will approve it this year are very low, congressional staffers agree. "This is important cleanup legislation, but we probably won't pass it in 1994 after all," a tax staffer says.  Any attempt to move the bill through the Senate probably would collapse as senators propose controversial amendments on unrelated tax issues, staffers say. Also, there is "no great imperative" for Congress to act now, says a Washington tax lawyer. But that could change, says Gary J. Gasper of law firm Keck, Mahin & Cate in Washington. He says pressure for action soon may increase from companies affected by the proposed legislation. "It's an uphill battle, but it's not hopeless," he says.
