 Even $18-a-Barrel Oil Won't Halt Plunging U.S. Output --- Battered Producers Say Price in Mid-20s Or More Needed for Revival   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1986  At 8.7 million barrels a day, domestic output of crude oil is down 300,000 barrels a day since the start of 1986, reversing four consecutive years of increases. The stage is set for further and bigger drops. The gap has to be filled with foreign oil imports, which are rising at a fast rate because of increased petroleum demand.  Oil industry executives say that an increase in oil prices from the current average of $14 a barrel -- half that of a year ago -- might slow the erosion in U.S. petroleum production. Eventually, they say, the production slide could even be halted -- if oil prices were to rise high enough to spur a resurgence of exploration in the U.S.  The ouster last week of Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani -- the man widely regarded as the architect of the 1986 oil-price collapse -- underscored Saudi King Fahd's determination to achieve a fixed price of $18 a barrel. But even if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can get that price, the $4-a-barrel increase wouldn't be sufficient, oil experts agree, to revive the U.S. oil industry.
