 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Hit and Miss: Seeing Intrinsic Value in Euro Zone; Top Investor Van Otterloo Focuses on Free Cash Flow, Return on Invested Capital   By Ascarelli, Silvia, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2004  Mr. van [Otterloo] says he judges stocks as if he wants to buy the whole company. He seeks companies whose shares are selling at a 40% discount to what he defines as their intrinsic value, using such measures as a company's free cash flow and return on invested capital.  In his investing style, there is a lot that he tries to do differently than other investors. While he considers himself a "value" manager, he doesn't pick stocks because they trade at low price/earnings and price-to-book-value multiples -- traditional measures of value stocks. He shuns other techniques commonly used by fund managers, such as favoring companies whose earnings are being upgraded. He has little use for another theme of the moment -- searching for companies that pay a high dividend relative to their share price. The generous-dividend-payers strategy "doesn't make sense," he says. "It doesn't change the value of the company."  HOW IT DID: The stock price has risen fairly steadily since then. Acea, which recently unveiled a more ambitious four-year business plan, reported a 30% jump in pretax profit for the first six months, easily outstripping the 9.4% rise in sales. The chief executive officer says he wants to run a boring company that is best in class -- "exactly what you want to hear," Mr. van Otterloo says.
