 Object of the Week: Framing Picasso   By By Ken Bensinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1999  Mr. [Steve] Wynn turned to Julius Lowy Frame & Restoring Co. of New York, which has a computer database of its 4,000 frames in inventory. President Larry Shar selected a handful of frames he thought would complement the brightly colored canvas and its future home. This trio of choices fits the large canvas: an 11 inches wide, hand-carved and gilded 17th-century Italian frame (top); a 7 1/2 inches wide 17th-century carved and gilded Spanish frame (center); and a 7 inches wide carved and gilded 17th-century Spanish frame (bottom).
