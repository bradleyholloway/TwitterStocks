 Kohl's Chances May Hinge On Coalition Partner FDP   By By Brian Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1998  Even if Mr. (Helmut) Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union comes from behind to finish first in Sunday's election, it will need the Free Democrats' continued support to stay in power. But in a regional election in Bavaria on Sept. 13, the FDP won less than 2% of the vote, casting doubt on whether the FDP will win the 5% of the votes needed under German law to stay in Parliament. In the last election, in 1994, the FDP won 6.9% of the vote.  Yet, one of the biggest ironies in German politics is that the Free Democrats are the one party with policy ideas that economists say will help cure the country's economic woes -- a 10.6% unemployment rate and an underfunded pension system -- that voters say are their primary concerns. "We are the only party looking at how to solve problems with self-reliance," said the FDP's campaign manager, Hans-Juergen Beerfeltz.  "The FDP is the only party that sticks to market-economy principles in its program," said Dieter Braeuninger, an economist with Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. Without the FDP in the government, "the chances for decisive reforms will not be very high," he said. Unfortunately for the FDP, he added, "people in Germany don't like to pay taxes but they like the benefits."
