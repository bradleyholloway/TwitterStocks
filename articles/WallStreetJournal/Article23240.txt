 Expats Face Hurdles in Saving Up for a Nest Egg   By Hovey, Hollister H, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2005  "As long as you're a U.S. citizen holding a U.S. passport, you're subject to income taxes on world-wide income and estate taxes on your world-wide assets," said Bill Barbeosch, head of U.S. Trust & Estate at Citigroup Private Bank. "Your taxes are based on citizenship, not residency."  "It's best to pick up [the tax] on an annual basis. Typically the income will be reduced because of the earned-income exclusion," said Jason Felton, a tax expert who was a partner with Ernst & Young in Hong Kong and led the expatriate tax practice from 1986 through 2002. "And it's important to note that foreign plans typically can't be rolled into an IRA because they're generally not qualified under the U.S. tax law."
