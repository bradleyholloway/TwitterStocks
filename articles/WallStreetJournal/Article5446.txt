 Chicken plant of tribe seen causing a stir   By Kilman, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1997  A plan to build a sprawling $300 million chicken complex on Rosebud Sioux tribal land in South Dakota is likely to raise eyebrows throughout the poultry industry. Atlanta-based Red Clay Growth Fund said it will begin construction in April of an integrated chicken operation that would eventually slaughter 2.5 million birds a week in a cattle ranching region long considered too cold for large-scale chicken production. Lakota Farms Inc, a corporation owned by tribal members, will own the complex.
