 MTV Seeks Global Appeal; Music Channel Tries Shows That Can Cross Cultures; Jennifer Lopez Flees a Fire   By Goldsmith, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2003  "Famous Last Minutes," for example, was dreamed up by MTV Germany but would be too expensive to produce solely for that market. "Almost every month we'd come up with an idea and say, 'Wow, this is a great idea but we can't afford it,' " says program director Elmar Giglinger. MTV says the program is only at pilot stage at this point. (In the pilot, the cartoon J.Lo. wriggles free, but later dies in a fall from the building.)  "TimeZone" would take viewers to five locations around the world for performances and interviews, and "Mash," scheduled to air in Europe later this summer, is a program that proposes to "mash" two videos together, such as Madonna and Lenny Kravitz, the eclectic U.S. rocker, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, an alternative California band, and Nelly Furtado, a Latino-influenced Canadian pop singer. "There are all sorts of copyright issues" surrounding "Mash," says Mr. [Bill Roedy], including artist and record-company clearance, but the program is slated to air in Europe later this summer. It's being backed by electronics company Motorola Inc. as part of a $75 million sponsorship deal with MTV.  So, in the late 1990s, MTV began tailoring music and programming to local tastes and languages. As a result, MTV Russia now has a show called "12 Angry Viewers," in which intellectuals and others debate music videos. In Brazil, "Mochilao," a backpack travel show, is hosted by a popular Brazilian model. In China, MTV Mandarin broadcasts "Mei Mei Sees MTV," which features a "virtual video jockey." And MTV India screens "Silly Point," which is made up of short films poking fun at how cricket gear can be used in everyday life.
