 Those Aren't Weeds in Cleveland; They're Really Rare, Exotic Plants   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  Botanist James Bissell tromps through Cleveland's urban jungle in search of what he considers rare plants. Others simply tag them as weeds.  The 39-year-old Mr. Bissell has spent the past 11 years documenting more than 400 different plants found within inner-city Cleveland, from rare prairie grasses to weeds native to South America and Asia. (Migratory birds and lake freighters, among others, are responsible for the exotic finds.) His aim is to publish a field guide to urban plants, thus legitimizing what most of the rest of the world views as unsightly annoyances.
