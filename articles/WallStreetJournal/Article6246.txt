 Politics & Policy -- Washington Wire: A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2003  Gov.-elect Schwarzenegger's choice of U.S. Rep. Dreier to head his transition puzzles some California party leaders. Dreier, 51, has been in Congress nearly half his life. One Republican sees "a bad omen [that] Arnold doesn't know what he's doing." Or maybe the actor is "brilliant," he says -- tapping a Washington pol to keep rival Sacramento Republicans at bay.  Stirling Newberry, an early draft-Clark leader, blasts the retired general's infant campaign as a "cozy little inside operation ... of people who ran Gore's campaign into the ground." Clark gets advice from Gore veterans Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane -- "Gray Davis's message team," a rival strategist snipes. The two say they advised Davis only during California's energy crisis two years ago.  GREEN LIGHT: Utah Gov. Leavitt's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency seems headed to the Senate, after the White House works to overcome Democrats' objections. Nevada's Reid got the administration to weigh naming his adviser Gregory Jaczko for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, even though he doesn't want nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain repository, which the NRC must license. Democrats whittle to 50 from 400 their questions for Leavitt on [Laura Bush] policies.
