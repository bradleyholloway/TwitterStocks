 Clash Threatens Independence For Namibia --- Celebrations Marking End Of South African Rule Undercut by Fighting   By By Roger Thurow, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1989  WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Amid a noisy festival celebrating the start of Namibia's independence from South Africa, two young supporters of the South West Africa Peoples' Organization hoisted a giant banner proclaiming: "Freedom is in our hands."  Yesterday, United Nations observers monitoring the independence process flew to Namibia's northern border to verify reports of clashes between Swapo guerrillas and Namibia's paramilitary police force early Saturday morning, just as the independence era was dawning. Namibian police said yesterday that at least 120 guerrillas and 20 police officers had been killed in continuing border fighting, according to Reuter news service. Meanwhile, U.N. officials here and in New York scrambled to keep the fragile independence process from breaking down.  As details of the border incident became clear, South Africa threatened to demand the withdrawal of the U.N. observer team "until Swapo can be brought to its senses." South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the incursion of the guerrillas into Namibia from Angola was a "flagrant violation" of a cease-fire agreement between South Africa and Swapo. As a result, the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia was suspended and the U.N. said the troops may be recalled if police need assistance.
