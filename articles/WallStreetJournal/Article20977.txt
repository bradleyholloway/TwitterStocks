 Draft Iacocca Committee Expects Lady Liberty Will Brighten His Road for a Presidential Drive   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1986  A handful of political consultants will call a news conference July 16 at the National Press Club to announce the formation of a committee to make the man at the center of tomorrow's New York celebration the next president: Lee Iacocca, the un-candidate.  He has said he won't run for president, but so much the better. The lure of the Chrysler Corp. chairman, according to the consultants' reasoning, grows each time he says he isn't interested. "Our problem is that this is a campaign without a candidate," says Terrence O'Connell, one of the leaders of the Draft Iacocca effort. "But that's the chief appeal of the whole thing."  One of the principals in the drive to make Mr. Iacocca the 1988 Democratic nominee was a planner in the Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. John Glenn of Ohio. Another is a Michigan state senator from Battle Creek who says he can barely resist flying to New York tomorrow to pass out Iacocca buttons and bumper stickers. A third is a car dealer in Utah with the unlikely name of John Hinckley.
