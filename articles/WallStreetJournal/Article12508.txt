 Omnicom Extends Internet Push With a 20% Stake in Dash.com   By By Kathryn Kranhold, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1999  Omnicom Group, expanding its stable of Internet-related advertising and marketing companies, acquired a minority stake in Dash.com, a New York online start-up that offers discounts on major Web retail sites to consumers.  The investment by Omnicom, the parent of BBDO Worldwide, TBWA Worldwide and DDB Worldwide, marks one more significant online move by the company, which about three years ago started taking stakes in interactive advertising and marketing agencies, including Organic Inc., Agency.com, Razorfish, Red Sky Interactive and Think New Ideas, which recently merged with AnswerThink Consulting Group.  Omnicom's chairman and chief executive, John Wren, said the company is looking at acquiring stakes in at least two more Internet-related service companies in coming weeks, but he wouldn't identify them. And he said Omnicom early next year intends to spin off Career Mosaic, a Web-based recruitment advertising site that competes with Monster.com.
