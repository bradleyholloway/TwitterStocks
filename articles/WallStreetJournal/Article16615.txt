 Barron's Insight: Amylin Is Richly Priced   By Alpert, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2006  Some endocrinologists at cancer centers in Texas and New York say they wish Amylin would examine Byetta's effect on the thyroid's C cells, which also have receptors for the GLP-1 hormone. Before last year's U.S. approval of Byetta, Amylin tested it for carcinogenicity in mice and rats -- using the standard approach of dosing the critters for up to two years, at concentrations as high as 90 times the human dose. Of the female rats subjected to Byetta, 11% to 23% developed noncancerous C-cell growths, versus 5% and 8% in placebo groups. The rat results weren't statistically significant and didn't seem to affect the rats' longevity, so the FDA found the study no cause for worry. A parallel study in mice showed no C-cell growths.
