 Wonder Land: Olympic Games Reflect Sacrifice By The U.S.A.   By Henninger, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 2004  Even Howard Dean's heart had to skip a beat when the Iraqi athletes walked into Santiago Calatrava's magnificent stadium at the Olympics opening ceremony. Boy, did they look happy. Genuinely happy. Compare their elation -- reaching toward he crowd, tapping their hearts -- with the athletes from Iran or Saudi Arabia, who had that smile-or- disappear look Olympic athletes forlornly wore when they represented the Soviet Union or the "Eastern bloc" nations. In a word, the Iraqis looked free.  My apologies for ruffling the global fellow-feeling that lies officially beneath the summer Games. But for many of us it has become more than a little tiresome of late hearing how much the Europeans "hate us" and how the U.S. has "alienated" our "friends." And how all this global ill will is because George W. Bush "invaded" Iraq to wage an "unjustifiable" or unnecessary war.  It is most certainly true that not all American interventions work out well for local peoples. Haiti and Somalia remain disordered. Sudan appears beyond reach. None has a team in Athens. Serious people can always measure and debate foreign commitments against America's interests, goals and resources. Dean Acheson in 1950 suggested South Korea lay "outside" America's defense perimeter. A similar argument is being made now about Iraq -- that Mr. Bush overstated the threat.
