 Savvy Hedge-Fund Manager Bet Right on Subprime, but ...   By Gregory Zuckerman and Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2007  TPG-Axon isn't the only hedge-fund firm to encounter problems in the SIV marketplace. Last month, Cheyne Finance PLC, an SIV affiliate of London hedge-fund group Cheyne Capital Management (UK) LLP, said it had begun selling assets to repay its debts. Yesterday, Moody's said it downgraded notes issued by Cheyne Finance. Bank-operated SIVs also may face increasing financial troubles amid a lack of investor interest in the IOUs that SIVs are issuing.  Moody's said in a statement that Axon Financial Funding's notes faced a possible downgrade because of the "deterioration of the market value of Axon Financial Funding's portfolio and the potential impact of crystallized losses following asset sales."  Amid such jitters about European banks exposure to SIVs and similar vehicles, the Bank of England made extra cash available yesterday and the European Central Bank indicated it could inject more funds into euro-zone money markets today. The Moody's actions affected six SIVs. The agency downgraded the notes of one SIV and placed on review for possible downgrade the notes of five others. Several had signaled they faced financial pressures.
