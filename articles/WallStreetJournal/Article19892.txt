 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Outside Audit: AIG's Accounting Errors Raise Questions About Auditors' Duties   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2005  INTERNAL AFFAIR: Outside attorneys investigating improper accounting at AIG were expected to deliver their final report to regulators today. AIG used the lawyers' report to draft its annual report, so the findings hew closely to what AIG disclosed in its 229-page report Tuesday, people familiar with both reports said.  The error that added nearly $500 million to AIG earnings over the five-year period involved deferred compensation that some AIG executives received through an investment entity, Starr International Co., with long ties to AIG. While AIG disclosed the amounts in prior filings, it didn't run the cost through its financial statements, as it now says it should have. With the restatement, AIG also recorded additional capital, reflecting the Starr payments and offsetting its own expense.
