 Aon's Earnings Miss Estimates Despite Surge   By By Deborah Lohse, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1998  Aon Corp., the big Chicago insurance broker, posted a 23% increase in net income, but warned that earnings growth for 1999 will be lower than expected. Aon must now grapple with the realities of its low-growth business as significant acquisition opportunities are drying up, analysts said.  Much of the disappointment stemmed from lower-than-expected profit margins at Aon's brokerage business. Analysts had expected profit margins at Aon's brokerage business to be in the high teens in the quarter, but Aon reported only 14.6%, after accounting for expenses to make its computers year-2000 compliant, as well as investments in new businesses.
