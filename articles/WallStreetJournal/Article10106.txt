 Lilly Boosts Its 2008 Outlook   By Loftus, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2007  Lilly didn't make the kind of dramatic cost-cutting announcements that rivals such as Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca PLC have made recently, but the company has been quietly cutting costs. Executives said Lilly's work force has fallen 11% since mid-2004, representing more than 5,000 jobs. At the same time, Lilly has been outsourcing work and using contract sales representatives to sell its diabetes drugs, for example. Lilly said it is likely to continue to cut jobs, but it did not give a target. Lilly had about 40,725 employees world- wide as of Sept. 30.
