 Sprint Chairman Esrey Is Expected To Resign Soon   By By Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 2003  Mr. [William Esrey], who joined Sprint in 1980, was chief executive from 1985 until Mr. [Gary Forsee] succeeded him in March. Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., provides local, long-distance and wireless phone service.  At its annual meeting, Sprint is seeking shareholder approval to reappoint accounting firm Ernst & Young, which recommended the tax shelters to the executives. Institutional Shareholder Services, an adviser to pension and mutual-fund managers, has joined the AFL-CIO in urging shareholders not to approve the reappointment because they believe the firm's independence has been compromised by the tax shelters it devised for Sprint executives.
