 World-Wide [5]  The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1987  As Secretary of State Shultz prepared to depart tomorrow for weapons talks in Moscow, U.S. arms control chief Adelman said the Soviets had rejected the president's Iceland summit proposal, though it remains on the Geneva negotiating table. Adelman said Shultz will try to shift the emphasis to slashing strategic weapons and will offer to swap a "Star Wars" experiments timetable for data on the Kremlin's anti-missile work.  The Kremlin's Foreign Ministry displayed listening devices that it said were hidden in Soviet diplomatic missions in the U.S., in a response to outrage in Washington over its Moscow embassy sex-spy scandal. Most of the devices apparently were found years ago, but the Soviets said gear disguised as window insulation in one of their Washington buildings was found recently.  The Senate passed a nonbinding resolution urging Shultz either to cancel next week's talks with Soviet officials or to find a secure place to hold them.
