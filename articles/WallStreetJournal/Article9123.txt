 Monthly Mutual Funds Review: An Agent for Change in Fund World --- It Had to Happen, Didn't It? `Jerry Maguire' Sets Sights On Star Stock-Pickers   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1999  On the other end of the phone, the executive haggles over Mr. (Ken) Phillips's fee as an agent. To bluff his way out of the deadlock, Mr. Phillips coolly says, "Maybe we should just postpone signing my guys for a week or so." The executive, eager to conclude the pact, accedes to Mr. Phillips's demands: A fixed agent's fee and a share of the revenue his clients will generate.  With a style as unconventional as his choice in clientele, Mr. Phillips, 47 years old, wants to be the Jerry Maguire of the asset-management world, earning his pay as an agent by finding new gigs for his fund-manager clients. This is a radical idea in a staid industry in which many mutual-fund firms, already concerned about soaring salaries for their stock pickers -- and the potential for those who depart to trigger shareholder flight -- resist treating managers like stars.  Mr. Phillips recently wrapped up his first major deal. John Flynn, a client-service executive at Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management in San Diego, called on Mr. Phillips in February to work with him and three international stock-fund managers, Eswar Menon, John Tribolet and Alex Muromcew. By mid-July, Mr. Phillips, who made his bluff phone call during negotiations for these clients, had signed the team to manage international funds at the San Francisco office of Loomis Sayles, a subsidiary of Nvest LP. Loomis Sayles, a Boston-based asset-management firm, has since created a new international-stocks division around Mr. Phillips's clients.
