 Think the Deficit Is Bad Now? Just Wait.   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2006  The world is awash in money, keeping long-term interest rates remarkably low, despite the government's heavy borrowing and despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tighten credit. As long as that glut of money continues, and as long as foreign countries are happy to ship their excess savings to the U.S., why worry?  Don't be fooled by current talk about eliminating "pork" in Washington, for instance. Add up everything that looks like pork -- that is, projects placed in spending bills by individual congressmen to benefit their constituents -- and you'll only get about $27 billion. That's just 1% of the spending total.  So when will Congress finally get serious about cutting the deficit? There's no sign that it will happen soon. It could take a crisis of the sort mentioned above. Or it could take the expiration of President [Bush]'s tax rate cuts, now slated for 2010. When that day comes, members of Congress will get serious about tackling the big budget problems -- maybe.
