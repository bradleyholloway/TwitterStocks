 SmartMoney: Grads, Grab Loan Bargain   By Grant, Kelli B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2006  If you consolidate before July 1, you can lock in a fixed rate based on the current rates on your loans. Currently, variable interest rates on so-called Stafford Loans are 4.7% if you're in the "in- school" or "grace" period, and can be consolidated at 4.75%. Loans already in repayment carry rates of 5.3%, and can be consolidated at 5.375%. PLUS loans are 6.1%, and can be consolidated at 6.125%.  "The cost of being one day late is really expensive," says Patricia Scherschel, vice president of loan consolidation for Sallie Mae, a big student-loan consolidator. According to Sallie Mae, a recent graduate consolidating $20,000 in loans during his or her grace period could save $5,123 by doing so before July 1.  -- Boost monthly payments. Consolidating lowers monthly payments, but this short-term relief can cost you, says Robert Shireman, executive director for the nonprofit Project on Student Debt. That's because the payments are made for longer. Say you have $20,000 in Stafford Loans. Without consolidating, you'd pay $5,105 in interest over 10 years. If you consolidated under a 20-year term, the interest more than doubles, to $11,019.
