 Coffee Futures Rise Sharply as Strike In Colombian Port Stirs Supply Worries   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1997  Coffee for March delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 4.2%, to $1.2925 a pound on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange. During the trading day, the price of the active nearby contract hit a new high of $1.2950, more than two cents above the previous contract high set last April.  A port workers' strike entering its second week in the Colombian port of Buenaventura has halted the shipment of about 200,000 bags of green coffee beans, analysts said. The port, the country's main harbor on the Pacific coast, handles about 60% of Colombia's coffee exports. Further, the potential for a Colombian truckers' strike is compounding supply fears, analysts add. "We're in a tight situation," said Stephen Platt, commodities analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds. "With the prospects that coffee stocks could be drawn down further, we could see higher prices prevail through April or May."  Supply and distribution concerns have had a particularly strong effect as coffee stockpiles at the CSCE reversed unexpectedly last week. After several weeks of seasonal increases in coffee stocks, CSCE stocks fell unexpectedly last week by about 9,070 bags to 23,388 bags. Yesterday, after the market's close, the CSCE reported warehouse stocks fell another 1,025 bags to 22,363 bags. The Green Coffee Association's monthly figures showed a 63,000-bag increase last week for December, but that increase was judged as marginal by traders.
