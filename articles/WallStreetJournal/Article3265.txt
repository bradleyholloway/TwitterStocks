 Nasdaq Composite Index Hits Another Record; Captec Lease, Relm Wireless, Helen of Troy Drop   By By Thomas Granahan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1999  The session began as so many have recently -- with a surge in technology stocks. Bond yields, particularly important relative to high-multiple stocks, crept higher in the afternoon and knocked some of the wind out of Nasdaq. But it is tough to keep Nasdaq down right now, and the index quickly recovered.  The Nasdaq composite, up 71% coming into yesterday's session, gained 30.81, or 0.8%, to 3783.87. Nasdaq volume was 1.291 billion shares, compared with 1.528 billion Friday.  Shares of Captec Lease Realty, a real-estate investment trust based in Ann Arbor, Mich., fell 2 5/8 , or 27%, to 7 1/16, hitting a 52-week low of 6 3/4 intraday. The company will merge with its affiliates, Captec Financial Group and Captec Net Lease Realty Advisors, and will change its tax status to a C corporation from a real-estate investment trust. By moving to a C corporation, the company won't be required to distribute 95% of its income to shareholders.
