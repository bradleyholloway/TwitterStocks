 Hog Futures Tumble on New Fears of Oversupply   By By Howard Packowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2001  COCOA: Cocoa futures on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange deepened their corrective pullback following an impressive rally in the past month. The most-active March contract settled $36 lower at $1,271 a metric ton. While fundamentals continue to be supportive, participants said the fair amount of hedging this week, seen mostly in London, mirrors the increased pace of port arrivals in Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer. Trade sources said arrivals have been averaging about 70,000 tons a week, placing the cumulative figures about 100,000 to 150,000 tons ahead of the previous season.
