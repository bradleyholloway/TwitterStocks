 The Other Market Crisis   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2007  First, the delisting of foreign companies from U.S. markets leapt this year -- to 56 so far, up from 30 in 2006 and 12 a decade ago. Those 56 represented 12.4% of all listed foreign companies. In part, the jump is the result of an SEC rule change that lowered the bar for delisting. But don't take comfort in that. "Pent-up demand" to delist is still demand. Companies that maintain their listings only because they can't escape the SEC hardly signal confidence in U.S. markets.  To cite another example from the new report, since 2002 four out of five foreign companies that chose to raise capital in the U.S. through an IPO did so outside publicly traded exchanges. Instead they used what's known as the far more restricted Rule 144a offering. Ten years ago, more than half of these "Global IPOs" that came to the U.S. for part of their offering listed on a public exchange. But companies that go the Rule 144a route can only sell their shares to "qualified" investors, and thus those companies are not subject to Sarbox, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to strict liability in shareholder suits.
