 The Mossberg Solution: Sizing Up the Latest iPod Iteration; Apple Joins Rivals Offering Photo-Viewing With Music; Benefits of the Scroll Wheel   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2004  Last week, Apple released a souped-up version of its wildly popular iPod called the iPod Photo. Unlike earlier iPods, this new model has a vivid color screen and can store and display up to 25,000 photos. It retains the usual music storage and playback functions as well. You can view your photos on the iPod itself or on the screen of any TV that's handy, using a clever cable that comes with the new iPod.  If you're near a television, you can connect it to your iPod Photo using Apple's included AV cable, allowing multiple people to watch a slideshow on the TV screen at once. This cable hooks directly into the iPod's headphone jack or into the included iPod dock. We tried this with an old standard TV, and the pictures looked very good.  The iRiver H320 player is often praised on techie Web sites. But, in terms of simplicity and ease of use, it doesn't begin to compare to the iPod Photo. Physically, it's about the same size as the iPod, though slightly thicker, but that's where the similarities end. The H320's nine buttons frustrated us right away because they don't include a scrolling device like Apple's wheel that would have helped us move through long lists of songs or pictures within the player's vast hard disk.
