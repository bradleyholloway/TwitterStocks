 U.S. Unveils New Global Economic Plan --- IMF Would Assist Nations Hurt By Investor Panic Despite Sound Policies   By By Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  The (President) Clinton administration unveiled its plan to stanch the global economic crisis, including a new preapproved credit line for countries that fall victim to investor panic despite sound economic policies.  The key element is the new preapproved contingency fund under the International Monetary Fund, a proposal that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven major industrialized nations agreed to "explore" at their meeting Saturday night. The G-7 gave a warmer endorsement to U.S. calls for more multilateral lending to battle poverty and fix troubled banking systems, as well as a U.S. plan to use multilateral guarantees to encourage private investors to put their money back into emerging markets.  While other IMF loans require borrowing countries to agree to implement often-austere economic policies before they get loans, this new approach would be for countries whose policies the IMF judges to be sound already. But the idea appears to challenge the IMF's traditional insistence on strict conditions on its loans; without such conditions, the IMF and others have argued, IMF money may be wasted.
