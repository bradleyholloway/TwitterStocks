 World-Wide [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1992  The Russian president removed Gaidar, architect of Russia's radical economic reforms, ahead of next week's Congress of People's Deputies. Gaidar retains the post of deputy prime minister, however. Many Russian lawmakers have denounced Gaidar and his reforms, which have caused consumer prices to soar. But the reforms had pleased Western governments and international lending agencies, which this week pledged $24 billion to ease Russia's transition to democracy.  Vassily Barchuk, Gaidar's senior deputy adviser, was named as his successor. Barchuk is said to lack Gaidar's radical economic vision.  The Security Council demanded that Libya put a stop to attacks in Tripoli against embassies of nations that voted for U.N. sanctions against Libya. The violence erupted yesterday as youths sacked the Venezuelan Embassy, tried to storm Russia's mission and protested outside the Belgian, French and Italian embassies.
