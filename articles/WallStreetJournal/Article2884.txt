 GAO suggests taxpayers' time, money could be saved if IRS prepared returns   By Connor, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1996  The GAO said the federal government should study the feasibility of a system under which the IRS would prepare returns for taxpayers. The GAO report estimated that such a system could reduce the amount of time taxpayers spend preparing tax returns by as much as 155 million hours a year and could save millions of dollars in fees paid to commercial tax-return preparers.
