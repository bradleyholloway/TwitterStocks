 Private Properties   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 2002  EVEN THOUGH HE recently retired, Henry "Ric" Duques, is still accustomed to anticipating the movement of financial markets. Now it looks as if the former chief executive of First Data has finally conceded that New York's high-end real-estate market isn't what it used to be. He's lowered the price on his three-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot condo on Park Avenue to $3.995 million. Mr. Duques bought the apartment, located upstairs from four-star French restaurant Daniel, for a little less than its $4.25 million asking price. A few months later, he discovered two of his 22-year-old triplets were planning to move to Manhattan, and figured he would have to find something bigger. He put this apartment on the market at $4.4 million -- which would have made for a nice flip if he'd gotten the asking price. But with 2003 approaching and the apartment still unsold, the 9% drop in the asking price makes sense, says Michele Kleier of Gumley Haft Kleier, who sold the apartment to Mr. Duques. Alice F. Mason Ltd. has the new listing.
