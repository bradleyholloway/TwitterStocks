 Apartment-Unit Portfolios Grow   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2002  A study expected to be released next Tuesday by the National Multi Housing Council shows that the 50 largest apartment owners increased their apartment holdings by 6% in 2001, from a 3% rise in 2000. For the year, they collectively owned 2.77 million apartment units, about 17% of the total national stock, up from an 11% share 10 years ago for the top 50.  Equity capital remained scarce for publicly traded apartment real-estate investment trusts, putting a lid on their growth. Despite that, there was one big merger -- between Archstone Communities Inc., of Englewood, Colo., and Arlington, Va.-based Charles E. Smith Residential Realty Inc. in May -- in a stock deal valued at $2.2 billion.
