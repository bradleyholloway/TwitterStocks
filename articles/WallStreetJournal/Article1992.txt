 Letters to the Editor: Oil Spill: Who's Really to Blame?   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  Mr. Rawl stated, "We believe that Exxon has moved swiftly and competently to minimize the effect this oil will have on the environment, fish and other wildlife." Where is he getting his information? During the first three days, little was done to contain the spill. The level of inefficiency of the cleanup contingent quickly became apparent. Lack of equipment, manpower and communication hampered efforts. Next, a turn of bad weather put an end to ill-fated efforts.  Exxon now is letting the captain of the Exxon Valdez take the entire blame for the disaster. Exxon is to blame. It knowingly had a captain in command of its largest vessel who had convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol. Yes, this man should be punished, but so should Exxon. We as a nation should hold it fully accountable for its lack of sound judgment.  Before oil exploration and drilling were permitted, Exxon and other oil companies had to show to the state of Alaska proof of personnel and equipment to be available in the event of a spill. They did a pretty good job at the time of convincing everyone they were ready. The reality is, due to cutbacks and layoffs, Exxon had no one capable of coordinating the effort and no equipment available. How dare Exxon officials lie to the people of Alaska? How dare they be allowed to destroy the last natural environment in North America?
