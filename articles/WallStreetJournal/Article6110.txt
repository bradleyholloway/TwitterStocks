 Diminishing Returns: A Tax Maneuver In Delaware Puts Squeeze on States --- Trademark-Holding Companies Help Limited, Many Others Save Millions of Dollars --- One Address for 670 Firms   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 9, 2002  For example, the retail operations of Toys "R" Us pay millions of dollars in "licensing fees" to a Delaware subsidiary called Geoffrey Inc. for the right to use the Toys "R" Us name on signs outside stores. And Home Depot stores direct royalties to a Delaware-based holding company called Homer TLC Inc., which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Home Depot Inc.  DCM also provides the holding companies with contract corporate officers and auditors so that firms don't need to incur the expense of putting anyone on their own payroll. Former DCM president Edward J. Jones, a certified public accountant who helped sign up Limited, has served as an outside director for hundreds of Delaware holding companies, according to a case Massachusetts tax authorities successfully brought against clothing retailer Syms Corp., another Jones client. Mr. Jones, who is retired, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.  Limited enlisted a Wilmington lawyer, Louis S. Black Jr., to serve on the boards of its Delaware subsidiaries. Mr. Black, a well-known authority on Delaware corporate law, charged $50 for every board meeting he attended. The meetings were conducted at his own law firm, Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnel, across the street from DCM's offices.
