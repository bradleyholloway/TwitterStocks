White in Moscow   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2006  "It's a test case of not just the U.S. relationship with Russia, but the developed world's relationship with Russia," said Coit "Chip" Blacker, who was a top Russia expert in the Clinton administration. "There's very deep and fundamental concern about Russia's trajectory."  Assuming trade negotiators resolve their sticking points, the issue for U.S. lawmakers won't technically be whether Russia should join the WTO, but whether they are prepared to end Cold War-era economic restrictions -- imposed under the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendments -- and establish permanent normal trade relations with Russia. As a practical matter, the vote is certain to become a referendum on Moscow, since failure to extend normal trade relations with the U.S. would deny Russia a big benefit of joining the WTO.  "I've been one of those who have pushed for trade, and have been burned by China," said Sen. Gordon Smith.
