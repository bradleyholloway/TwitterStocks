 Entertainment Firms Target Gnutella   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  Napster has had discussions in recent weeks with Microsoft Corp., though a Napster spokeswoman said they involved using Microsoft software in future versions of the Napster service.  Napster has always been a relatively easy legal target, since it is a corporation and runs its own computers. That's not the case, though, with the "peer to peer" software system known as Gnutella, in which individual PCs connect to each other directly without the need for a central server. Gnutella was written last year by Justin Frankel, an employee of America Online Inc., who friends say developed the program in anticipation of the day Napster would be shut down. While AOL was embarrassed by Gnutella, and forced Mr. Frankel to stop working on it, use of the software has spread. A number of increasingly popular software packages, like Lime Wire and BearShare, are based on Gnutella, and Sun Microsystems Inc. recently bought another company, InfraSearch, using Gnutella-type software.
