 BUSINESS & RACE   By By Leon D. Wynter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1999  AFRICAN-AMERICANS drive 46% of all BMWs in New York, according to marketing research. And the No. 1 radio station among blacks in the same market is WRKS Kiss-FM. But don't expect to hear any Beemer ads on the "classic soul" station. Even an upscale brand of yogurt refuses to buy Kiss, says station manager Judy Ellis, because, it told her, its listeners didn't make the $75,000 household income cut.  With the backing of Kiss owner Emmis Communications, the nation's No. 8 radio chain, Ms. Ellis is crusading to change the inequities of air-time buyers. And she is willing to name companies, including BMW, Saab, Audi and American Airlines. She once wrote a letter of complaint to the governor of New Jersey when a state-chartered science park declined to buy Kiss last year.  BMW says it very rarely uses radio, period, making only one small New York buy in 1998. American says it also uses no radio in the New York market, though it did buy black and Hispanic stations in Chicago and Dallas. Both companies say they buy space in some black and Hispanic magazines.
