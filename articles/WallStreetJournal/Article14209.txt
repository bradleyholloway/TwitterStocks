 Dole Wants Income Of Any New Taxes Used to Cut Deficit   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1986  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said that revenue raised from any new taxes should be used to reduce budget deficits rather than to finance lower rates in a tax-revision package.  Opponents of tax overhaul, such as Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R., Minn.), think they can block the controversial measure by postponing it until a deficit-reduction package is agreed upon. Other lawmakers who want to deal with the deficit first, such as Chairman Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) of the Senate Budget Committee, want to prevent the tax-overhaul bill from pre-empting any new taxes for use in the fight against deficits.  Depriving the tax-overhaul bill of revenue from new taxes could be devastating. There is a growing realization among members of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee that a new source of revenue outside of the income tax likely will have to be found if the overhaul package is to succeed.
