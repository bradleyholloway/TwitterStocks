 Takeovers Aren't Likely to Sweep Europe --- But Battle for B.A.T May Nudge Companies to Hasten Restructuring   By By Philip Revzin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  Sir James Goldsmith may be running into roadblocks as he tries to take over Britain's B.A.T Industries PLC. But had he tried his hostile leveraged buy-out elsewhere in Europe, he probably never would have gotten started.  Indeed, despite predictions that takeover fever would sweep the continent in the wake of Sir James's bid for B.A.T, there are plenty of reasons why it won't, at least not for a while. For one thing, hostile takeovers, let alone ones involving huge debt that can be repaid only by selling assets, are still largely anathema. And the few European raiders -- like Italy's Carlo De Benedetti, who launched a hostile assault last year on Societe Generale de Belgique -- have usually had their wings clipped. Governments' inclination to intervene and limits on shareholders' rights in several countries ensure that.  And there will be merger activity -- some of it unfriendly -- as European companies prepare for the European Community's planned barrier-free internal market after 1992. Already, mergers and acquisitions activity on the continent has picked up over the past two years, and such techniques as leveraged buy-outs have begun appearing. But much of this restructuring is likely to take the form of alliances, joint ventures or friendly takeovers rather than aggressive, debt-financed raids, businessmen say.
