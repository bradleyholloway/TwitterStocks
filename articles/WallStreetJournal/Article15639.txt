 Some Fitness Plans Designed By People Who Actually Do Them   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1998  National Institutes of Health Director Harold Varmus, intimidatingly lean at 58 years old, is following a rigorous regimen of cycling, running and rowing and squash.  "Cycling is definitely the staple. I bike to work 12 miles," he says, explaining he has the necessary luxury of a shower in his NIH campus building. After wiping out on an icy street last winter, he may take a winter bike hiatus, but he says Washington's humid summers are no excuse.  In the jockopolis of Silicon Valley, T.J. Rodgers, president and chief executive officer of Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of San Jose, is famous for jogging in American-flag running shorts. The 49-year-old executive doesn't plan to vary his fitness routine in 1998, except that he now favors sober sweatsuits with his chip company's logo.
