 Large Investors Lift Chinese Shares; Shanghai Rises 2.6%, but Volatility Could Be the Norm   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2007  China's market appears to have entered a volatile period. Despite finishing higher yesterday, the Shanghai Composite Index swung in a 10% range between its lowest and highest points during the session. And while many investors appear to be holding tight, they also are waiting for Beijing's next steps.  "The correction must have exceeded the regulator's expectations. Beijing clearly doesn't want to see a big fall of the stock market, which may cause large financial losses and spur social unrest," said Chen Huiqin, at Huatai Securities.  Before starting its slide last week, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up more than 50% since the start of the year, and the stock market's surge has largely been attributed to individual investors piling into the market.
