 Eaton Corp. Names Butler President, Operating Chief; Rankin to Join Nacco   By By Gregory Stricharchuk and Ralph E. Winter, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1989  Alfred M. Rankin Jr., 47 years old, who has been Eaton vice chairman and chief operating officer since 1986, is leaving the company to join Nacco Industries Inc., a company less than a quarter the size of Eaton, which last year earned $212 million, or $6.11 a share, on sales of $3.5 billion. For many years the Rankin family has had major holdings in Nacco.  A source close to Eaton indicated that the switch was a board decision rather than a move initiated by Mr. Rankin. Mr. Rankin couldn't be reached for comment.  Ward Smith, chairman, chief executive and president of Nacco, said in an interview he invited Mr. Rankin more than a year ago to join Nacco as president. "I feel that it is appropriate for a well-run corporation to have an obvious successor to the chief executive." Mr. Smith said that at age 58 he has no immediate intent to retire, but believes that Mr. Rankin will make a contribution at Nacco and is "an appropriate" successor.
