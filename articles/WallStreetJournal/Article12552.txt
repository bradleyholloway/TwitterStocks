 Stock Markets Urged to Start Trading Shares in Dollars, Cents by Labor Day   By By Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  Angered by the Nasdaq Stock Market's foot dragging, a bipartisan group of senior lawmakers is demanding that stock markets begin trading some shares in increments of dollars and pennies by Labor Day.  But last month, NASD threw in a wrench, claiming it wouldn't be ready for so-called decimal trading until early next year. That infuriated SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and House Commerce Committee leaders, who had received a general commitment from the industry three years ago for the shift to pennies. Back in 1998, proponents agreed to delay the change until this year to give securities firms and markets a chance to complete massive Y2K computer-system upgrades.  "No country in the developed world other than the United States continues to trade stock in these increments. It is inexcusable that the SEC continues to allow this `price fixing' to remain as normal practice," said Rep. Thomas Bliley (R., Va.), who heads the Commerce Committee. Separate letters were sent to the SEC, NASD and the New York Stock Exchange and signed by Reps. Bliley, Michael Oxley (R., Ohio), and Edward Markey (D., Mass.).
