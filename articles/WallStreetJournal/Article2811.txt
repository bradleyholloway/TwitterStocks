 Big Photo Retailer To Offer Service On the Internet   By Bounds, Wendy, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1996  Much like consumers can order flowers on-line, they will now be able to order and send photographs as well. Wolf Camera & Video, which has more than 200 stores and is based in Atlanta, has teamed up with some powerful photo industry partners such as Japan's Konica Corp. to make consumer's photographs accessible through [Wolf]'s Internet home page; Konica has its own national group of photofinishing labs that will work with Wolf. People close to the venture, which could be announced as soon as today, say Eastman Kodak Co. is expected to join the group in several months, bringing on board its enormous photofinishing operation, Qualex Inc.
