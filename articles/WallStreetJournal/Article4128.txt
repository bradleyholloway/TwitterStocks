 Asia: Philippine Election Turns Into a Horror Show   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1986  Jaime Opinion, a member of the Philippine Commission on Elections, or Comelec, was asked if the slow vote count and reports of fraud hadn't damaged his group's credibility. Mr. Opinion agreed that Comelec had doubters, but blamed its woes on false reports by the foreign media. Hearing that, Filipinos nearby started booing and broke into chants of "Cory, Cory." Viewers could hear the chants until the broadcast microphone suddenly, and conveniently, went dead.  President Ferdinand Marcos may be winning the official vote in his race against Corazon "Cory" Aquino, but he's losing the contest for Philippine public opinion. That doesn't bode well for the legitimacy of the Marcos government, for Philippine stability, or for U.S. interests in Asia. Indeed, if the weekend's trends hold and are made final this week, the big winner will be the extreme left, which boycotted the vote and has quickly seized on the dubious results to try to discredit any opposition save its own program of violent revolution.  Mr. Marcos may well have won anyway, but the key issue is what Filipinos believe and will tolerate. With two vote counts proceeding, one by Comelec and another by Namfrel, Mr. Marcos and government TV then tried publicly to discredit Namfrel, accusing its volunteers of cheating. As Mr. Marcos put it, incredibly, at his Saturday press conference, "When you see a nun trying to grab the ballot box, then an illegal act is being committed." Any Comelec count will now be hard to believe.
