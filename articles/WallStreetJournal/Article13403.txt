 Getting Going: Why Aiming for Average Has Its Own Genius   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  This isn't a column criticizing the new "fundamental" indexing. In fact, I think it is a fairly clever idea. The notion originated with Pasadena, Calif., money manager Robert Arnott and it has since been taken up by others, notably Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.  Still, I like fundamental indexing's emphasis on stock-market noise. It's an appealing way to explain the historical outperformance of value stocks generally and fundamental indexing in particular. In fact, the noise explanation strikes me as more convincing than the claim, favored by some, that value shares outperform because they are somehow riskier.  The May 6 "Getting Going" column incorrectly stated that the notion of fundamental indexing originated with Pasadena, Calif., money manager Robert Arnott. While Mr. Arnott has produced perhaps the best- known research on the topic, he wasn't the first to advocate the strategy.
