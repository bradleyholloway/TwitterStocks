 Puget Sound P&L Has 4th Quarter Loss After Charge on Plant   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1985  BELLEVUE, Wash. -- Puget Sound Power & Light Co., as expected, posted a $10.2 million net loss in the fourth quarter after a one-time charge to reduce its investment in the mothballed Skagit/Hanford nuclear plant.  A Puget Sound spokesman also said Coopers & Lybrand, its outside auditing firm, will qualify its opinion of Puget Sound's 1984 financial statements because it's unclear how much the utility will recover of the $175 million it invested in the Skagit/Hanford project and in Pebble Springs, another abandoned plant. Coopers & Lybrand also qualified its opinion of Puget Sound in 1983, citing the same reasons.
