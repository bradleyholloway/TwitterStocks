 This Picnic Tradition Is Still on Target, Though It's All Wet --- Bosses Say Getting Dunked Builds Morale and Provides A Chance to Loosen Up   By By Shella P. Calamba, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1996  They are served hot dogs, hamburgers, beer, plus a special treat -- a chance to send their bosses plunging into the dunk tank, a contraption whose key component contains 500 gallons of cold water.  For workers such as Mr. Fredianelli, it is a chance to get back for a year of slights, real and imagined. Most children at Southwest Beer's picnic take a few throws and then retreat to other games. But their parents hang around taking aim at their favorite supervisor. At some company picnics, employees dump ice cubes into already-cold water, and aren't content with dunking the boss just once.  Bosses see it as a chance to show they can loosen up. "CEOs tend to get a little stuffy," says Michael Hennessy, president and chief executive officer of Lovejoy Inc., a suburban-Chicago maker of power-transmission components. That doesn't appear to be a problem for Mr. Hennessy. He showed up for dunk duty at his company picnic last year wearing a tutu.
