 GM Is Holding Talks With Britain's BL On Buying Part of Leyland, Other Lines   By By Craig Forman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1986  General Motors Corp., continuing its efforts to expand in Europe, is in an "advanced stage" of talks on buying much of BL PLC's Leyland unit, British officials said.  The purchase would mark a significant new step in Detroit-based GM's expansion in Europe, and would give it a much stronger toehold in the European truck market. Though the Leyland unit is unprofitable, analysts said GM might be able to unify and streamline the operations of Leyland trucks and GM's loss-ridden Bedford unit in the U.K.  GM's current share of the European heavy-truck market is only 3%, analysts said. That would more than double with the purchase of Leyland trucks. In addition, if GM could use its operations elsewhere in Europe to market Leyland trucks, it could become a more forceful challenger to such market leaders as Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany, the Iveco unit of Fiat S.p.A. of Italy and Regie Nationale des Usines Renault of France.
