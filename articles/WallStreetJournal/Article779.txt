 Experimental Appeals Court Measure Is Approved by Senate Judiciary Unit   By By Andy Pasztor and Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 1986  The Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would create an experimental appeals court, long advocated by Chief Justice Warren Burger to ease the Supreme Court's burgeoning workload.  But in a strange twist that threatens the measure's chances of getting through Congress, the committee narrowly approved an amendment to strip the Supreme Court's authority to appoint judges to the proposed new court. As a result, Chief Justice Burger said he intends to oppose the entire bill.  The chief justice has pushed hard for a new court despite resistance from the American Bar Association and many federal appeals court judges. In the past two weeks, he personally lobbied a number of members of the Judiciary panel to express his interest in the bill and his concern over the selection process for judges.
