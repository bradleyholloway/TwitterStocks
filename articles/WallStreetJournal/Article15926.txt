 Emerson Hopes Division Fills Online Niche --- Fast-Growing Unit Helps To Protect Equipment From Electric Surges   By By Christina Cheddar, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2000  The unit supplies products that back up power supplied from utilities and smooths out the power stream, protecting sensitive electronic equipment from power surges. By the end of fiscal 2000 in September, Emerson expects its Power & Connectivity sales to total $4 billion on a pro forma basis and account for 26% of the company's revenue, said Emerson President James Berges.  The unit is the fastest growing segment of the St. Louis company's business, Mr. Berges said. In the fiscal second quarter, which ended in March, pro forma sales rose 33%. Emerson expects future revenue to rise 13% to 17% a year on a pro forma basis, Mr. Berges said.  "Lucent has said the power business will be sold," Mr. Berges said. He expects Emerson to be among the bidders when the Murray Hill, N.J., telecommunications-equipment provider starts taking offers for the business this summer.
