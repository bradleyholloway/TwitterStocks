 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Another Vietnam?   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1991  It now appears that nearly every phase of the war in the Gulf will undergo some level of internal domestic debate, which is probably not a bad thing. We will perhaps re-establish a functioning balance between the views of the political community and the U.S. public over America's proper role in the world and the means of carrying out that role.  The latest debate to emerge from this conflict is whether to defeat Saddam Hussein in a ground war against Iraq is necessary, now or ever. A collection of voices around Washington is now suggesting that President Bush should defer a ground war, or even abandon the idea in favor of letting air power alone finish Saddam's army. These voices worry that the cost in casualties of a ground war would be too high.  To us, what Senator Cohen and the rest are advocating sounds like a recipe for turning the Gulf conflict into another Vietnam. The air war in Vietnam, and the later ground campaigns as well, were run under a strategic doctrine then called "graduated response." The notion was that we would use our superior firepower to gradually turn up the heat until Ho Chi Minh cried uncle. This proved to be a strategic disaster, as Clausewitz would have predicted.
