 Churches' Role In Welfare Plan Stirs Debate   By By Jess Bravin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1998  But the proposal, which originated in a private meeting between Christian evangelical groups and state Department of Social Services officials, has drawn fire from other religious organizations. They worry that such an arrangement would amount to government endorsement, and public subsidy, of certain beliefs.  "We are deeply concerned that this will go around the wall separating church and state," says Adine Forman, a lobbyist for the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, which is trying to line up Lutheran and Catholic charities, among others, to fight the plan. Ms. Forman complains that "we weren't really included" in the discussions that led to the proposal, although her organization sponsors the Jewish Vocational Service, a $2.8 million agency that serves 6,000 clients in the Los Angeles area.  Under the proposal, organizations contracting "directly" with a county to provide welfare-to-work services as part of the CalWorks program may not demand participation in religious activities. But in accordance with the 1996 federal welfare-reform act, religious or nonsectarian organizations can also agree to provide such services in exchange for county-issued "vouchers." The organizations can then cash in the vouchers for public funds.
