 When It Comes to Prices, The South Is Rising Again   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1998  Throughout the Southeast, it seems, inflation is becoming an increasingly troublesome corollary to the region's nation-leading growth. Costs in 14 regional cities surveyed by West Chester, Pa.-based consultant Regional Financial Associates rose an average of 3% last year, compared with 2.3% in the 99 cities it studied nationwide.  In some cities, that could be happening already. Take high-growth Raleigh, where unemployment is a minuscule 2%. "This is one of the tightest labor markets in the whole country, and that means a tight housing market too," says Bob Leake, a site-location consultant in Raleigh. "So a lot of companies that are being recruited to move here are saying, `It's too expensive for us.'"  The Regional Financial report covers housing, utilities, food, insurance and transportation -- essentially the same basket of goods and services as the Commerce Department uses, except that Commerce doesn't measure inflation in individual cities. Patrick Howie, the economist who wrote the report, says much of the region's inflation is due to a shortage of workers in the fast-growing service sector.
