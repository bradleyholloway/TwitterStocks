 New Mall in Katy Offers Novel Test Of State's Work-Force Programs   By By Robert Elder Jr. and Renae Merle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  So Katy, 25 miles from Houston, was the perfect place for a new company initiative, called Mills Access to Training and Career Help, or Match, designed to help move welfare recipients into the work force. The idea is part altruism and part an effort to make sure the mall's retailers have an adequate supply of hard-to-find workers: The company would tap a variety of local, state and federal programs to provide welfare recipients with training, transportation and child care -- and, most important, a job that carries the promise of a better-paying position down the line.  Work-force experts say the Mills initiative is an unusually aggressive effort to marshal many welfare-to-work programs for a single job site -- and a possible model for future efforts to link welfare recipients with a large-scale employer. "We're trying to learn lessons about the programs government has and whether they can be tailored in a way to place more people in jobs," says Jim Dausch, senior executive vice president for Mills, an Arlington, Va., real-estate investment trust.  For the Katy Mills mall, which opened last week, Mills and local work-force officials have pulled together state job-training funds to pay to train workers for retail jobs, federal transportation funds to pay to shuttle workers to and from the mall and local work-force funds to provide child care and career counseling.
