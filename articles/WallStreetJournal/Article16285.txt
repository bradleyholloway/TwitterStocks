 Schwab Fees Steer Some Funds to the Exits   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  Not all fund firms have gotten an ultimatum from Schwab. Industry behemoths Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments say Schwab hasn't approached them seeking new fee payments to keep their products in the Schwab supermarket -- an apparent reflection of the importance of those fund giants to Schwab.  Some other fund firms that are unhappy about being asked to pay higher fees to Schwab still haven't resolved whether -- and how much -- they will pay to remain on the Schwab supermarket shelves. For instance, according to a list Schwab has given its client-service representatives, the Firsthand group of funds will soon become unavailable to most investors at Schwab. But that came as a surprise to Firsthand officials Friday.  Many fund companies find the ability of the Schwab supermarket to channel money to their funds is valuable enough that they can't afford not to pay up. But some funds, including ones from the Longleaf, Meridian and [Donald Yacktman] families, have decided against making new or higher payments to Schwab. As a result, they will no longer be open to most new investment at Schwab. [Schwab] says the funds becoming unavailable represent less than 1% of Schwab's total $144 billion in supermarket assets.
