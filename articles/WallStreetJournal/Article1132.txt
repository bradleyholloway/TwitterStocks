 Politics & Economics: Obama's 'Improbable Quest'; After Official Entry, His Task Is to Conquer Questions of Experience   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2007  "One of the narratives that's established itself in the mainstream media is this notion that, 'Well, you know, [Barack Obama] has a pretty good style. He can deliver a pretty good speech, but he seems to prioritize rhetoric over substance.' Now, factually that's incorrect," Mr. Obama said.  He said he has "the most specific plan" on leaving Iraq, gave major speeches on health, education and energy in the two years before he decided to run for president, and has two books giving more "insights into how I think and how I feel about the issues facing America than any candidate in the field." As for the press, he teased, "you've been reporting how I look in a bathing suit" -- referring to a photo taken while he visited Hawaii over the holidays.  Mr. [John Edwards] added to the pressure on Mr. Obama to be more specific with his recent unveiling of a health plan. But Democrats say Mr. Obama provoked the style-versus-substance talk himself, by his recent address to local Democratic Party leaders meeting in Washington, in which he seemed dismissive of "white papers" of policy specifics: "We've had a lot of plans, Democrats. What we've had is a shortage of hope."
