 Politics & Economics: Industries Show Uncertainty Over Ruling's Impact; Some Favor Regulation From Congress, Others From Federal Agencies   By Jeffrey Ball and Mike Spector, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2007  Limits on auto-emissions would add further urgency to the efforts of Detroit's Big Three auto makers to wean themselves from their dependence on gas-guzzling large vehicles amid massive losses. Limits on emissions from utilities could pressure those that rely heavily on coal, which supplies roughly half of U.S. electricity but is a major source of greenhouse gases. Oil producers, steelmakers, building- materials suppliers, airlines and other industries could be affected as well.  Industry groups generally said in response that any federal constraint should affect all sectors of the economy to spread the pain. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents utilities, said any regulation should be a "consistent, national program that sets reasonable emissions-reduction requirements for all sectors of the U.S. economy." Yet officials hastened to add that they "neither endorse nor oppose mandatory greenhouse-gas regulations." That reflects a split among utilities over a federal regulation.
