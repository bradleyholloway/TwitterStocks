 Gold Falls on News of Dutch Central Bank Sales   By By Janet Whitman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1999  Gold prices fell after the Dutch central bank said it intends to sell 300 metric tons of its gold reserves during the next five years.  The Dutch announcement added to the gloomy tone in the gold market, which has been on a steep downward curve since a poorly received Bank of England gold auction Nov. 29.  The Nederlandsche Bank announced it will sell 100 metric tons initially and an additional 200 metric tons during the next five years. After the sales are completed, the Netherlands' gold reserves will total 700 metric tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
