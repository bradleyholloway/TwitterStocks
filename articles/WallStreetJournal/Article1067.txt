 PURSUITS; Books -- Writer's Block: A Romantic Ex-Radical   By Mullen, Alexandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  University was more congenial. His tutor told him: "You won't learn any thing by my lectures Sir, so if you have any studies of your own you had better pursue them." And indeed he did. [Robert W. Southey]'s two interests were poetry and the radicalism wafting over the channel from the French Revolution. He and his friend [Samuel Taylor Coleridge] called themselves Pantisocrats and planned to start a utopian "republic of reason and virtue" on the banks of the Susquehanna River -- America being the place most conducive to such experiments. The plan fell through, although their fates were by now permanently linked. Southey and Coleridge married sisters, and Coleridge's racketty life meant that Southey housed and educated Coleridge's family along with his own.  In time, Southey's radicalism faded. He had rather liked calling himself a Jacobin, without much liking what they did. Robespierre's executions of the more moderate Girondists in Revolutionary France, and Napoleon's coup a few years later, helped propel him to the right. The next generation of British poets and political writers deplored what they saw as Southey's apostasy. Percy Shelley, who found him personally charming, despised him for the change: "He to whom Bigotry, Tyranny and Law was hateful has become the votary of those Idols."  Ironically, Southey's most anthologized work now is an antiwar poem he wrote back in 1798 commemorating the Battle of Blenheim nearly a century before. If this bloody episode in the War of the Spanish Succession is obscure to us, it was apparently only slightly less so to Southey's audience: "'It was the English,' Kaspar cried, / 'Who put the French to rout'; / But what they fought each other for / I could not well make out; / 'But everybody said,' quoth he, / 'That 'twas a famous victory.'"
