 Business and Finance [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1993  THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE remained at 7% in April as uncertainty about the economy and Clinton's tax and health proposals seemed to make employers leery about hiring. Businesses added 119,000 jobs-not enough to boost consumer spending and speed up the recovery, analysts said. The administration, which conceded it may have unwittingly slowed the economy, said the data show the need to expedite a budget plan.  Clinton health advisers decided to fold workers' compensation and medical-related auto insurance coverage into the pending health-care package in an effort to woo industry. But many business groups aren't satisfied.  Long-term bond prices fell after a rally that was sparked by sluggish jobs growth in April lost steam and traders focused on the Treasury's borrowing needs this week. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rose to 6.84%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 4.71 points to 3437.19.
