 Tax Increase Package of $9 Billion Backed by Reagan Clears Senate Panel   By By Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1987  The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved a $9 billion package of tax increases that largely meets with approval by the White House.  Before approving the package, the Finance Committee agreed to freeze the estate tax at 55% rather than letting it fall to 50% next year. Panel members earlier this week had considered dropping the freeze proposal because the White House strongly opposed it. But they decided to include it in the package after concluding that it alone wouldn't trigger a presidential veto.  Still, a tax bill approved by the House contains many other provisions that the Senate Finance Committee decided to drop to avoid a veto. House Democrats are determined to include the proposals, which would boost taxes on corporations and the rich, in the bill that will be sent to President Reagan. So the tax legislation, which was called for in the White House-congressional deficit-reduction accord, surely faces a contentious House-Senate conference.
