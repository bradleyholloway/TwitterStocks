 Politics & Economics: China's Investment Policy Stokes Foreign Concern   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2007  The trade imbalance has become a symbol of U.S. and European worries about China's economic rise and competition from its low-cost producers and has helped focus attention on China's hurdles to foreign trade and investment.  "I am worried about the direction of the investment climate," said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, noting a trend toward unequal treatment of foreign companies by Chinese regulators and scholars and politicians questioning the value of foreign investment. "Domestic lobbyists are working very strongly on the Chinese government to make foreign investment more difficult," he said.  Top Chinese leaders insist that the country remains open for business and that its regulatory changes will be in line with international practices. "I wish to reiterate that China's opening-up policy will definitely remain unchanged," Premier Wen Jiabao said in a speech last week to Chinese and foreign businesspeople, pledging "a more enabling environment to foreign companies."
