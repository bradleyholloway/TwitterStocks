 PURSUITS; Sports -- College Football: The New Big Shots of the Gridiron; Top Recruiters Are Now The Subject of Bidding Wars   By Adams, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2007  Mr. [John "Doc" Holliday] has spent most of his career forging ties with coaches and families in South Florida. Currently, one of the best high-school running backs in the country is Armando Allen, a senior at Hialeah- Miami Lakes. In the third quarter of a game this season in which Mr. Allen suffered a leg injury, an assistant coach at the high school received a text message from Mr. Holliday saying the injury had not diminished Florida's interest. Mr. Allen ultimately chose Notre Dame, but Mr. Holliday's move helped vault Florida into the top spot for awhile. Mr. Holliday, a 49-year-old former college linebacker, has only been at Florida since the 2005 season, so most of the team's starting lineup wasn't recruited by him. But Florida had Rivals.com's second-ranked recruiting class for 2006, and so far, for 2007 as well.  Penn State University's Larry Johnson, named the nation's top recruiter in 2006 by Rivals.com, started wearing a jacket and tie on recruiting trips to differentiate himself from his casually attired counterparts. Other tactics are more controversial. In late 2005, when it looked like highly touted quarterback recruit Mitch Mustain was leaning toward another school, University of Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt offered Mr. Mustain's high-school coach a job as Arkansas' new offensive coordinator. (National Collegiate Athletic Association rules forbid offering a high-school coach a job to land a recruit; Arkansas says the hiring wasn't motivated by its interest in Mr. Mustain.)
