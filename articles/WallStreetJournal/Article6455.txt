 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2005  A: This is a special deduction in calculating your adjusted gross income. (That's different from a tax credit, which is subtracted from your tax.) The deduction you asked about is known as the "clean- burning fuel deduction." It applies to people who buy vehicles that the IRS says meet certain qualifications. Latest to win IRS approval is the model year 2006 Toyota Highland Hybrid. "This one-time deduction must be taken in the year the vehicle is originally used," the IRS says. The taxpayer must be the original owner. "Individuals do not have to itemize deductions on their tax return to claim this deduction." This benefit can be taken as an adjustment to income on Form 1040.  The IRS offers another example: You donate cash to your city's police department to be used as a reward for information about a crime. "The city's police department is a qualified organization, and your contribution is for a public purpose." Thus, the IRS says, "you can deduct your contribution."
