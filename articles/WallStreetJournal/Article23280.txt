 Striving for Sensitivity Amid a Crisis; New Orleans Singer Appears In Red Cross Ads as ABC, Brown-Forman Pull Spots   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 2005  One radio spot features Mr. [Aaron Neville] saying: "Just because the weather map shows the storm is over, doesn't mean it's over." Producers had wanted to do a television spot featuring a recorded version of Mr. Neville singing "Amazing Grace," but that plan was scrapped when they couldn't get clearance for the song on short notice, according to a person familiar with the situation. Television ads that will be used include shots of people affected by the tragedy, with a voice-over saying, "Hope is stronger than a hurricane."  Brown-Forman's Southern Comfort finds itself having to tweak or cancel its advertising because its ads play up its New Orleans heritage and its sometimes-sybaritic culture. Southern Comfort was created in New Orleans, says Phil Lynch, a company spokesman, and about 18 months ago introduced the tagline "Born in New Orleans where anything can happen." At this time, however, the slogan "could be perceived as being insensitive, and that's the last thing we want to do," Mr. Lynch says.
