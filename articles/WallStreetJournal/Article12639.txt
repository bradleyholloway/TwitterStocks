After weeks of holiday goodies, you've resolved to eat right. At the Cooking School of the Rockies, the "Eating Smarter" program is taught by both a cooking instructor and a nutritionist. The class is from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., and the cost is $40. Other courses coming up include "Teens in the Kitchen," "Soup's on for Winter" and "Cooking with the Family."  Music conservatories and academies around the country often have adult continuing-education courses for musically minded adults. This course at the New England Conservatory, for instance, is a starter for adults with very little previous musical experience. Classes emphasize reading, rhythm, technique, ensemble playing and improvisation. Classes run from 6 to 7 p.m. Cost is $245 per person. The conservatory's School of Continuing Education also offers individual and group voice lessons as well as workshops for those interested in learning other instruments.
