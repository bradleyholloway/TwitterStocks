 Loews Profit Jumps Despite 11% Drop In CNA Earnings   By By Deborah Lohse, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1998  Loews, the New York holding company for Loews Hotels, Lorillard Tobacco, CNA Financial and Bulova, reported net income of $247.2 million, or $2.15 a diluted share, compared with $63.8 million, or 55 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. The improvement largely reflected the fact that Loews had investment losses of $212 million in last year's second quarter, compared with $11.3 million in net losses for this year's quarter.  Chicago-based CNA said a weak market for commercial products such as malpractice and workers' compensation insurance, and high catastrophe losses, contributed to its nearly 50% drop in operating profit, the measure by which analysts gauge insurers. CNA operating income, excluding capital gains or losses, fell to $64 million, or 33 cents a share, from $126 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. CNA revenue rose moderately to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billion.
