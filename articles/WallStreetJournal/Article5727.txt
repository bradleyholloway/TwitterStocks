Famous medical centers, unknown online start-ups and big media companies are all jockeying to create Web sites where consumers can find out about their health.  On Tuesday, drkoop.com Inc. raised $84.4 million in an initial public offering, making its co-founder, former U.S. surgeon general C. Everett Koop, a wealthy Web mogul at the age of 82. On the same day, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire said it had made a "significant investment" in PlanetRx.com, an online pharmacy and health-information service. Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim Clark, who founded Silicon Graphics and Netscape, is trying for his third home run with Healtheon Corp., now about to merge with WebMD Inc.  Roughly 22.3 million adults, or nearly 40% of American adults online, used the Internet to seek health-related information in 1998, says New York research firm Cyber Dialogue Inc.
