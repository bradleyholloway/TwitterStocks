 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1999  Several states have considered laws that would define and better control aggressive driving, but only a handful have them so far, says the National Conference of State Legislatures, Denver. Lawmakers say such statutes can be tough to define and enforce. Others develop ways to help handle the problem. Zurich U.S., a Schaumburg, Ill., unit of Zurich Financial Services Group, markets a defensive-driving program that includes screening drivers for road rage.  The publishing division of Unity School of Christianity, Unity Village, Mo., markets "The Peaceful Driver: Steering Clear of Road Rage," a self-help guide on audiotape or CD. And Leon James, a psychology professor at the University of Hawaii who calls himself DrDriving, says his educational materials can help achieve "a driving-personality makeover."  But Illinois, the largest pumpkin-producing state, is expected to have a good crop, says Mr. [Gary] Lucier. Ditto for third-ranked California. The USDA doesn't officially track pumpkins, but notes they have become attractive cash crops as fall festivals and farm outings have grown in popularity with families, says Mr. Lucier. In 1997, farmers harvested 74,354 acres of pumpkins -- nearly triple the 1982 amount. Still, with an estimated value of $150 million in 1997, pumpkins were far below, say, apples, which totaled $1.5 billion.
