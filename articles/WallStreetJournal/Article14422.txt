 Senate Panel Votes Farm Credit Bailout, Approves Forming New Market for Loans   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1987  The Senate Agriculture Committee authorized a $4 billion federal bailout of tottering Farm Credit System banks and approved the creation of a secondary market for agricultural loans.  The lawmakers approved the so-called Farmer Mac secondary market despite strong objections from the Reagan administration, which contends that it would intensify competition from private lenders for the best farm loans. The bill would enable commercial banks and insurance companies, as well as Farm Credit System banks, to pool farm loans and sell them as securities, just as home mortgages are sold on a secondary market.  Last month, the House adopted a similar farm-credit bill, including a secondary-market plan, but that bill would bail out banks with an appropriation of $2.5 billion in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1. The outlay would be offset by the sale of Farmers Home Administration assets. In subsequent years, funds would be authorized without such offsetting sales.
