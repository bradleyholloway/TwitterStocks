 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2005  A: It didn't become law. But don't give up hope. Major portions of that bill are still under active consideration. President Bush reiterated his support earlier this year for several new charitable- giving incentives. Among them is a provision that would permit "tax- free withdrawals from IRAs for charitable donations" in some circumstances.  President Bush didn't revive an earlier proposal to allow people who claim the "standard" deduction to deduct at least some of their charitable donations. A Treasury spokesman said this issue will be considered by the president's advisory panel on federal tax reform.  Charities are likely to be in the news this week. The Senate Finance Committee plans a hearing Tuesday on "Charities and Charitable Giving: Proposals for Reform." Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the committee, says he'll call for legislation combining the president's charitable-giving incentives with measures to attack problems with charitable giving and governance.
