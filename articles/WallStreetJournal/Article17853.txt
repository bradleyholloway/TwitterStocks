 A Telescope in Space May Get a Nice View Of the Dawn of Time --- But NASA Must First Put It Into Orbit and Keep It From the Fate of a Meteor   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1988  The scientists won't see the very beginning of time, but they will see stars and galaxies as they existed 14 billion years ago. That's how long light from the most distant of those stars takes to reach our planet. It's also a scant billion years or so after the big bang -- the monumental explosion of fiery gases that astronomers theorize created the universe and started cosmic clocks ticking.  In June of next year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration intends to launch the telescope above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere. From there it will beam back pictures of stars and galaxies that are invisible from the ground. Scientists comparing these primordial objects (long since dead perhaps) with younger ones closer to home may be able to trace how the universe has evolved and better predict its future. Lennard Fisk, who heads NASA's space-science program, calls the telescope project "one of the premier science missions of the century."  The success of the scheme will depend, of course, on whether the telescope ever gets into the sky and stays there. A frustrated NASA has spent $1.5 billion building the machine and is five years behind schedule in launching it. All the telescope has seen so far is the inside of a California warehouse, where it piles up storage and maintenance bills of $8 million a month. And the eventual launch is fraught with peril. NASA must plan everything very carefully. Among possible mishaps: Sunspots could cause the telescope, which weighs 12 tons and is 43 feet long, to plunge to Earth like a meteor.
