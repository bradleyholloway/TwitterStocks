 Hedge Fund amd its Founder Take Different Paths at Citi   By David Enrich and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2007  Citigroup's goal was to use Old Lane and its well-regarded management team to jump-start the New York bank's small alternative- investments business. Mr. [Vikram Pandit] and Old Lane's other founders, meanwhile, said that being part of a giant bank would help them attract fresh capital.  Mr. Pandit was instrumental in raising money for Old Lane and devising its strategy, which focused largely on investments in emerging markets like India. But he hasn't played an active role in the fund's daily operations since at least early this summer, when he took the helm of Citigroup's alternative-investments unit. In October, he was promoted to oversee a new division that included the alternatives business and Citigroup's giant investment bank, further distancing him from Old Lane.  After coming under the Citigroup umbrella, Old Lane seemed positioned to expand. Citigroup executives said the company would use its Smith Barney retail brokerage and its private bank, which caters to wealthy investors, to steer new investments to Old Lane. That hasn't happened, but it isn't clear if Citigroup scrapped those plans or simply hasn't implemented them yet.
