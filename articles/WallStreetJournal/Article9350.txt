 Big Auto Makers Brace for Waves Of Used Cars   By By Sholnn Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  Last year, GM certified just 30,000 vehicles, under 10% of GM's monthly new-car sales. To entice more dealers to participate in the program, GM reduced a $2,500 enrollment fee to $499 and cut out a $1,000 annual renewal fee altogether. "We made it a little harder than it had to be, and dealers were turned off," says Jeffrey Heichel, GM's director of used-vehicle activities.  Chrysler executives insist on touting the used vehicles in the same ads as new vehicles, hoping, for instance, that the rugged image of a brand like Jeep will appeal even to used-car buyers. "Used vehicles should be integral to the brand," Mr. [Ray Fisher] says. "This isn't about a new Jeep or a used Jeep. It's about Jeep."  Chrysler officials are hard at work on ideas to turn the heads of younger buyers who can't afford a new Jeep. One possibility: bolting on features such as cool wheels or stereos. But Mr. Fisher cautions that Chrysler doesn't "just want to resort to tricking up vehicles." He argues that, even with a mass-market brand like Chrysler, the reassurance of a factory warranty should attract buyers who otherwise might opt for a cheaper new car instead of a used Chrysler model.
