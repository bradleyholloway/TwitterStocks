 Jefferson Smurfit Expects to Post Profit Above Estimates but Below 1995 Pace   By By Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1996  Jefferson Smurfit Corp. believes it exceeded analysts' earnings estimates for the third quarter, although lower paper prices still indicate sharply lower net income than it posted a year earlier.  James E. Terrill, president and chief executive officer of the St. Louis maker of paper products, said in an interview that he expects the company to post per-share earnings that are "three to six cents over" analysts' recent consensus expectations of 13 cents.  In contrast to last year's booming performance, paper makers have been hurt in 1996 by falling prices in some key products. Jefferson Smurfit has been hit particularly hard by lower prices for corrugated boxes. That sector, which Mr. Terrill calls "the brown side of the business," represents about half of Jefferson Smurfit's sales.
