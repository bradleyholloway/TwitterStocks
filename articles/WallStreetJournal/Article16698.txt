 Love & Money: Update: Annuities, Eating Out and the Cave   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  Mom called me from the banker's desk to tell me about what sounded like a great deal to her. I told her the risks and that in her situation it was a terrible idea. She hung up, but then called back when the banker's spiel continued. She put the banker on the phone, and I told him to back down because this annuity was entirely inappropriate for my mom's situation.  The costs add up: We typically spend a lot more at a restaurant than we ever would making meals at home. But it's more than the costs that worry us. It's also the calories. Restaurant portions these days exceed excessive, made even worse by the relatively unhealthy fare that fills most restaurant menus. Even the salads are gargantuan. We don't leave restaurants feeling satisfied. We leave feeling stuffed.  It was [Amy]'s idea, and it took me a while to get on board. And, honestly, I still feel cheap when we announce that we're just going to split the meal. But once you move past the guilt, it isn't such a bad plan. Our dinner tab has fallen by about $15 to $20 a pop -- a not-so- trivial amount when you're eating out as much as we do -- and the added benefit is that we leave feeling like we've had the perfect-size meal.
