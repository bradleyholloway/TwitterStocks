 How Corporate Fliers Win VIP Treatment   By By Asra Q. Nomani, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1998  It's just after dawn and the long line is already almost out the door at the Continental Airlines ticket counter at Newark Airport. Weary business fliers in trench coats inch forward with the usual hordes of vacationers.  Suddenly, an anonymous-looking couple arrives as if they own the place. Jane and Robert Klein swoop past a phalanx of blue ropes to a special check-in counter, adorned with red carnations. There, an eager Continental agent handles their arrangements. "It's like I'm somebody important," says Mrs. Klein, a computer programmer for Lucent Technologies Inc.  In the new pecking order of the airline industry, she is important. After years of giving business fliers mostly lip service, airlines are dishing out some generous perks for the entire traveling staff of some companies. While the motive is to win more corporate clients, thousands of business travelers from places like AT&T, Hewlett-Packard and Johnson & Johnson are getting a glimpse of the good life -- separate check-in lines in some cases, free limo services and special airline seating. Got a problem with a lost bag? No problem, some airlines will assign a special agent to the case. Need to change a ticket at the last minute? The usual $75 fee won't apply.
