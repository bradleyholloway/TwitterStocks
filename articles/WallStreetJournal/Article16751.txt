 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2007  "Pretty much everything is back to where it was," says Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Richard Koss. "It was a selloff -- buy it!"  It's worth remembering that markets behaved this way in the late 1990s. Back then, a ferocious dip-buying mentality drove U.S. stocks higher. Now it's a world-wide phenomenon that extends to all kinds of assets.  Investors have seen markets bounce back from scares in 2005 about auto debt and in 2006 about "carry trades" -- borrowing money in low- interest countries and investing it elsewhere. So confidence in the market's shock absorbers is high and growing.
