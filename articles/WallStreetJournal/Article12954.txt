 S.O.S. Africa   By de Waal, Alex, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2003  The negotiating team is led by a retired Kenyan general on behalf of the north-east African regional grouping, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. That is in turn supported by a number of "friends," notably an informal troika of the U.S., Britain and Norway (which have divided the diplomatic tasks between them). The Egyptian government is engaged and has been brought in at critical moments. The Swiss took the lead in negotiating a ceasefire in one specific area of the country, the Nuba Mountains, a ceasefire that is now monitored by an international team headed by a Norwegian. A parallel ceasefire in the South is monitored by an American team. The World Bank and IMF have been called upon to advise the economic aspects of the draft agreement. Should the peace agreement be signed, the U.N. will play a key role in monitoring various aspects of it.  The U.S. has learned once again that it cannot ignore the crises posed by long-running civil wars and collapsing states. It is groping toward a new, pragmatic approach to diplomatic and military intervention, which holds out hope for snatching remedies. These remedies will not be quick or cost free. But the U.S. can maximize its chances of success by investing in the much-derided capacities of multilateral organizations, including the United Nations and African Union.  History shows that for conflict-prone regions -- such as Europe and East Asia half a century ago -- the security umbrella extended by U.S. leadership can provide the space for fragile countries to focus on rebuilding infrastructure and establishing democratic governance. Africa, facing no external threats, is asking for less: just the minimum security guarantees so that a modicum of stability can return. The U.S., working with Europe, the U.N., and Africa's own nascent regional organisations, can surely provide this.
