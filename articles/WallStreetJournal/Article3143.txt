 Long-Maturity Issues Rise, Shorter Ones Fall, As Expectations for Another Fed Rate Cut Fade   By By Matthew Newman and Steven Vames, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1998  In trading late yesterday, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 11/32 point, or $3.44 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 100 4/32. Its yield fell to 5.233% from 5.256% late Wednesday, as bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.  The Fed has cut the federal-funds rate 0.75 percentage point in the past three months because of concerns that turmoil in emerging markets would derail the sevenyear expansion of the U.S. economy. After Russia effectively defaulted on its domestic debt in August, investors became increasingly risk-averse and credit conditions deteriorated drastically.  But since the Fed's surprise inter-meeting easing Oct. 15, demand has returned to the corporate bond, mortgage-backed securities and similar markets. In addition, the stock market has rallied to within a few percentage points of its precrisis level in July. Following Wednesday's 54.83-point gain, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just slightly higher yesterday, rising 14.94 points.
