 Sirenza, Benchmark, Sontra Medical Increase   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2003  Indeed, after a rapid ascent, returns for small-cap "growth" mutual funds fell 2.5% in September, according to Lipper. That's more than the 2% drop posted by the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks during the same period.  "It is these smaller growth companies we expect to see benefit most from the economy's acceleration because it will greatly assist their earnings," said James Furey, head of Lehman's small-cap group who oversaw the survey.  Mr. [Randy Watts] offered a caveat, saying gains for the small tech stocks may not be as torrid as they were earlier in the year. "I feel a lot of the good news about an anticipated improved economy is priced in, so we're in the seventh inning of the game for these stocks because a lot of profit growth is already factored in," he said. Also, the companies are so small in some cases, their success is riding on one or two products and a lack of fruition can be catastrophic.
