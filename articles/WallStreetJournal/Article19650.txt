 Jones, Polo Relationship Unravels in Court   By By Sally Beatty and Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2003  Polo fired back with its own breach of contract lawsuit yesterday. In a complaint filed in State Supreme Court of New York, Polo wants to affirm that its licensing agreements with [Jones] for two Polo lines, Ralph and Lauren, both are set to end Dec. 31, not three years later, as Jones contends.  Polo, run by founder Ralph Lauren, is a preeminent designer brand for department stores, and has expanded from its men's and women's wear beginnings into paints, furniture, fragrance and housewares. In the mid-1990s, Polo signed Jones, a moderate women's apparel company, to make its mid-priced women's lines. Since then, Jones has grown into the nation's second-largest apparel company through acquisitions such as Nine West. Without Polo, however, it has no marquee designer name to give its stock sizzle with retail investors.  The Polo jeans business, also licensed by Jones, isn't named in the current litigation. But even before the lawsuits were filed, Jones had been negotiating to sell the Polo jeans business back to Polo, according to two people familiar with the talks. These people say the boards of both companies had agreed Polo would buy the jeans license for more than $300 million in cash. However, in recent days, Jones backed off the deal after calculating that it would be saddled with a hefty tax bill. As a result, those talks also broke off.
