 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Urban Therapy   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1992  A city is a terrible thing to waste. But people who live or work in many cities around the U.S. are familiar with news reports about urban financial distress. Governments in the U.S. today are trying to do everything -- educate kids, provide welfare, provide services, keep the infrastructure intact. It's a big, probably impossible assignment, and budgets are imploding.  The people who run local businesses often get asked to serve on task forces seeking solutions, but without pre-existing models it's sometimes hard to know where to start. We've previously discussed in this space the story of Ecorse, Michigan, which privatized almost everything. There is bankrupt Bridgeport. Now there is Scranton.  It's shunning the "B" word, but this Pennsylvania city is effectively bankrupt. Like many cities, Scranton lacks the political will to tackle its problems, but it's inviting the state in to clean house under a "distressed cities" program. If the state agrees, it will appoint an administrator with the authority to reorganize the city's bloated government and even dictate the terms of labor contracts. Something like the shock therapy Scranton is seeking may be necessary if other cities are going to abandon the outdated management and employment practices that are a major cause of their decline.
