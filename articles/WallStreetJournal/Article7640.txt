 Law Is Already Squeezing Immigrant Domestic Help   By By Robin G. Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1987  Two groups on whom the new immigration law promises to have a significant impact are foreign household helpers and their employers.  Meanwhile, those who employ foreign workers in their homes -- to help with such tasks as cooking and cleaning or to care for children or elderly relatives -- will also feel the law's effects. Fees for documented workers have begun to soar, a reflection of the fact that those who employ illegal immigrants are now, like the employees themselves, subject to penalties for such violations.  "Now that employers are at risk, they're going to be much more careful about whom they hire," says Karren De Seve, a partner at Baumann & De Seve, a Philadelphia law firm that specializes in immigration law. By the same token, though, she expects that employers who have no ready alternative will continue to hire illegal immigrants on the chance that no one will find out. Indeed, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service says "there's very little likelihood we're going to canvass houses" for violations.
