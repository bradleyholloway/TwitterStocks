 Americas: Giving `Little Guys' a Better Deal in Debt Workouts   By By Mary Anastasia O'Grady, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 2003  If this effort succeeds, it will demonstrate a private-sector solution to a debt crisis. That would have enormous implications for IMF theology. "For the Argentine problem I think it's a very good way to resolve things," says Glenn Hubbard, former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. As to curing the IMF sprawl, "It's not a panacea but it is constructive because it's an indication that the private sector can work things out." In Mr. Hubbard's view reducing global financial instability requires an end to bailouts and a greater willingness on the part of the private sector to solve its problems. "We have to put the burden back on the private sector."  Anyone with two brain cells to rub together can see the troubles that are almost certain to arise from an IMF bankruptcy court. Its raison d'etre would be that familiar IMF refrain about government's role where markets fail. Of course, this is the same line of thinking that gave us a string of mega-bailouts since 1995 and a moral-hazard problem that fertilized the current crop of bad Argentine bonds.  ABRA plans to contract with a negotiating team led by Adam Lerrick, an economist at Carnegie Mellon's Galliot Center and an adviser to the Joint Economic Committee. The team includes former Mexican finance minister Angel Gurria, Enrique Boilini who is an investment manager that specializes in Latin American securities, and Sanjay Srivastava, also an economist at Carnegie Mellon and an expert in valuation of securities. ABRA's goal is equal treatment for the retail investors it represents to that of institutional investors. It argues that its structure is superior to other proposals in that it will not be controlled or influenced by institutional investors who may have a conflict of interest when the Argentine pie is cut up.
