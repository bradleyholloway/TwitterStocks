 Mr. Reich, It's Not the Tea Partiers Who Are Out of Touch   By Anonymous, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2010  For this reason, talk of replacing the Federal Reserve's arbitrary monopoly over the U.S. money supply with a more decentralized and competitive monetary system does not, contrary to Mr. Reich's claim, spawn regime uncertainty of the sort that is spawned by "progressive" talk of (and action toward) empowering government with ever-more authority to tax, spend, borrow, block, "protect," punish, reward, subsidize, bail out, restrict, require, prohibit, cap, quantitatively ease, universally insure, stimulate, regulate, investigate, interrogate, moratoriate and otherwise override, with politically poisoned official diktats, the private choices and contracts of individuals.
