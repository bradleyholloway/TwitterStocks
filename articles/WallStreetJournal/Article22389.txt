 Letters to the Editor: Why Companies Buy Life Insurance   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  The code prohibits deductions to fund most retiree health obligations and taxes earnings on plan assets. The code also limits the amounts of an employee's annual compensation that can be considered to determine how much of a company's pension plan contributions are deductible. In 1993, the limit was lowered from $235,800 to $150,000 and indexed to inflation. Had the limit not been lowered in 1993, indexation would have raised it to more than $260,000 vs. the current $160,000. Contributions to supplemental retirement income plans above amounts permitted by this limit generally are not deductible and earnings on plan assets are taxable.
