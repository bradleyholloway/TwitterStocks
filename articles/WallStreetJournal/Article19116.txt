 1998 Year-End Review of Underwriting: Underwriting Firms Post Slight Gain in Fees   By By Anita Raghavan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1999  All told, investment banks earned $8.8 billion in disclosed fees last year, up slightly from 1997, but off from the record $9.3 billion earned in 1996, according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J., company that tracks corporate-finance activity. The third quarter's disclosed fees of nearly $1.6 billion represented the lowest level since the first quarter of 1995.  Not surprisingly, the biggest fee deals in the U.S. last year were stock offerings. The $4.4 billion initial public stock offering of Conoco Inc. triggered disclosed fees of about $158 million to underwriters led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The second biggest fee earner was the $2.9 billion offering by Infinity Broadcasting Corp., which produced $97.6 million in fees to underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Co. The $2.8 billion offering by Fox Entertainment Group Inc. was the third biggest fee earner of the year, leading underwriters at Merrill to pull in disclosed fees of about $95.2 million.
