 Texas Pacific, KKR Revise Terms Of Their Offer for Oxford Health   By By Leslie Scism and Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 1998  Texas Pacific Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. have adjusted terms of their $600 million rescue package for Oxford Health Plans Inc., apparently to fend off a rival bid from another investment group, people familiar with the matter said.  The competing offer is a sign that some investors believe that the beleaguered company's woes represent a profitable opportunity and that the problems can be solved. The rival bid included a requirement that Oxford hire Daniel D. Crowley, former chairman, president and chief executive officer at Foundation Health Corp., as Oxford's CEO. Mr. Crowley had emerged as an early candidate for the post, but people familiar with the situation say that the board has been leaning in favor of Norman Payson, a physician and former CEO of Healthsource Inc., for more than a week.
