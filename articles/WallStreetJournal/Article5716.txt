 HNC to Offer Its Antifraud Service for the Web   By By David Bank, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1999  HNC Software Inc., which tracks activity in more than 260 million credit-card accounts to spot fraudulent transactions, will offer its services to Web merchants in return for even more detailed data on consumer-buying patterns. The Web service, called eFalcon, is to be announced today.  HNC, based in San Diego, employs "neural network" techniques to spot patterns of activity correlated with fraud and then calculate the probability that a given transaction is unauthorized. The company has long had reciprocal agreements under which most major credit-card issuers, such as banks, provide HNC with transaction records to be added to its massive database to improve the accuracy of the predictions. (In addition to the data, HNC gets a small fee for each card check.)  Now, the company is seeking to extend its model to the Web. As part of HNC's new eFalcon fraud-detection service, Internet merchants will give HNC detailed information, including data on products purchased and a Web user's "click stream," or path, through a Web site.
