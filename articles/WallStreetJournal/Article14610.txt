 ConAgra's Pursuit Of Holly Is Said To Interest SEC   By By Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1989  People familiar with the litigation said they believe the SEC is investigating whether ConAgra misled the market when it told The Wall Street Journal that it planned to skip Holly's latest auction for the company. Those comments appeared May 19 and ConAgra's stock rose 87.5 cents a share that day, closing at $35.625. Over the weekend, however, ConAgra improved its bid for Holly to 2.1 ConAgra shares for each Holly share outstanding, and Holly accepted the offer, which it valued at $1.38 billion.  The SEC also may be investigating whether Holly should have disclosed earlier that it knew ConAgra planned to sweeten its offer. The people familiar with the litigation say court documents indicate that Holly, a Memphis, Tenn., chicken producer, may have known as early as April 25 that ConAgra planned to increase its stock-swap proposal from an earlier offer of as many as two of its shares for each Holly share outstanding. The previous offer was rejected by Holly shareholders earlier this year.
