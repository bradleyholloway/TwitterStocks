 Government Soon to Hit Debt Limit --- Bush Will Be Forced to Ask Congress to Boost Ceiling; Treasury to Change Sales   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  Issuance of the three-year note will reduce the Treasury's dependence on two-year notes and Treasury bills, "while also providing additional capacity for fresh borrowing," Assistant Treasury Secretary for Financial Markets Brian Roseboro said in a statement.  Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw said the moves reflect concern that the Treasury has borrowed too heavily in very-short-term securities, with Treasury bills rising to 26% from 16% of outstanding debt in four years. That could prove costly when the Federal Reserve eventually lifts short-term interest rates, he said.  Treasury prices fell despite a lower close for major stock indexes, largely on the prospect of increased sales of Treasury debt this year.
