 PURSUITS; Books: Writer's Block   By Weiner, Lauren, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2006  A word of caution, though: Just because Mr. Marias has the tastes and interests of a traditionalist does not mean that readers can slip into his work as easily as they would into a 19th-century novel. Each Marias tale is an imposing edifice, grandiose yet somehow ungrounded, built by a first-person narrator who is as skeptical of the nature of reality as he is opinionated. As a kind of in-joke, the author will have the narrator in one work (Victor from "Tomorrow in the Battle Think on Me," 1997) repeat comments made by the narrator of another (Juan in "A Heart So White," 1995). The life circumstances and the literary and cinematic likes and dislikes of these narrators track closely with those of [Javier Marias] himself.  In "Written Lives," and in the autobiographical work "Dark Back of Time" (2001), Mr. Marias suggests that the literary artists closest to his heart tend to be "ill-fated, calamitous and jovial." Come what may, these writers never "take themselves too seriously."  Really Mr. Marias does have his share of the trait that the Spanish call soberbio -- a prickly sort of pride that takes itself very, very seriously. He grouses about being underappreciated in "the intellectually mediocre country which I grew up in." But it was his late father, the philosopher and writer Julian Marias, who could have more legitimately claimed injustice. The elder Marias, a student of the philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset, was persecuted by the Franco dictatorship. The younger Marias is only mistreated by publishers who hand out paltry advances (a target of his ire in "Dark Back of Time").
