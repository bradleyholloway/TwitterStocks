 `Survivor' for Start-Ups: Dot-Coms Take Steps to Avoid Elimination --- Facing the Music, Distributors Of Downloadable Tunes Scrounge for Cash, Cut Jobs   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  Among the latest examples: Xenote, a San Mateo, Calif., company that gave away devices people were supposed to use to identify music heard on the radio, plans to shut its doors tomorrow after unsuccessfully seeking funds from about 25 venture-capital companies. Supertracks, a Portland, Ore., online music-distribution service, yesterday said it is laying off about 40 employees, or a third of its workers. Microsoft Corp., which has plenty to spend on acquisitions, this month said it would buy two California music start-ups, MongoMusic Inc., of Redwood City, and Pacific Microsonics Inc., of Union City.  Now, because of delays in the use of SDMI -- and consumers' keen interest in using the unprotected MP3 format -- Supertracks has developed services that don't prevent consumers from passing along downloaded tunes. "The whole market has stalled," Mr. [Charles Jennings] says. "We regard SDMI as a kind of tar pit that we need to climb out of."  Supertracks recently announced a partnership with EMusic.com Inc., of Redwood City, which sells downloadable music that isn't controlled by major labels. But EMusic.com has been having problems, too: It cut its own work force by 20% in June and now is emphasizing a subscription service as well as individual songs. Its stock has fallen far from a 52-week high of $21.75 a share, trading at $1.78 a share at 4 p.m. yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
