 'Decluttering' Your Career; Cleaning Up Distractions, Conflicts on the Job   By Needleman, Sarah E, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2007  Put an unpleasant task at the top of your "to do" list and chop it into smaller pieces, says Mr. [Daniel Markovitz]. "Imagine I gave you a 25-foot salami and said, 'Bon appetit!' Then what if I broke it up into little bite-size pieces?" he says. "Suddenly it seems totally manageable."  Emails that don't require an immediate reply can pile up as you respond to more-urgent messages. To get them out of the way, send a quick reply to each with a canned message such as: "Thanks for writing. I'll get back to you on this as soon as possible," says Ana Weber, a controller at Binder Metal Products Inc., a Gardena, Calif., manufacturer, who is a part-time career and time-management coach. Then, she says, store them in a folder labeled "unread" as a reminder to attend to them later.  One way to reduce the influx of email is to cancel newsletters and other electronic mailings that aren't a strong match for your career, Ms. [Debby Stone] says. "Most people get on them because something caught their eye or someone recommended it to them," she says. "In a lot of cases, they find that what they get is not as interesting or relevant as they anticipated."
