 Call It Blackmail   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1998  The White House denies that it leaked the news of an extramarital affair 30 years ago by the head of a likely impeachment inquiry, Henry Hyde. Of course, it had previously denied that President Clinton had sex with Monica Lewinsky.  The Hyde leak got Congressional consideration of the (Kenneth) Starr report off to a partisan start. No doubt angered by the revelation, coming atop similar incidents with Dan Burton and Helen Chenoweth, Republicans used their majority to vote immediate release of the videotape of President Clinton's grand jury testimony. Democrats resisted. In fact the material had to come out in some way or another, and it is not entirely clear whether dumping it all at once will hurt the President worse than a more measured procedure would. But thanks to the leak, the Judiciary Committee is voting on party lines.
