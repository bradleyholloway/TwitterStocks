 Toshiba to Seal $5.4 Billion Deal For BNFL's Westinghouse Electric   By Berman, Dennis K, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2006  Building a nuclear plant can take more than a decade, and in that time the process can get bogged down by economic shifts, environmental protests and legal battles. One person involved in the sale process said Toshiba was viewing the purchase with a "20-year time horizon," given it was paying such a high price for the company. That price is at least 10% more than the final bid submitted by its closet rival, Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., people familiar with the matter said.  BNFL was advised by Rothschild and law firm Sutherland Asbill & Brennan. Toshiba was advised by KPMG Corporate Finance and law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
