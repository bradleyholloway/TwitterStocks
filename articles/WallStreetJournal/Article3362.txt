 Serbian Vote Could Upset West's Plans --- U.S. and NATO Allies May Find Hands Tied By Domestic Politics   By By Matthew Kaminski, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  NATO officials say they want to encourage the Serbian democratic opposition, but any overt support for Mr. [Vojislav Kostunica] could be used by the Belgrade regime to tar him as a NATO tool, U.S. administration officials say. Mr. [Slobodan Milosevic] called the national poll for this coming Sunday, less than two months before Americans vote for president. Trouble abroad could hurt Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.  European Union nations also face political pressures. EU members Greece, France and Italy believe engagement is more effective than sanctions in Yugoslavia. Athens sent its foreign minister to Belgrade this month, the first visit to Yugoslavia by a NATO minister since the war. The EU says it will reconsider its sanctions on Serbia after Sunday's elections. With these divisions, diplomats suggest NATO would have trouble reaching a consensus if forced to act.  In a warning flag to the Milosevic government, Britain sent its Invincible aircraft carrier group, previously scheduled for a U.S. trip, into the Mediterranean this month. "We're remaining as flexible as we can," said a British Defense Ministry spokesman. The U.S. organized troop exercises in Croatia, just across the border from Montenegro; NATO forces are training with Romania, on the other side of Serbia.
