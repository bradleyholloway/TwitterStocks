 The Sentencing Game   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2004  On the docket are cases involving the constitutionality of capital punishment for teens, the detention of illegal immigrants in the age of terrorism, and age discrimination in the workplace. The Justices will hear an important eminent domain case -- whether a city can force citizens to sell their homes or businesses in favor of economic development -- and they'll decide whether oenophiles can import across state lines a case of that delightful Chardonnay they enjoyed on their vacation in California's Napa Valley.  All of which is to say that we'd hate to see the Justices tinker with success. That said, the challengers have a point on the specific question of whether it's constitutional for judges to increase the length of a sentence based on facts that have not been found by a jury "beyond a reasonable doubt." In June, the Court struck down a similar system in the state of Washington, saying that it violated defendants' Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.
