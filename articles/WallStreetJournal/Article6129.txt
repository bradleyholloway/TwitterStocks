 Severance Pay: A Tricky Lifeline For Hard Times   By By Terri Cullen The Wall Street Journal Online, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  Severance pay isn't always guaranteed, particularly if there is no labor-union contract or individual employee contract with your employer that specifies the amount of severance you will be paid in case of a layoff or job elimination. Companies aren't legally required to offer severance, or even match the same rate of severance paid to employees laid off in previous rounds of cuts. You are at the mercy of the company's generosity at a time when most can't spare the cash.  To get some idea of what your severance paycheck might look like, check with your employee-benefits department to determine how many weeks of pay, if any, you may be entitled to during a layoff. Remember to ask whether you will be paid for any unused sick leave or vacation days. Then head to the Web, where many state unemployment-agency sites offer severance calculators to give you a ballpark estimate of what you can expect. (Key in "severance calculator" on your search engine.)
