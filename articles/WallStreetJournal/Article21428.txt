 Stocks Hurt By Plunge In Tokyo --- Effect Is Moderate; Strong Dollar Drives Nikkei Down by 6.6%   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1990  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.76 points to close at 2700.45 in light trading. Analysts noted that while selling pressure wasn't intense, there was little buying. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange far outpaced gainers, 1,122 to 434.  The sharp drop in Tokyo share prices carried over to some extent to European trading, setting up the U.S. stock market for a nosedive on the opening bell. The Dow Jones industrials plummeted about 27 points in the first few minutes of trading, then stabilized before regaining about 10 points of the lost ground. But trading was sluggish throughout the day and only in the final minutes did the Dow industrials regain the 2700 mark.
