 US Air Logs Widespread Delays; Kiosk Failures Lead To Long Check-Ins, Mostly Late Flights   By Trottman, Melanie, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  The problems at US Airways began when the airline's kiosks at its hubs in Charlotte, N.C., and Philadelphia failed to come back online after being switched off as planned early in the morning. Kiosks in Las Vegas and San Diego also had problems. The failure left passengers with no option of checking in at the kiosks, which have increasingly replaced airline workers in recent years.  "The kiosks just aren't talking to the new reservations system. They work and then don't work and then they're slow," he said. The airline had its information-technology staff working on the problem yesterday, but is staffing airport workers today as if it won't have kiosks. Morning passenger traffic at hubs today is expected to be heavier than it was yesterday morning.  US Airways said that to keep the airline operating as close to its schedule as possible, flights departed without all of their booked passengers. The airline rebooked waiting passengers on later flights, the spokesman said, though he couldn't immediately provide information about the rate of accommodation. He said the airline chose this past weekend for the switchover because it preceded the spring break travel rush.
