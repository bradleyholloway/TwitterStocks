 Politics & Economics: Trials of Nuclear Rebuilding; Problems at Finland Reactor Highlight Global Expertise Shortage   By Gauthier-Villars, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2007  "Areva should have detected the wider gaps," says Jukka Laaksonen, director of Finland's nuclear-safety watchdog, Stuk. "You can't play with specifications in the nuclear sector."  There are 435 nuclear reactors in operation world-wide, but most were built in the 1960s and 1970s. Finland last constructed a nuclear plant in the late 1970s, and Areva NP, the [Areva]-led joint venture at Olkiluoto, hasn't been a lead contractor since the 1980s. Excluding Olkiluoto, 29 reactors are currently being built, mainly in Asia, but all are using old designs that Western European and U.S. nuclear- safety regulators won't allow.  "It's unclear how fast we can re-create forging capacity," Mr. [Philippe Knoche] said. "The know-how is in people's heads and there aren't that many who master the technology."
