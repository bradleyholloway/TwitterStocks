 Heard on the Street: Ralphs Supermarkets IPO, Likely to Be Touted as a Good Buy, Requires a Careful Checkout   By Power, William, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1992  California-based Ralphs Supermarkets is about to make an initial public offering of a nearly 20% stake through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch, and analysts expect the price to be a fairly cheap $15 to $17 a share.

DeBartelo Corp, each brought their own financial problems into the picture, but Ralphs itself is said to be a solid company.
