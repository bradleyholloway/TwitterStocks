 Stocks, Dollar Advance; Bond Prices Retreat   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1989  Stocks and the dollar advanced slightly, but bond prices edged lower as investors reacted warily to higher short-term interest rates.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its ninth gain in 11 sessions, climbing 5.86 to 2483.87. But more than half the rise came from a surge in Philip Morris. Higher oil prices also fueled gains in oil stocks.  "It's not unreasonable to expect the market to consolidate here" after such an explosive rally, said Byron R. Wien, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Co. "One cloud over the market may be concern that the dollar is so strong that {West} Germany and Japan may react" by raising interest rates, which would jar global markets, Mr. Wien said. British interest rates surged yesterday, with the base rate jumping to 14% from 13%.
