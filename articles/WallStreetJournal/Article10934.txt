 ILA Ends Walkout at East Coast Ports But Still Must Face Shippers' Demands   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1986  Competition in the depressed maritime industry among carriers, ports and union and nonunion crews is putting the ILA on the defensive. A proliferation of non-ILA labor -- receiving 40% less in wages and benefits -- on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts is encouraging ports further north that use ILA dockworkers to challenge the union for cost savings.  The agreement extended an expired contract for 45 days, thus ending a walkout that shut ports from Maine to Virginia. In reaching the accord, a management group bowed to the ILA and withdrew demands that any contract extension include a two-tier wage system.  When negotiations between the ILA and management for a new three-year contract resume, the Council of North Atlantic Shipping Associations vows to press for a two-tier wage system with pay cuts for some crews. "There's tremendous pressure on us," said Francis A. Scanlan, the group's chief counsel, who points to the growth of non-ILA dockworkers with wages lower than those of ILA members and without expensive ILA-fringe benefit packages.
