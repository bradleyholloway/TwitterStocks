 Homeland Security's Request For Student Data Stirs Concern   By Alonso Soto and Robert Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2004  In addition to complaining to Mr. Ridge, Mr. [Patrick Lynch] wrote to Rhode Island's state director of Homeland Security affairs and to the superintendents of each of the state's school systems asking them to disregard the Homeland form. "We don't want children, we don't want adults, we don't want anybody giving up their Social Security numbers," he said.  Barry Steinhardt, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union Liberty Project, said Homeland Security was "grossly irresponsible" for the form, saying that it should know that identify theft is an epidemic in the country and their actions would only make it easier for thieves. "I hope this was just a misjudgment by the department and not a concealed attempt to collect data," he said.
