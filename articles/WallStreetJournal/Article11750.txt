 Burger Joint Chomps On CBS Trademark For TV Cop Show --- Network Loses Registration For `Rescue 911' in Lawsuit Energized by a Candy Bar   By By Steve Stecklow, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1993  It all began three years ago when CBS went after the couple who own the restaurant, James and Rose Marie Mercadante, for trying to register a trademark on a candy bar they had been selling, called the "911 Rescue Bar." Although the couple had been selling the bar since 1985, they decided to seek a trademark because they were revising the packaging.  But the Mercadantes argued that they began selling their candy bars, as well as "911 Rescue Team" T-shirts, four years before the debut of the television show, which is hosted by William Shatner and features real and re-enacted police emergencies. The couple filed a counterclaim with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, arguing that the registration of the network's trademark should be nullified since it too closely resembled the name of their candy bars.
