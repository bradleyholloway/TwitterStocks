 U.S. Says GM Didn't Give Its Customers Adequate Warning About Safety Defects   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1987  On Feb. 27, GM announced it would ask owners to return the vehicles to dealers to "make certain modifications" on three separate mechanical problems involving fuel tanks, power steering and accelerator-control cables.  But in a letter to GM, George Parker, enforcement chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, complained that the auto maker hadn't described the problems as "safety defects" or the company's action as a "safety recall."  In Detroit, GM issued a statement saying it wasn't aware NHTSA "felt this way. We've issued recall (press) releases voluntarily since the process began," the statement said. "We believe they carefully explain problems and risks of any recall. The items mentioned in the NHTSA press release were covered by a GM release of Feb. 27, 1987. We hope our customers will not be confused by NHTSA's later release on the same subject."
