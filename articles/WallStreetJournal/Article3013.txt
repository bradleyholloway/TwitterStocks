 A Royal Mess   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1997  Even the Royal Academy of Arts in London probably underestimated the press attention its shock-art show, "Sensation," would generate when it opened last month. The publicity resulted in a series of resignations and what an Academy insider called "the worst crisis in our 230-year-old history." The critics don't see the show as hewing to the Royal Charter mission to promote the "great and the good."  "Sensation" is filled with pieces whose only intention is to slap the art-viewing public in the face. One show room, for instance, features mannequins with male genitalia for noses and sex-doll mouths. Presumably it's up to the viewing public to discern which part of this is "great" and which is "good."
