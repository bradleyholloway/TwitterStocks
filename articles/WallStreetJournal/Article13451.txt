 Cloudy Outlook for the Sunshine State?   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  Although I agree with much or your article, I have to provide some perspective to your statement that Florida's two-tiered tax system, which is the result of the homestead exemption and a 3% annual assessment cap, hits newcomers and part-timers harder than longer-term residents. We've lived in our home for 12 years, and we're tired of being labeled the bad guys. We built a very modest home with the intention of retiring here. The homestead exemption and assessment cap allowed us enough predictability and stability to plan and budget our expenses. We pay around $3,900 annually, and now the media and some government officials say that we should pay $20,000, based on current market value. We couldn't afford this now, much less at retirement.
