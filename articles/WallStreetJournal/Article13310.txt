 MarketWatch: Preferred Stock or Not?   By Burton, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  For starters, if a company does well, preferred shareholders won't capture any of the common stock's appreciation. Most preferred shares have no voting rights. And if a company runs into financial trouble, bondholders can stake a solid claim on the company's assets while preferred shareholders are stuck with common stockholders near the back of the creditors' line.  Even if a company doesn't go bankrupt, it can suspend preferred dividends without risking default, as it would with a missed bond payment. What's more, a company isn't obligated to make good on the lapsed dividend if the preferred shares are "noncumulative." In contrast, "cumulative" preferreds carry a promise to pay a skipped dividend eventually.  Preferred stocks are also "callable," meaning a company can buy back the shares at a certain date -- usually five years from the initial offering -- at a price equal to what's known as "par," which for most preferreds is $25 a share.
