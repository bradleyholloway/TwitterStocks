 The Economy; CAPITAL: Madison Avenue Approach Helps Nonprofit   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2005  Now PSI finds itself in the cross hairs of some conservatives upset that PSI gets slightly less than half its $250 million annual funding from the U.S. foreign-aid budget. "It is time to stop funding immorality at taxpayer expense," an aide to Sen. Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican, wrote in a memo reported by my colleague Michael Phillips. PSI funds "obscene" and "suggestive over-sexualized" ads for condoms, it complained. (Sen. Brownback wasn't available to comment.)  Like the U.S. government, PSI subscribes to the A-B-C approach to fighting AIDS: Abstinence -- Be Faithful -- Condoms. In Zambia, its posters shout: "Abstinence Ili Che!" or "Abstinence is cool!" In Malawi, its billboards show a teenage girl shunning the entreaties of three boys with the headline: "Sex Can Wait, but My Future Cannot."  ITS MARKETING is clever and bold. In Central America, PSI collaborated with local artists to produce songs for popular radio stations to reach teens with messages about abstinence, fidelity and safer sex. "Te Esperare" ("I'll Wait for You") is set to soft-rock music. "La Fidelidad si Paga" ("Fidelity Pays") is set to salsa. And the merengue "Proteccion" ("Protection") reminds listeners that "your life is worth using protection." PSI promotions feature a mascot called Perinollo, an animated penis that the company says breaks the ice and makes the serious public-health message entertaining.
