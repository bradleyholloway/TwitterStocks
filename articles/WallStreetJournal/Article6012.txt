 Another Target? The War on bin Laden Renews Old Debate On Threat of Saddam --- Some, Fearing an Alliance And Iraq's Deadly Arsenal, Support Pre-Emptive Hit --- Risk to International Support   By By Neil King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2001  Several current and former U.S. officials argue strenuously that even now, the deeply secular and heavy-handed [Saddam Hussein] would have ample reason to keep his distance from Mr. bin Laden. He's hardly the kind of pious Islamic ruler Mr. bin Laden envisions for the Muslim world; in fact, he has much in common with the leaders of Egypt and Saudi Arabia that Mr. bin Laden so frequently criticizes.  Yet Saddam Hussein has shown an ability to find temporary friends where and when he needs them. Even the U.S. was an ally that provided aid and battlefield intelligence during Iraq's war with Iran in the 1980s. So some Iraq experts insist that at least a tactical alliance with al Qaeda would suit Iraq's interests right now. And Iraq and Mr. bin Laden share enmity toward Iran, a Shiite Islamic regime that has distanced itself from Mr. bin Laden's radical Sunni Muslim recipe for running the Islamic world.  The next encounters took place soon after Mr. bin Laden fled to Afghanistan in 1996. On at least two occasions, former intelligence officials say, Iraq sent agents to meet with bin Laden deputies in Afghanistan. The most notable meeting came in December 1998, just months after the East Africa embassy bombings, when a senior Iraqi intelligence official, Farouk Hijazi, went to the Afghan city of Kandahar to meet with al Qaeda. It remains uncertain whether Mr. Hijazi met with Mr. bin Laden himself.
