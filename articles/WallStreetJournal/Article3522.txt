 Quarrels Fray U.S.- Canada Trade Ties --- Washington Weighs Curbs On Wheat and Steel As Rancor Builds   By By Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  Canadian steel exports also face potential barriers as the U.S. takes aim at a host of countries allegedly overloading the U.S. market with steel. Certain types of Canadian steel could be subject to tariffs or quotas if President [Bush] decides to uphold recent U.S. International Trade Commission recommendations. Barry Lacombe, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, estimates that US$1 billion of Canadian steel exports to the U.S. are at stake.  Meanwhile, Canadian wheat farmers are bracing for the U.S. trade representative's decision due Feb. 15 on whether to impose duties on Canadian durum and spring wheat. Canadian wheat exports to the U.S. have dropped in recent years as Canada found higher returns abroad, and the total value of wheat exports to the U.S. is a fraction of that for other contested products, such as lumber. But U.S. growers say Canadian practices are hurting them in the multibillion-dollar global wheat market, as U.S. growers lose market share in several important countries.
