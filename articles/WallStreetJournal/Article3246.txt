 The Donald Goes to Washington   By By Christopher Buckley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1999  This is a great day for me personally. You're very smart to have voted for me because I'm going to do positive things for this country, starting with this mall I'm looking out over. For starters, I don't know why this is called a "mall." Where I come from, New York City -- which happens to be the greatest city in the world, and the reason I say that is that I built most of it, and I only build quality, so I think I know what I'm talking about -- a mall doesn't look like this. Where are the shops? I see grass, ponds, an obelisk. This is not Cairo.
