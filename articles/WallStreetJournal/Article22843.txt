 Moussaoui Denies Charges in Court In Terrorism Case   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2002  Mr. [Zacarias Moussaoui] was in jail in Minnesota on Sept. 11, when Islamic terrorists hijacked and crashed four U.S. passenger jets. He had been detained for an immigration violation after instructors at a flight school he attended there grew suspicious and reported him to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Attorney General John Ashcroft has said that Mr. Moussaoui's activities before his arrest tracked those of the 19 other hijackers and suggested Mr. Moussaoui was intended to be the 20th hijacker.  Virginia courts also are known to move more rapidly than those in New York, and that was apparent at Mr. Moussaoui's 30-minute hearing yesterday morning. Judge [Leonie Brinkema], who was appointed to the bench by President Clinton in 1993, denied a request by Mr. Moussaoui's defense lawyers to delay his trial until early 2003, and instead approved the government's request to begin jury selection in the case on Sept. 30, with the trial expected to begin by Oct. 14. Defense lawyer Gerald Zerkin argued that the trial date proposed by the government is too close to the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks to ensure a fair trial for Mr. Moussaoui, because jurors could be influenced by a renewed spate of media coverage of the crimes Mr. Moussaoui is accused of helping to commit.
