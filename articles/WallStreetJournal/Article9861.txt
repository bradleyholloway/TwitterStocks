 Forex View: Dollar's Vitality May Be Tested By Economic Data   By Laurence Norman and Steven Vames, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2005  The advance late last week brought the U.S. currency's gains to 15% versus the yen in 2005, while the euro is around 13% lower. In addition to breaking key levels against the euro and the yen, the dollar also hit a one-year high against its Australian peer Friday and was at its strongest level against the franc since May 2004.  Jeff Young, currency strategist at Citigroup in New York, said that given the strength of the U.S. currency Friday, there is a "technical case for further dollar strength" early this week.  If the consensus forecast is accurate, it would be a record deficit, narrowly surpassing the trade gap from February. Mr. Young said, "This could remind people about" the U.S. currency's main vulnerability -- that a weaker dollar is the route of least resistance to correcting the deficits.
