 Philippine Question: Will Vote Proceed?   By By Anthony Spaeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 1985  By uniting against Mr. Marcos in the presidential election scheduled for Feb. 7, the opposition has posed such a formidable challenge that many opposition supporters suspect the president may backtrack on his decision to hold an election.  Mrs. Aquino and Mr. Laurel finally were brought together by Jaime Cardinal Sin, archbishop of Manila. Some political analysts say that the arrangement still might come unstuck, however, as the difficult task of melding Mrs. Aquino's and Mr. Laurel's supporters begins.  Diplomats say the opposition team has the advantage of opposing Mr. Marcos at a time when his popularity is at an all-time low. And Mrs. Aquino, the widow of slain opposition leader Benigno Aquino, is known all over the country, an important factor when dealing with a poor and predominantly rural electorate.
