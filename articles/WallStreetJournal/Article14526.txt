 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Scott R. Schmedel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1988  The momentous ruling resolves a longstanding uncertainty for options investors, says Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton. The court ruled last week for David E. Gantner of Bloomington, Minn., a heavy investor in call options, which confer rights to buy stock at fixed prices. On Dec. 3, 1980, Gantner sold and bought 100 options identical to 100 he owned and took a $38,910 current loss. But the IRS called that a wash sale, requiring deferral of the loss until he sold his remaining options, as he did in January 1981.  The wash-sale rules restrict deductions of losses on identical "stock or securities" bought and sold within a 61-day period. But Gantner argued that options aren't stock or securities as the terms are used in the wash-sale rules. Judge Wells agreed (after finding conflicting treatment among other tax-code sections) and upheld the current loss. The decision is important for year-end and other tax-timing strategies.  In fact, tax-code commandments that protect religious rights discourage IRS enforcement efforts, says a General Accounting Office report to Rep. Rangel (D., N.Y.), prompted by publicity about the Bakkers and other TV preachers. First, unlike other religious entities, such as publishers, churches need not apply for exemption or file annual information reports. Also, special audit procedures slow the IRS, and exemption abuses are hard to nail down.
