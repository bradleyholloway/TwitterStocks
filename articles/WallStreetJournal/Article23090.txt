 IN THE LEAD: Women Put Noses To the Grindstone, And Miss Opportunities   By Hymowitz, Carol, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  A big factor holding women back is their good-girl, or good- student, behavior. "Women will work themselves to death in the belief that if they do more and more, that will get them ahead, when it isn't so," says Terri Dial, former vice chairman of Wells Fargo, and president and CEO of its Wells Fargo Bank. "They think, 'If I do the work, my bosses will see it and reward me.' "  That may never happen. Even Ms. Dial, now an adviser to companies, admits that as a senior executive she took advantage of her female subordinates' willingness to be grinds. "Good girls don't advertise, only prostitutes advertise," she says. "We feel dirty promoting ourselves." As a result, women are still getting stuck in the middle, shut out of "the club at the top."  Lisa Jacobson, CEO of Inspirica, a New York high-school and college tutoring company, agrees that women often don't ask for what they deserve. In the 20 years since she founded her company, none of the female lawyers, graphic designers, public-relations experts, accountants or others she has interviewed to do work for Inspirica has ever quoted her as high a fee as their male counterparts. "The women almost always seem to say, 'I'm $125 an hour, but for you I'd charge $75, when the guy just says flatly that he charges $350," she adds.
