 Bond Market Still Punishes Hedge Fund and Investors --- Long-Term Capital Faces Challenges In Diverging Yields   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  What's worse for Long-Term Capital is that since the bailout was agreed to, prices of the riskier bonds it had made massive bets on -- including junk, emerging-markets and commercial mortgage-backed securities -- have fallen even further behind Treasurys, weighed down by fears that the fund will have to dump its portfolio sooner rather than later.  "A lot of the recent rally (in Treasury bonds) has been because of Long-Term Capital," says Livingston Douglas, president of Kiewit Investment Management in Omaha, Neb. "The market believes that Long-Term Capital is long risky positions and short Treasurys, and the threat of them buying back Treasurys has helped the Treasury market at the expense of riskier markets."  The spread between benchmark 10year commercial mortgage backed-securities and comparable Treasurys has climbed to 1.55 percentage points from 1.35 percentage points since the Long-Term Capital bailout agreement, according to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. And the spread between high-yield bonds and Treasurys has grown to 5.84 percentage points from 5.57 percentage points in the same period, according to Merrill Lynch.
