 VNU Is Kept Busy By Activist Holder And Buyout Group   By Sender, Henny, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2006  If the private-equity firms proceed with their offer, a potential deal might involve equity of about 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion), one of the largest equity checks ever for a buyout, and as much as 6 billion euros in debt, people familiar with the matter say. But activist shareholders such as [Knight Vinke], which have been pressing VNU to adopt more shareholder-friendly measures, are a wild card in the proceedings. Last year, such activists were instrumental in defeating VNU's plans to acquire IMS Health Inc. Knight Vinke has been working with outside consultants on proposals to maximize shareholder value.  Meanwhile, both major debt-rating services have downgraded the credit ratings of VNU in the past two months. Moody's Investors Service referred to VNU's weakened financial profile because of its plan to return 1 billion euro to shareholders, the prospect of further restructuring and strategic uncertainties in the wake of the planned departure of the CEO. Standard & Poor's Corp. cited pressure from shareholders to maximize the value of the equity and added that the possibility of a buyout or an increased dividend to shareholders could weaken VNU's credit quality.
