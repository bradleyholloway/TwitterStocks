 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Rome and Ramadan   By By Francis X. Rocca, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 23, 2001  Such views have gained force for certain people from the evidence that Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network has operatives in Italy. The U.S. Treasury Department says that Milan's Islamic Cultural Institute is the "most important base of al Qaeda in Europe," from which "weapons, men and money travel the whole world." A document linking one Moroccan-born Italian citizen to bin Laden's group was just found at an abandoned al Qaeda base in Kabul. The same document included tips for entering and establishing legal residence in Italy.  The Catholic Church's position toward Islam, meanwhile, has been pointedly tolerant. Cardinals Carlo Maria Martini of Milan and Marco Ce of Venice are prominent advocates of friendly relations with the Muslim community. And reaching out to the world's second-largest faith has been a theme of John Paul II's papacy. Naturally, the Vatican and Islamic leaders have joined to oppose U.N. conference resolutions favoring abortion and birth control. And if recent tradition is a guide, the Holy See will send end-of-Ramadan greetings next month to its "Muslim Friends" around the world. Indeed, John Paul has called on Catholics to promote world peace by fasting along with Muslims on Dec. 12, the last Friday of Ramadan. (Nevertheless, the pope is a "primary target" for al Qaeda attack, or so claimed a former CIA counterterrorism chief, Vincent Cannistraro, in an interview with La Repubblica last Sunday.)
