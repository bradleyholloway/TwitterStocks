 Sweet Charity: Top Firms Follow Fidelity's Lead In Offering Funds Acting as Charitable Accounts   By By Laura Saunders Egodigwe, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2000  Vanguard Group, Charles Schwab and most recently Eaton Vance have followed the lead of Fidelity Investments in establishing what are technically called "donor-advised funds." In essence, these vehicles allow contributors with less than Bill Gates-type wealth to establish charitable-giving accounts that look a bit like personal foundations.  Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, begun in 1992, has grown to be the nation's third-biggest charity in terms of donations. Assets in the Fidelity, Vanguard and Schwab gift funds total $2.4 billion, with the lion's share of that at the Fidelity fund.  But some folks in the charitable-giving community are griping about the gift funds set up by fund companies. One concern: that the funds are delaying -- potentially for years -- donations that otherwise might have gone directly into charitable programs. Moreover, the longer the money sits in the charitable fund, the greater the fee income to the money-management firm.
