 Ontario Reforms Aim to Strengthen Securities Laws   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1993  Edward Waitzer, chairman of OSC, said he believes the reforms will significantly enhance the commission's authority and effectiveness. He noted that in the recent high-profile case involving Gordon Capital Corp. -- in which the firm and some of its former and current officers admitted allowing a series of transactions that resulted in the firm's overstating its free capital position -- the penalties eventually assessed were possible only because Gordon and the officers agreed to them as part of a settlement. Had Gordon been found culpable in a hearing, Mr. Waitzer notes, the OSC wouldn't have been able to order it to contribute 6 million Canadian dollars (US$4.5 million) to an investor protection fund, to reprimand its compliance officer, or order the firm to undertake an education program.
