 Judge Dismisses Tax Indictments Of Hubbells   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  A federal judge threw out Kenneth Starr's tax-fraud indictments of Webster Hubbell, his wife and two associates, dealing a significant setback to the independent counsel's four-year inquiry into President Clinton.  U.S. District Judge James Robertson ruled that Mr. Starr exceeded his legal authority in bringing a case not directly related to his investigation of the Whitewater real-estate deal. He also said that Mr. Starr relied on records Mr. Hubbell produced after receiving an immunity agreement from the independent counsel.  Prosecutors believe Mr. Hubbell, a former associate attorney general and close confidant of the president, hasn't told everything he knows about the involvement of the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton in matters related to their Whitewater real-estate investment. The prosecutors had hoped the tax-fraud indictment would persuade Mr. Hubbell to talk.
