 Bonds Rally as Traders Are Encouraged By Declines in Some Short-Term Rates   By By Tom Herman and Edward P. Foldessy, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1987  Moreover, Federal Reserve System statistics released in the afternoon indicated to many analysts that the Fed hasn't made any changes in credit strategy recently. That helped calm fears pervading the credit markets earlier this week that the Fed had orchestrated a slight tightening of credit conditions.  Based on the Fed figures released yesterday, "it seems obvious the Fed hasn't changed" its credit policy, said Alan C. Lerner, a managing director at Bankers Trust Co. He and several other analysts contended that the federal funds rate is likely to average around 6%, rather than the 6 1/8% to 6 1/4% that some economists had thought.  Borrowings by banks and savings institutions from the Fed averaged only $119 million in the week ended Wednesday, according to the Fed. That compared with $200 million the previous week. Such borrowings are another indicator watched by analysts for hints of changes in Fed policy. The tougher the credit policy is, the more banks must turn to the Fed to meet their needs.
