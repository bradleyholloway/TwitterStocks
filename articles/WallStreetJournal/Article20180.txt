 SmartMoney.com: Mortgage Survival Kit   By Todorova, Aleksandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2007  -- Talk to your lender. Don't wait to fall behind on your mortgage. Call as soon as things start getting rough, says Ms. [Dania Perez]. Although the lender might not be able to do anything like Countrywide, it will put a note in your file and may be more willing to help if you do become delinquent. Meanwhile, if you're already in trouble, don't dodge the lender's calls. "It's like telling them you don't care," Ms. Perez says.  -- Other alternatives. Some homeowners simply won't be able to keep their homes. Your only choice might be to let the house go, says Kate Williams, a vice president at Money Management International, a credit-counseling service. If that's the case, there are options. For example, if you haven't been able to sell your house but think you'll find a buyer at a much lower price, you can ask your lender if it will agree to a short sale. That means it will accept a lump-sum payment lower than the loan outstanding, and consider it paid off.
