 Cross Country: State of the Unions   By Moore, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2006  Spokane, Wash. -- Teachers' unions are supposed to promote the financial interests of, well, teachers -- but not in Washington state. Here, the Washington Education Association is fighting some 4,000 nonmember teachers who don't want their paychecks raided each year and used for political activities that they don't believe in. "The right of free speech is being trampled" by the union political spending, complains Scott Carlson, a business teacher in Spokane. "And that's a right I hold very precious."  At issue is whether workers have the right to effectively declare themselves conscientious objectors to the unions' multimillion-dollar political war games. "All we are saying is that no one has the right to take our money and spend it on causes we don't believe in," insists Cindy Omlin, a recently retired speech teacher in Spokane. "If you want my money, ask for it, like private charities, political candidates and businesses do." Ms. Omlin was one of 250 teachers who successfully sued the WEA in 2002 to get half their dues refunded after a Washington superior court found the union guilty of "intentional violations" of the paycheck protection law.  The union retaliated with lawsuits and other intimidation tactics to shut her up. It's one reason she's not teaching anymore. "We're constantly called 'freeloaders' and 'enemies of public education,'" she notes with a mix of frustration and resentment. Another nonunion teacher in Seattle, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, says that the WEA openly invites retaliation by widely distributing lists of the outcasts: "Believe me, sitting in the faculty lounge is no picnic. You always have to look over your shoulder."
