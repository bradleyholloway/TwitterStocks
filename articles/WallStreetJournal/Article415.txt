 Britain 'Refines' Pension Plans; New Rule Will Allow Collectibles Such as Wine, Art Into Accounts; Worries About Unwise Investing   By Calian, Sara, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2005  Peter Osborne, deputy chairman of the Society of London Art Dealers and the owner of an art gallery in Mayfair, is starting to encourage investors, too. "Someone walks into my gallery and looks at a beautiful Henry Moore and says 'I love it, but I can't afford it,' and I say, 'Why don't you buy it with your pension fund?' " he says.  Some accountants worry that the new tax break will trigger unwise investing. "People shouldn't put all their pension money into residential property or artwork," says David Fairs, a pensions partner at KPMG in London. "It needs to be used within a well-balanced pension plan that includes stocks, bonds and other investments."  "The [SIPPs] wine isn't for drinking," says Sam Fazeli, a 41-year-old banker in London, who has already bought several cases of Chateau Latour 2003 for GBP 2,200 a case that he says he "would happily move into a pension fund." "If you are really interested in drinking," he says, "then you need to buy an extra case or two to keep to the side."
