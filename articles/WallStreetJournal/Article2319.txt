 Education Dinosaurs   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1992  An editorial says that the education reform bill that Sen Ted Kennedy and the Senate Labor Committee passed recently shows once again how impossible it is to promote reform inside an antiquated system dominated not by parents or individual teachers, but by unions and bureaucracy. The editorial calls it a case of dinosaurs fighting back against a political evolution that threatens them with extinction.
