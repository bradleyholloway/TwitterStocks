 Jobless Tech Workers Denied Benefits   By Loftus, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2003  Mr. [Jim Fusco], who was laid off from International Business Machines Corp. in Piscataway, N.J., last year, attributed the layoff to IBM's transfer of information-technology jobs overseas. IBM spokesman Clint Roswell said the company is continuously "rebalancing" its work force, which operates in more than 160 countries.  Mr. Fusco's application was rejected by the Labor Department, which oversees TAA. The department ruled the service he provided at IBM didn't qualify under TAA as a product that could be imported. With some exceptions, only workers who make products that are subject to import duties, such as clothing or furniture, can be certified for TAA benefits.  "We would endorse the expansion of the program" to include service workers, said Sean Healy, spokesman for EDS, a Plano, Texas, computer- services firm. "The U.S. economy is now more of a service economy than a manufacturing economy."
