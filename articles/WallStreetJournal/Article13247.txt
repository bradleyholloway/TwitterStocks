 Politics & Economics: How Brazil Broke Its Oil Habit; Government's Central Role May Prove Unpalatable to U.S.   By Luhnow, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2006  The government helped make ethanol affordable through free-market policies, too. Brazil's ethanol is made from sugar, which had been coddled with subsidies for decades. When the cost of the ethanol program became prohibitive in the early 1990s, Brazil slashed its subsidies and forced its farmers to become more productive to survive and thrive in a global market. Since growing the sugar represents by far the biggest cost in making Brazilian ethanol, trimming sugar prices was the key to making more affordable fuel.  Transplanting those lessons from the sugar fields of Brazil to U.S. corn fields -- the source of most U.S.-made ethanol -- would be difficult. Consider the idea of a gasoline tax. While U.S.-made ethanol is becoming competitive with gasoline given high oil prices, and does enjoy tax breaks, any dip in oil prices could cause consumers and producers to abandon the fuel before technology has a chance to help lower its production cost.  In the U.S., about 500 gas stations carry the fuel. Without competition from more filling stations carrying ethanol, distributors have little incentive to try to undercut gasoline prices, denting ethanol's attraction. Auto makers such as Ford Motor Co., which are ramping up production of flexible-fuel vehicles that run on ethanol or gasoline, say the government needs to offer bigger tax incentives for gas stations to offer ethanol.
