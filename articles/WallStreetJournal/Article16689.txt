 Pyramis Hires Asset-Allocation Head; Fidelity Unit Hires Friebel, From Barclays, to Develop, Oversee Strategies, Products   By Arden, Dale, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2006  Pyramis Global Advisors said Mark A. Friebel will direct its asset- allocation efforts, developing and overseeing management of strategies and products for Pyramis.  Fidelity launched Pyramis last year as a separate business that serves institutional clients. The move came at a time when sales of Fidelity retail mutual funds had lagged behind others and amid vying by asset managers for the vast pool of money amassed by retiring baby boomers. In May, the unit put a key piece of its senior management team in place with the appointment of Mr. [Young D. Chin] -- an outsider from Gartmore Global Investments -- as its first chief investment officer.
