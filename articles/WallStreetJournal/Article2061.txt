 Solvay Says Revamping Will Create a Capital Gain   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1989  Solvay & Cie. said it expects to post a capital gain of "at least" 30 billion Belgian francs ($777 million) from a reorganization of its West German activities.  Mr. Janssen noted that Solvay does as much as a quarter of its business in West Germany. But he said recent pleas from the East German government for Western investment will fall on deaf ears at Solvay as long as ownership of a large plant seized by the East Germans after World War II isn't returned.
