 Germany Is Set To Lower Rates As Growth Slows --- Central Bank's Moves Seen As Creating Conditions For a Cut by December   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1992  FRANKFURT, Germany -- Pressured by its European neighbors and a skidding German economy, the Bundesbank is poised to lower interest rates despite inflationary growth in the money supply.  Germany's central bank yesterday announced that this week's securities repurchase agreements with banks, or "repos," would be on an auction basis rather than with a fixed rate. The switch to the more flexible tender rate can create conditions for cuts in the key Lombard and discount rates by December, some analysts say.  Since German unity became a reality in 1990, the Bundesbank has been fixated on using high interest rates to offset the inflationary impact of Bonn's massive fiscal transfers to eastern Germany. The Bundesbank has been bitterly criticized in Europe since it boosted official German interest rates to 61-year highs in July, when European economies were showing clear signs of slowing.
