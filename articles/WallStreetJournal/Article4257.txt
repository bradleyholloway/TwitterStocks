 Paul Klee at MOMA: A Show Worth the Wait   By By Jack Flam, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1987  New York -- By 1979 Paul Klee's standing had so diminished that the Museum of Modern Art couldn't find corporate sponsorship for a planned centenary exhibition of his work. In the age of the blockbuster, there seemed to be little place for a man whose whole life had been dedicated to the modest and the intricate.  Now, seven years later, and thanks in good measure to the National Endowment for the Arts, a large retrospective Klee exhibition has been mounted here at MOMA (up until May 5), and it makes one wonder how anyone could have treated Klee with indifference. The retrospective, with its 300 works, is not only one of the most ambitious but also one of the most intensely absorbing exhibitions of recent years. It offers intellectual stimulation, emotional excitement and sheer delight, but most of all it makes us reconsider the virtue of humility with renewed respect.  Paul Klee was nothing if not humble, in a profound and almost religious way. Absorbed in metaphysics, in technical experimentation, in pictorial speculation, he worked on a modest scale and in modest circumstances, year in and year out, quite simply producing some of the most intelligent and moving pictures of our century. At a time when some of the most innovative pictorial experimentation in history was being done, Klee was one of the most inventive artists around. He explored a vast range of styles and modes, ranging from fairly descriptive figuration to extreme abstraction. A professor in Germany for many years (first at the Bauhaus, later at the Dusseldorf Academy) his art was sometimes pedagogical, but never academic. Great theorist that he was, he never let theory outstrip performance.
