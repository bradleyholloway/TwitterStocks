 Ratios Help Gauge Saving   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2006  You can find Mr. [Charles J. Farrell]'s article at www.fpanet.org/journal/articles/ past_issues.cfm online (click on "2006"). You can read our original column, "New Look at Retiree Math," at WSJ.com/Sunday (type "Farrell" in the search box).  An example: A person, age 50, has a gross salary of $80,000, a mortgage of $100,000, two auto loans totaling $20,000, and savings -- such as a 401(k), but not the equity in a home -- of $250,000. Using Mr. Farrell's calculations, our 50-year-old already should have savings equal to 4.5 times his annual paycheck, or $360,000. Instead, the $250,000 nest egg equals just 3.13 times his salary.  The easy reaction is to say, "I'll never hit these targets." But the purpose of Mr. Farrell's ratios isn't to create a pass-fail situation. It's to get people heading in the right direction: reducing debt and saving more money.
