 Ryanair Must Shelve Ads Claiming Carrier Offers Lowest Fares   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2004  The agency said that while people probably wouldn't infer Ryanair had lower prices than competitors on all routes at all times, Ryanair didn't prove that in cases where the airline flew the same route and to the same airports as competitors, its prices were generally lower.  A Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline agreed with the agency's ruling "and won't use the ad in question again."
