 Bond Prices Extend Rally as Decline In Federal Funds Rate Cheers Traders   By By Tom Herman and Edward P. Foldessy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1985  The rally continued despite a large, $2.7 billion increase in the nation's money supply, reported yesterday afternoon by the Federal Reserve System. The increase had been widely expected. Most analysts surveyed earlier in the week had predicted a rise of about $2.5 billion to $3 billion.  Much of the market's attention yesterday was on the federal funds rate, from which most other interest rates are scaled upward. At one point Tuesday, the funds rate surged to 10%, reflecting technical factors stemming from a huge rise in the Treasury's deposits at the Fed.  Treasury deposits at the Fed usually surge in April, draining reserves from the banking system and pushing up the federal funds rate. Some analysts yesterday contended that the worst of these seasonal pressures may be abating. "I expect the funds rate to settle in around 8 1/4%" soon once these seasonal factors dissipate, said Edward Sawicz, a vice president and economist at Discount Corp. of New York.
