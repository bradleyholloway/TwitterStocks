 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  The White House acknowledged war planning has been complicated by the Turkish parliament's refusal to let a northern front open from its soil, but that the president's time-table remains "weeks, not months."

Bush's U.N. envoy said the U.S. expects a vote on declaring Iraq in violation of Security Council orders "quite soon" after inspectors report Friday. Baghdad continued destroying barred missiles and promised new reports on its stores of nerve gas and anthrax.  The U.S. vowed a formal protest over an incident on Sunday in which four MiGs intercepted an RC-135S spy plane about 150 miles off North Korea's coast and "painted" it with radar. It was the first such incident since 1969, when North Korea shot down a Navy spy plane and killed 31.  Israel arrested Hamas leader Mohammed Taha in a Gaza raid that left several Palestinians dead.
