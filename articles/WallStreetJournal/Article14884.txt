 Prudential Plans To Cut Payout On Its Policies --- Insurer Cites Projected Loss On Real Estate Holdings And Other Investments   By By Susan Pulliam, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1991  Prudential Insurance Co. of America expects to cut the dividend it pays to policyholders next year, largely reflecting expected losses on its real estate holdings and other investments.  The planned dividend cut by Prudential, which would follow a reduction last year, was outlined in a memo sent to agents this week. It is an indication that troubled investments are forcing even one of the most financially stable insurers to retrench.  Although mutual life insurers have been chipping away at their dividends in recent years because of tax increases and falling interest rates, Prudential's move is unusual because it is based on predicted losses on its investment portfolio. The memo said increased taxes and expenses will also contribute to the dividend cut.
