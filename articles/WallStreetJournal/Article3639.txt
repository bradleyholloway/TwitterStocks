 Forget Good and Bad Fats: If You Want To Lose Weight, Cut Down on Calories   By By Tara Parker-Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2003  -- In terms of weight, does the fat content of a food count at all? Here's where it gets tricky. If you are dieting, then it doesn't matter if you consume fat calories or carbohydrate calories or protein calories, as long as you are in caloric deficit. "You could lose weight on 1,000 calories of butter," notes Thomas Wadden, director of the weight and eating disorders program at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, although he obviously doesn't advise it.  If you are overeating, you will gain more weight on a high-fat diet than on a high-carb diet. That's because it takes more energy for the body to convert carbohydrates to body fat than it takes to convert fat to body fat. So for every 100 excess calories of carbohydrates, 77 will end up on the body as extra fat. But if you eat 100 excess fat calories, 93 of them will be converted to body fat.  -- Isn't some fat better for you than others? Several readers were upset that last week's column noted the fat content of fast foods without distinguishing between good fats and bad fats. "Not all fat is created equal," wrote one reader. "Guacamole is very high in fat, but it's essential fat."
