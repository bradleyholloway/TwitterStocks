 Westinghouse Seeks Arbitrator in Dispute With Philippines Over $2.4 Billion Plant   By By Clare Ansberry and Matt Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 2, 1988  Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it has asked the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to arbitrate its differences with the Philippines over a $2.4 billion Westinghouse-built commercial nuclear power plant.  Meanwhile, as expected, the Philippine government filed a lawsuit alleging that Westinghouse obtained the nuclear plant contract through kickbacks and that the plant is unsafe. The suit, filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, asks that the contracts for the plant be rescinded.  Westinghouse contends that it has been unable to reach an agreement with the government under President Corazon Aquino because the plant was ordered by former President Ferdinand Marcos. The Philippine government has maintained that the plant is unsafe to operate.
