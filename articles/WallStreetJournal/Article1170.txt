Under the draft, rural workers with stable jobs will be included in the same pension system that exists for company employees in urban areas. Migrant workers who don't have stable jobs can join a new pension plan in which companies and individuals make compulsory contributions. The employee's contribution is limited to 5% of his or her monthly salary.
