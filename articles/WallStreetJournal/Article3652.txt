 Futures & Options: Opera Buffs   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  LOVED ONES in the spirit world. No, not an episode of "Crossing Over," but [Wagner]'s dreamlike opera about a ghost ship captain doomed to sail forever. It dates from 1841, and was Wagner's first opera to introduce a new dramatic subtlety to the form. He used brief melodic motifs to build a continuous web of music, creating an intense theatrical mood. This L.A. production has been directed by Julie Taymor, of "Lion King" fame. But never fear: no puppets. Evening performances at 7:30 p.m., matinee at 1 p.m. Tickets are $30-$170.  based on Oscar Wilde's equally racy play -- was a big hit for Strauss when it premiered in 1906. It won fans in many major opera houses, but couldn't get past the prudes in Vienna: Conductor Gustav Mahler was forbidden to stage it. Connecticut opera-goers can see what all the fuss was about. This is the opera with "Dance of the Seven Veils" -- and John the Baptist's head on a platter. The slinky costumes usually preclude plus-size divas in the title role. Tickets $20-$85. Evening performances 8 p.m., matinee 2 p.m.  THIS COMPANY stages opera classics in a traditional manner (no abstract Euro-moderne sets here). "Cavalleria Rusticana" is a one-act about a torrid Sicilian love affair. "Pagliacci," another one-act, concerns a heartbroken clown whose daughter falls for the wrong man. In an interesting twist, the director is Ira Siff, who has worked with New York's satiric La Gran Scena Opera Company playing an opera diva-in-drag. But he's doing these works straight. Evening performances at 8 p.m., matinees at 3 p.m. Tickets are $15-$85.
