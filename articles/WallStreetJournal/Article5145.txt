 Business Associations, Searching For Savings and Clout, May Merge   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1994  In many ways, it makes sense. Business executives have long griped about the cost of supporting the two general-interest lobbying organizations; about a fifth of the people on their membership rolls (each has about 3,500 members) belong to both groups. Officials estimate that a merger would allow the organizations to trim operating expenses by 15%.  Moreover, consolidation would permit the groups to concentrate their lobbying clout and combine their political-action committees. Although they rarely take positions at odds with each other, the crush of business groups -- including the Texas Association of Taxpayers, the Texas Civil Justice League and others -- often means that lobbying efforts get muddled.
