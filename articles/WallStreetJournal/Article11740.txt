 Creating an `Awesome' Baseball Card   By By Michael J. McCarthy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1993  Last year, Leaf Inc., noticing its Donruss-brand baseball cards were losing their appeal among younger collectors, set out on a redesign mission.  In focus-group research, grade schoolers, mostly boys, played a sorting game. They were asked to separate into piles the cards they liked, really liked, and didn't like. Invariably, the card-by-card reviews would go something like: "awesome," "common," "super awesome," "common." Cards that rated "awesome" and higher typically had action shots.
