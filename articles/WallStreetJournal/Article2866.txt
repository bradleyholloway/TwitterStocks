 A Look at What's in Store for Some Of the State's Biggest Retailers   By By Karen L. Tippett, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1996  During the past few weeks, many Florida retailers have reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, sending their stocks soaring. Such momentum is cheery news for the sector, long one of the most important in Florida. It did, after all, spend three years in a funk.  But retail's revival also poses investment risks. For one, since the comeback is still in its infancy, it's important for investors to monitor monthly sales figures, and overall shopping trends. It's also unlikely, given the current runup, that new investors will see tremendous gains. And some analysts point out that the year-over-year gains actually aren't so impressive, considering last year's depressed earnings.  "Claire's customers are a prime beneficiary of the minimum-wage increase," says David Buchsbaum, an analyst at Southeast Research Partners in Boca Raton. Other bright spots for the company include several earlier acquisitions that are bolstering earnings. For the second quarter ended Aug. 3, Claire's earnings increased 90% to $7.9 million, or 25 cents a share -- analysts had expected 22 cents.
