 Rising Fees Charged In Bankruptcy Cases Elicit a Backlash   By Wysocki, Bernard, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2007  Stephen Lubben, a professor at Seton Hall University law school, Newark, N.J., says bankruptcy fees are rising about as fast as compensation increases to junior lawyers in big law firms. In other words, fees are keeping pace with wage inflation. He argues that bankruptcy fees shouldn't be singled out, because corporate-advisory work is expensive. For instance, he says fees in the recent sale of Tribune Co. were roughly $100 million, a transaction that didn't involve bankruptcy.  United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger recently lashed out at the fees paid to professionals in the Delphi bankruptcy case, which have exceeded $200 million. "These guys are making a ton of money," Mr. Gettelfinger told a Detroit radio interviewer in July. "It's obscene. They're hogs slopping at the trough of corporate greed."  The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department and a watchdog over bankruptcy proceedings, has weighed in recently in opposition to fees. Three months ago, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a 53-page brief seeking to block $91 million in fees in the Adelphia case. The agency pushed to deny $26 million in fees billed by White & Case LLP, a law firm representing a note-holders committee, because the firm didn't explain what work it had performed.
