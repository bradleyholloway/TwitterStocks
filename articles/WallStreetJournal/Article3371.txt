 Bulls Roar Back With Broad Rally; Tech Stocks Help Lift Nasdaq 7.8%   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  The gains sent the Nasdaq Composite Index to its third-strongest percentage gain ever. Propelled by Microsoft's strong earnings report, the Nasdaq composite leapt 7.79%, or 247.04 points, to close at 3418.60.  In addition to staging two of its three biggest percentage gains in just the past five trading days, the Nasdaq composite's biggest percentage gain was also this year. The index soared 7.94% on May 30, as technology stocks were rebounding from weeks of punishment. Its biggest percentage loss took place during the 1987 crash (down 11.35%), but No. 2 on that list also was this year, in April. Recent gains have been punctuated by big losses.  Yesterday's rebound leaves the Nasdaq composite up 11.2% from its low for the year of 3074.68, set on Thursday of last week amid Mideast violence. The Nasdaq index is at its highest level in two weeks. But it still is down 32% from its March 10 record and down 16% for the year.
