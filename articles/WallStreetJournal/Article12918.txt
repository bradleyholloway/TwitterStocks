 Enterprise: Shift in Customer Base Transforms a Company --- Retailer Returns to Roots As Supplier and Finds The Ground Has Changed   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2003  Seigle's, growing out of an Elgin lumberyard founded in 1881, was initially a supplier to home builders. But as lumber yards morphed into home centers to cater to do-it-yourselfers, Seigle's bought up lumber outfits around Chicago, gaining enough bulk to buy its supplies more cheaply. By 1990, about 60% of its sales were to consumers, 40% to builders.  They soon began closing stores and by 1993 cast their lot with builders, who today account for 95% of Seigle's sales. Seigle's carries 1,500 or so products, down from 7,000 or so in the retail days. It employs 33 outside salespeople who, when they do their job very well, draw more in cash compensation than either of the brothers. "They're the lifeblood of the business," Mr Seigle says.  Going forward, Mr. Seigle sees more consolidation among home builders and, as a result, a significant threat. It's also an opportunity. Will national builders increasingly want to deal with national suppliers, cutting out local manufacturers like Seigle's? Will all sales also require the supplier to handle installation, meaning an ever-bigger skilled work force and therefore a burdensome cost structure?
