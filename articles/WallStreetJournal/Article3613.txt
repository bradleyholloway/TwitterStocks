 United They Fall   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2002  The airline industry is flying on empty, set to rack up some $7 billion in losses this year. Just last week, the major carriers reported significant third-quarter losses, and Delta said it would cut more than 10% of its work force. Some of this red ink is due to an industry slowdown after September 11, but most of it stems from plain old bad business practices. High fixed costs, primarily from expensive union contracts, are driving the industry bankrupt. And those all-time industry highs trace back to a bidding war that was started by United.  The problem was that in effect the owners sold their company not to the workers but to the unions. Workers couldn't sell their shares until they quit or retired. And almost immediately the unions reneged on their side of the bargain, working to win back everything they had given up to gain ownership. Pilots staged a slowdown in 2000 that the airline reckons cost $700 million. For this lack of cooperation, pilots won what would become the most expensive contract in history: An immediate pay raise of 22% to 28%, and a 4.5% annual raise through 2004.  Before long, every airline union was demanding "industry-leading" contracts. Delta pilots came first in April 2001, receiving raises of 24% to 39% over five years (cost to Delta: $2.4 billion). US Airways was also on the hook because its pilots' contract has a "parity" clause that forces it to reckon with Delta and United. Northwest's mechanics wangled a 24% wage increase.
