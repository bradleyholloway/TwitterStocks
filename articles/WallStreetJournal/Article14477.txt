 Eight-Day Advance Comes to an End As Business Dries Up for Many Brokers   By By William Power, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1988  The eight-day rally in over-the-counter stocks screeched to a halt yesterday, as retail OTC business all but dried up for many brokers.  "Retail volume was off today. The small John Q. Public isn't around, and that's the guy we need," said Roger "Buddy" West, president of Brokers Securities Inc., a Norfolk, Va., discount broker that specializes in OTC issues. Mr. West attributed the lack of interest to the general slowdown in volume on the New York Stock Exchange the past two weeks -- a trend that he and other market watchers said took time to catch up to the OTC market.  Smaller OTC stocks were weaker than bigger ones yesterday, another reflection of a lack of interest from retail customers. One way of measuring that: 20% of the 4,658 Nasdaq issues advanced yesterday; but of the Nasdaq issues that don't trade on the National Market System -- a category that includes the generally smaller and less heavily traded OTC issues -- only 8% advanced.
