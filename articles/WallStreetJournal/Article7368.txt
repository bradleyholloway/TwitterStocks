 Credit Lines: Offshore Funds Post Slight Losses; Swiss Regulators Eye Bond Market   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1985  A survey of 446 offshore funds by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. of New York found the majority of portfolios incurred slight losses in dollar terms last year. These funds, catering to individual investors, resemble U.S. mutual funds or British unit trusts. But they often are registered in such tax havens as the Channel Islands or the Bahamas, and they attract mainly expatriates interested in sophisticated investments.  While bullion languished, though, Hong Kong was a gold mine. Three funds that specialize in the colony averaged a 38% gain in dollar terms last year. Most profits came late in the year, as the colony's stock market took off following September's Sino-British accord on Hong Kong's future. So far this year, the Hong Kong funds continue to lead, with gains of at least 9%.  Last year's top performance came from the Schroder Hong Kong Fund, administered by Schroders & Chartered Ltd., a British financial group, with a 41% gain. It was followed by Henderson Baring Hong Kong Fund, up 38.1%, and by Old Court Hong Kong Fund, up 36.3%. (The Old Court fund is run by N.M. Rothschild & Sons, a British merchant bank.) Also among 1984's top 10 were two commodities and futures funds: Mint Ltd., which showed a 31.4% gain, and Futurgam S.A., which was up 20.9%.
