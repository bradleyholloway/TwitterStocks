 Priceline.com Reports Second Profitable Quarter   By By Julia Angwin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 2001  [Priceline] Chief Executive Richard S. Braddock warned that the company will see continued lower results until the travel industry rebounds. "The operating environment today for the whole industry is basically untenable," Mr. Braddock said. "I don't frankly think today's environment is going to last too long."  Priceline said it paid out $8.6 million in preferred-stock dividends during the third quarter. "We'll never pay that size dividend again," Mr. Braddock said. "It's going to be a much smaller amount in the future."  Separately, Priceline began accepting advertising on its Web site for the first time. The company announced an arrangement with Visa USA, and said more such arrangements are in the works. "We think that, done in the right way, advertising adds value to our service," Mr. Braddock said.
