 O'Neill Suggests the Economy May Grow Much More Slowly Than Bush Estimates   By By Damian Milverton and John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2001  Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill suggested that economic growth could be considerably less than the [Bush] administration's official estimate for 2002.  At a briefing before he left for meetings with Asian finance ministers, Mr. O'Neill told reporters that U.S. gross domestic product could increase 2.5% to 3% in 2002, or somewhat more. That compares with the White House Office of Management and Budget's own projection of 3.2%.  "I continue to be optimistic that as we go through the rest of this year and into 2002 that we will see a rekindling of economic growth, and that for all of 2002, we will see an economic growth rate in the range of at least 2.5% to 3%, maybe even a little bit better than that," Mr. O'Neill said. Questioned about his estimate, Mr. O'Neill added that growth could reach 3.5%.
