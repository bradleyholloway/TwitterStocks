 Developing Land Makes His Day --- Clint Eastwood Runs Gauntlet to Build His Golf Course   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  "I thought it would be nice to play with an affable group of people who share a philosophy" about how the game should be played, says Mr. (Clint) Eastwood, his nearly finished fairways unfolding around him on 2,010 pine and oak-dotted acres. Wearing a cap that says "Fac Diem Meam," or "Make My Day" in Latin, the 68-year-old golfer says he finds most courses too crowded and slow.  The problem is, there already are two dozen golf courses in Monterey county. Several more are being proposed, as entrepreneurs rush to serve aging baby boomers who are dumping skis and lifting clubs. They include a second course on the drawing board at Pebble Beach Co., whose popular AT&T Pebble Beach tournament last week was chaired by Mr. Eastwood. Predictably, the peninsula's propagating greens and fairways have caused concern about the destruction of one of the last remaining coastal paradises and its fragile water supply. And Dave Potter, a county supervisor, frets that "If you deface Monterey, tourists will go to Mendocino instead."  Mr. Eastwood's contentious role as land developer is an odd twist for the star actor/director of 57 movies over the past 40 years. While real estate hasn't exactly been a second career for him, it turns out to have been quite an important part of his life. Mr. Eastwood's dealings cast a new light on one of America's top stars, showing he is just as adept at directing a team of land and tax lawyers, investment advisers, architects and developers, as he is at running the crews on a movie set. Indeed, his stint as mayor of Carmel in the late 1980s, which followed a fight over one of his early developments, showed that he doesn't brook opposition lightly.
