 France's NATO Gambit   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2003  Fortunately, they are meeting resistance from Italy, Britain and Spain -- three of the five largest EU members -- as well as the majority of the East Europeans now joining both NATO and the EU. Said Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at an EU summit late last week, "European defense must complement NATO and by no means be an alternative to NATO." Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair has also backed away from conciliatory comments toward the EU plan that had some U.S. officials worried he might be looking to tack toward the French after the Iraq furor.  One irony here is that the same Europeans who are most critical of a supposedly "unilateral" America are undermining the world's most effective multilateral institution. It's true that a separate EU military force won't compete with NATO overnight. But over the years it will become a competing power center and erode NATO's effectiveness and clout. This is no doubt precisely what Mr. [Jacques Chirac] has in mind, and other Europeans have to realize what is being decided.
