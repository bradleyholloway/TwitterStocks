 Defiant Chechnya Tests Moscow's Empire --- Small Civil War May Bring Biggest Russian Strike Since Afghan Invasion   By By Claudia Rosett, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 9, 1994  This city of low brick buildings and busy street markets is the capital of Russia's most rebellious region, the breakaway Chechen Republic. The Chechens' defiance of Russia has flared into a small civil war that now threatens to bring on Moscow's largest military strike since the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.  For Russia, there are other alarming echoes of Afghanistan. Chechnya is a Moslem republic, threatening to fight a guerrilla war in the Caucasus mountains of southern Russia, should Moscow's army invade. In an effort to avert this unpleasant prospect, Russian politicians have been shuttling to and from Grozny but with no resolution yet in sight. Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced Wednesday he would use "all constitutional means" to disarm the Chechens -- widely understood as a threat to send in troops.  Few Chechens seem to care that Russia's government today is no longer totalitarian, but democratic. Kicked around by Russian rulers for centuries, these people have little faith that Russia offers its citizens good things ahead. "You can never trust Russia," says another young Chechen, who adds that he will fight to the death against any Russian incursion.
