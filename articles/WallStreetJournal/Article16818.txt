 Politics & Economics: Banks Fear Democrat Bids To Aid Mortgage Borrowers   By Paletta, Damian, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  The new bill, sponsored by Reps. Brad Miller (D., N.C.) and Linda Sanchez (D., Calif.), would allow bankruptcy judges to change the interest rate and length of a mortgage for borrowers in bankruptcy, in an effort to avoid foreclosure. It could also potentially allow judges to change the balance of a loan. For example, if a borrower near foreclosure owed $125,000 on a house now worth $100,000, the judge could mark $25,000 as "unsecured debt," which would make it much harder for the bank to recover that portion.  Several large banks, including Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Wells Fargo & Co., have organized to fight the proposal. In a letter last month to House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, the banks and others warned that the bill would "prevent many low- and moderate-income Americans from owning homes."  White House and Treasury Department officials have raised concerns about the proposals, echoing many of the banking industry's warnings. "We think it could reduce mortgage availability . . . and increase mortgage rates, which could tend to compound the problem," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
