 Central Banks Force Dollar Lower --- But Short-Term Bulls Feed on Its Strength   By By Charles Hunter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 20, 1989  The U.S. currency punched its way through a pack of interest-rate increases in Europe and didn't start to weaken until afternoon trading in New York, after nine nations' central banks piled on to help drive it down in heavy trading.  In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8548 marks and 128.73 yen, compared with 1.8715 marks and 128.55 yen late Wednesday. Its slight rise against the yen wasn't reflected in other currencies, as it weakened against the pound, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar.  The currency showed little reaction after West Germany raised its two key lending rates by half a percentage point each, to 4% and 6%, and central banks in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and Austria announced half-point increases in several of their rates. Late in the European trading day, the dollar was still quoted at 1.8650 marks, down less than half a pfennig from its opening level. "The response isn't worth mentioning," said Peter Pietsch, an economist for Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, West Germany.
