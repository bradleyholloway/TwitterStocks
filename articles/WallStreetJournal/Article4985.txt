 Big Tool Makers Expected to Post Higher Earnings --- First-Quarter Improvement Is Likely Despite Weak Sales in Other Nations   By By Erle Norton, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 1993  "The first quarter started slow," said William L. Potter, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. "It wasn't until the February announcement of industry orders that we saw the orders beginning to pick up." Industry shipments rose 34.5% to $485.1 million in January and February. Even then, strong orders weren't enough to offset weak overseas orders.  The nation's biggest machine tool maker, Giddings & Lewis Inc., is aided by its emphasis on complex, often customized machining systems, which companies buy even in economic downturns to boost productivity. The Fond Du Lac, Wis., company should earn 28 cents a share, according to consensus analysts' estimates compiled by First Call Corp., up from $7.3 million, or 23 cents a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split. Giddings's bottom line is also benefiting from cost-cutting in the wake of its 1991 acquisition of Cross & Trecker Corp., said Mr. Potter.
