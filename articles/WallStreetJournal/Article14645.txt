 Vernes's Response to Offer From Suez Confuses Battle Over Cie. Industrielle   By By Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1989  Jean-Marc Vernes's decision to fight Cie. Financiere de Suez's bid for Cie. Industrielle and Groupe Victoire without making a counterbid throws France's biggest-ever takeover battle into deeper confusion.  Mr. Vernes, Industrielle's chairman, said he would neither launch a bid to top Suez's double-barreled 23.7 billion French franc ($3.57 billion) takeover offer nor throw in the towel.  Instead, Mr. Vernes indicated he will try to destabilize Suez's bid for control of Industrielle, a holding company whose main asset is a 40% stake in the Victoire insurance group.
