 Rostenkowski Says Trade Bill Will Come First --- Panel to Consider Proposal To Limit Some Imports Before Tax Overhaul   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 1985  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, acknowledging resistance in the House Ways and Means Committee to writing a tax-overhaul bill, said the panel first will deal with the politically urgent issue of trade.  The trade bill isn't likely to delay work on the tax bill significantly. At the same time, however, Rep. Rostenkowski said there's a "hesitancy" among committee members about drafting the controversial tax bill. "It's going to be a difficult process," he said.  Rep. Rostenkowski, who has been President Reagan's chief congressional ally on tax revision, was clearly distancing himself a bit from the tax-revision effort, which has been getting little support in Congress. His comments yesterday at a news conference were designed in part to identify him more closely with the emerging trade issue. Still, the chairman said he opposes permanent quotas and won't vote for the textile bill. The Reagan administration also opposes it.
