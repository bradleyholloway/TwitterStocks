 FPL Unit Tackles Turtle Problem At Nuclear Plant   By By Jennifer Morrow, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2002  The move comes after biologists captured a record 601 turtles in the canals last year. Six of those turtles were dead. One more, and the plant could have been fined for violating federal endangered-species regulations. Despite the danger, the turtles keep coming.  Sixty-eight turtles were captured last year, and 11 injured turtles were taken to a rehabilitation center for care, spokesman Mac Harris said."Most were healthy," Mr. Harris said. Two floated in dead, and another perished after getting stuck in the canal, he said.  The 7,000 acres of warm, secluded cooling canals around FPL's Turkey Point plant farther south are home to hundreds of crocodiles. In fact, they're one of only three areas in the U.S. where crocodiles nest. About 300 of the reptiles are born in the plant's canals every year.
