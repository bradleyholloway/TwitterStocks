 Seekers of Armageddon in South Africa   By By Stephen Mulholland, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 1988  Perhaps Oscar Dhlomo, minister of education and culture of Kwazulu, homeland of South Africa's six million Zulus, has read Revel. In any event, Mr. Dhlomo understands better than do most U.S. congressmen that if the South African economy is destroyed by sanctions, so, too, will be the prospects for revolutionary, or even evolutionary, change.  Mr. Dhlomo is not alone in believing an apocalyptic end is possible for South Africa if the economy is destroyed. John Makatini, U.N. representative of the African National Congress, the exiled black liberation movement that supports sanctions, believes so, too. And he welcomes it. In New York in 1986 he declared that "if there were only four million of us left after the revolution, that would be better than the present situation." Mr. Makatini was aware, when he said this, that he was talking about the deaths of up to 25 million blacks and several million whites.  What can be the purpose of stimulating unemployment? One can only assume that the proponents of such a policy hope that when a sufficient number of starving blacks have been thrown on the street, their children sick, dying or dead, their jobs and prospects destroyed, and their homes derelict, they will rise up and throw off the yoke of apartheid. This scenario would probably bring about Mr. Dhlomo's nightmare of the white South African Hitler with the blood of millions of black South Africans on his hands, not to mention devastation in the entire subcontinent. Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Swaziland would all be sucked into the vortex. Their already largely subsistence economies would be destroyed.
