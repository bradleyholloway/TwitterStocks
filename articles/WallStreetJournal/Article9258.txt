 Firestone Finds More Problems In One Line and Left Rear Tire   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  Determining what went wrong with the tires is crucial for Firestone in trying to assure consumers that the problem can and will be corrected. In August, Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires, linked to 119 deaths in the U.S. and more than 40 overseas, involving accidents mainly on Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer sports-utility vehicle. Firestone has been trying to pinpoint the cause ever since, conducting its own internal analysis as well as monitoring the work of an independent expert, Sanjay Govindjee, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  Firestone has also determined that the vast majority of claims on the recalled tires involve a left rear tire, leading to questions about how a vehicle's design puts more load or stress on that particular tire. In testing on Explorers, Firestone's Greer Tidwell said that even when sitting still, the left rear tire on the Explorer experienced a greater weight load. The load on the tires can affect the temperature of the materials inside the tire, which Firestone measured with an internal thermometer.
