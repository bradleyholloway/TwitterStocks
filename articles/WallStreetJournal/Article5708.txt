 Review / Books It's a Long Way to the Green   By By Jay Nordlinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 1999  The latest to tell the tales is David Owen, in "The Making of the Masters." Mr. Owen writes for the New Yorker and is known to golf fans as the author of "My Usual Game" (1995), a collection of valentines to his sport. His Masters book follows, by exactly a year, Curt Sampson's contribution, "The Masters," a superb exploration of the tournament, in spots cheeky and iconoclastic.  Or had been. Mr. Owen presents an almost warm and cuddly Roberts, widely misunderstood and maligned. "The real Roberts," he contends, "is as hard to see as the real (Bobby) Jones," shrouded in myth. He goes about erasing "the cartoon that so often stands in for" his man, and to a large degree he succeeds. Mr. Owen writes protectively about Roberts, saying, for example, that "sportswriters who wouldn't dream of quoting a baseball score without double-checking it have felt no compunction about repeating and embellishing even the unlikeliest tales about Roberts." He makes the excellent point that, if Roberts "really had been the monster" of lore, "Jones would never have associated with him."  At times, however, Mr. Owen fails in his aim of refurbishing the old coot's image. Paragraphs intended to exonerate Roberts show him as the nasty and vainglorious piece of work he sometimes was. He really did give Jack Whitaker the shaft, pressuring CBS to remove him from its Masters telecast for the flimsiest offenses. Yet Mr. Owen makes us wish we had known Roberts, if only to judge him for ourselves -- no small achievement. He writes beautifully, too, meandering through the familiar byways, enveloping us in the Augusta-ness of it all. It must be noted, though: Most of this terrain is overtrodden, and Mr. Owen is reduced to carping at his fellow writers for the tiniest inaccuracies.
