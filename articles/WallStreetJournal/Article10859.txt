 General Motors To Assemble Cars in Egypt --- Project Also to Bring Nation 22 Auto-Part Factories; GM Beats Fiat, Nissan   By By Barbara Rosewicz, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1986  The Egyptian government has accepted a General Motors Corp. proposal to assemble cars in Egypt, and to bring 22 auto-part plants to the country. GM officials announced in Cairo.  The GM proposal, which still needs final approval from the U.S. auto maker's board of directors, calls for assembling GM cars in a joint venture with Egypt's state-owned Nasr Car Co. In addition, 22 auto-part makers have agreed to follow GM to Egypt to set up plants.  The arrangement also makes sense for GM because the 22 car-parts plants will provide a source of inexpensive parts for GM's European operations. GM is promising to buy an estimated 60% of the parts produced in Egypt for shipment to Europe; the parts are expected to be attractively priced because of Egypt's low wages.
