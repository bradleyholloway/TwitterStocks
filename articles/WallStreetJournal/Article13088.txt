 3M Innovation Will Juice Power Lines   By Ahlberg, Erik, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2004  3M's power line, which became available earlier this year, got a boost in August when Xcel Energy Inc. agreed to use the material as an upgrade to a 10-mile section of the utility's transmission wires in Minnesota. Xcel Energy, of Minneapolis, got early access to the material through a special pilot program with 3M and -- after putting the material through the paces -- was impressed enough to begin commercial installation next year.  Side by side, the two cables look identical, but 3M says the aluminum-zirconium alloy can handle a continuous temperature of 410 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas standard aluminum breaks down at above 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, 3M's composite core is stiffer and stronger than steel but half the weight. That means it won't sag as much and can carry more electricity.  American Electric Power Inc., which has roughly 39,000 miles of transmission wires in 11 U.S. states, has been following the development of 3M's power line and has held meetings with 3M officials to discuss the details, said Dale Krumman, who oversees transmission research for the Ohio utility. Though the company hasn't yet signed any deals, AEP has a handful of areas that would be well suited for such an upgrade, he said.
