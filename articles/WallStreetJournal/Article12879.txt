 Commodities Report: Silver Attains Six-Month Highs In Bid to Overtake Pace of Gold   By By Gavin Maguire OsterDowJones Commodity News, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2003  CRUDE OIL: Contracts on Nymex rallied amid fresh evidence of the impact of the monthlong strike in Venezuela on global supplies. Petrologistics, a Geneva tanker tracker, said crude-oil output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries slid 1.9 million barrels a day, or 8%, to 22.7 million barrels a day in December, mostly as a result of Venezuela's near absence from the market. Meanwhile, Reuters reported OPEC President Abdullah al-Attiyah said the cartel was poised to boost crude supplies by as much as one million barrels per day in a bid to tame oil prices which have rocketed to two-year highs. "An increase could be anywhere between 500,000 barrels per day to one million barrels per day. . . . It will depend on consultations," Mr. Attiyah told Reuters.  Other traders agreed that silver has trailed gold noticeably over recent months, but noted along with Mr. Sanik that silver's peculiar demand-and-supply fundamentals aren't as supportive as those of gold. "As a general industrial metal [excluding photography use], silver has been suffering because of weak economic conditions," said Mr. Sanik.
