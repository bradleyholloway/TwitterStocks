 Politics & Economics: Terror Attacks Resemble '04 Plot; U.K. Officials Study Possible Link to 'Rhyme' Figures as Arrests Grow   By Robert Block in Washington, Ian McDonald in Glasgow, Scotland, and Jeanne Whalen and Carrick Mollenkamp in London, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  Suspects in the recent U.K. attacks are from a range of ethnic backgrounds. Those arrested include two doctors who have been licensed to practice in the U.K. since 2005 and 2006. The doctors are Mohammed Asha and Bilal Abdulla, according to a person familiar with the probe. Dr. Asha holds a medical degree from Jordan and first registered as a doctor to practice in the U.K. in 2005. Dr. Abdulla, U.K. records indicate, received his medical degree in Baghdad and was granted a right to practice medicine in the U.K. last year.  In the U.K., doctors holding medical degrees from countries outside the U.K. or European Union are required to go through a number of background checks performed by the General Medical Council, a body that registers and tracks doctors in the U.K., before they can practice in the U.K., according to a GMC spokeswoman.  Jordanian officials said records from their country indicate Dr. Asha was an academic star in both high school and university who didn't display any noticeable ties to radical Islamic groups. After graduating from medical school in Jordan, he took up residence in the U.K. and married a long-time girlfriend. Dr. Asha's father, in the Jordanian capital, denied to news agencies that his son had anything to do with al Qaeda or terrorist conspiracies.
