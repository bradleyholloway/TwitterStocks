 PEOPLE PATTERNS   By By Diane Crispell of American Demographics magazine, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1994  Three in four women think bra ads sell from a man's perspective, while 53% think the ads are sexist, according to a survey by EDK Associates of New York for its EDK Forecast newsletter, which tracks women's consumer attitudes. These percentages are higher among women aged 45 and older, which means advertisers may need to change their approach if they want to appeal to aging baby boomers.  Nine in 10 women aged 45 to 54 and 85% of those aged 55 and older think the ads use a male perspective, compared with 70% of those under 45. Sixty-eight percent of those aged 55 and older and 59% of those aged 45 to 54 think the ads are sexist, compared with 53% of those aged 35 to 44 and 41% of those under 35. Regardless of age, most women say they don't feel inferior to models in bra ads, ranging from 59% of those aged 35 to 44 to 68% of those aged 45 to 54.  Women buy bras that are comfortable. Seventy-eight percent say they would choose a comfortable bra over one with sex appeal, while only 16% claim the opposite. The share who would sacrifice comfort for appearance is highest among those under age 35, at 25%. Even the youngest women buy bras to please themselves: Just 7% of women under 35 buy bras with men in mind. The share for all women is 3%.
