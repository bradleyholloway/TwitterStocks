 Business and Finance [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1992  PAYROLLS GREW slightly in March, offering new evidence that the economy is growing, but very slowly. The unemployment rate remained at 7.3% as more people joined the labor force. Bond prices rallied on the weaker-than-expected jobs data. Treasury bonds rose about 3/8 point.  Sales of domestic cars rose modestly in late March from earlier in the month, but not enough to signal the arrival of a solid sales recovery. The sales level was down from a year earlier, but sales of trucks surged 16.8%.  Sam Walton died of bone cancer at age 74 after building Wal-Mart into the largest U.S. retail chain by popularizing discount pricing and by targeting small towns. His formula is widely expected to keep the company growing.
