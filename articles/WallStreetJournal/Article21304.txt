 Drexel's Lock on Junk Bond Market May Be Loosening   By By Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1989  Despite Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s success in selling $5 billion of RJR Nabisco Inc. junk notes recently, signs are increasing that Drexel's hammerlock on the $188 billion junk market is loosening.  This year, again, Drexel already has leapfrogged its rivals in overall underwriting with $5 billion of RJR Nabisco's short-term "bridge" notes in the past month. Drexel sold these notes privately to investors.  But it's a different story in the underwriting of junk bonds that are sold publicly. For the first time, Drexel isn't the leader in this important segment of the junk market. "So far this year, Drexel is No. 5, behind Goldman, Merrill, First Boston and Morgan Stanley," says Fran Wissack, an analyst for Securities Data Co. "There has never been a year when Drexel wasn't No. 1 at this point in public deals."
