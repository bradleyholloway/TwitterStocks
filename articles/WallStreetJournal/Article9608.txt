 The Economy: Office Vacancies Continue to Climb As Rents Decline   By Chittum, Ryan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2003  "All indications are that we've bottomed out," said Bruce Mosler, president of U.S. operations for Cushman & Wakefield, a New York-based international provider of commercial real-estate services. "There are indications of pent-up demand, and signs of improvement to come."  Kansas City and Raleigh-Durham performed best in the second quarter, each absorbing about 400,000 square feet of office space. Kansas City's vacancy rate fell to 17.6% from 18.5% and Raleigh-Durham's vacancies fell to 20.2% from 21.5%.  Some say the market faces obstacles that may be underestimated. "Shadow space," which is extra room a tenant isn't using and not putting on the market for sublease, may be underestimated because of recent accounting-rules changes, said Kenneth Rudy, managing director of corporate finance for Jones Lang LaSalle, an international commercial real-estate services firm in Chicago.
