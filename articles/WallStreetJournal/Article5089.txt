 Time Limits Are Sought on Liability for Cleanup Costs --- Groups Want to Cut Uncertainty Small Firms Face in Assessment Process   By By Jeanne Saddler, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1994  Several small business and environmental groups today will jointly recommend setting time limits on the liabilities of small companies to pay cleanup costs at toxic-waste sites.  In a letter to President Clinton, the groups will propose giving the government strict deadlines for determining a small company's share of the cleanup costs at a site governed by the federal Superfund law. Under the proposal, a company that contributed little to a toxic-waste site would be released from its cleanup costs if federal officials took more than 10 months to determine its share of those costs. Currently, it can take five to seven years to determine responsibility.  Superfund poses big problems for small companies. Although small concerns usually contributed little to the waste sites in question, they have often become the target of lawsuits by big companies seeking to cut their cleanup costs by collecting from other businesses that used the same sites. Defense against these so-called "third-party suits" has created heavy legal expenses for many small companies. The unresolved liability or the cleanup have also made it harder for some to obtain credit.
