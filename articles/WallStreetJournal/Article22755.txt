 `Man Who Ruined Politics' Finds His Holy Grail Now Within Reach   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2001  At 62 years old, with wispy hair and a white mustache, Mr. [Fred Wertheimer] looks a bit like the excitable grandfather in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." As lawmakers debated during the past two weeks, he has been a ubiquitous presence in the Senate Reception Room, where lobbyists gather when the chamber is in session. Since the money-and-politics debate began, the room has been largely empty, save for Mr. Wertheimer and his small band of reform advocates. "It's a peaceful place to work when campaign finance comes up," says Mr. Wertheimer, an informal adviser to Sens. John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Russell Feingold (D., Wisc.), the bill's chief sponsors.  Long before it was fashionable, Mr. Wertheimer was complaining -- loudly and often -- that the unregulated "soft-money" contributions collected by political parties corrupted the system. The McCain-Feingold bill would ban those contributions and put new limits on independent political groups, while boosting the caps on donations made directly to candidates.
