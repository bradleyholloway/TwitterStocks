 Cutting a Deal With the IRS Has Grown Increasingly Taxing   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  "I wouldn't make an offer if I didn't think it would be approved. Now, I'm down in the 70% bracket, and I'm using the same diligence," he says. Enrolled agents are tax preparers who are authorized to represent taxpayers to the IRS.  The offer-in-compromise program can be misunderstood. "I've had doctors walk in with millions of dollars of assets in real estate who want an offer in compromise because they're having a bad year. I have to explain to them, 'No way,'" says Jayme Gallenson, an enrolled agent with H&R Block Inc. in Corte Madera, Calif. If people have the assets or the ability to work to pay their tax bills, they are normally going to be held to it, he says.  What's more, recent legislation has prompted the IRS to approve partial-payment installment agreements, "the notion being that if the taxpayer is down on their luck and can afford to pay $100 a month, it's better to get the $100 a month than to get nothing," says Frank Degen, an enrolled agent on New York's Long Island.
