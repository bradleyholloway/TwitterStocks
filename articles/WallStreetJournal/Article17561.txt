 Vulture Funds Rise as Property Falls --- Latest Fad in Real Estate Chills Some Experts   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1986  Such funds buy troubled and sometimes unfinished properties at bargain prices, using cash raised from institutions or individuals. They're betting that the more than year-long real estate slump in major cities and suburbs will soon end, turning their money-losing properties into gold mines.  Several billion dollars worth of vulture funds are already in the works for 1986, with some of the biggest players in the real estate business considering them: Lincoln Property Co., Unicorp American Corp., JMB Realty Corp. and VMS Realty Inc.  But as the funds grow hotter, some real estate experts are feeling a chill. They say that few fund organizers have experience in turning around distressed properties and that too many funds looking for properties may crowd the market, pushing up real estate prices. They also fret that the funds are so risky that they may not attract enough investors. Perhaps most troubling, they say, is that the funds are based on a timing wager that, if wrong, could spell disaster.
