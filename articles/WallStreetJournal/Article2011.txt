 Florida Ruling Blocking Children From Playing Near Power Lines May Fuel Growing Controversy   By By Bill Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1989  A Florida judge, in a ruling that could affect thousands of schools and other public buildings, recently ordered children not to play in a schoolyard near overhead power lines because the electromagnetic field emitted by the lines may eventually be found to cause or promote cancer.  The little-noticed, first-of-its-kind decision handed down earlier this month is likely to fuel the growing controversy over whether power-line fields constitute a health hazard. More than 50 other lawsuits are pending against utilities and public officials around the U.S., with most seeking to prevent power-line construction.  In a study published last week, the congressional Office of Technology found that the controversy has "prompted vigorous public intervention and litigation which has significantly impeded the ability of private and public utilities to construct new power transmission facilities." The electric utility industry also says badly needed power lines aren't getting built.
