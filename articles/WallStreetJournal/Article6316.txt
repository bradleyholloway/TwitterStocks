 Google's IPO Feels European; Emphasis on Stakeholders Has Them Smiling Overseas   By Rhoads, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2004  In its IPO prospectus issued last month, the Google founders embraced the "stakeholder" approach to corporate governance, in which a company's employees, the environment the business operates in and a company's role in society are just as important as shareholders. Google employees, for instance, will be allowed to spend 20% of their work time any way they choose.  Porsche says quarterly reporting increases the volatility of its stock and diverts management from strategic goals. "We have ignited a public discussion of this issue in Germany," said Manfred Ayasse, Porsche's head of investor relations. "[Google] could do the same."  "Quarterly results in the U.S. didn't prevent the bubble collapse or huge problems such as Enron," said Alexandre Etuy, an investor relations official at Cie. de Saint-Gobain, a French glass and building-materials company. "But the European model didn't prevent Parmalat either. Maybe there is no perfect solution."
