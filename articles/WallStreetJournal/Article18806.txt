 Swiss Bank sets sights in U.S. on small firms   By Raghavan, Anita, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1996  In a move that raised eyebrows on Wall Street, an unusual letter was sent in May 1996 to three small US securities firms from SBC Warburg Inc, the investment-banking arm of Swiss Bank Corp.

The overture could be a prelude to an eventual bid by the Swiss Bank unit to acquire one of these firms.
