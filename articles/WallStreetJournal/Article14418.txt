 Film: Attenborough and Apartheid   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1987  "Cry Freedom" is billing itself as "The True Story of the Friendship That Shook South Africa and Awakened the World." That may be the film director Richard Attenborough set out to make, but it isn't the film he made. The film he made is so wrongheaded, stultified and incoherent it's hard to tell exactly what it is. Roughly, you could say it's the story of how a white liberal journalist got his story -- and how he got it out of South Africa.  Mr. Attenborough has been congratulating himself in the press for his willingness to tackle this "controversial" subject (though who in his world -- the film-making world -- would object to an anti-apartheid position?). Perhaps he should be congratulated for persuading a Hollywood studio to back a movie about a political figure -- but why wouldn't it? He is, after all, the man who made a commercial movie out of the life of Mahatma Gandhi.  Here Mr. Attenborough has avoided the tragic story of the martyrdom of Stephen Biko, the young black leader who was beaten to death in a South African jail. Instead, the director has chosen to focus on Donald Woods, a former newspaper editor who became Mr. Biko's friend and biographer -- and who served as a consultant for this movie, which was based on his books.
