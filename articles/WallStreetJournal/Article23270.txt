 Kinder Morgan, TRW Automotive Post Gains; Nasdaq Hits 4-Year High, Driven by the Chip Sector; Tyco, Foot Locker Decline   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2005  Maxim Integrated Products (Nasdaq) gained $3.49, or 8.3%, to $45.50. The chip maker's fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by lower costs. The news helped galvanize other semiconductor makers, including Dow industrial average component Intel, which gained 45 cents, or 1.7%, to 27.56 on the Nasdaq.  Cnooc's American depositary shares rose 4.15, or 6%, to 73.49. The Chinese oil company pulled out of the running for Unocal, ending a politically charged $18.5 billion attempt to assume control of the ninth-largest U.S. oil producer. Cnooc's withdrawal clears the way for Chevron to go ahead with a $17.5 billion deal for Unocal it originally cut back in April. Chevron gained 1.13, or 1.9%, to 59.56 and Unocal added 16 cents to 64.53.  DaimlerChrysler gained 1.37, or 2.8%, to 50.74. The auto maker's Chrysler Group plans a major revamp of its manufacturing process that it hopes will shave billions of dollars off the cost of developing and producing cars over many years. Otherwise, investors weren't very impressed with word that U.S. auto makers posted very strong July sales. General Motors lost 33 cents to 36.53 and Ford Motor added 3 cents to 10.88.
