 Nasdaq's Share of New Issues Is Falling As Big Board and Amex Make Inroads   By By William Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1988  Almost all new issues of common stock used to begin their trading lives on the over-the-counter market; the Nasdaq OTC system launched the stocks of Genentech Inc., Apple Computer Inc., MCI Communications Corp. and thousands of other established companies. (Some, such as Genentech, later moved to the New York Stock Exchange; others, such as Apple and MCI, have stayed with Nasdaq.)  Several years ago, Nasdaq was launching 99% of all new stock issues, but the percentage has been slowly dropping. So far in 1988, Nasdaq has an 81% share of the action -- still well ahead of the Big Board's 8.8% and the American Stock Exchange's 10.4% share.  Moreover, in dollar value, Nasdaq has fallen behind the Big Board in the new-issue game the past two years. Nasdaq has had $8.2 billion of new offerings in that period, while the Big Board has launched $9.1 billion. The Amex trails with $2.6 billion, or 12% in dollar terms.
