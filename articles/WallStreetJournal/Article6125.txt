 Stocks Fall, Corporate Bonds Wobble --- Dow Industrials' Drop of 215.22 Sparks a Rally in Treasurys; Investors Fret About Debt Loads   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  Investors shifted money into safe U.S. Treasurys, as they have for much of the stock swoon, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up 16/32 to 106 20/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, dropped to 3.571%, its lowest level in 44 years. The dollar fell to 99.01 euros from 99.12 euros Tuesday.  While money continued to flow into Treasurys, all kinds of corporate bonds, including both those rated investment grade and lower-rated junk bonds, are sinking. Junk bonds have an average yield of about 14% -- with bonds of some troubled telecom companies offering yields of 20% or more -- putting the average yield more than 10 percentage points higher than comparable 10-year Treasurys. That is the widest difference on record and a sign investors are nervous about the prospects of the most troubled companies possibly defaulting on their debt and thus are demanding a higher yield to offset the risk.  even investment-grade bonds are under pressure, with spreads continuing to widen compared with Treasurys. Top-rated corporate bonds yield around 5.25%, or 1.75 percentage points more than 10-year Treasurys. The difference in yields was just 1.55 points as recently as in June.
