 IBM's Net Rose 3.1% in Quarter On Weak Sales --- First-Period Shipments Off; '86 Prospects Uncertain As Capital Outlays Lag   By By John Marcom Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1986  IBM said shipments declined world-wide, a drop estimated by analysts at between 5% and 10%. And its profit would have fallen slightly without the aid of a weakening dollar and an accounting change. IBM also repeated earlier warnings that the outlook for 1986 remains uncertain because of sluggish capital spending. The report suggests that any recovery in the computer industry as a whole isn't yet in sight.  Profit was $1.02 billion, or $1.65 a share, compared with $986 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier. IBM said the results included a net gain of less than $15 million resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard for pensions. Despite the lower shipments, a sharp gain in service revenue resulted in a 3.7% gain in total revenue to $10.13 billion from $9.77 billion.  Analysts expect most other makers of large computers, with the principal exception of Digital Equipment Corp., to also report weak first-quarter results. "Given what else is going to transpire around it, IBM is going to look pretty good," said Daniel Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. Most analysts continue to predict at least a slight gain in full-year profit for IBM, though many have cut estimates in recent months.
