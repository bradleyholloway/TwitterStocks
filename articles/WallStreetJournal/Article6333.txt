 Corporate Gadflies Are the Buzz; Shareholder Activists Sting Company Boards in Proxy Wars; 'They Treated Us Like Lepers'   By Kim, Queena Sook, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2004  "We're passing proposals and that's something we've never done before," says Nick Rossi, 42 years old.

Undeterred, Mr. Rossi took to upbraiding board members during the question-and-answer period at annual shareholders meeting. "I jumped on them for not having minorities, which apparently embarrassed them," Mr. Rossi says.

"Companies looked at individual investors like us as gadflies but we've reached a point where we're legitimate."
