 Anheuser-Busch Cos. Allowed to Withhold Document at Trial   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1988  ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. won't have to make public a potentially embarrassing corporate document in the trial of two former executives charged in a kickback scandal.  Lawyers for the brewer have won their battle over defense attorneys' request seeking a copy of the company's own investigation 18 months ago. The defense is apparently seeking to prove that the practice of accepting gifts from suppliers was widespread among Anheuser-Busch executives.
