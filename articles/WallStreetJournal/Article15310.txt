 World Wire [2]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1995  A B.A.T Industries PLC unit has stopped making 555 brand cigarettes in Vietnam. The British company, which got its production license in November, said it couldn't compete with low prices of millions of smuggled 555s that flooded the market. Vietnam bans imports of finished cigarettes and producers must pay taxes of about 40% of sale prices. Smuggling of goods into Vietnam is common, and the government in February began selling confiscated contraband cigarettes through state-run firms for about a third of retail prices, though these sales generated only half the revenue of taxed legal products.  Giordano Holdings Ltd., a clothing retailer with Asian operations, plans to shift its legal domicile to Bermuda from Hong Kong, joining the flood of companies choosing legal security prior to the British colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Giordano said it would keep its headquarters in Hong Kong. As of the end of 1994, more than half of Hong Kong's 529 listed companies were domiciled in Bermuda or the British West Indies, which also have business-friendly taxation. Giordano's founder, Jimmy Lai, was replaced as chairman after he got into hot water with Chinese authorities for printing a critical article in his political magazine.
