 Sugar Prices Settle Much Higher on Speculation That Big Purchase Was Made in World Market   By By John Valentine, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 1989  Sugar futures prices rose sharply on a report of a large purchase in the world market and the prospect of more purchases. According to one rumor, even China bought a significant amount of sugar.  Another analyst explained that a substantial part of India's sugar production had been diverted to other types of sugar preferred by Indians. The diversion hadn't been stopped or slowed by the government, he said, because it appeared at the time that India's crop would be ample enough to permit the diversion.  China yesterday was rumored to have bought 300,000 tons of sugar on the world market. However, one analyst emphasized, "It is totally a rumor without any confirmation whatsoever." But in the nervous atmosphere generated by the continuing crisis in China, the speculation may have added support to the market even though traders preferred to wait for confirmation.
