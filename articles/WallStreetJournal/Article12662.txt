 Panel Is Near Pact in Dispute On Stock Data   By By Judith Burns, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  After only a few meetings, the advisory committee has reached agreement on some key issues, Annette Nazareth, director of the SEC's market regulation division, said Saturday at the annual "SEC Speaks" conference here. At a daylong session last week, most advisory committee members agreed that markets should be legally required to issue a minimum amount of trading information, but be free to provide more data if they wish, she noted.  "No one liked the concept that we set forth," Ms. Nazareth acknowledged, so the SEC took the "somewhat unusual step" of creating an advisory committee led by Washington University Law School Dean Joel Seligman.
