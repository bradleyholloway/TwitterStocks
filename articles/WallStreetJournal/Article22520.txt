 New NATO Official Faces Battles After Kosovo --- Italian Admiral Must Calm Tension   By By Stephen J. Glain, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1999  Adm. (Guido) Venturoni later this week will fill the seat held by German Gen. Klaus Naumann, who has waged a largely rear-guard action to retool NATO from a defensive alliance into a flexible force better suited to dealing with regional crises like the one in Kosovo. The 19-member NATO has failed to redefine itself since the collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago, and the consequence of that failure are apparent: NATO, despite pledges that it would modernize and integrate its member's armed forces, has proved itself unable to mount its attack on Yugoslavia without a disproportionate contribution from the U.S. and Britain. From the cruise missiles pounding targets in Yugoslavia, to the command-and-control systems guiding them, to the communications networks that monitor and transmit the results, the air campaign has been a distinctly Anglo-U.S. production. That has led to tension in NATO between U.S. and British officials on one side, who complain they are bearing the burden of the Kosovo raids, and other European members, who warn that London and Washington will use the crisis to force-feed them Anglo-U.S. defense products.
