 Convenience Chain to Post Wider Loss --- National Convenience Stores Sees 4th-Period Deficit Of Up to 31 Cents a Share   By By Kevin Helliker, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 1991  In an interview, V.H. Van Horn, chief executive officer, said the company's troubles in reviving convenience-store sales continued, as fourth-quarter sales fell 12% to about $256 million from $292 million last year. At June 30, NCS, operator of the Stop N Go convenience store chain, owned 988 stores, down from 1,090 a year ago.  Mr. Van Horn attributed the sales and earnings decline primarily to a gasolineprice war that broke out between major oil companies operating in NCS's markets. To maintain its practice of underselling the major oil companies, NCS would have had to sell its gasoline at a loss, Mr. Van Horn said, adding that the company decided instead to maintain a five-cent-a-gallon gross margin -- down from 18 cents in December -- even though that left its prices as much as five cents a gallon higher than gasoline at major oil companies such as Exxon.
