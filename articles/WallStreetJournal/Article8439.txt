 Young and Restless: In the New Vietnam, Baby Boomers Strive For Fun and Money --- Ignoring Elders' Ideals, They Become Avid Customers In Budding Free Market --- Old Soldiers' Postwar Doubts   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1994  Vietnam is like that these days: young, money hungry, a bit surreal. The Sunset Pub, run by a former aid worker from Finland, serves Mexican-style pizza amid photos of James Dean. Chiang Kai-shek's old political party in Taiwan is investing in Ho Chi Minh City, and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord of Iran-Contra fame comes here on behalf of an engineering company. Even Hue, whose Buddhist monks are still a voice of dissent, has a new beer "brewed with Danish technology."  Success belongs to those who can best ride this wave, and for Le Van Kiem, the new generation is the labor pool on which he has built his own future. A native of the ancient city of Hue, Mr. Kiem first moved to the capital as a boy in 1954 and then returned to the southern part of the country as a member of a North Vietnamese army-transportation unit. He stayed after the war in a government post, where he learned, he says, by studying bidding practices on government contracts. Today, he is the 48-year-old president of Huy Hoang Co., a private garment and construction company whose sportswear exports were $32.5 million last year.  While Mr. Kiem prospers by using the young generation as a work force, Ho Trong Tiet is doing nicely by catering to its tastes. Mr. Tiet is a 51-year-old businessman who also was born in central Vietnam, though he sided with the South in the war as an administrator in the Danang area. He now is capitalizing on the new generation's love affair with billiards. His Thanh Minh brand tables and cue sticks are marketed under a logo featuring a busty, long-legged Eurasian woman.
