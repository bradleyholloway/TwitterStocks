 IN THE LEAD: Managers Are Starting To Loosen Budgets As Optimism Grows   By Hymowitz, Carol, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2004  He was buoyed when he learned that customers weren't canceling reservations at his chain, or even changing their diets. Traffic at Morton's 60 restaurants in the U.S. was very strong on Christmas and New Year's weekends, with 80% of customers sticking as they typically do to steak and other meat choices on the menu, Mr. [Allen J. Bernstein] says. "We have an educated group of customers who know there's never been a [known] case of mad cow contracted from eating muscle meat," he adds.  He recently lost a prospective employee because another company made a better counteroffer. "We haven't had that happen in three years," Mr. [Scott Flanders] says. "Until recently, we were in unchallenged territory whenever we wanted to poach someone else's talent."  He has his own system for tracking the economy that draws on more than 50 indexes, and he is optimistic about the improvements he has seen in recent months. "We're seeing consumer confidence, and because of low interest rates, we're seeing people realizing their dream of buying homes," he says. "We're also seeing bigger home-improvement projects come back again."
