 Iran's Message: No More Nice Guys   By Melloan, George, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2005  Whoever wins an electoral runoff and becomes Iran's new president, the news won't be good, either for Iranians or Americans and Europeans disturbed about the regime's quest for nuclear weaponry. The country's ruling mullahs blatantly displayed their muscle, and vote-rigging skills, in last Friday's initial vote. That suggests that they are no longer interested in creating even the illusion of political moderation.  Mr. [Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani] is no moderate, judging from the oppression when he held the presidency from 1989 to 1997. But he is also no favorite of the regime. He once stood above [Ali Khamenei] in the esteem of that old rascal who established Iran's clerical dictatorship, Ayatollah Ruhallah Khomeini. The two are longtime rivals. That aside, he is not the kind of character in whom a supreme leader, or anyone else, would want to put a lot of trust.  That could be a mistake, too. Mr. Karroubi's complaint about the election theft shows that even supposedly loyal politicians have limits on how much high-handedness they will tolerate. Mr. Karroubi's alleged 5 million votes suggest that he has at least some political following. The other losing candidates had supporters as well. Should former loyalists go into opposition and a defeated Mr. Rafsanjani choose to use his political skills as well, Ayatollah Khamenei might have a problem.
