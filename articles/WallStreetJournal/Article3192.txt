 Uncertainty in India May Slow Arms Pact --- American Officials Question If a New Government Can Tackle Tough Issue   By By Jonathan Karp, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1999  Last year, India's nuclear tests jolted a U.S. initiative to mend relations with New Delhi. Now, the demise of the Hindu-nationalist government that ordered those blasts could blow a hole in State Department diplomacy aimed at getting India-and the U.S.-to ratify a nuclear test-ban treaty by September.  India's Congress Party said yesterday that it expects to complete talks today on forming a minority government led by Sonia Gandhi and backed by small parties that helped it oust the ruling coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. But some foreign policy commentators and U.S. officials question whether a fragile government can tackle such a sensitive issue as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before the United Nations' September deadline.  The BJP's fall effectively kills a January agreement by which the U.S. promised to lift some economic sanctions on India in return for New Delhi signing the treaty by May. At the time, U.S. diplomats used dance metaphors to describe the delicate diplomacy with India. Yet the State Department was engaged in a simultaneous two-step with the Senate: The importance of May, say Clinton administration officials, was to win the support of Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for the treaty in time for the Senate to ratify it by September.
