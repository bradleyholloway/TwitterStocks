 Dow Tumbles 73 Points as Attention Shifts to the Economy, New Congress   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2006  Crude-oil futures, whose declines had helped fuel stock gains, surged back above $61 a barrel amid worries about declining stockpiles and the looming winter heating season. Oil futures rose $1.33, or 2.2%, to $61.16.  Large technology stocks bucked the trend, rising after Cisco Systems forecast stronger sales than analysts had expected. Cisco jumped 6% and Dell, Oracle and Yahoo all gained. But their coattails didn't reach the broader tech market, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, filled with tech stocks, fell 0.37%, or 8.93 points, to 2376.01. It remains up 7.7% this year.  Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.07%, or 0.17 point, to 230.63.
