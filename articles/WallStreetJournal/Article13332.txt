 Tribune Ousts Rebel Publisher At L.A. Times   By Ellison, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2006  Tribune owns a group of 25 TV stations and a string of newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune and New York's Newsday, but the L.A. Times is its biggest newspaper property. It accounts for nearly a quarter of Tribune's publishing revenue, which in turn accounts for about three-quarters of the company's revenue. Some investors believe Mr. Johnson's ouster signals Tribune's determination to hold onto the L.A. Times. Turmoil at the paper could also be an issue for potential buyers of Tribune, particularly private equity firms, which are seen as the most likely bidders.  At the same time, Mr. Johnson's departure could fuel concern among civic leaders in Los Angeles about Tribune's management of the paper. Last month a group of Los Angeles civic leaders wrote to Tribune Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons, warning that making further cuts in the L.A. Times's newsroom was a bad idea and hinting that Tribune should consider selling the paper. Mr. Smith, Tribune's publishing chief, had recently broached the possibility of additional job cuts on top of the roughly 300 made last year.  Mr. [Jeffrey M. Johnson] said he hadn't consulted Mr. [Dean Baquet] about his decision to resign. "Dean and I talk a lot, but this is pretty much a direct matter between me and Chicago," Mr. Johnson said, adding, "I called Dean about this early today and told him about my decision."
