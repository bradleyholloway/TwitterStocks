 RTC Sold Thrifts To Operator Facing State Civil Charges   By By Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1992  An insurance executive facing civil racketeering charges in Arizona completed his second savings-and-loan acquisition from the government in April, a Senate hearing was told, provoking outrage from one senator.  In the transaction, the Resolution Trust Corp. sold several branches of New Merabank Texas, a failed thrift, to Bluebonnet Savings Bank, Dallas. The chairman of Bluebonnet and its parent, CFSB Corp., is James M. Fail, whose Arizona insurance company collapsed in 1990.
