 CBS Won `Sweeps' In February, Final Tally Will Show   By By Elizabeth Jensen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1993  The CBS network won the February "sweeps" ratings period, final numbers, to be announced today, will show. The CBS Inc. unit was helped by the strong performance of the miniseries "Queen."  The network also led its competitors in the numbers of viewers among two key groups sought by advertisers, adults aged 18 to 49, and 25 to 54. Moreover, the network seems assured of winning the 1992-93 television season when it ends seven weeks from now. Even without the strong performance of "Queen," which was the highest-rated miniseries since the CBS epic "Lonesome Dove" in 1989, CBS was dominant.
