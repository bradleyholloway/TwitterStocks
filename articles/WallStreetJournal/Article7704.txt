 Manager's Journal: Put Those Ideas Up Against the Wall   By By Michael Schrage, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1987  Managers know that most of their business meetings are little symphonies of frustration and ennui. Digressions ride roughshod over even the most thoughtful agenda, and perceptive comments are too often lost amid the jumble of words spilling over the conference table.  Clearly, these people need help. They need some way to make meetings better and more productive. Enter the personal computer, which already has become the most useful tool for running meetings since Robert's Rules of Order.  At the typical computer-supported meeting, someone is designated to "take notes" on the computer as the participants talk. Key points made by the speakers are dutifully typed into the computer (and on the screen) as they talk. Everyone at the meeting hears -- and sees -- the discussion.
