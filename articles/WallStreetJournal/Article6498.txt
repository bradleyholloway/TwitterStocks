 Hong Kong REIT Tries Again; With Court Ruling, City Takes Another Crack at a Huge IPO   By Linebaugh, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2005  It was one year ago that the city's administration and investment bankers began marketing the historic IPO, a vital step in the government's ambitious privatization program. Then, a 67-year-old public-housing tenant, Lo Siu Lan, who argued the stock offering would violate the city's housing code by making her groceries more expensive, embarked on a legal challenge that forced the government to pull the deal at the 11th hour. The city's highest court struck down the case in July.  This time, however, the offering faces a new set of challenges, including bruised sentiment from last year's debacle and softening REIT markets regionally. The biggest hurdle is rising interest rates, which are expected to continue to climb, reducing the difference between a REIT's yield and that of risk-free securities.  This time, Hong Kong isn't taking any chances. Not only have lawyers written every conceivable risk into the prospectus, according to people familiar with the deal, but if the unforeseen were to happen -- as it did last year -- the government, its bankers and its advisers have the option to allow investors to withdraw from the offering. Institutional investors subscribing to the offering might find themselves with a greater share of the offering than the 10.6% they got last year, now that the government has cut out a group of nine investment houses that underpinned last year's deal with a 19% stake.
