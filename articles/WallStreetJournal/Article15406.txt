 Clinton to seek to reinstate his order penalizing employers of strike-breakers   By Burkins, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1996  Despite a ruling by the US Court of Appeals in Washington DC on Feb 2, 1996 that struck down President Clinton's executive order on replacement workers, Clinton has not abandoned his plan to withhold federal contracts from employers who hire strike-busting replacement workers. Officials said Clinton has instructed the Justice Dept to do "everything possible" to reverse the ruling.
