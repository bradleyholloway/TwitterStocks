 Short-Covering, Rumors of Export Sales Send Wheat Prices Higher at the CBOT   By By Robin K. Taylor, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1999  The CBOT March wheat contract settled at $2.5325 a bushel, up 8.75 cents. The May contract settled up nine cents at $2.6375 a bushel.  Market watchers said recent short-selling -- the selling of futures on the bet that prices would decline -- had left the market looking oversold. Talk of wheat purchases by Egypt, which started filtering into the market Monday, helped persuade shortsellers such as speculative commodity funds to buy futures in order to cover their previous short sales.  The short-covering rally also affected other CBOT grain pits. March corn futures settled at $2.1025 a bushel, up four cents, while the May contract rose 4.50 cents to settle at $2.1575 a bushel. March soybean futures settled up eight cents at $4.625 a bushel, while the May contract settled up 8.50 cents at $4.7150.
