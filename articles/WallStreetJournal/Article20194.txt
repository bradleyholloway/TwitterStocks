 Take-Two Rises 8.7%; Ambac, MBIA Decline   By Curran, Rob, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2007  "I don't know if we're going to tumble into a recession under the classic definition, but we're certainly in pullback, or slowdown mode," said Georges Yared, chief investment strategist at Yared Investment Research, after some soft manufacturing data. "When you look at spending, whether it be automotive or large-ticket items, consumers have pulled back."  Bankrate rose 1.60, or 4.1%, to 40.74 after Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. raised its rating on the online banking concern to "buy" from "neutral," seeing a recent pullback as temporary.  ParkerVision fell 1.31, or 13%, to 8.52. Short sellers are casting doubt on the viability of the Jacksonville, Fla., technology company's wireless innovation, according to a report in Barron's magazine, produced by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. ParkerVision challenged claims in the Barron's article and defended its technology.
