 Boeing Is Close to Deal to Sell 30 Planes To Lease Unit of American International   By By Jeff Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2000  Recently, Boeing officials vowed to accumulate a total of about 40 orders for those two new types in time to ballyhoo them at the Farnborough Air Show that begins in Britain later this month. The International Lease order would bring Boeing an important step closer to its goal. Japan Air Lines and EVA Airways of Taiwan already have announced firm orders for 14 of the planes. Seattle-based Boeing has targeted All Nippon Airways for a six-plane order. The plane maker also hopes to land an order for 10 of the planes from the jet-leasing unit of General Electric Co. (A separate GE unit is the sole provider of engines for the new pair of 777 types). Another possible customer is the carrier Malaysian Airlines System.
