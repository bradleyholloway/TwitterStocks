 Taste: Cancel My Ticket --- You didn't travel this summer? Good for you   By By Joseph Epstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  The English poet Philip Larkin, who once said that he thought sex was too good to share with anyone else, also said that he wouldn't mind visiting China, so long as he could return home that night. I do not yet share Larkin's first sentiment, but I am beginning to sympathize with his second. Larkin lived all his life in England, much of it in provincial England, and visited only one European country, Germany, and that only once. His curiosity about the rest of the world, despite his enormous personal culture, apparently never came close to outweighing his deep inertia when it came to travel.  Travel in most quarters is considered an adventure. I once considered it so, but less and less nowadays. By travel I mean fairly standard tourism, chiefly in Europe. I certainly do not mean exotic travel: traipsing up some Himalaya on a mountain bike, following Conrad's Mr. Kurtz down the steamy Congo, setting out on dogsled on the path of Admiral Byrd to the South Pole. My idea of roughing it is poor room service. In point of sad fact, I find that when I am away I require an even higher level of comfort than usual to replace the pleasing, familiar comforts of home.  One of the things that has taken some of the thrill out of travel is a subtle but genuine change in the cultural status of America vis a vis Europe. When I was young, Americans with intellectual and cultural aspirations felt themselves in a condition of clear cultural inferiority to Europeans generally, and to the French and the English in particular. Europeans seemed culturally superior in every way; so many of the great living writers, painters, musicians were European; Europeans lived on closer terms with history than we, and deeper down; and they had the architecture, art works, museums and cultural institutions to prove it.
