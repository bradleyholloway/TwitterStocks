 Municipal Finance: One Way or Another...   By By Jacqueline Bueno, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1996  Which raises the question: Should they pay more? A comparison of taxes and fees around the state shows that Miami's garbage service is a relative bargain. Yet residents pay relatively more in property taxes and other fees than do those in other cities. Chuck Hungerford, a senior analyst with the Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, says that when a city charges very little for a service, it is sure to be making up for it in other areas.  But several Miami commissioners are reluctant to support the fee increase because of the city's heavy taxes and fees in other areas. Miami's property-tax rate, for example, is one of the highest in the state: Miami homeowners pay the city more than $9.50 for every $1,000 of taxable assessed value of their home. When added to the county's property tax, the total rate comes to $30.36. Meanwhile, homeowners in Naples are paying less than half that: $1.78 to the city, and a total of $14.31. And Tallahassee's homeowners pay $3.20 to the city, and a total of $22.37.
