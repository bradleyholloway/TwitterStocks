 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2004; Simmering M&A Sector Reaches a Boil; Crush of December Activity Signals M&A Is Heating Up; Will 'Deals Beget Deals'?   By Berman, Dennis K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2005  "These deals got good reaction in the marketplace," says Steven Baronoff, Merrill Lynch & Co.'s global head of mergers and acquisitions. "That's going to give people additional confidence to do deals in 2005."  In the U.S., announced merger volume surged more than 50% from 2003, to $875 billion. European merger activity rose more than 28% and Asian activity was up more than 59%, although the comparisons are somewhat exaggerated after a relatively inactive year world-wide for mergers in 2003. "Everything is coming together," says Paul J. Taubman, Morgan Stanley's global co-head of mergers and acquisitions. "There is a very favorable economic environment, and as the economy goes, so goes M&A. [This year] is going to continue to pick up where we started in 2004."  Also under scrutiny will be Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, which finished 11th globally, according to Thomson, and didn't have a hand in any of the four huge M&A transactions announced in December, which also included Exelon Corp.'s $12.3 billion takeover of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., and software maker Symantec Corp.'s agreement to acquire Veritas Corp. for $13.5 billion.
