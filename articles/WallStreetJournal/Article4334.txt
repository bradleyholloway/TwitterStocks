 Nippon Telegraph Offering Loses None Of Its Appeal After Stock-Market Crash   By By Elisabeth Rubinfien, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1987  A headlong fall in the Tokyo stock market has made Japanese investors nervous but hasn't cooled enthusiasm for this week's offer of a second block of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. shares.  Before Oct. 20, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei stock average plummeted a record 3836.48 points on the heels of Black Monday in New York, share prices were rising -- hitting a high of 26646.43 Oct. 14. Tokyo analysts, brokers and investors generally agreed the market would keep climbing in advance of the NTT offer.  But rather than scare investors, the fall has made NTT shares even more attractive, analysts and investors say, because it has brought the price down. The price for the new shares was set at 3.5% below Monday's closing price. NTT closed Monday at 2.64 million yen ($19,555) a share, down 80,000, making the offer price 2.55 million yen. The price exceeded three million yen in early October.
