 Ahead of the Tape   By Patterson, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2007  Crude-oil prices are up 28% this year, hitting a Nymex closing record of $78.23 a barrel yesterday, despite OPEC's decision to boost production. (The inflation-adjusted high remains $101.57 a barrel, hit in April 1980.) Heating oil and gasoline prices also are marching higher.  That leaves little cushion for supply shocks caused by hurricanes or cold snaps, said Sarah Emerson, managing director at Energy Security. "The horse is out of the barn for 2007," she said. "We're going to have a tight market."  In July, Franklin Resources agitated against the $32 billion buyout of Texas utility TXU, saying it wanted more. Last month, Franklin said it would vote for the deal after all, citing "changing market conditions." The deal easily passed, winning the approval of 74% of shares outstanding.
