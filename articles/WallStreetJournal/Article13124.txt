 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; What's Ahead for Bond Funds; Fixed Income Beat the Odds Last Year, but the Dollar and Economic Worries Give Investors Pause   By Crane, Agnes T, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2005  "This year, the story of the year may very well turn out to be the dollar," said Mr. [David Darst]. "We don't see a panic of U.S. investors moving out of dollars," he said, but global imbalances, which include U.S. deficits, mean the buck must adjust lower.  "I think the big concern going into the New Year is what is going to happen with inflation," said Bob Auwaerter, head of Vanguard's Fixed Income Group, who oversees approximately $265 billion in bond and money-market fund assets. "We're already at the top end of what we perceive to be the Federal Reserve's tolerance range."  The futures market has priced in a 3% to 3.25% federal-funds rate by the end of 2005, although Fidelity's Mr. [George Fischer] said, "my suspicion is it will be higher than that." He added: "The Fed is going to need to keep its inflation credentials intact and be wary of housing bubbles." Low interest rates have contributed to rising home prices in recent years. "The risk for 2005 is the Fed needs to do more than people expect," he said.
