 Media: TV Is Giving Star Status to Environment   By By Meg Cox, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1989  Once the subject of an occasional public-television documentary, the issue of saving the Earth's environment is about to blanket network and cable channels, in everything from news-division specials to sitcom episodes. We won't just see Madonna singing to save the rain forest: An episode of "Murphy Brown" set to air next month finds the caustic TV anchor (Candice Bergen) accepting a bet that she can make her life style more environmentally responsible. "I wanted to get across the message that we don't have a choice anymore, but to also make it funny by showing how inconvenient it is for Murphy," says Diane English, the show's creator.  -- Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Superstation TBS is working on an animated cartoon series for children to be called "Captain Planet."  -- CBS last month began airing 60-second "Earth Quest" spots, which replaced its occasional "Presidential Portraits;" CBS News also plans five one-hour specials on the environment in April.
