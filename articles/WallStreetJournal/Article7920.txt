 Prospects Grow Dim For Free Diamonds In Arkansas Hills --- Commercial Interests Want To Stake Claims in a Park Where Hobbyists Dig   By By Marj Charlier, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1989  MURFREESBORO, Ark. -- At 6 a.m., when many retirees awake for a day of fishing, James Archer pulls on his yellow waders and pushes a tattered straw hat down over his wiry black hair. He drives a dozen miles to a state park and pays $3 to enter.  Mr. Archer doesn't fish, though. He digs for diamonds, along with a dozen or so other regular prospectors and a stream of tourists, in a 30-acre field the state plows for amateur diggers. Crater of Diamonds State Park, in the rolling hills of southwest Arkansas, is the only place in the U.S. where significant numbers of the stones have been found.  Like the other regular diggers, Mr. Archer sells his diamonds to tourists and local jewelers for $200 to $1,000 a carat, depending on the size and color of the stones. He has found about 200 carats, and although he won't say how much money he has earned, it hasn't been much for 13 years of backbreaking labor. But money isn't why he comes to the park.
