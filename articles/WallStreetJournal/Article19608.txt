 Big HMO Plans to Put Medical Records Online   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  The U.S. Veterans Health Administration has been a pioneer in using electronic records, and some health plans, hospitals and medical groups have made the switch. But the Kaiser-Epic project, which would make online records accessible to 12,000 Kaiser doctors, could set a new standard for American medicine. "Many problems in patient safety arise not from poor actors -- doctors and nurses -- but from the lack of a good system in place," said Carolyn Clancy, acting director of the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in Washington.  When Mr. [George C. Halvorson] took the Kaiser reins last summer, he ordered a review of the HMO's information-technology strategy. His previous employer, HealthPartners, a smaller HMO in Minneapolis, used Epic's medical-records system. Mr. Halvorson says that the decision to go with Epic was based on Kaiser's own analysis of the commercial alternatives and wasn't influenced by him. Kaiser expects to save $1 billion by using Epic rather than pursing the internal-development path, Mr. Halvorson added.
