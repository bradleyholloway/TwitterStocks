 Russia Backs Away From a Plan To Build 5 New Reactors in Iran   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2002  Washington believes Russian technology exports are helping Iran develop nuclear weapons, and has urged Moscow to cease all nuclear assistance to Tehran -- a country President [Bush] has identified as part of an "axis of evil." Russia says the Bushehr reactor is for civilian purposes only, and is regularly inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Mr. [Alexander Rumyantsev]'s apparent change of heart came a week after Russia unveiled ambitious plans to construct as many as five new reactors in Iran -- three more in Bushehr, and an additional two in Ahwaz, close to Iran's border with Iraq. The minister said the plans, contained in a 10-year program of economic, scientific and industrial cooperation with Iran, weren't carved in stone.
