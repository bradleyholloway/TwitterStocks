 Web Offers Commuters a Way Around Gridlock; Traffic Sites Gain Traction With New, Improved Data; Government Drives the Push   By Vascellaro, Jessica E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2006  Companies such as Iteris Inc. and Traffic.com Inc. are enhancing their online traffic maps and expanding their geographic coverage. Last fall, the Travel Advisory News Network, based in Diamond Bar, Calif., launched CommuteOne, an Internet service that allows drivers to view real-time traffic maps on their desktop, personal digital assistant or cellphone. And Traffic.com., based in Wayne, Pa., expanded its coverage of real-time traffic maps to cities such as Denver, Portland, and San Antonio as well as adding a feature that predicts whether traffic on a particular route is worsening or improving.  Officials who operate online traffic sites acknowledge that traffic conditions can easily change between the time a user logs off a computer and gets behind the wheel. In response, companies are rolling out their content on cellphones and mobile devices such as BlackBerrys, so drivers can access it while traveling. In November, Traffic.com began allowing individuals to receive an email overview of the traffic in their city. For $4.99 a month, customers can receive a verbal traffic report on their cellphones.  Traffic.com ranks the traffic on a particular route on a scale of one to 10 and displays average speeds and times, as well as the slowest speed a driver is expected to go on that course. Yahoo Inc.'s traffic maps, which provide real-time data for more than 20 metropolitan areas, display color-coded average speeds and detailed incident reports along with directions.
