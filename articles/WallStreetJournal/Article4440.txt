 Third World Debt Remedy Is Urged By Fed's LaWare   By By Walter S. Mossberg and Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 9, 1988  Federal Reserve Board Governor John LaWare, breaking with the Fed's usual conservative approach, urged new approaches to alleviating Third World debt problems.  In a speech to the National Bankers Association convention in Boston, Mr. LaWare suggested that banks consider the possibility of a long-term restructuring of Third World debt by exchanging current short-term notes for long-term bonds that would carry fixed rates of interest and require no principal payments for some period. Such an approach might encourage resumption of capital flows into Third World economies, Mr. LaWare said.  Mr. LaWare, a former banker who has served on the Fed for less than a month, said he was unsure whether the proposal would prove workable, but added, "We've got to think of a different approach from what we've been doing."
