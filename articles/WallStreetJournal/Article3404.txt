 VW's Earnings for 2000 Exceed Estimates   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2001  Pretax profit rose 38% to 6.78 billion marks from 4.93 billion marks in 1999, and sales gained 14% to 167.33 billion marks. Analysts said a recovery in South America and strong sales at Audi in the U.S. bolstered earnings.  To sustain sales and earnings growth, Volkswagen said it "will need big efforts to raise efficiency and cut costs." In particular, earnings should be helped by new products like the new Passat and the A4 at VW's premium brand, Audi AG, Volks-wagen said.
