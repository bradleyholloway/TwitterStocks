 Southwestern Bell Ordered to Reduce Telephone Rates   By By Randolph B. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1989  Southwestern Bell Corp. was ordered to reduce its Missouri telephone rates by $101 million a year in a decision that also rejected the company's rate reform proposal.  The Missouri Public Service Commission ruled that the company's Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit had excessive earnings and cut its authorized rate of return on equity to 12.61% from 14.7%.  A Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. spokesman said the decision would jeopardize the company's plan to spend $180 million to install digital switches in 112 Missouri communities by 1990.
