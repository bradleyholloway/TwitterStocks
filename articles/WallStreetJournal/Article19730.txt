 Plots & Ploys   By Muto, Sheila, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  "We all agree that a square foot is 12 by 12, but after that, the agreement starts to break down," says Keith Perske, a manager in Sun Microsystems Inc.'s corporate real-estate department and a member of the consortium's executive committee.  For example, he says, some landlords measure space from the interior of walls, while others measure the space from the exterior of the building. Some include the columns in a space or even an elevator shaft on the floor when "I can't put a desk there, so why should I pay for that?" says Mr. Perske. "As a tenant, I want to make sure that area is as small as possible because I'm paying on a per-square-foot basis. Landlords want to make that number as large as possible" by including a portion of the lobby.  "We're net sellers rather than buyers," because real estate is commanding premium prices, says Jeffrey Dishner, the company's chief operating officer.
