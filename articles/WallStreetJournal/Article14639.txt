 Educated Moves: Elite Private Colleges Routinely Share Plans For Raising Tuition --- Saying It's Done Openly, They Decry Price-Fixing Probe; Critics Charge 'Arrogance' --- Wesleyan's Accurate Forecast   By By Gary Putka, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1989  A March 4, 1988, document, labeled "confidential" and drafted by the Wesleyan treasurer's office, stated that in September 1988, Harvard University charges would go up 6%, Yale's 6.2%, and Dartmouth's 6.3%. At the other end of the spectrum, Wellesley College planned a 7.9% increase, Amherst College 8.5%, and Williams 10.6%. Thus, the Wesleyan administration argued that its increase was only matching the competition.  The earlier-reported practice of 23 Ivy League and other Northeastern schools of fixing student financial aid is also under government scrutiny. At an annual spring meeting, these colleges compare proposed financial-aid packages for more than 10,000 common admittees and in most cases eliminate variances so that a family's expenses will be identical no matter where a student goes. According to people familiar with the investigation, however, the Justice Department's main concern is tuition and faculty salaries.  The investigation has stunned many educators, especially at the prestigious private schools on which it seems to be focused. Public-college tuitions and salaries, largely fixed by state legislative and policy decisions, apparently aren't under study. So far, 13 private schools acknowledge getting the civil-investigative demands; they include the University of Chicago; Wesleyan, Connecticut and Trinity colleges in Connecticut; Amherst, Harvard, Williams and Tufts in Massachusetts; Bates, Bowdoin and Colby colleges in Maine; Hamilton College, New York state; and Middlebury College, Vermont.
