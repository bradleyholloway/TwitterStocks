 How to Size Up Your Hospital; Improved Public Databases Let People Compare Practices And Outcomes; the Importance of Looking Past the Numbers   By Francis, Theo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2007  The assumption is that hospitals with the best practices will provide the best care, Chief Executive Suzanne Delbanco says. The group also tracks how hospitals handle "never events" -- mistakes that should never happen, like a newborn abduction or amputating the wrong leg -- but it doesn't track how often such events occur. "We're not counting problems," Ms. Delbanco says.  Last month, Medicare started providing some mortality information for heart-attack and heart-failure cases through Hospital Compare -- specifically, measuring how likely such patients are to die of any cause within 30 days of admission at all of the hospitals it tracks. But critics say the information is too vague to be of much use: The site indicates only whether a given hospital is better, no different or worse than national averages -- and virtually all hospitals fall into the "no different" category. (Seventeen U.S. hospitals are "better" than the U.S. rate for heart-attack deaths, and seven are "worse," for example; the rest -- 4,453 -- are labeled "no different.")  "We're not going to tell you go to this hospital," Ms. [Kristen Bronner] says. "We're going to tell you the profile for this hospital is very aggressive, specialist-oriented, high-tech probably -- they're going to try everything and you're going to see everybody."
