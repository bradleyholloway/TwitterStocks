 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2004; Bull Pedals Hard in Uphill Climb; After 2nd Straight Annual Rise, Continued Rising Rates and Slowing Corporate Profit Growth Lie Ahead for Stocks   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2005  "It is very unlikely that stocks would have a tough year," says Edgar Peters, chief investment strategist at Boston money-management firm PanAgora Asset Management, which oversees $13 billion for clients. "Earnings growth is slowing, but it isn't slowing to a stop. It is just slowing to a more sustainable level."  "The recent increase in equity prices to new cyclical highs has led to questions about how much more upside potential exists," noted Bob Doll, president of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, in a recent report to clients. He said that stock prices, compared to companies' profits, are beginning to look "somewhat stretched." Corporate profits are "still strong enough to support the market," he said, but some time this year, "equities may be due for a breather."  "I wouldn't be surprised if any positive market developments that take place occur in the first half" of the year, Mr. [Dorsey Farr] says. "The trends we're seeing now on interest rates and profits are likely to lead us to a more neutral stance on stocks versus our current position of being slightly overweight in equities. In this environment, we are looking to be a bit more defensive to protect the capital we've helped build for clients."
