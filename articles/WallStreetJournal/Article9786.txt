 He Thrived on Chaos   By Meyers, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2005  His first three wives were "nice" Jewish women from the Midwest. But, as Gertrude Stein said of Ernest Hemingway, "Anyone who's married three girls from St. Louis hasn't learned much." His fourth wife, Alexandra (the second one with that name), he depicted as sophisticated and sexy in "To Jerusalem and Back," as refined and beautiful in "The Dean's December." After their acrimonious split, she appeared -- transformed and transfixed -- as Vela in "Ravelstein": cold, self-absorbed and emotionally constrained. Mr. [Saul Bellow] also had scores of mistresses -- the rock on which his marriages crashed.  Mr. Bellow, whose first language was Yiddish, translated "Gimpel the Fool" into English in 1953 and introduced Isaac Bashevis Singer to American readers. His version of Mr. Singer's opening sentences -- "I am Gimpel the fool. I don't think of myself as a fool. On the contrary. But that's what folks call me. They gave me the name while I was still in school" -- has the same intimate and erratic tone as the opening sentence of Mr. Bellow's "Adventures of Augie March" (1953): "I am an American, Chicago-born -- Chicago, that somber city -- and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes not so innocent." Both openings instantly reveal their engagingly eccentric characters.
