 Asia: Korea and Taiwan: One 'Twin' Has Grown Faster   By By Willard D. Sharpe, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1985  It is true that the two have followed a remarkably parallel path: Between 1960 and 1983 their average gross national product growth rates were nearly identical -- 8.4% for Korea and 8.3% for Taiwan. But a major difference between them has become evident. In the process of growing, Korea borrowed heavily and is now saddled with a large debt. Taiwan, on the other hand, borrowed little.  At the end of 1984, Korea's external debt totaled the equivalent of $43 billion, or a net of $36 billion if foreign-exchange reserves of $7 billion are subtracted. The gross debt is 53% of Korea's GNP of $81 billion. By contrast, Taiwan's total debt at the end of last year was just under $12 billion, or 21% of GNP. If foreign-exchange reserves of $18 billion are subtracted, however, Taiwan emerges as a net creditor, at $6 billion.  Since those days, Korea has always been behind. Its per-capita GNP was about $2,000 last year, compared with slightly more than $3,000 for Taiwan. At its current growth rate, Korea will need about seven years to catch up with Taiwan's 1984 level of per-capita GNP.
