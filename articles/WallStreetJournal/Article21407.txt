 Agee Puts Morrison Knudsen in the Black --- Debt Slashed, but Can Firm's Recovery Be Sustained?   By By Carrie Dolan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 1990  When William Agee returned to his hometown of Boise, Idaho, in August 1988, he faced a tough job as the new chairman of debt-ridden Morrison Knudsen Corp. His No.1 priority: Turn the company around -- ASAP.  In an interview, Mr. Agee, Morrison's chairman, said fourth-quarter results were in the range of analysts' estimates of between 82 cents and 90 cents a share. Morrison Knudsen has 11.5 million shares outstanding, indicating net income of between $9.4 million and $10.3 million.  Part of Morrison Knudsen's woes in the past were caused by low bids, resulting in cost overruns. Mr. Agee has taken a much more conservative approach to bidding, which resulted in the company winning few new contracts. Yet, for one recent dam project in Arizona, Morrison Knudsen's bid was so low the company had to withdraw it. "Pride didn't get in the way, and we dodged a future bullet," Mr. Agee says. He concedes the company is still "fine-tuning" its bidding process.
