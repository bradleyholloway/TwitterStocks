 Boeing to Take Equity Stake in Ellipso; Vote of Confidence in Satellite System   By By Jeff Cole and Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1998  Boeing Co. is expected to announce today that it will become the prime contractor and also take an equity stake in the proposed $1.4 billion Ellipso satellite mobile-phone project, according to people familiar with the negotiations.  The importance of Boeing's decision, expected to take the form of equity and vendor financing totaling as much as $200 million, goes beyond the size of the anticipated investment. It amounts to an important vote of confidence in Ellipso -- considered by many over the years as an underdog in the competition with larger, more expensive satellite systems -- instantly improving the project's credibility with a new crop of potential investors.  Meanwhile, Hughes Electronics Corp. announced Friday that it is investing nearly $850 million to increase its controlling interest in PanAmSat Corp , a satellite-communications system. Hughes's move to raise its stake to 81% from 71.5% isn't considered a strategic shift. But Hughes, according to company officials, expects to improve its net earnings by gaining certain tax benefits on all future income derived from PanAmSat.
