 Europe: Spain and America on the Brink   By By Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1987  As an exercise in brinkmanship, this one risks becoming a classic. For more than a year, Spain and the U.S. have been locked in confrontation over renewal of a defense pact of key importance for the West. After six rounds of unproductive talks, a seventh round tomorrow and Friday isn't expected to show progress. By Nov. 14, Spain seems certain to serve notice of the agreement's termination, paving the way for its expiration in six months' time.  By May 1989, under this worst-case scenario, the U.S. would have to ferry home the last of its 12,000 military personnel in Spain. The unraveling of the Spanish treaty could prompt a domino effect on similar agreements in Greece, Turkey and Portugal. While the U.S. and the Soviet Union pursue nuclear cuts, Western Europe's conventional defenses would be diminishing and the already weak southern flank of NATO would become even weaker. Some fear that the decoupling of Western Europe's defenses from those of the U.S. could be the next step.  Torrejon has become the crux of the negotiations, because Spain has made withdrawal of its 72 U.S. F-16 fighter jets a condition for extending leases elsewhere. Under NATO agreements, however, the planes are committed to the defense of Italy, Greece and Turkey, and if they were removed from Spain they would probably have to be taken back to the U.S. The U.S. says it's not opposed to cuts, but that Spain should take over the same missions. That's something that Spanish officials have so far refused to concede.
