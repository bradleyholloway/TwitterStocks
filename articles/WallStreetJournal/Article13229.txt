 Blair Drops Bid For Budget Deal On EU Subsidies   By Echikson, William, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2005  Mr. [Tony Blair]'s proposal reduced that to 1.03% of GDP, or about 24 billion euros less for the seven years. More than half the savings -- about 14 billion euros -- would have come from money earmarked for the EU's less wealthy, formerly communist Eastern European newcomers, which immediately opposed the move. About 7 billion euros would be taken from rural-development funds for Western Europe, and just 2 billion euros from the 250 billion euros in farm funding under the Common Agricultural Policy, the budget's single-biggest component. Farm payments and regional aid account for about 80% of the EU's annual budget.  A frequent Blair ally, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, blasted the U.K. proposal as "unacceptable" and "unrealistic," saying it was a recipe for "a 'Mini Europe,' not the strong Europe that we need." He pledged to work for a deal that is "fairer for new member states." Eastern European leaders, frequent allies of Britain, also rejected the proposal.  U.K. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw acknowledged it was "a tough package" and insisted on a review of all EU spending in 2009, including farm funds. To soften the blow a bit, Mr. Blair offered that the U.K. either would make an extra annual payment to the EU budget, or cut the U.K.'s previously sacrosanct budget rebate by a total of 8 billion euros.
