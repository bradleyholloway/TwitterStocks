 Politics & Economics: World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  Changing the constitution would require two-thirds support in a national referendum. "We will make efforts to further the national debate and attain the required two-thirds consensus," Mr. [Shinzo Abe] said. "If we make progress, we may bring our plans forward."  Mr. Abe also said he hopes to amend Japan's postwar pacifist constitution within five years in order to join peacekeeping teams and other foreign operations. The U.S.-drafted constitution severely limits Japanese military actions to self-defense and bars the country from using war to solve international disputes.
