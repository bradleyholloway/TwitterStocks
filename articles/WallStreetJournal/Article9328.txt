 Choice Evidence   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2001  That's the conclusion of well regarded economist Caroline Hoxby of Harvard and the National Bureau of Economic Research. Most investigations of school choice have studied its impact on allocation issues -- that is, how choice redistributes students and money. But Ms. Hoxby probed school productivity, defined as student performance per dollar spent.  In general the U.S. news is lousy. Ms. Hoxby points out that the productivity of American schools fell by, gulp, 65% between 1970-71 and 1998-99. As one horrifying example, Washington, D.C.'s spending puts it in the 99th percentile of all U.S. public schools, but an average D.C. student scores between the 10th and 20th percentile on the NAEP tests.  "Overall, an evaluation of Milwaukee suggests that public schools have a strong, positive productivity response to competition from vouchers," Ms. Hoxby writes. "The schools that faced the most potential competition from vouchers had the best productivity response. In fact, the schools that were most treated to competition had dramatic productivity improvements."
