 Use of Tax System to Collect Bad Debts Raises Civil Libertarian and IRS Protest   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1986  Welfare recipients who have been hiding interest and dividend earnings from state and federal agencies in order to qualify for low-income benefits may also get a shock. The IRS has begun providing those agencies with the interest and dividend reports it receives from banks and brokers.  But the IRS disagrees, arguing that using the tax system for purposes other than collecting taxes will encourage tax cheating and cause taxpayers to provide less reliable information on their returns. Civil liberties advocates, meanwhile, say the programs threaten Americans' rights to privacy.  A law protecting confidentiality was passed in 1976, following accusations that the Nixon administration used tax data for political purposes. But in 1984, spurred by the federal deficit, Congress approved a two-year pilot program that authorized the IRS to withhold refunds from delinquent debtors. Congress also authorized a handful of government programs -- including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), unemployment compensation and food stamps -- to use data on wages, interest and dividends collected by the IRS.
