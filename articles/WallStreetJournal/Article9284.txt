 Margin Calls Hit Some Tech Executives   By By Cassell Bryan-Low, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2001  Similarly, Stamps.com entered a loan repayment agreement with then-CEO John Payne and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney, where he maintained a brokerage account. In February Mr. Payne borrowed $6 million against his 1.5 million-share holdings to purchase 187,000 more company shares, when the Santa Monica, Calif., Internet postal-services firm's stock was trading at more than $30.  Meanwhile, at online retailer eToys, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold 319,000 shares of CEO Edward "Toby" Lenk's company holdings in November, at $2.58 each, or about $823,000 total value, as the result of a margin call, according to SEC filings. After the transaction, Mr. Lenk, who declined to comment, directly held 7.1 million company shares. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq trading, shares of Los Angeles-based eToys were down nine cents to 19 cents.  Mr. [James Daleen] tried to pay down the debt, selling 50,000 shares in November. When the stock fell below $5, the debt was no longer maintainable. In a private sale on Dec. 4, he sold 750,000 shares to SAIC Venture Capital Corp., one of the company's largest investors, at $4 a share, or $3 million total. Together, the sales accounted for a 47% reduction in Mr. Daleen's direct holdings. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq trading, Daleen shares were up 13 cents to $2.75.
