 Bigger Bets -- and Risks -- With These ETFs   By Laise, Eleanor, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  These "leveraged index funds" aim to deliver some multiple of a market benchmark's performance. The Rydex Dynamic Dow Fund (RYLDX), for example, tries to double the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average each day.  For one thing, losses as well as gains are magnified. For example, Rydex Dynamic S&P 500 Fund (RYTNX), which tries to deliver double the daily performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, lost 6.3% as the market tumbled last Tuesday through Thursday, while the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX), a traditional index-tracking fund, lost only 3.1%.
