 Two Medical Schools Face Merger Ire --- New York Imbroglio Underscores Nationwide Struggle   By By Lucette Lagnado, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1997  The interim provost of New York University Medical Center recently sent a curious memo to the teaching hospital's faculty. It warned that a "planned action" by employees to disrupt a proposed merger with another hospital could lead to "dramatic and disastrous" consequences for the famed medical center, including financial collapse.  That the official felt compelled to make such an emotional appeal shows the degree of animosity unleashed by NYU's merger talks with Mount Sinai Medical Center, which recently resumed. The discussions pit faculty members, who fear their departments would lose out in the combination, against hospital trustees -- some of whom happen to be major-league corporate merger experts in their regular jobs.  Yet doctors at NYU, who resent the imposition of a corporate-style merger, have formed an opposition group called the Committee of Concerned Physicians. Doctors say they have raised more than $40,000 to mount a legal campaign against the merger. The committee also has held secret meetings and distributed the medical equivalent of underground pamphlets. The unsigned memos use fiery language -- one warns that NYU Medical School is about to be controlled by "the aggressive `czar' of Mount Sinai Medical Center," Dr. Jack Rowe, the center's chief executive.
