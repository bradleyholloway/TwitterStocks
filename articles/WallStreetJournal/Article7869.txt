 House Panels Push Extra Spending Past Bush's Limit   By By David Rogers and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1989  House appropriations subcommittees approved an estimated $1.4 billion in new budget authority beyond the $2.16 billion in additional spending the Bush administration is requesting for the current fiscal year.  The supplemental spending bill for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30, also may become a vehicle for satisfying the administration's foreign policy goals in Central America and Africa. As drafted yesterday, the measure already includes a requested $125 million transfer to finance international peacekeeping forces in Southern Africa. It may also be amended to include money to support anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua.  Meanwhile, senior members of congressional budget committees met with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman for more than two hours yesterday in a continued effort to reach a compromise on the fiscal 1990 budget. The talks touched on two key issues -- how to raise additional revenue and how to restrain growth in entitlement programs. Aides were excluded from the meeting.
