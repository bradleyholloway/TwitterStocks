 Business World: A Champion Trader Yearns for More Stability   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  One also might assume that anyone so successful at trading securities and commodities in an era marked by market volatility would want the world economy to stay pretty much the same. But Mr. Soros, who was born in Hungary and educated at the London School of Economics, instead wants more order. For example, he advocates the creation of an international central bank to stabilize exchange rates.  Sitting in a Manhattan office decorated with abstract art running heavily toward chromatic blues and reds, Mr. Soros jokes about such yearnings. "Maybe it's like a relationship between being married or single. Whatever state prevails, the other is more attractive. If you have fixed exchange rates you lack the flexibility. If you have flexible exchange rates you lack the stability. But seriously, I think if you want to have an international economy you have to have currency stability."  Mr. Soros propounds his theories in a new book titled "The Alchemy of Finance" and subtitled "Reading the Mind of the Market" (Simon & Schuster). A section describes a "real-time experiment" in which Mr. Soros kept a diary of his investment decisions. It covers the 15 months from August 1985 to November 1986. He did rather well, expanding Quantum Fund to more than $1.5 billion by the end of 1986 from $489 million two years earlier.
