 House Panel Votes To Impose Sanctions On South Africa   The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1985  The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to impose economic sanctions on South Africa to try to force that government to abandon its policy of racial separatism, or apartheid.  In a 29-6 vote, the panel approved a bill that would prohibit nearly all loans to the South African government, bar new investments there by U.S. companies, end the importing of gold Krugerrand coins and stop sales to the South African government of computer goods and technology.  A committee aide said that, given the "overwhelming nature of the vote" and the general support for such measures, the House is likely to approve the bill "well before the end of the month." He added that the House Banking panel, which also has jurisdiction over the issue, told the Foreign Affairs Committee that it wouldn't hold separate hearings and didn't object to the measure moving to the House floor.
