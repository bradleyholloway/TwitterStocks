 Businesses Highlight Costs of Piracy   By Boles, Corey, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2007  Mr. [Jeff Zucker], speaking yesterday at a summit on intellectual-property theft hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called upon federal, state, local and foreign governments to work together with industries to tackle what he referred to as an issue that is "absolutely critical to economic prosperity."  "Those who are stealing our intellectual property aren't going to lie down," said Mr. [Thomas J. Donohue], saying the government has to fight theft.  The future of these distribution channels "will depend critically on our ability to protect this content from being stolen and to prevent our new distribution models from being compromised at birth by pirates and counterfeiters," said Mr. Zucker. NBC Universal is a unit of General Electric Co.
