 Clinton's Social Security Plan Appears Simpler and More Sweeping Than It Is   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  President Clinton's plan to "save" Social Security and Medicare is more complicated -- and his solutions are less sweeping -- than his rhetoric suggests.  It's mostly accounting. The government will take in more money than it spends, about $4.5 trillion more over 15 years. Of that, about $2.7 trillion will be turned over to the Social Security trust fund. Most of that money -- about 80% -- would go to buy Treasury debt from the public; the sum of government IOUs in the Social Security trust fund would increase.  The government would pay more interest to the Social Security fund, which, as an accounting matter, would help keep the fund from going bankrupt. The result is that general tax revenues from the government will be used to help keep Social Security afloat. The rest of the money -- about 20% -- would be invested in the stock market.
