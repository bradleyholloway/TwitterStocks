 Pixar Reaps Big Benefits From 'Incredibles'   By Marr, Merissa, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2004  "This is our highest-grossing animated movie yet," said Chuck Viane, head of distribution at Walt Disney Co.'s studio, which co-finances Pixar's movies and distributes them through its Buena Vista unit. The weekend tally wasn't enough to steal the animation crown from "Shrek 2," but "The Incredibles" did sneak into second place ahead of "Finding Nemo" which made a $70.2 million bow, although with fewer screens.  While "The Incredibles" beat the opening of "Finding Nemo," the studio played down its chances of topping the overall success of that movie, a 2003 release that took in $864 million at the box office world-wide. "We'd be thrilled if this movie did the same business as 'Monsters, Inc.,' which was released in November [2001]," Mr. Jobs said.  "The Polar Express" doesn't have just "The Incredibles" to contend with. On Nov. 19 Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures is releasing "The Sponge Bob Square Pants Movie," based on the Nickelodeon children's television series.
