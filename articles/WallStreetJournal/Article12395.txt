 Heard In The Northwest Some Small Caps May Be Done With Their Ugly Duckling Years   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1999  Just as they have been at the start of each of the past several years, small-company stocks are perched atop the "buy" lists of many Wall Street pros, who are convinced small firms will finally shine in 99. Some strategists think the Street's mighty midgets -- beaten so severely in 1998 -- are poised to outgun their large-cap brethren for the next three to five years.  Of course, similar convictions dating to 1996 got the experts, and the stocks, nowhere. The Russell 2000, benchmark for small stocks, lost ground in 1998 while its big-stock comrade, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, gained more than 28%. The Russell also trailed the S&P in 1997 and 1996, by as much as 11 percentage points.  Finally, consider what Jim O'Shaughnessy calls "the numero uno reason" to own small caps in 1999: Since 1928 there had only been three 20-year cycles in which small caps failed to best the S&P. Last year's dismal showing culminates the fourth such period, according to Mr. O'Shaughnessy, a Connecticut mutual-fund manager and author of the book, What Works on Wall Street.
