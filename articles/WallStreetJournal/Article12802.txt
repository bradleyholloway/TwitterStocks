 Italy's Banks May See Growing Pains   By By Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2002  With that behind them, investors are giving Italian banks a new start, hoping that new management, progress on the integration front and a brighter macroeconomic outlook will boost shares. IntesaBCI, Italy's largest bank, is at the top of this list, with its stock up 25% this year. Fueling the buying is the imminent arrival of a new restructuring-minded chief executive and hopes that hundreds of millions of euros in bad-loan provisions for everything from Enron to Argentina has improved the group's risk profile.  In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index ended up 0.2%, or 17.11 points, at 11797.22. Conglomerate CITIC Pacific gained 5.49% to end at 17.3 Hong Kong dollars. Financial and property stocks were particularly active. Bank of East Asia finished 2.08% higher at HK$17.2 and Dah Sing Financial rose 4% at HK$41.6. Developer Sun Hung Kai Properties inched up 0.36% to HK$70, Cheung Kong Holding closed 0.33% lower at HK$76 and Henderson Land ended 2.34% lower at HK$37.5. Leading office landlords Swire Pacific and Wharf pulled back after surging Thursday. Swire Pacific fell 4.36% to end at HK$48.30 after rising 8% Thursday and Wharf ended 1.79% lower at HK$22 after a 7% rally Thursday.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index closed up 0.6%, or 29 points, at 5203.1. Vodafone's restatement of sales and profit forecasts for its German operations sent shares down 10.5 pence, or 11%, to 98 pence, below the psychologically important 100-pence level. Vodafone dragged down wireless operator mmO2 by 5.3%, to 45 pence. Logica also suffered, shedding 19.5 pence, or 6.0%, to 306.5 pence. British Airways fell 9 pence, or 3.8%, to 229.5 pence after releasing disappointing April traffic numbers.
