 Love & Money: A Job Is Lost, but a Home Is Found   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2005  My worries about our finances weren't as dramatic, and ultimately I wanted her to quit. Yes, money is an issue; [Amy] can't stay unemployed too long. But I'm not overly concerned. Other hospitals have wanted to hire her since our return to Baton Rouge. I have faith in Amy; she's extraordinarily good at what she does. I have no doubt she'll find a good job, and soon. So while Amy worries some about our finances, I don't. At least not for now.  Yet, when Amy was up for the chief nursing officer job last summer, I figured that financially, maybe it wasn't such a bad move. Yes, it would alter my career path. But it would benefit the family because of Amy's pay and because the job would probably open the door to a more lucrative career for her over the long run. We'd be able to afford a lifestyle we probably couldn't match in New Jersey. We could buy a new car, save for college, put more money aside for retirement.  What I'm saying is this: At the end of the day, the move really wasn't about Amy's job or Amy's money, despite what I told myself. For all its faults, Louisiana is the place I want to be. I just never looked deep inside myself, deep beyond the money, to realize just how important those family and quality-of-life issues are.
