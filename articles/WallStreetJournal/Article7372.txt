 Live, From the Dentist's Office, He-e-e-e-e-e-r-r-r-r-e's His Wife!   By By Ed Bean, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1985  In comes Suzanne Harris Pastorius, assistant, wife, humorist and singer for St. Petersburg, Fla., dentist Steve Pastorius. While he drills, she strums her guitar and sings -- mostly country-and-western tunes. Willie Nelson is her favorite, but she takes requests. No rock-and-roll, please.  It's a tough world for young dentists these days; there are too many of them and too few teeth. So many are resorting to desperate measures -- big Yellow Page ads, funny costumes, or, in Dr. Pastorius's case, live concerts. Mrs. Pastorius, a sometime nightclub crooner with a voice she describes as "somewhere between Anne Murray and Emmylou Harris," put her music career on hold five years ago to help her husband establish his practice.
