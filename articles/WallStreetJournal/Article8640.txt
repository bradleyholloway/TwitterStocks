 Senate Panel Urges Expulsion For Packwood --- Ethics Committee Votes On Alleged Misconduct; Early Decision Is Likely   By Phil Kuntz and Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1995  The outcome is far from clear. The Senate hasn't expelled anyone since the Civil War, when it ousted 14 Southerners for supporting the Confederacy. More recently, Sen. Harrison Williams (D., N.J.) narrowly escaped expulsion by first resigning in the aftermath of his conviction in the 1979-80 Abscam bribery scandal. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, now the GOP's second in command, said in an interview about the [Bob Packwood] case two years ago: "Short of engaging in criminal acts and being convicted, the Senate should not expel anyone." Many lawmakers have expressed similar views in the past.  Democrats on the committee led the charge for expulsion. But in the committee's meeting yesterday, it was Chairman Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who proposed expulsion. His resolution accused Sen. Packwood of trying to obstruct the panel with "illegal acts [that] constitute a crime against the Senate." Mr. Packwood's repeated advances on women between 1969 and 1990 evidenced "a pattern of abuse of his position of power."  The Oregon Republican, chairman of the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, denounced the decision as "absolutely outrageous." He signaled he would fight to keep the seat he has held since 1969, but he didn't rule out a later decision to resign. "I've just learned not to make decisions on the spur of the moment when you've got time to think about them," Mr. Packwood said last night.
