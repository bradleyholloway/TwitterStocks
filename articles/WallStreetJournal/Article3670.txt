 Rebuilding the Law   By By Khaled Abou El Fadl, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2003  After gaining independence from Britain in 1930, Iraq, like most Arab countries, adopted Civil Law and Criminal Law Codes, which were adapted from the French and Germanic legal systems. Iraq's personal law, however, continued to be based primarily on Islamic law, feeding a thorny relationship between Iraq's Islamic legal heritage, and the legal system borrowed from Europe. Making the situation more difficult, in Iraq, as in many other Muslim countries, there were socio-political pressures to simultaneously Islamize and modernize.  Keeping all this in mind, the evolution of Iraq's new legal sytem will have repercussions for the entire region. The urban centers of Iraq, Baghdad, Basra, and Kufa played central roles in the birth of Islamic jurisprudence, and they continued to play a leading role in the development of the institutions and doctrines of Islamic law. Iraq's intellectual heritage, especially as it relates to Islam's divine law, continues to carry considerable moral weight within the Muslim world.  After the Gulf War of 1991, and especially after the rebellions in the south and north, [Saddam Hussein] announced that he would implement Islamic law in Iraq, but he did so primarily as a legitimacy and popularity ploy. Saddam had systematically obliterated all Islamic opposition, and gained notoriety for executing more Muslim scholars and jurists than any other leader in the modern history of Islam. But after the post-1991 rebellions were stamped out, the staunchly secular Saddam suddenly discovered religion: He made a point to be filmed performing his prayers, often interrupting media interviews, as he did with Dan Rather, to announce that he must pause for prayers.
