 In Ratings Wars, Wrestling and Rap Shows Boost a Laggard Network --- Attracting Young Male Viewers, UPN Gains on Rival WB, But Still Runs in the Red   By By Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1999  After serving as an industry joke for almost five years -- and losing more than $500 million in the process -- the sixth-rated broadcast network is in the midst of a surprising rebound. While UPN remains in last place, viewership at the network, owned by Viacom Inc. and Chris-Craft Industries Inc., is up 40% percent so far this season, even as its bigger network competitors are lucky to see gains in the single digits.  And, nearly two months into the new TV season, UPN is the only network that has yet to cancel one of its new programs. Indeed, Mr. (Steve) Austin's "WWF Smackdown!," a weekly wrestling program much-derided by critics, has evolved into one of the unqualified hits of the new season.  What makes UPN's turnaround particularly juicy is the recent slowdown at the WB network, its longtime nemesis. Launched in the same week of January 1995, the two so-called "netlets" have over the years had a particularly bitter rivalry. In a meeting with Madison Avenue executives, for instance, a former UPN president once wore a lapel pin featuring WB's frog mascot with a stake through its heart.
