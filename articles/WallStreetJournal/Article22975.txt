 Bush Aims to Boost Domestic Outlays To Fight AIDS   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2003  In the fiscal 2004 budget being released today, Mr. [Bush] will request $16 billon for prevention and treatment of AIDS in the U.S., a 7% increase above the amount he had requested for the current fiscal year. Mr. Bush said $100 million would be set aside to help buy drugs for those without health insurance and $93 million would go to research. The announcement Friday came a few days after Mr. Bush unveiled a five-year, $15 billion plan -- a tripling of the current U.S. commitment -- to supply drugs and medical assistance to help countries in Africa and the Caribbean stem the spread of the epidemic.  For Mr. Bush, the actions to fight AIDS represent a sharp turn in policy. Early in his administration, the disease wasn't accorded a high priority and he drew sharp criticism from AIDS relief groups. But at the midpoint of his term, advisers say the broadly expanded federal efforts now embraced by the president dovetail with his view of a compassionate government.
