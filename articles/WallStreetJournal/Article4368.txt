 Stocks Move Up on a Late Rally; Buying Programs Boost Blue Chips   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1988  The industrial average was down less than one point at 3:30 p.m. EST. But a surge in stock index futures prices prompted several waves of buying programs, which pumped up the prices of blue-chip stocks. The industrial average closed up 18.74 at 1914.46.  In searching for reasons for the futures market's late rally, traders and analysts said a substantial decline in the federal funds rate, a pivotal money market rate, could have been a factor. Although the Federal Reserve temporarily drained reserves from the banking system yesterday, the highly sensitive funds rate eased in the afternoon, trading as low as 4%. The average funds rate for the session was 6 1/4%.  According to stock traders on Wall Street trading desks, futures traders, watching the funds rate decline in the afternoon, aggressively bought index futures. When the prices of the index futures shot up, the premium between the futures and the actual index widened, making it beneficial for some market professionals to buy baskets of stocks that make up the index and sell the more expensive futures contract.
