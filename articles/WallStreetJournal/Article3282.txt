 Ivory Tower: Texas A&M Tragedy Sparks Tears, Prayers But No Outside Probes --- Can the School, a State Icon, Investigate Its Own Role In Fatal Bonfire Collapse? --- Seton Hall's Different Course   By By Susan Warren and Mark Tatge, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2000  The university allowed students without engineering experience to oversee a project that combined the dangers of logging with the dangers of high-level construction. It allowed them to work at night. It loosely enforced rules against student drinking on the job. Even after a rash of student injuries -- and after members of its own faculty declared the project perilous -- the university declined to intervene.  But when the 59-foot tower of logs collapsed last November, killing 11 students and one alumnus and seriously injuring 27 other students, the university dropped its policy of detachment. Various local and state agencies stood ready to investigate. But Texas A&M dismissed them, saying that it would take sole responsibility for determining how and why the tragedy occurred.  The school's approach seems all the more striking in the wake of another college tragedy. After a dormitory fire early Wednesday morning at New Jersey's Seton Hall University killed three students, Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo listed the agencies investigating the blaze: his office, the state police, and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as well as local police and fire departments. "It will be a painstaking investigation," Mr. Campolo said.
