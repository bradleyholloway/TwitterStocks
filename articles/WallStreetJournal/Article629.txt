 For the Poor Athletes Who Blame Their Tools, New Ones Are Coming   By By Hal Lancaster, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1985  Is your tennis backhand the stuff nightmares are made of? In your hands, is a four-iron a dead weapon? Take heart, klutzes of the world. If engineers at Wilson Sporting Goods Co. are right, technology is coming to your rescue.  OK, so maybe there's no way some technological gimcrackery can overcome the limitations of knock-knees and spaghetti arms. But at Wilson's research center in River Grove, Ill., they're sure trying. So far, computer and materials technology have produced an easy-to-hit tennis ball, a golf ball built for distance and accuracy and implements designed to move those balls closer than usual to the intended spot. And study of tire-tread technology has yielded an easier-to-hold basketball.  Wilson, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., isn't the only sporting-goods manufacturer dabbling in technology. A number of companies sell sophisticated physical-fitness equipment that provide physiological data. For example, Puma, the shoe maker, produces a running shoe with an electronic device that measures time, distance and calories expended; the shoe is then plugged into a personal computer for a readout.
