 The Growing Case For Dividends --- More Details Emerge on White House Plan, Offering Added Boost for Stocks with High Payouts   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, Ruth Simon and John P. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2002  Proposals are being floated in Washington about how best to accomplish the administration's goals. One approach is eliminating the dividend tax altogether. Another would reduce the tax rate on dividends to equal that on capital gains, typically 20%. Currently, dividend payments are taxed at ordinary income rates, as high as 38.6%. Yet a third possibility would exempt some amount of dividends, say, $1,000, from taxes.  If the proposal becomes law, corporations would come under increasing pressure to change their approach to dividends. Companies that already have dividends would be pushed to boost them. And companies that have never paid dividends, such as Microsoft, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, would face pressure to start paying them.  Dividends also are a meaty part of the stock market's total return over time. Statistics from Ned Davis Research show that from 1925 through Nov. 30, 2002, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned, on average, 10% a year. About 44% of that return came from dividends. Looked at another way: Take away the dividends that companies paid over time, and the stock-price appreciation amounted to just 5.7% a year on average.
