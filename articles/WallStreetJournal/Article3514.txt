 Investors Hope Stocks' Retreat Isn't Preamble to a Plunge   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  For the Nasdaq to begin putting in the kind of steady gains that characterized its behavior before 2000, investors who own Nasdaq stocks will need to get past the kind of behavior they have exhibited for the past two years. That "is a process that could take many months and probably years," warns Phil Roth, senior technical strategist at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Roth believes that the Nasdaq probably will manage to stay above its Sept. 21 low, but he thinks the tech group's travails could weigh on overall stock gains, keeping them below average for years.  The Nasdaq didn't exist back then, of course. The young Dow Jones Industrial Average, with its hot industrial stocks, was the volatile index of the day. Like the Nasdaq today, the Dow industrials went through a bubble in the 1920s, then crashed and suffered five failed rallies before finally bottoming out on July 8, 1932.  From early 1971 through the index's peak in March of 2000, the Nasdaq behaved according to a pattern -- a series of bull markets punctuated by occasional pullbacks. In the 29 years from early 1971 through March 2000, the Nasdaq went through eight bear markets, defined as drops of 20% or more. That was one every 3 1/2 years.
