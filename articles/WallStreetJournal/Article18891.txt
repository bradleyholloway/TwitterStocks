 Advertising: Rubbermaid ads pitch problem solving   By Narisetti, Raju, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1997  Rubbermaid is unveiling a major ad campaign the week of Feb 2, 1997 that positions its products as the answer to mundane household predicaments. The new campaign is the company's response to lower-priced competing products and the difficulty of getting shoppers to keep buying plastic products. Rubbermaid's consumer focus comes a year after it sharply increased trade promotions and in-store spending, and switched ad agencies, to Meldrum & Fewsmith, Cleveland.
