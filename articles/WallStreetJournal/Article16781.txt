 Alcoa-Alcan Exchange Signals Pressures   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  The exchange, detailed in a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, began June 20, when Alcoa Chief Executive Alain Belda sent a letter to Alcan CEO Dick Evans. He asked Mr. Evans about news reports of a "data room" Alcan was setting up so that parties interested in bidding on Alcan could examine company data and documents. In the discussion between the CEOs, Mr. Belda also alluded to possibilities of an improved bid.  Alcan representatives indicated company executives and its board were standing by their opposition to the Alcoa hostile takeover bid. "Alcoa chose to take their offer to our shareholders. Alcan's board rejected it," Alcan spokeswoman Anik Michaud said Tuesday. "We're continuing to pursue other alternatives."
