 CareGroup Plans Overhaul Of Its Board   By By James Bandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2000  The change comes at a critical time. Over the past two days, Dr. [James] Reinertsen told staff at CareGroup and its flagship hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, that the parent company and hospital will lay off workers, reducing payroll costs by $20 million. The total number of people is expected to be in the low hundreds and will include finance, information-systems, human-resources and other administrative staff, as well as nurses who aren't directly involved in patient care. The cutbacks take effect in mid-February.  Dr. Reinertsen told staff the layoffs were just one piece of a turnaround strategy. Another big component includes changing the structure of CareGroup's board. The board, which on Jan. 26 is expected to be reduced to 16 directors from 29, has been hobbled in the past by its size and the dual roles of some directors, many of whom also serve as trustees at individual hospitals within the CareGroup network. The structure of the board has been blamed, in part, for the organization's delays in implementing cost-saving efforts promised since the company was created in 1996. Boston-based CareGroup grew out of the merger of the former parent companies of area hospitals Beth Israel, New England Deaconess and Mount Auburn.  Under proposed changes to the CareGroup and individual hospital bylaws, directors won't be allowed to simultaneously serve as hospital trustees and CareGroup directors. The CareGroup board also gains the power to establish the budgets of the individual hospitals. "We want to make sure we're an organization that is capable of acting quickly and decisively on important issues," Dr. Reinertsen says.
