 AmSouth Folds Regional Fund Into Broader One   By By Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2000  AmSouth Bancorp.'s AmSouth Regional Equity Fund was folded into the AmSouth Value Fund on March 13, ending a 10-year run. Pete Verdu, the manager handling both funds from their starts, says the move was one of several fund mergers done after Birmingham-based AmSouth acquired First American Corp. of Nashville last year.  The regional fund had $45 million in assets and lost 17% of its value in the six months ended Jan. 31. The value fund -- with $715 million in assets -- lost nearly 9% of its value in the same period. But it has outperformed the market by six percentage points since the market's March peak, says Mr. Verdu.
