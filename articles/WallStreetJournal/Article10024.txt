 U.S. Options on Iran: Strike Now or Keep Our Heads in the Sand?   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2007  Bravo to Lt. Gen. Thomas G. McInerney for his crystal-clear assessment of the U.S. options regarding a menacing and dangerous Iranian regime ("Iran Escalates," editorial page, March 30). His comments on the danger of the prevalent "head-in-the-sand" inaction by our U.S. politicians, Arab countries and European allies should be required reading by all.  Gen. McInerney's commentary has an eerily familiar tenor. He flippantly asserts that Iran is a "rich environment for unrest," and that American attacks "would probably unleash a new Iranian revolution." This, and his calls for bypassing the U.N., and the assemblage of a "coalition of the willing," might as well be cut and pasted from the pre-Iraq invasion rhetoric about cakewalks, and U.S. forces being welcomed as liberators.
