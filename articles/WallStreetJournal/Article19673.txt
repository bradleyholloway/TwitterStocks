 GE Nears Sale of Guaranty Arm To Consortium for $2.16 Billion   By Kathryn Kranhold and Robin Sidel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2003  The deal could be announced as early as today; GE and PMI were still haggling over small details last night, people familiar with the matter say. A PMI spokesman declined to comment. Officials from Cypress and Bank of America declined to comment. Blackstone couldn't be reached for comment. PMI, based in Walnut Creek, Calif., is mostly a provider of private mortgage insurance to homeowners who don't have at least a 20% down payment to buy a residence. PMI also is in the financial-guaranty business, with a 24.9% stake in RAM Reinsurance Co., a Bermuda-based reinsurer of financial-guaranty primary insurance businesses such as GE's unit. In 2002, PMI had $346.2 million in net income on $1.12 billion in revenue.
