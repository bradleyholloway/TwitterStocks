 Sterling Gains 1% Against Yen, U.S. Currency --- Dollar Falls After Comment About the Japanese Unit By a Commerce Official   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1987  The British pound climbed about 1% against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen yesterday as it rallied for the third session this week. Against other currrencies, the dollar fell on comments -- which the White House said didn't represent its views -- by a Commerce Department official.  The British unit was aided yesterday by speculation that Britain's central bank opposes a cut in interest rates by commercial banks. Sterling's rise has been sparked in part by investors rushing to take advantage of Britain's high interest rates.  Separately, the dollar fell after Robert Ortner, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, told a U.S. ExportImport Bank conference that the yen "is still a little bit undervalued" against the dollar and ought to rise a further 10% to 15%. Mr. Ortner also said he believes the dollar "is fairly priced" against the West German mark and other European currencies.
