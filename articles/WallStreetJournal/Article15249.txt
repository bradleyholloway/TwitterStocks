 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1994  The exiled president set the date in a speech at the U.N. after Michel Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief and leader of the coup that ousted Aristide three years ago, fled to the Dominican Republic. The police force he led will be reorganized and retrained by an international group led by a former New York police commissioner. Meanwhile, the leader of Haiti's most feared paramilitary group called for an end to violence and pledged to work with the Aristide government.  The U.S. and China reached an accord in which China agreed not to export certain missile technology to Pakistan and the U.S. will remove sanctions it imposed on Beijing last year. At the same time, China agreed to hold talks with the U.S. about adhering to export guidelines designed to limit missile proliferation.  A strong undersea earthquake struck near Japan, causing at least 16 deaths in the Kuril Islands, controlled by Russia. The quake, measuring at least 7.9 on the Richter scale, triggered tidal waves and forced evacuations in many places, including coastal areas of Hawaii. The waves proved small, however, and warnings were lifted.
