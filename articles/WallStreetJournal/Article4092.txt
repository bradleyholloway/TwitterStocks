 Middle South Unit Omits Its Dividends On Preferred, May Miss Debt Payment   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1985  Louisiana Power & Light Co., a unit of financially troubled Middle South Utilities Inc., omitted dividends on all 18 classes of preferred stock and raised doubts about its ability to meet an $11.6 million debt payment due Tuesday.  The moves signal a worsening of the financial crisis at Middle South, which has said it has considered a bankruptcy-law petition in its efforts to pay the debt from its $3.5 billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear reactor. A second Middle South operating unit, New Orleans Public Service Inc., may also be unable to make a $14 million debt payment due next week, a spokesman for the two units said.  The units have been severely short of cash for more than two months. Without additional financing, they won't be able to meet their portion of debt payments to Middle South's banks due on the units' shares of the Grand Gulf nuclear unit, the spokesman confirmed. Missing such a payment wouldn't immediately place Middle South in default on its bank loans because the loans contain provisions for a 30-day "grace period" in such instances, the spokesman said.
