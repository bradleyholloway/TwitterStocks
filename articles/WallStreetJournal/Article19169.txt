 Crisis in Asia Spawns Millions Of `Newly Poor' --- World Bank Urges Changes In Financial Programs To Widen `Safety Net'   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1999  WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first detailed look at the impact of the Asian financial crisis on global poverty, the World Bank estimates there are millions of "newly poor" and recommends urgent changes in financial rescue programs to protect people, not just economies.  "Countries that until recently believed they were turning the tide in the fight against poverty are witnessing its reemergence," said bank President James D. Wolfensohn. "We must now draw on the lessons of recent experience to help us reshape our strategies for the future."  Programs to avoid and deal with financial crises in all countries should boost social protections, referred to by economists as "safety nets," the bank said in its annual update on global poverty. They include unemployment insurance, subsidized school fees, job creation, food subsidies and other programs aimed at keeping more people from slipping into poverty.
