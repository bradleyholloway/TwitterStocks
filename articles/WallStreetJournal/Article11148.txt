 Heresy Has Become Gospel at Unocal --- New Chief Preaches Sermon About Asset Sales   By By Frederick Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1988  "I don't care whether it's a tank truck, a chemical plant, a refinery, an oil field or a typewriter . . . look at it as if it were your own investment," Mr. Stegemeier tells his corporate flock. And if that asset doesn't produce an appropriate profit, and won't soon, then consider selling it, he advises.  What's gospel at the oil company these days was heresy not long ago. Fred L. Hartley, who retired July 1 after 24 years as chief executive, firmly rejected asset sales to cut the company's vast debt. Mr. Hartley remains chairman. Mr. Stegemeier is president of the company as well as chief executive.  A number of challenges may make that difficult for Mr. Stegemeier, who is 60 years old. At current oil prices, Unocal's earnings are depressed. It is involved in chemicals that haven't benefited from the boom in that business. Prices for some assets it wants to sell are low. Capping these are the difficulties of managing an organization that was steered by another executive for nearly a quarter of a century.
