 Electronics: So Many Megabytes, So Little Space --- Goal Is a Gizmo That Would Store All Digital Data   By By Evan Ramstad, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  Big names like Sony Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. and smaller fry like Lexar Media Corp. and SanDisk Corp. are trying to create a single digital storage medium that is as cheap, convenient and clear as compact disks, film, videotape and floppy disks. Such a product would allow people to move digital pictures and songs between computers, printers, camcorders, Palm Pilots, stereos, portable players, televisions and even picture frames.  Manufacturers aren't close to the ideal yet, but they are moving in that direction with various digital-storage devices, including higher-capacity floppy disks, ultra-tiny hard drives and plastic-coated memory chips that look like sticks of gum. But these devices aren't applicable to all types of digital output, and users complain the sound and picture quality of the products isn't up to the standards of older technology. What's more, the digital-storage devices on the market are, at least for now, quite expensive, with a single digital gum-stick chip costing more than $100.  Cameras generally use Compact Flash, a square about half the size of a business card. Digital-music storage devices and phones are using a flash product dubbed Multimedia Card or one called a SmartMedia card, both of which are smaller in size and data capacity than Compact Flash. All are too small for the standard openings in PCs, though there are adapters that make them fit.
