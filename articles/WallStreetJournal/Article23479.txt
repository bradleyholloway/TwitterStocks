 Politics & Economics: Crisis Eased, Turkey Index Is Up   By Christopher Emsden and William Echikson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2007  The tensions had driven the market, which was down about 8% at one point on Monday, sharply lower over the previous two trading sessions. The Istanbul stock market's benchmark index rose 1.7% yesterday after being up as much as 3% during the day. The Turkish lira's fall slowed after two days of sharp losses that followed the military's weekend warning that it opposed the governing party's plans to elect an Islamic-leaning president.  A constitutional court Tuesday annulled last week's election of the president by the Parliament. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the court ruling as a "bullet fired at democracy," but his Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials AKP, proposed holding elections for a new Parliament late next month instead of in autumn, as originally scheduled. The current term for the president -- largely a ceremonial post -- ends May 16.
