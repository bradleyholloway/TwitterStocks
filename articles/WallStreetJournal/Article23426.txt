 On Investing: Past Losses a Plus for Large-Growth Funds   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  Some funds that have posted positive returns this year aren't making distributions because they're offsetting any realized gains with past losses. Tax laws allow funds to carry forward their losses for eight years, so a fund that suffered in 2002 can use that to its benefit until 2010.  As of its Sept. 30 annual report, the fund had $407.8 million in stockpiled losses that could offset future gains until 2010, and another $136.5 million that could be used through 2011. Those losses add up to a hefty 70% of the fund's assets of $767 million, indicating the magnitude of gains the fund managers could realize before having to make gains distributions.  "If you have realized losses that are 71% to 100% of net assets, you're protected [from capital-gains distributions] for a lot of years," says Joe Brennan, head of the portfolio-review department at Vanguard Group.
