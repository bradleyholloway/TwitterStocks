 Common Sense: EBay, Yahoo, Despite Recent Hits, Are Still Solid Growth Companies   By Stewart, James B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2006  That was the theory. Both of those contracts expire next month, but it's already pretty clear that both contracts will expire worthless. The eBay strike price is $50, and shares were at $32 this week. Yahoo shares have fared better than eBay's. But call options are worthless in a declining market. The strike price on my Yahoo calls is $35, and shares this week were just above $30. If Yahoo is trading at $34.99 or below on the July expiration date, the contract is worthless. With options, "close" isn't good enough.  Investors' overall disillusionment with Internet stocks swamped the considerable news that emerged during the options period. The most dramatic was the announcement of a strategic alliance between Yahoo and eBay that briefly gave each company's shares a boost. The alliance even raised the possibility of an eBay-Yahoo merger, or an acquisition of eBay by someone else. I'm convinced that eBay has considerable inherent value because an auction site is a natural monopoly, or close to it. No one can match eBay's dominance of the North American auction market.  If investor sentiment has soured on eBay, it has also stayed skeptical of Yahoo. Though not as battered as eBay, its shares also hit a 52-week low about the same time. One possibility would have been to buy more Yahoo calls, as well as eBay calls, rather than shares. But with sentiment still so negative, and the call premiums still high for both stocks, I wasn't willing to continue the experiment, running the risk the contracts would again expire worthless.
