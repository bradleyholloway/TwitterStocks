 Focus on Franchising: This Franchisee   By Tannenbaum, Jeffrey A, The Wall Street Journal,  May 22, 1992  McDonald's Corp claims it was forced to sue franchise owner Steven L. Nelson and his Tass Enterprises Inc, a Des Moines IA operator of six McDonald's, to circumvent a new Iowa law that goes into effect Jul 1, 1992. The law grants broader rights to franchise owners, and would have affected Nelson adversely.
