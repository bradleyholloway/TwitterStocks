 Insider-Trading Caveat: In the End, Only Ethics Pays   By By John Shad, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1987  Five years ago, articles in leading magazines stated that insider trading was so pervasive, nothing could be done about it. Many took such articles to be a license to engage in insider trading. If everyone else was doing it -- and nothing could be done about it -- why not?  A few academicians contended that insider trading was good for the market. That it moved prices in the "right" direction. But few shareholders felt it was good for them if the president of a company unloaded his shares on them just before he announced bad news or if he purchased their shares just before he announced favorable news.  Since 1981, the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought 125 insider-trading cases, as compared with 77 during the previous 47 years. The large increase is due principally to the increase in tender offers and to improved surveillance and enforcement systems.
