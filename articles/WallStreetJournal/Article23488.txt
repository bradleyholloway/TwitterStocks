 Eyes on the Road: High Gas Prices? Shrug; Quality Family Time Trumps Cost For Holiday Weekend Driving Online edition  By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  First, let's look at me. I shelled out a bunch of money for gas, rather than abandon plans for a family getaway. I don't consciously put a dollar value on spending time chilling by the waterside with family, but in fact I did. It was worth the $40 to $50 of gasoline our car consumed on the round trip. It was also worth the additional $50 of gas I put into my daughter's Camry, effectively replacing the gas she burned during her holiday weekend travels.  Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds, says large SUV sales were strong last month compared with a year earlier, in part because General Motors Corp. and others offered some attractive deals. GM dusted off the 0% for 60 months financing promotion to help move Chevy Tahoes, Hummers and other SUV's in its lineup. Mr. Toprak estimated discounts in the segment of as much as $5,000 a vehicle. In January, Edmunds estimated the value of discounts on Tahoes at just $2,861. So, as they have done before, auto makers are responding to concern about gas prices by effectively rebating the incremental cost.  Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford's chief economist, says she's concerned about the potential that the housing slump and rising energy prices could depress consumer demand. But for the most part the people who buy new cars and trucks aren't low income people, such as my unemployed daughter. They are older, more affluent folks for whom the ups and downs at the pump don't really mean that much in straight economic terms. At least, not yet.
