 Google IPO Tests Theories On Auctions   By Sidel, Robin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2004  Legg Mason portfolio manager Bill Miller, who is considering bidding for Google shares in the IPO, has consulted with two auction theorists. Students of auction theory in California and New York are evaluating Google as a case study. And last month, even Google consulted with one of the country's best-known auction theorists -- essentially oddsmakers who analyze the best strategies for making a winning bid.  Under the system outlined so far by Google, investors will register with investment banks underwriting the offering, indicating how many shares they want to buy and the price they are willing to pay. Google and its bankers will consider the bids and other factors to determine a "clearing price" at which all of the bids could be sold. Anyone bidding below the clearing price won't get any shares. Google, which hasn't set a date for the IPO yet, is expected to release more details in coming weeks and months.  Because the pool of bidders is likely to be large, auction theorists say it will be difficult -- and potentially risky -- for investors to game the Google auction by making an offer based on mere beliefs about what others will bid. "The best strategy in this type of auction is to bid the truth because you want to put in a bid at a price where, if you win, you don't suddenly say, 'Oops,' " says Mr. [Matthew Rhodes-Kropf].
