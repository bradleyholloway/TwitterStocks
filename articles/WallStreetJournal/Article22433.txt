 The Underestimated President   By By Richard Norton Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1998  Seventy-five years ago today, a kerosene-lit farmhouse in a remote Vermont hamlet witnessed the most dramatic of inaugurals for the most prosaic of presidents, Calvin Coolidge. In today's climate of political fakery, Coolidge deserves reappraisal for his character as well as his ideas. He was a thoughtful and astute politician for whom American government was nothing if not self-government.  Cafe society sneered at Coolidge and the culture that produced him. Alice Roosevelt Longworth famously observed that he looked as if weaned on a pickle. When Coolidge opened his mouth, some said, a moth flew out. And who can forget Dorothy Parker's cruel wisecrack on being informed of Coolidge's death in 1933: "How could they tell?"  Yet his reticence was matched by his canniness. Denied the usual political gifts, Coolidge created a public persona that held the world at bay while allowing him to indulge a humor sharp as Vermont cheddar. No less an authority than Will Rogers said of Coolidge that "he wasted more humor on folks than almost anybody." Many Coolidge stories have the tang of self-parody. Urged to increase spending on military aviation, Coolidge asked his Cabinet: "Why can't we just buy one airplane and have all the pilots take turns?"
