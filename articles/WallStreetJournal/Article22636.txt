 Cultural Sites See Decline In Visitors   By By Jeffrey Krasner, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2000  According to a survey of 46 museums and historic sites, total attendance fell 4.7% last year. The dip, coming after a banner year for some of the region's most popular museums, left museum directors blaming everything including the Big Dig, the Internet, nearby casinos and the weather.  "Last year was actually a good year for tourism, but there's more things to do, and the spending is spread around," says Tim Tyrrell, professor of environmental and natural-resource economics at the University of Rhode Island, who studied the impact of cultural and historic tourism on the state economy. As for the economy, more disposable income doesn't translate into more museum-going, he says. "The economy may be so good that people are spending money on more expensive stuff, rather than an $8 museum admission."  For many New England institutions, 1999 was a real downer. The Museum of Science saw attendance drop 13%, to 1.7 million. The Children's Museum in Boston had a 14% decline to 377,146. And attendance at Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Conn., fell 3% last year, to about 413,000.
