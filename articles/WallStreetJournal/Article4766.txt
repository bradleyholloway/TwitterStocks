 Letters to the Editor: Don't Kill Marines' Big Bird in the Nest   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1991  Last year, the Pentagon commissioned a study by the Institute for Defense Analysis that compared all the proposed medium-lift alternatives, and specifically compared the V-22 and the Pentagon alternative, as well as other potential proposals. The study used $24 billion (for which you can build 356 Ospreys) as a budgeting bench mark, and examined 12 separate military missions. Its conclusions: "The V22's speed, range and survivability advantages enable even the 356-aircraft fleet to be more effective than all of the proposed alternatives." The V-22's unique tilt-rotor design (which allows it to take off like a helicopter and fly like a fixed-wing aircraft) gives it advantages no helicopter in the fleet can match.
