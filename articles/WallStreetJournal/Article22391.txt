 Greenspan Sees Asian Crisis Speeding World-Wide Move to Market Capitalism   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted the Asian financial crisis, which some cite as proof that unfettered markets are dangerous, eventually will be viewed as a milestone in the triumph of market capitalism.  In a speech full of echoes of his long-ago association with free-market political philosopher Ayn Rand, Mr. Greenspan celebrated "a significant and seemingly inexorable trend toward market capitalism and political systems that stress the rule of law." The current crisis in East Asia is likely to hasten the global trend toward free markets, even in "socialistic economies of Africa," he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors.  "The economies in crisis," Mr. Greenspan said, "did not use central planning of the pervasive Soviet Union style. They relied on markets in most respects, but they also used elements of central planning in the form of credit allocation, and those elements . . . turned out to be their Achilles' heel."
