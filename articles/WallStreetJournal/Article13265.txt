 Google, Craigslist Expand Into Real Estate; With Listings From Owners As Well as Agents, Sites May Weaken Realtors' Hold   By James R. Hagerty and Kevin J. Delaney, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2006  The Web-site companies say they don't aim to revolutionize real- estate brokerage and indeed are working to cooperate with brokers in many cases. But the growth of the sites may embolden more consumers to try selling their homes themselves and, when they do use agents, to reduce their reliance on them. Abdullah Yavas, a real-estate professor at Pennsylvania State University, says these sites may encourage an "unbundling" of agents' services, with consumers paying for only the services they want, rather than a whole package. For instance, a consumer might list a home on Craigslist and arrange showings, but still hire an agent -- for a lower commission -- to help with negotiations or guide the paper work.  Craigslist's chief executive, Jim Buckmaster, sees a move toward even more public access to information about homes for sale. The information "isn't something that should be controlled or owned by brokers," Mr. Buckmaster says. "It's going to eventually happen" that all the brokers' listings become publicly available. "You can mark that down as done. It's just a matter of when."  Google in November began allowing consumers and businesses to directly submit content such as real-estate listings for inclusion in some Google search results through a service called Base. Google previously included real-estate listings from sites it came across, but they weren't always up-to-date and couldn't easily be sorted by price and other attributes. In March, Google began on a test basis letting consumers who were searching terms such as "Los Angeles real estate" narrow their results by choosing various categories -- saying whether they want to rent or buy, for example -- and letting them see real-estate listings plotted on a map.
