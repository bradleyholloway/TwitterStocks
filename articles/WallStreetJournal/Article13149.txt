 Senate Panel to Alter Iraq Budget Bill; Pentagon Funds to Be Sent To Baghdad, Afghanistan; A Big Concession to Rice   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  Ms. [Condoleezza Rice]'s chief priority is restoring funding for the $658 million embassy compound for thousands of workers in Baghdad, said Mr. [Thad Cochran], who has included $592 million for this purpose. Economic- support funds for Afghanistan also would be boosted to about $1.3 billion in the Senate bill, $570 million more than the House approved.  "I'm trying to help the president, I think he deserves our support," Mr. Cochran said. The jockeying also shows how in today's budget climate, even members of Mr. [Bush]'s foreign-policy team must compete against one another for resources.  Ms. Rice's department bore the brunt of the cuts in the House, even as lawmakers were adding $2.2 billion above the White House's request to buy equipment for units in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate bill tilts the playing field back more toward the State Department and seeks to set up a situation where both State and the Pentagon will have to compete in the final House-Senate negotiations later this spring.
