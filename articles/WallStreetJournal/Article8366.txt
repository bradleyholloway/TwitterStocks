 Bookshelf: A Scribe's Life in Southern Maine   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1993  In Alexander Brook's world, journalists don't worry about whether David Gergen is restricting access to the president or how much the press plane to Oregon costs or whether the Treasury Department is providing a live feed from the secretary's meeting with business executives against the North American Free Trade Agreement. In his world, the journalists are printers who sometimes sell ads, and worry if the revenue that comes in by Friday will keep the paper alive until Monday.  Day in and day out, Mr. Brook did that sort of thing, and then he sold the darn paper, lock, stock and ink barrel, and wrote a book. He did things the hard way and he calls his book just that: "The Hard Way" (Bridge Works, 306 pages, $19.95).  There's a whiff of salt water in this book, the setting being the colorful corner of southern Maine where the lobstermen troll past Cape Porpoise and the tourists stroll on Ogunguit's slender Marginal Way just a whisker from the sea. There's some personal pathos in this book, too, the author managing to move his wife to Maine, divorce her, remarry her, divorce her again and then marry someone else, all in one volume, maybe setting some kind of record. And there's also some romance in this book, unless only those of us who are journalists see something magical and mystical in the lone (and long-suffering) small-town editor who is part scribbler, part town crier, part huckster, part entrepreneur, part debtor, part revolutionary and part philosopher.
