 Developing an 'Employer Brand' Online edition  By Lorber, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  1. Be honest about who you are as an employer. Many employers try to figure out what candidates want, promise it, and hope works it out when they're hired. If a company isn't as advertised, employees aren't likely to be happy once they're on board. For a small firm, each new employee can make a notable difference to the company's success, and hiring a poor match can be a costly mistake.  A common complaint among applicants is that they never knew if anyone received their resume. Or they interviewed and didn't hear back. "A small company doesn't have an excuse if they're not overwhelmed by applicants and they're not continually recruiting," says Ms. [Jo Bredwell].  If you're thinking about starting a blog for recruiting, consider how often you'd respond to inquiries. If you don't have time to respond to all inquiries and to post new items frequently, don't blog."Blogs need to be fed, watered and maintained," she says.
