 Art & Money: Sparkling Expectations   By By Andrew Decker, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1998  Not quite a household name, Mrs. Whitney nonetheless was born rich and married well. Her first husband was James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt; her second was John Hay Whitney, an oil and tobacco heir. Mr. Whitney was publisher of the New York Herald Tribune and also served as ambassador to Britain. He died in 1982, and his wife died in March of 1998. They were married for 40 years.  The art would represent a bonanza for the dealer or auction house given the consignment. Christie's International PLC has recently won several high-profile estates, but rival Sotheby's has the inside track on this one: the jewels consignment, plus a longtime, lucrative business relationship with the Whitney family. Among a trio of major works sold on behalf of Whitney family members, in 1990, Sotheby's sold Mrs. Whitney's "Au Moulin de la Galette" by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which her husband had bought in 1929 for $165,000. With a bid of $78.1 million, it went to Japanese paper tycoon Ryoei Saito. Last year, after his death, it was resold privately through Sotheby's at a price believed to be near $50 million.
