 Resorts' Donald Trump Sues to Block Merv Griffin's Bid, Calling It 'Illusory'   By By Richard Koenig and Eileen White Read, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1988  Mr. Trump, the New York developer who has 88% voting control of Resorts, alleged in his suit that, among other things, Mr. Griffin was making a "wholly illusory" offer to manipulate the stock price of the company, a casino and hotel operator based in Atlantic City, N.J. The suit, filed Friday in federal court in New York, asks the court to enjoin Mr. Griffin from pursuing his offer, and asks for damages of at least $250 million.  In addition to Mr. Griffin, the suit names Griffin Co., the Los Angeles-based concern through which Mr. Griffin has made his offer, and Fedelle V. Scutti, a Florida investor and dissident Resorts holder. Mr. Griffin has an option to purchase half of Mr. Scutti's 5% stake in the Class A shares.  Mr. Griffin, in a prepared statement, said Mr. Trump's suit was without merit and brought solely to "coerce" him to withdraw his offer, which covers both Resorts' Class A and Class B shares. A spokesman for Mr. Griffin said he plans to file his own suit alleging breach of fiduciary duty by Mr. Trump, who is Resorts' chairman, and by Resorts' independent directors, who also have spurned Mr. Griffin's bid.
