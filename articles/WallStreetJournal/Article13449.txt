 Washington Mutual Warns On Profit Due to Credit Woes   By Carrns, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  The main reason for the earnings drop is a big boost in WaMu's provision for loans it expects to go sour -- primarily mortgages made to borrowers with weak credit, as well as home-equity loans. WaMu, the sixth-largest U.S. mortgage originator according to Inside Mortgage Finance, has been releasing bits of bad news for months. The company's stock is down 20% year to date.  WaMu shares rallied, perhaps suggesting investors viewed the news as a sign that the worst may be over. But such optimism could be premature, since WaMu also implied that charge-offs, or loans considered uncollectible, spiked to about $425 million, up from $271 million in the second quarter. "Credit deterioration in the quarter was significant," said Fred Cannon, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. "It's hard to look at this release and say it's all behind them."
