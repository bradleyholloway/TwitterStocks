 Discount Rate Move Is Likely to Bolster Economy, but Some Predict Further Cut   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1986  But further reductions will be needed in coming months to keep the economy afloat, many analysts say. Some predict the discount rate, the fee the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, will drop at least another half-percentage point by year's end, and that other borrowing costs will fall about the same amount.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, Citibank, First National Bank of Chicago, Northern Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co. and Irving Trust Co. were among the banks that followed Chemical's lead.  The discount rate cut represents "an insurance policy designed to shore up the economy," said Robert G. Dederick, executive vice president of Northern Trust. Mr. Dederick, a former Commerce Department undersecretary for economic affairs in the Reagan administration, said the decline "should bolster housing and other interest-sensitive sectors."
