 Some Employees Just Aren't Suited For Dressing Down --- Corporate `Casual-Day' Rules Can Be a Formal Hassle; Wear Green Jeans, Not Blue   By By Louise Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1995  For the first time in his life, Mr. Sienski, a 36-year-old technology-development manager, finds himself facing workplace taunts about his appearance. And all because his employer, E-Systems Inc., a defense contractor here, adopted a weekly casual-dress day.  Once a gesture of rebellion, dress-down day has become so widespread that adopting it is an act of conformity. A 1992 survey of 504 companies showed 26% had a dressdown day, according to apparel maker Levi Strauss & Co., which encourages casual wear every day. Human-resource experts say the practice is growing in popularity. Even staid International Business Machines Corp. is instituting a casual-dress policy.  It isn't any easier for women to relax at work. "It's actually harder to dress casual," says Fran Eichorst, a Southland Corp. corporate personnel manager who owns "15 years worth of suits." She would like to dress as men do on casual day -- in cotton twill slacks -- "but you don't want to look like a guy." On a recent Friday, she sported bluejeans, red socks, a red shirt and a safari jacket.
