 As Senate Switches to Democrats, Republicans Ratchet Up Offense   By By David Rogers and Shailagh Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2001  President Bush, stung by the defection of Vermont Sen. James Jeffords, began a series of private dinners to improve working relations, first with his former political rival, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), last evening, and another is scheduled with the incoming majority leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, tomorrow.  When the Senate convenes this morning, Mr. Daschle will be recognized as the new majority leader, but the transfer of power began last evening when the doors of the Senate chamber closed on Mr. Jeffords's last day in the GOP. Speaker Dennis Hastert (R., Ill.) walked over from the House minutes later to congratulate Mr. Daschle, and workmen prepared to move Mr. Jeffords's desk from the Republican to the Democratic side of the chamber.
