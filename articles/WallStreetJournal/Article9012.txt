 House Panel Expands Its China Satellite Probe   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1998  The special House committee investigating exports of U.S. satellite technology to China has expanded its probe to include shipments of supercomputers and precision machine tools to that Asian nation.  During a closed-door hearing about two weeks ago, the panel questioned Stephen Bryen, a defense consultant and former Pentagon official, on the national security implications of exporting supercomputers to China. Mr. Bryen, who advocates tight export controls for items such as supercomputers, said in an interview that he told the panel he is highly critical of a 1996 Clinton administration change in export rules that resulted in shipments of supercomputers to China.  He also said some committee members were amazed to learn that several years ago, during the consolidation of the U.S. defense industry, China bought at public auctions in the U.S. precision machine tools and dies used to build airplanes and other items. Another person familiar with the House committee's work said the panel also is looking into how U.S. firms may have unwittingly exported machine tools and similar products to intermediary companies that then sold these items to Chinese companies.
