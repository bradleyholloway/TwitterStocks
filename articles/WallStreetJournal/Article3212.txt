 TV: The Turner Classic Addiction   By By Dorothy Rabinowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1999  The fact is now unavoidable. For some time there have been signs that a large number of Americans are now hopelessly addicted to the Turner Classic Movies network -- so much so that they would cheerfully relinquish all else on television, and possibly their day jobs, to keep their TCM. Moreover, that addiction steadily grows more serious. Only a few weeks ago, the New York Times television critic Walter Goodman, whose new cable system doesn't carry Turner Classic Movies, wrote a column detailing his feelings of bereavement -- feelings that would have come as no surprise to anyone in the viewing population now seriously dependent on TCM.  All this came home with peculiar force in May, when TCM offered no less than 55 Bette Davis films -- works now little known, from the early `30s, like "The Cabin in The Cotton" and "Three on a Match," along with major Davis films of the late '30s, the '40s and the '50s. The offerings included a curious little drama made in 1948 called "Winter Meeting," which starred Davis as a successful but haunted career woman in love with a war hero who also turns out to be haunted. An odd tale, yes, and an excessively talky one, but also a film that remains riveting up to its remarkably silly ending.  Beginning today and continuing every Sunday through September, TCM begins airing its Bowery Boys festival, which will no doubt please some of its customers and make numerous others particularly grateful for the policy forbidding frequent repeats. Recently, TCM offered a festival of sorts devoted to the films of Dennis Morgan. Dennis Morgan? The devotion to TCM is such, of course, that its customers take what comes without asking too many questions. Indeed, according to TCM's general manager, Tom Karsch, the network actually received one fan letter praising TCM for bringing Dennis Morgan back.
