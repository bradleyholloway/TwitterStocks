 Big Stocks Fail to Share in Feast Lesser Issues Enjoy --- Lack of a Surge Amid Good Signs Puzzles Investors   By By Steven E. Levingston, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1994  Stocks and bonds last week played all sorts of strange games: When bond prices rose stocks fell and when bonds plummeted stocks rallied. Witness the late 30-point surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday on huge volume even as the Treasury's 30-year bond plunged nearly 7/8 point.  Mr. Johnson thinks hard economic data played less of a role in debilitating the stock market than did more elusive factors such as Corporate America's growing wariness of President Kennedy. A similar scenario may be unfolding today, he says. Among the examples of the battle between big business and the government, Mr. Johnson cites the Clinton administration's heavy hand in trying to reform and regulate the health-care industry and the recent Federal Communications Commission ruling requiring a 7% reduction in cable-television rates.  On March 24, 1962, Mr. Gingold wrote, "Most corporate news is optimistic. . . . However, caution is apparent in the Street and among investors." A week later, he reported, "There has been no business news to induce an important volume of selling, yet the market . . . sagged throughout last week. Analysts are at a loss to explain this action." The next week, Mr. Gingold wrote, "In the recent declining stock market, analysts have found it difficult to pinpoint the reasons for the spells of selling. A number of analysts are expressing doubts about the business trend, but business itself is reporting a comfortable situation in most cases, with expectation of better things to come."
