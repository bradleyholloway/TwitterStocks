 Family Finances: Know What Your Bank Branch Is Pitching   By Jaime Levy Pessin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  Stock investments are entirely appropriate for many investors. But some bank customers may not understand that they are being steered away from deposits that don't fluctuate in value to stock investments that do, says Jill Gross, director of the Pace Investor Rights Project at Pace University Law School in New York. "There are many investors out there who just don't understand they're changing the nature of the product, not just the interest rate or the rate of return. We're talking about an entirely different level of risk."  Ms. Gross advises bank customers to ask whether their principal will be totally protected. Just because a broker says an investment product is low-risk, it doesn't mean you can't lose some of your initial investment, she notes. Also, she says, it's important for consumers to ask whether there are any penalties for withdrawing money from a brokerage or annuity product.
