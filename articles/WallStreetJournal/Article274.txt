 Pain of Mutual-Fund Fees Is More Acute When the Market Is Going Down Than Up   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1998  Mutual-fund fees are among the most contentious -- and for small investors, least understood -- issues in the $5 trillion fund business. The fund companies say that, on average, small investors are benefiting from an overall reduction in fees and expenses. Consumer advocates say that investors are actually paying more.  "It's easy to ignore fees when you're making 16% to 20%, but it gets a lot harder to overlook when you're only making 8%," says Dave Foster, a Cincinnati-based financial adviser. Using round numbers, Mr. Foster illustrates his point: Say your fund earns a gross return of 15%, and you pay a 1% management fee. Mr. Foster says you are paying a fee to the fund company that is equal to about 6.6% of your 15% overall return. But what happens when that performance adds up to just 10%? "You're now losing 10% of your total return," says Mr. Foster, who himself charges a fee to help investors buy the right funds.  Investors often don't realize how fees affect their fund's performance. Take the nation's largest mutual fund, Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund. For the past 12 months through July 31, Magellan produced a healthy 18.84% "gross" return excluding expenses, according to Morningstar Inc., Chicago. But adjusted for fees and expenses, Magellan's return drops to 18.10%. Factor in the fund's 3% "load," and the return falls to 14.55%.
