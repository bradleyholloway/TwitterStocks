 Olivetti to Shuffle Telecom Italia Shares --- Stock Conversion Will Put Stake Below 50% as it Cuts Huge Debt Load   By By Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2001  According to the plan, Telecom Italia will convert all of its savings shares -- which account for 30% of the group's capital -- into ordinary shares, using a financial technique that will bring in 10 billion euros ($9.36 billion) and simplifying the capital structure by leaving just one class of stock. The cash will be used to repurchase as much as 10% of the ordinary shares, which would effectively transfer the cash to Olivetti. Olivetti will then cut by about a third its 18 billion euros of debt, which it took on to finance its takeover of Telecom Italia.  Furthermore, the operation will leave Olivetti holding 40% of Telecom Italia, down from its current 55% stake. This would in theory render Telecom Italia open to an outside takeover bid, but analysts said such a move was unlikely given the dominant stake Olivetti will retain.
