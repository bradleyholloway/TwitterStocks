 Simmons Will Begin An Effort to Unseat Board of Georgia Gulf   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1989  Investor Harold C. Simmons and a company he controls said they are beginning an effort to unseat Georgia Gulf Corp.'s board in an attempt to prevent the Atlanta company from taking further anti-takeover measures.  Mr. Simmons and NL Industries Inc. own 9.9% of Georgia Gulf and have proposed acquiring the chemicals company or helping it recapitalize in a transaction that would bring shareholders at least $55 a share in cash, or about $1.38 billion.  In a letter to Georgia Gulf, J. Landis Martin, NL's president and chief executive officer, said the group will begin soliciting consents to oust Georgia Gulf's directors unless Georgia Gulf agrees that it won't take actions to prevent any of Mr. Simmons's proposed transactions.
