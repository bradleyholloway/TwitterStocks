 IBM 5.2% Revenue Rise Trails Forecast --- Firm Warns of Weak Profit; Concerns May Return About Y2K Slowdown   By By Jon G. Auerbach, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1999  The stunning news from the world's largest computer maker caused IBM's shares to fall $7 in after-hours Instinet trading to $100 after closing in composite New York Stock Exchange trading at $107, down 12.5 cents. Before the release of IBM's earnings, the shares had risen $6.1875 to $112.75 in regular Big Board trading. If IBM's stock is hit in trading today, every dollar it drops will send the Dow Jones Industrial average down five points.  Mainly because of the Y2K effects, IBM warned that fourth-quarter profit may be 15 to 20 cents a share below the year-earlier period, coming up as much as 29 cents shy of analysts' estimates of $1.33 a share. IBM warned of continued Y2K effects "into next year."  IBM's results highlight just how unevenly the Y2K bug is affecting technology companies. Both Microsoft Corp., which reported ebullient earnings Tuesday, and EMC Corp., the No. 1 high-end data-storage vendor, reported negligible Y2K effects, and IBM shares rose this week on Microsoft's news. But IBM's hardware business was walloped.
