 The Mansion Glut   By By June Fletcher and Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  To gauge the ubermarket, we decided to take a cross-country tour of some of America's superpriced homes, which range from places like movie producer Peter Guber's Colorado ranch (he wants $63 million) to John Melk's Bahamas island ($56.5 million). For this kind of money you don't always get as much as you'd think: One $50 million Long Island retreat lacks a swimming pool; another island getaway isn't even on the beach. In the case of Mrs. Payson's home, the issue is upkeep -- it runs about $600,000 a year. Three of our sellers have dropped their prices; two places are being marketed in smaller parcels.  The site and views are spectacular: It's high on a bluff at the tip of Long Island and is surrounded by more than 100 acres of protected land (Mr. [Paul Morrissey] didn't let us tour). But the place is somewhat rustic for someone looking to shell out $50 million for a house. The Colonial Revival main house, two guesthouses and staff houses haven't been renovated much since Messrs. Morrissey and [Andy Warhol] bought the place. And there's no tennis court, no fancy gym -- not even a swimming pool. "I've had the good sense not to improve" it, says Mr. Morrissey.  Given the fact that Mr. [Nelson Peltz] hasn't really lived here since the mid-'90s, the place is remarkably well-kept. Indeed, Ned Monell, the broker, says Mr. Peltz keeps a full-time staff to groom the palms, rake the 609 feet of sandy beach, and keep the home's 14 bedrooms and 13 baths sparkling when potential buyers drop by. (We weren't invited in.) And Mr. Peltz continues to pay more than $1 million a year, including property taxes, just to keep it going.
