 Court Says Insurers Don't Have to Pay In Waste Cleanup   By By Wade Lambert, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1989  New York's highest court, in a victory for the insurance industry, ruled that companies that intentionally discharge hazardous waste can't force their insurers to pay for the cleanup or for damage caused by the waste.  The New York Court of Appeals in Albany said insurers aren't required to pay in cases where the discharge of waste isn't accidental. Technicon Electronics Corp., the company that appealed the case, maintained that even though it intentionally discharged the waste, it didn't intend to cause pollution. Therefore, Technicon said, if pollution occurred, it was accidental.  Technicon had sought to force its insurers to pay for its defense against a personal injury suit stemming from the waste and against an Environmental Protection Agency action. The EPA, under the Superfund Act, had cited the company as potentially liable for the cleanup; the agency is studying whether a cleanup is required.
