 On Sports: Doubles Action Behind Closed Doors   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1986  New York -- One of my distinctions is that a few years ago I played a set of tennis against Kathy Jordan, the pro. The people running the women's tour thought I might be interested in doing a column on how an average-guy male player (me) would fare against one of their stars, Kathy being ranked 11th in the world at the time. I had a pretty good idea what would happen, but I went ahead anyway. I was right. I got whipped, 6-0.  Jordan does serve and volley well, which is why she is one of the world's best doubles players. Her distinctions include women's doubles titles at Wimbledon and the French Open in 1980, and at the U.S. and Australian Opens in 1981, all with partner Anne Smith. Last year, she and Elizabeth Smylie broke the 109-match winning streak of the Martina Navratilova-Pam Shriver team in the Wimbledon final.  Jordan, 26, played in the doubles at the U.S. Open this week, advancing to the quarterfinals in both the women's and mixed events before losing. That may be news even to tennis fans, because the doubles proceed more or less in secret here -- usually on the outer courts of the National Tennis Center -- and its results are relegated to the small-print sections of the sports pages.
