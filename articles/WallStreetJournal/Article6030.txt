 E-Commerce (A Special Report): A Consumer's Guide --- Technical Adviser: IM: Not just child's play   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  Another core feature of IM is the "buddy list." You determine who your "buddies" are among your correspondents, then the software informs you when they are online and able to receive a message. There are a number of privacy options built into IM systems that allow you to control what people know about you; you can say, for instance, say that you are away at lunch, or that you just don't want to be bothered, and some systems can even block the fact that you're online. In theory, privacy is less of a concern with IM than it is with e-mail, since IM systems are used to communicate not with the whole world, but with a small group of family, friends and colleagues.  If you don't believe me, try it yourself. This is the best part of the IM world -- it's free of charge, and the software can be easily uninstalled if you decide you don't like it. The three most widely used IM systems are offered by America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. It does matter which IM system you pick, because you can't use IM with people who have a different software package than you do.  In addition, the makers of IM systems are busy trying to add "grown-up" features. You can, for example, easily exchange files from your PC with your IM buddies -- one reason why IM systems are a popular venue for MP3 music distribution. IM is also offering users alerts if new e-mail arrives, and suppliers are even adding voice capabilities, so you can literally chat with your buddies, as long as all concerned have microphones and speakers at their PCs.
