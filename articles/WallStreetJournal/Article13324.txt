 Google Service Lets Users Search For Archived News   By Delaney, Kevin J, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2006  The Mountain View, Calif., Internet company is working with media outlets such as New York Times Co. and Washington Post Co., as well as news-retrieval services such as Reed Elsevier Inc.'s LexisNexis, to make articles available through the Google service. The Wall Street Journal and Factiva, a news-retrieval service jointly owned by Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. and Reuters Group PLC, also are making articles searchable through the new Google service.  The news-archive service also includes articles that [Google] has indexed from the Web without formal arrangements with their publishers. That practice prompted a copyright lawsuit filed by French news agency Agence France-Presse in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia last year. The news agency alleged that Google's presentation of short excerpts of its articles and photos constituted copyright infringement. Google says it allows publishers to opt out of Google News and that it has removed AFP content from its news site.
