 Executives on Trial: Trial of Tyco's Ex-Counsel Opens; Prosecution Slams Belnick For Taking Loans, Bonus; Defense Refutes Allegations   By Bray, Chad, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2004  Defense attorneys countered that Mr. [Mark Belnick] believed his compensation was proper and needed to be approved only by L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Bermuda conglomerate's former chairman and chief executive. Mr. Kozlowski and Mark Swartz, Tyco's former chief financial officer, are facing separate charges in the matter.  In an 81-minute opening argument, Ms. [Amy Schwartz] charged that Mr. Belnick borrowed more than $14.8 million from 1998 to 2001 under the company's relocation program, first to buy an apartment near Central Park in Manhattan, and later to buy a home in Utah, where he was Tyco's lone employee.  In his 93-minute opening statement, Reid Weingarten, Mr. Belnick's lead counsel, countered that Mr. Belnick was a family man who was looking for a change when he joined Tyco in 1998. Mr. Belnick negotiated exclusively with Mr. Kozlowski with the understanding that Mr. Kozlowski was solely responsible for setting his compensation, Mr. Weingarten said.
