 Productivity Indicates Sluggish Economy --- Many Economists See Slow Gains, at Best, Ahead   By By Lindley H. Clark Jr. and Alfred L. Malabre Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  But the service sector accounts for only some 47% of the economy's total output. Service-sector jobs generally don't lend themselves as readily to productivity gains as jobs in manufacturing, whose share of total employment has fallen to about 17% from more than 30% in the early 1960s.  In the first quarter, overall productivity in nonfarm businesses fell at an annual rate of 2.7%, according to U.S. data. This decline was the steepest drop since early in the 1981-82 recession, and it occurred even though productivity in manufacturing rose at an annual rate of 4.9% in the quarter; sharply falling productivity in service businesses wiped out the gain.  Some economists, it should be noted, maintain that the productivity picture is less bleak than it seems, because productivity is difficult to measure in service businesses and may be understated in the official Labor Department figures.
