 Special Deliveries: Anti-Abortion Forces, In a Change of Tactics, Offer Alternative Care --- Evangelicals, Others Provide Hot Lines, Tests, Homes And Avenues of Adoption --- Pressure to Be Born-Again?   By By Alix M. Freedman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  Mr. Falwell and other abortion foes have developed new, more sophisticated tactics for reaching women facing unwanted pregnancies. Frustration over the sustained level of abortions and legislative setbacks made them conclude that lobbying and picketing weren't enough. They couldn't refute critics who accused them of providing little but fire-and-brimstone moralizing to women in crisis.  According to a survey by Intercessors for America, a Christian prayer group, about 2,000 anti-abortion pregnancy centers are operating around the country. The Christian Action Council, the largest Protestant anti-abortion group, will sponsor 200 new centers this year, bringing its total to 440. Mr. Falwell wants to have 10,000 churches taking part in his program by the end of the decade. (He now has more than 260.) Says Intercessors' director, Gary Bergel: "We are digging in and multiplying."  The anti-abortion forces say these programs are saving the lives of many children. Mr. Falwell, the Baptist TV evangelist best known as the founder of the Moral Majority, says that 22,000 women have called his pregnancy hot line since 1982 and that only 1% of them subsequently got abortions. The Rev. Wales A. Goebel, the founder of the Sav-a-Life program in Birmingham, Ala., estimates that his success rate in face-to-face counseling is almost 99%. The Christian Action Council claims 80%.
