 Goldman, Nikko Salomon Win Mandates for Big Japanese Offer   By By Jason Singer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2002  After heated competition, the agency that manages the government's rail holdings said it selected Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd. and UBS AG unit UBS Warburg to arrange the bigger of the two sales, in West Japan Railway Co. Nikko Salomon is a joint venture of Japan's Nikko Cordial Corp. and Citigroup Inc.  It's also a blow for Morgan Stanley, but hardly surprising. Morgan Stanley wasn't invited to participate in the selection process because regulators had sanctioned it for a securities-law violation and some of its Tokyo operations were suspended at the time.  Morgan Stanley, which with Nomura arranged a 652 billion yen global sale of JR East stock in 1999, submitted a written proposal anyway. But it wasn't invited back to give a presentation. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
