 GM Ups the Ante In Warranty War; Extended Coverage Marks Shift From Costlier Incentives; Sifting Through the Fine Print   By Chon, Gina, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2006  GM, which previously offered bumper-to-bumper warranties for three years or 36,000 miles on its nonluxury models, is the latest auto maker to extend its warranty coverage as part of a broad effort by the industry to move away from cash rebates and other costly incentives. "Powertrain" warranties cover parts of the vehicle that make it move, such as the engine and transmission, while "bumper to bumper" warranties cover the cost of most repairs except for normal wear and tear, such as oil filters.  Warranty coverage is important in giving consumers peace of mind and confidence in their purchase. It also boosts a vehicle's resale value, which contributes to quality perceptions. But reading the fine print is important, and warranties are just like other options to consider when buying a car, experts say. Some vehicles with diesel engines have different warranties, while some warranties charge a deductible for repairs. And hybrid vehicles often have a separate warranty for hybrid-only parts, such as the battery. The 10-year, 100,000-mile Hyundai warranties are not transferable and are reduced to a five- year, 60,000-mile warranty if the vehicle is sold before the warranty expires.  Ford's new warranty is part of a "plan to reduce the need for incentives," Francisco Codina, Ford's group vice president of sales and marketing, said in July. "We'll see a meaningful improvement in residual values because of the warranty increase."
