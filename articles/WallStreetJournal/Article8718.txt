 Dollar Gains a Bit on Mark, Ends Off Against Yen in Quiet Trading Session   By Patterson, Rebecca H, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1996  Mr. [Dennis Pettit] said the mark could fall as far as 68.10 yen, which in turn could drive the dollar higher against the mark but lower against the yen.

Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president, said prospects for Germany's stagnant economy to recover "aren't as bad" as they are claimed to be.

"It's just a matter of timing."
