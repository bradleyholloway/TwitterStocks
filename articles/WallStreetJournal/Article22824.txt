 China Speedily Prints Books About Sept. 11   By By Leslie Chang, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 2001  When China's state-run newspapers were ordered to tone down their reports of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., some surprising players rushed to fill the gap: State-run publishing houses, increasingly driven by the demands of the marketplace.  The China Workers' Press offered "Attack of the Century," a 250-page volume with minute-by-minute accounts of events on the four hijacked planes and back-cover photos of people jumping to their deaths from the World Trade Center's towers. The China Social Sciences Press offered "Empire's Nightmare," with glossy photos and political analyses from a hastily assembled stable of experts. Both books rely heavily on summaries of foreign news reports and other materials culled from the Internet. Each has pretty much sold out an initial printing of about 40,000 copies, a stellar figure in China's fragmented publishing market.  Taken together, these instant books provide a tantalizing view of the closest thing to a free press in China today. Between their covers can be found the anguished recollections of survivors, chilling tales of escape and graphic photos of people fleeing or frozen in dismay. There is open admiration for Americans' generous instincts to aid victims and donate blood, as well as overt criticism of a "unilateralist" foreign policy that some scholars charge has made the U.S. a terrorist target.
