 Heartland, Investors to Buy MascoTech In Latest Industrial-Manufacturing LBO   By By Kara Scannell and Steven Lipin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2000  Analysts say the price is fair for MascoTech, which was spun off from Masco in the early 1990s. Wall Street seemed to agree, pushing shares of MascoTech up $4.50 a share, or 39%, to $16. Shares of Masco Corp., which still owns 18% of MascoTech, rose 12.5 cents to $20.375.  MascoTech stock had been heading south for some time. Over the past year its shares are down 31%, according to Baseline, about the same decline as its former parent Masco, which has fallen 32%. In two years, MascoTech has fallen 45%. By some estimates auto-supplier stocks are trading between three and six times forward earnings.  After Heartland was given the mandate to proceed with the MascoTech deal, it sought out other investors and brought in Credit Suisse's Group CSFB Private Equity, which invested as well. In all, the investment group will pay approximately $550 million in cash, with the remainder coming from a financing package led by Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase has provided commitments of $1.5 billion. The management team will own 20% of the new company after the buyout.
