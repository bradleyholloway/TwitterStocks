 U.S., Britain Want to Defer Aid to Soviets --- Some Russian Economists, Leaders Agree That Plan Wouldn't Be Effective   By By Elisabeth Rubinfien, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  When Western leaders meet in Houston next week, the U.S. and Britain plan to argue that a controversial plan for massive aid to the Soviet Union is premature. Surprisingly, leading Soviet economists and officials agree.  West Germany and France have proposed an immediate $15 billion infusion of international aid, while Britain and the U.S. say cash won't do any good unless serious economic reforms are in place. Soviet economists say that the help would be welcome, but that the country simply isn't ready to absorb it yet.  Before any aid could be effective, some Western and Soviet experts argue, the country must start price reforms, industrial privatization, reconstructing its banking system and building better supports for foreign investment. Linking the aid to such economic conditions could actually help Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev push through unpopular reforms.
