 Bookshelf: Kids' Stuff From an Old Asia Hand   By By Everett Groseclose, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1986  How else can one explain the author's latest entry into the world of books? Not another "Tai-Pan" or "Shogun" -- but rather a handsome, oversized children's story called "Thrump-O-Moto" (Delacorte Press, New York, 96 pages, $20).  Whatever the author's reasons for doing the book, "Thrump-O-Moto" is a delightful yarn. This reader's 14-year-old daughter, a discerning veteran of countless children's stories good and bad, swiped the book and read it in a single sitting during a recent lakeside holiday. She pronounced it "charming" and, "not quite like anything I've ever read before -- part 'Alice-in-Wonderland' and part 'Arabian Nights.'"  Thrump-O-Moto, age 465, height about two feet and bedecked in a kimono, meets Patricia, a cheerful seven-year-old who lives on the edge of the Australian Outback, when he muffs a travel trick at home in Japan and ends up in Australia. Patricia, who can move about only with the aid of crutches, is soon "woozed" through time and space to Japan by her new-found friend.
