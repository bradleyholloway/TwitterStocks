 Ad Notes...   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  WIEDEN OVERHAUL: Wieden & Kennedy, the closely held Portland, Ore., ad agency, shuffled its executive lineup in the wake of the marketing shakeup at big client Nike and last week's departure of Nike's global ad director Geoffrey Frost. Dave Luhr, previously director of account service, was named Wieden's chief operating officer. Chris Riley, the former director of planning, becomes chief strategic officer. Ben Kline, previously global account director on Nike, becomes director of account service in Portland. More actions are likely in regional offices, including New York.  SONY EMBRACES Y&R: Sony of Japan's Sony Electronics said it tapped Young & Rubicam to handle advertising for its consumer products, a job previously done by Interpublic Group's Lowe & Partners/SMS. The agency beat out WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson and True North Communications' Foote, Cone & Belding. Annual spending on the account is estimated at $50 million to $60 million. Young & Rubicam and Tokyo-based Dentsu developed Sony's global campaign with the tag "Do you dream in Sony?"
