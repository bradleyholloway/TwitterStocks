 Futures Markets: Coffee Prices Rise as the U.S. Appears Willing to Accept Formula for Quotas   By By John Valentine, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1988  The apparent willingness of the U.S. to accept the current formula for allocating coffee export quotas for next season and not fight for a larger share for hard-to-get mild coffees triggered active buying of futures contracts.
