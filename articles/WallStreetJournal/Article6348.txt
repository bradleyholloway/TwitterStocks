 Women Win New Rights in Morocco by Invoking Islam   By Leggett, Karby, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2004  Progress came first in a form that was barely recognizable. In 1993, bending to pressure from activists, Morocco's aging monarch, King Hassan II, set up a commission to review women's legal status. But the commission had no women as members and produced only minor changes, such as allowing women whose fathers were deceased to select their husbands. "It was like a conspiracy of silence," Mrs. Skalli says.  Yet by changing a part of the existing law, the commission had embraced a central part of Mrs. Skalli's argument. "It meant the Family Law was no longer sacred," she says. By then, married with two children, Mrs. Skalli reframed her case: Islam, she argued, was about protecting women, not hurting them. She pointed to passages in the Koran that showed Prophet Mohammad allowed polygamy only when the husband was able to provide equal treatment to each wife, and even then he didn't encourage it.  Earlier this year, Mrs. Biler filed a new petition -- and a claim for alimony, which wasn't allowed before. Under the new law, Mrs. Biler's petition should be granted in months, according to her lawyer, Chaouki Ajani. A religious woman who prays daily, Mrs. Biler says the new law "is good for Muslim women." More importantly, she adds, "It doesn't contradict the principles of Islam."
