 NWA's Northwest Gives Airbus Order For 10 Jetliners   By By Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1989  The Northwest Airlines unit of NWA Inc. ordered 10 Airbus 330 jets valued at a total of $860 million, making it the first U.S. airline to agree to buy the high-technology aircraft.  The order is in addition to 10 options placed by St. Paul, Minn.-based Northwest for the aircraft in 1987. It provides a boost for Airbus Industrie, the consortium owned by four European partners.  Airlines typically pay less than sticker price in such transactions, but neither Northwest nor Airbus would disclose the exact price Northwest is paying.
