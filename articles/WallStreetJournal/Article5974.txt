 Analysts' Reports: Don't Believe the Hype   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  No wonder, then, so much controversy swirls around Wall Street's research analysts these days. Congress is investigating how analysts arrive at their often-bullish research conclusions. (For the record, only about 1% of all research recommendations are sells.) The securities industry is scrambling to restore its credibility, as regulators propose measures that would mandate more forthright communication with investors. A few securities firms have gone further: Prudential Securities, which gutted its investment-banking unit, says its analysts should say sell when they mean sell and not hide behind euphemisms.  Here is the real rub: Academic evidence suggests that buy recommendations aren't an overly valuable indictor. Even research directors at top brokerage houses say investors shouldn't take the one-word ratings as gospel. "No one should just react to the recommendation," says John Hoffmann, director of global stock research at New York securities firm Salomon Smith Barney.  To start with, don't blindly heed buy recommendations. Kent Womack, a finance professor at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H., found in a study published in 1996 that "new buy recommendations are only marginally valuable." The ensuing price rise of about 3% in the six months after the call, he says, "would probably cover your commission cost."
