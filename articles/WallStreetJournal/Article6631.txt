 On Investing: Weaker Dollar? Bet on Bigger Firms   By McKay, Peter A, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2006  U.S. companies can also benefit from a falling dollar because it makes domestic goods and services cheaper for overseas buyers, encouraging them to go on shopping sprees in America. It also discourages U.S. consumers from buying imported goods, which become more expensive in dollar terms.  Mr. [Jim Paulsen] believes the falling dollar favors small U.S. companies whose business is heavily domestic, but that is a minority view these days. Most investment pros see the dollar's woes as more of a mixed bag for small stocks in the U.S., based on the assumption that the dollar's strength broadly relates to the strength of the U.S. economy.  Foreign-stock vehicles for U.S. investors include exchange-traded funds tracking EAFE and other indexes on foreign shares. ETFs are structured like traditional mutual funds but trade throughout the day on major U.S. exchanges.
