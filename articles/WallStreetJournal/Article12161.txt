 Many Military Officers Say Gulf War Syndrome Results From the Stress of War, Not Chemicals   By Ricks, Thomas E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1997  Indeed, a recent study published in "Annals of Internal Medicine" by three doctors, two from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Command and one from the Department of Veterans Affairs, found that a substantial number of veterans of every major U.S. war have endured constellations of symptoms including memory loss, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and headaches. Dr. Kenneth Hyams and his colleagues concluded that "poorly understood war syndromes have recurred at least since the U.S. Civil War." In World War II, some called this "combat stress reaction" or "combat fatigue"; in Vietnam, it was called "post-traumatic stress disorder."  The most significant point about Gulf War syndrome may be that it isn't going to go away. There already is enough misunderstanding, enough clumsy moves by the Pentagon and, most of all, enough pain among thousands of veterans, to keep the controversy stoked for years to come. "I will make a prediction to you," says Peter Feaver, a former staff member of the National Security Council who now teaches political science at Duke University. "This will be the MIA issue of the next 30 years."  That's a far cry from the widespread belief that the syndrome somehow results from chemical-weapons releases in the war that the U.S. military somehow is hiding. GOP Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut began a hearing on Gulf War syndrome last month by noting that "many Gulf War veterans report . . . symptoms [of] memory loss, fatigue, muscle and joint pain." Following him, Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont Independent, charged that the government was guilty of "at least an apparent cover-up."
