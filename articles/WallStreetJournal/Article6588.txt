 Dating Game -- Stock-Options Criminal Charge: Slush Fund and Fake Employees; U.S. Accuses 3 Ex-Executives At Comverse Technology Of Long-Running Scheme; Scrambling to Avoid Detection   By Charles Forelle and James Bandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2006  In the affidavit, FBI special agent Kevin Riordan said two compensation-committee members told him they assumed the "as of" date on the consent forms they later received was the day Mr. [William F. Sorin] had called them. It was not, the affidavit said, adding: "No corporate action whatsoever occurred on the 'as of' dates." The FBI agent added in his affidavit that the two committee members told him they didn't realize the grant carried a lower trading price and that they "did not intend to grant in-the-money options."  After meeting with their own lawyers, the three began to backtrack, the government said. In a later meeting with an in-house lawyer, the trio said there might be "some issues" because "hypothetically speaking," phone calls to the compensation committee weren't made on the dates of the grant, according to the affidavit. It added that Messrs. Alexander and Kreinberg "importuned" the in-house lawyer "to handle the internal investigation personally instead of hiring independent counsel." The next day, Comverse's board formed a special committee to investigate the matter.  -- March 9: Messrs. Alexander, Sorin and [David Kreinberg] tell Comverse lawyer there may be "issues" and "hypothetically speaking" they may not have called compensation committee members for approval on the date of the grants and that they may have "looked back" in selecting options dates.
