 Sea Turtles' Gains Damaged by Tsunami; Conservationist's Struggle In Sri Lanka Shows Effects Of Disaster on Ecosystems   By Eric Bellman in Kosgoda, Sri Lanka, and Rebecca Buckman in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2005  "Everything was taken by the water," says Mr. [Chandrasiri Abrew], rubbing his head and looking up at the coconut palms that are all that is left standing around his Sea Turtles Research Center. "Now there's no hatchery, no money."  Of the seven types of sea turtles found in the world's oceans, six are either endangered or "critically endangered," meaning they are at severe risk of extinction. "So every turtle is important," says Kim Davis, deputy director of the marine conservation program at the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C.  Though it is illegal to sell, buy or eat turtle eggs, Sri Lankans on the country's west coast say there has been a rush of eggs onto the market. "Usually they all go to the hatcheries but now you can buy them," says one hotel owner who bought 50 turtle eggs last week and fed them to his sons like vitamins. "You just take the top off, put in a bit of salt and then drink it."
