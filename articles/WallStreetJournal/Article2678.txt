 Forget U.: That's Kennesaw College's Riposte for Harvard --- No-Name, No-Clout Schools No Longer Are Left Out As Congress Goes Right   By By Ron Suskind, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 20, 1995  If you are looking for the new brain trust, the original thinkers who will form the intellectual vanguard in the Age of Newt, come meet the lightly published, anti-intellectual intellectuals here at Kennesaw -- proud home of ousted House historian Christina Jeffery. Or drop in on professors down the interstate at West Georgia College, where House Speaker Newt Gingrich once taught and now looks to an inner circle of professors for advice. Or chat with House Majority Leader Richard Armey, a onetime economics professor at West Texas State University.  "Our day has finally come," says Timothy Mescon, dean of Kennesaw's new business school, the site from which Mr. Gingrich last year taught his "vision thing" seminar, "Renewing American Civilization." Dr. Mescon adds: "The Harvards and Yales and the cultural elite are on the run. The Kennesaws are where the cutting-edge ideas will be coming from."
