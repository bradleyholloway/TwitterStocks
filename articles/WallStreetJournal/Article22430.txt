 Hong Kong's Image as Financial Center Is Tarnished by Conviction of Lawmaker   By By Erik Guyot, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1998  The conviction of a well-known legislator who represents the securities industry here underscores how problems of poor corporate governance are tarnishing this city's reputation as a financial center and hurting its wobbly economy.  Chim Pui-chung was convicted Saturday of conspiracy to forge share-transfer documents relating to a 1992 property deal. The 50-year-old businessman is scheduled to be sentenced today and could face as many as 14 years in prison. Mr. Chim has vowed to appeal the case and couldn't be reached for comment.  The circumstances surrounding Mr. Chim's case cast a spotlight on shady corporate-governance practices in Hong Kong. Mr. Chim was convicted of conspiring to forge share-transfer documents relating to his listed company Lucky Man Properties Ltd. The businessman was acquitted of other charges to defraud shareholders in the company.
