 Household Holders Still May Seek Control of Firm --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1985  Mr. Moran, who two weeks ago lost a Delaware Supreme Court battle against Household's poison pill anti-takeover defense, made the disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Some Household insiders thought the group might throw in the towel after the court ruling.  The group holds the equivalent of 3.9 million common shares, or a 6.6% stake in Household, assuming conversion of 1.8 million shares of convertible preferred voting stock, the filing said. Household, Prospect Heights, Ill., has interests in consumer finance, retailing, manufacturing and car rentals. A spokesman for Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp., the New York-based investment concern included in the group, said the stake has remained unchanged for the last nine months. The spokesman for the group wouldn't comment on the filing.
