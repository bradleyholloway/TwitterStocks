 Court Clears Offer for Most Of Barings PLC --- Internationale Nederlanden Bid Will Cover Losses, But Wipe Out Holders   By By Glenn Whitney and Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1995  The Bank of England also noted that ING, which will inject #660 million into the Barings operations, is guaranteeing the safety of some #2.5 billion in deposits that could have been jeopardized. Barings' prestigious list of clients is believed to include Queen Elizabeth II and a number of charities, including one sponsored by Prince Charles.  Despite the relief at Barings over the sale, the reverberations from the spectacular failure of the 233-year-old investment bank probably will be felt for some time. Authorities continue to investigate the activities of 28-year-old Barings employee Nicholas Leeson. Mr. Leeson, whose allegedly unauthorized trading in futures and options led to the losses, is being detained in Germany after fleeing Barings' Singapore office when the debacle was discovered. Moreover, officials are trying to determine why Barings executives ignored numerous warning signals from inside and outside the bank about possible problems.  ING is acquiring Barings' investment banking, securities and asset-management divisions, as well as Barings' 40% stake in Wall Street investment bank Dillon Read & Co., which ING plans to retain. But ING isn't buying the holding company, Barings PLC. The reason for this, ING executives indicated, is to enable ING to avoid any legal liabilities arising out of the parent company's failure.
