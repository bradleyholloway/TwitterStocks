 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Political Diterrence   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1991  Call him Justice Thomas, but don't forget the spectacle designed to ruin Clarence Thomas. After the hearings ended, a consensus emerged that it was important to pump the slime out of the Senate confirmation process. But not all are party to that consensus. The special-interest alliance that poisoned the well wants little changed. And nothing will, unless we move past a mood of general revulsion and get down to specifics.  We keep reading, for instance, that Joseph Biden can't find any crime in the strategic leak by the Judiciary Committee of the Hill affidavit. If the new rule is that the promise of confidentiality by a congressional committee means nothing, let Senator Biden say so. It clearly is a crime to leak FBI reports; ask Nixon aide Chuck Colson how he enjoyed his seven months in jail for the offense. Since Congress has no constitutional power to prosecute crimes, this is a job for the Justice Department, which now presides over an FBI whose confidentiality stands compromised by the leak of a secret Bureau report to the New York Times and Newsday.
