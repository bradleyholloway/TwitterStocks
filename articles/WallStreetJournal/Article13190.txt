 By A Thread: To Soothe Anger Over Subsidies, U.S. Cotton Tries Wooing Africa; Americans Offer Help, Advice As Poor Nations Urge WTO To Kill Federal Farm Aid; Mr. Butler's Gunfire Greeting   By Scott Kilman and Roger Thurow, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2005  President Bush has said the U.S. will work with European nations to scale back farm subsidies; the White House is sensitive to the divisive nature of cotton aid. But zapping the U.S.'s network of cotton subsidies, or immediately scaling them back, isn't a politically viable option. The cotton industry has powerful Congressional supporters who don't want cotton singled out ahead of other subsidized crops.  This unstable landscape has prompted U.S. cotton to adopt an "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" strategy. By offering technical and scientific help they're hoping the Africans will drop their demands and instead accept a gradual reduction in subsidies. Under WTO rules, any agreement must be a consensus of all 148 member nations.  The U.S. spends more money on cotton subsidies than any other nation. The U.S. cotton industry last year collected $4.5 billion in subsidies on a crop worth $5.9 billion, according to the USDA. This system enables U.S. farmers to export three-quarters of their harvest and control about 40% of world trade. That's despite the decline of their traditional customer -- the U.S. textile industry -- and the fact that others produce cotton at lower cost.
