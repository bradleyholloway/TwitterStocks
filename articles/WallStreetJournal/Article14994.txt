 Fouling Out: A Founder Embezzled Millions for Basketball, Phar-Mor Chain Says --- It Takes Huge Charge, Fires Its Auditors, Lays Off 100 But Proclaims Optimism --- Doing the Inventory Shuffle   By By Gabriella Stern and Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1992  Short and stocky, "Mickey" Monus decided to start the World Basketball League for relatively short players -- those 6-foot-7 or less. Although the franchise had only 10 teams in midsize cities like Dayton, Ohio, and Erie, Pa., Mr. Monus ran it "like the NBA," says Milton Kantor, part-owner of the WBL's Dayton Wings. Limousines were provided for league officials. The commissioner of the five-year-old league drove a league-leased Cadillac.  Phar-Mor has been a phenomenon. In just a decade, it zoomed to $3 billion in sales, using deep discounting in warehouse-sized stores selling everything from prescription drugs to videotapes. Now, Phar-Mor Chief Executive David S. Shapira, who with Mr. Monus founded the chain, is busy reassuring bankers, suppliers and distributors that the company can survive. "We are very optimistic about the company," Mr. Shapira says.  Mr. Monus's empire began unraveling last month when World Basketball League team owners rebelled because players and referees had not been paid for nearly two months. Mr. Monus, who generally owned 60% of each team, was liable for most of the losses. At the WBL all-star game July 15 in Youngstown, Mr. Monus met with disgruntled team owners and assured them that payrolls would be met. Mr. Kantor says Mr. Monus "issued two checks that day" to Canadian teams, both of which bounced.
