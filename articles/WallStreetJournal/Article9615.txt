 Pixar Net Falls, But Help Found In 'Nemo' Success   By Wingfield, Nick, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2003  Pixar said its results continued to reflect the success of its blockbuster movie "Finding Nemo," which had grossed $424 million at the box office world-wide by the end of the third quarter and is on track to be the top-grossing movie of the year. Pixar said "Finding Nemo" is the top-selling home-video title in the U.S., though the movie was released to home video just this week, too late to be included in third-quarter results. The company said it sold more than eight million copies of "Finding Nemo" on digital videodisc and videotape on the first day it was released in North America, a record that surpassed the previous top seller, "Monsters, Inc.," which sold five million on its first day.
