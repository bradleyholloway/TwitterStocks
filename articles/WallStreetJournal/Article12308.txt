 Price Lays Groundwork to Exit Franklin   By By Charles Gasparino and Jill Goldsmith, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1998  Some people in and around the fund business say the noted fund manager is strongly hinting that he will step down as chief executive of Franklin Mutual Advisers Inc. at year end. Mr. Price, who sold his popular Mutual Series mutual funds to Franklin Resources in 1996, isn't ruling out the possibility of such a move.  Since the sale to Franklin, Mr. Price has delegated more of the funds' day-to-day management to his proteges, including Ray Garea and Larry Sondike. In March, Franklin announced it promoted two senior analysts, David Winters and David Marcus, to newly created senior vice president positions. "Transitioning to my guys in the office is going well. The funds are fine," he says.  The firm has made a strong showing in the arbitrage business, he says, though it has had its share of missteps, such as its investment in Cityscape Financial Corp., which Mr. Price has termed his "worst mistake." His funds haven't kept up with returns generated by Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but according to Mr. Price, they aren't supposed to; the Mutual Series funds are designed to outperform the competition in down markets.
