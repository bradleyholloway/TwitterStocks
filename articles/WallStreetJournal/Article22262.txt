 Clinton Joins Lott's Call for CPI Panel --- Action Promises to Advance Bipartisan Budget Plan; New Price Index Sought   By By Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1997  With that word from White House Budget Director Frank Raines, the administration and the GOP Congress may have taken their most important step yet toward a bipartisan plan to balance the budget. With the current consumer price index widely held to overstate inflation, an index that rose more slowly could cut billions from the deficit over time, mainly through lower Social Security cost-of-living allowances and higher receipts from taxes indexed for inflation.  The public comments, kicked off a week ago with Sen. Lott's call for an independent commission, reflect private conversations that have been under way between the White House and GOP leaders. The Republicans had been waiting for some public sign from Mr. Clinton backing the commission idea, to give them political cover on the volatile CPI issue and to test the president's seriousness about reaching a budget deal.  Meanwhile, any questions as to why Republicans are so eager to have Mr. Clinton's fingerprints on any CPI proposal are answered by a few papers found within the Democratic Party fund-raising documents that the White House released last week. Just two years ago, the papers show, Mr. Clinton's party sought to raise millions of dollars with a letter blasting a Republican plan for a reduced CPI as "a cowardly and backdoor" plan "to cut Social Security COLAs."
