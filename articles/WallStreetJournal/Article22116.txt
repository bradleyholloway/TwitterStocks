 AT&T Will Eliminate 40,000 Jobs And Take a Charge of $4 Billion --- Preparing for Spinoffs, Giant Firm to Slash 24,000 Manager Posts   By By John J. Keller, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1996  The magnitude of the cuts stunned even some veteran AT&T-watchers. It broadly signaled that, for many major U.S. corporations, the eagerness and urgency for wholesale restructuring continues unabated. For AT&T, in particular, it also underscored that -- even after trimming some 85,000 people in the decade since the breakup of the old Bell System empire -- AT&T still employs far too many workers. As the telecommunications market endures vast change and a raft of new competition in coming years, what had been seen as "lean" only a few years ago may be not lean enough in the future.  "This is a big number -- a very, very big number," said Blake Bath, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co. "It's a lot bigger than Wall Street had been anticipating." Wall Street responded well, sending AT&T shares up $2.625 yesterday to close at $67.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The charge is AT&T's seventh major earnings hit in 12 years, and the latest layoffs would bring the company's total job cuts to 125,500 in the past decade. The new charge will trigger a loss for the 1995 fourth quarter and slash full-year earnings by $4 billion, or $2.50 a share. A final tally will come later this month when the telecommunications giant reports its fourth-quarter results. In the first nine months of 1995, AT&T earned $2.82 billion, or $1.77 a share. In 1994, full-year profit was $4.7 billion, or $3.01 a share.
