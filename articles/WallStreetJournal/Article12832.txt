 Manager's Journal: Don't Count on Laws to Restore Trust in Markets   By By Paul Maco, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2002  Premised on the notion that nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of a hanging, Sarbanes-Oxley added penalties for corporate wrongdoing to a variety of regulatory initiatives already underway. Equally salient, it set a tight time-frame for implementation, giving many companies little time to come into compliance with a raft of new regulations. Not least among the act's provisions, CEOs and CFOs will soon likely face a significant increase in lawsuits.  Slow actors have some room to breathe, but not much. Some certification requirements became effective on signing. Others take effect over time periods ranging from 30 days to next year. Approximately 13,000 companies, including non-U.S. issuers, registered with the SEC need to fall in line. While the framework for new requirements is in place, much of the detail is still to come and will arrive over an extended period of time.  It will be a major undertaking for the next few months. Board chairs will need to review board structure, particularly that of the audit committee (including its members' background), and be prepared to conform to both the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, including procedures for handling complaints, and of applicable stock exchange and Nasdaq listing requirements. If new audit committee members are required, it may be time to start the search.
