 Amerisource, Kindred Near a Deal; Institutional Pharmacies Would Be United, Spun Off To Gain Scale in the Market   By Berman, Dennis K, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2006  If completed, a deal would create the nation's second-largest institutional pharmacy, which distributes and prepares patient medications for nursing homes, hospitals and hospices. While the industry continues to grow, it is continually under pricing pressure from insurers and government programs that foot the nation's medical bills. Broader consolidation has also put stress on players such as AmerisourceBergen and Kindred, where institutional pharmacy isn't core to either business.  Margins in the institutional-pharmacy business are higher, but the same macro-economic trends are weighing on the industry. It was those pressures that helped drive Omnicare Inc.'s unsolicited and ultimately successful bid for rival NeighborCare Inc., which created an institutional-pharmacy leader with a $5.6 billion market capitalization. With its scale, it can exert influence with suppliers on their own pricing demands. A combined AmerisourceBergen-Kindred unit might have more leeway to do the same, while also squeezing more costs from combined operations.
