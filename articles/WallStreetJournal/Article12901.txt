 Deals & Deal Makers: Tyco International Could Be Voted Off Its Island --- Bermuda Incorporation Gets Challenge From Shareholders In Test of Postscandal Ire   By By Mark Maremont, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2003  Tyco's new management, under former Motorola Inc. executive Edward Breen, has recommended a vote against the repatriation resolution. The company argues that its new board -- by today the entire slate of directors will have changed since the last annual meeting -- hasn't had time to evaluate the issue. Tyco is also worried about the impact on its low tax rate. Tyco moved its incorporation to Bermuda in 1997 when it merged with security-alarm concern ADT Ltd. It maintains operational headquarters in New York City and in New Hampshire.  One of the proposed new directors to be voted on today has publicly opposed incorporation in places such as Bermuda: H. Carl McCall, former New York state comptroller. When running for New York governor last year, Mr. McCall joined other officials in opposing Bermuda registration for companies. Mr. McCall said it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on the Tyco proposal before he is elected, but said, "It's clear to me this is an issue the board has to confront, has to examine very carefully."
