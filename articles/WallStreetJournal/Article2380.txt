 Witco Will Buy 2 Schering Units For $453 Million   By By Andrea Gerlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1992  Witco Corp. said it agreed to buy Schering AG's two industrial chemicals and natural substances divisions for 660 million marks ($453 million) in the fourth quarter of 1992.  Witco, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and petroleum products, had sales of $1.63 billion in 1991.  Following the company's announcement, Standard & Poor's Corp. said it placed Witco's single-A senior debt and single-A minus subordinated debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. S&P said while it anticipated the acquisition, the transaction was larger than expected. If the purchased is financed as expected, S&P said Witco's risk will increase significantly. The company has about $190 million of debt outstanding.
