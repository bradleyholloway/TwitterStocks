 Turmoil at the Times   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2003  It's a free country, and perhaps the Times has decided it wants its reporters to explain the world in this partisan tendentious way. This is the tradition in Europe, where newspapers and their staffs are understood to be right (Le Figaro) or left (Le Monde), and it was once true of American papers too. If the Times wants to return to those days, its editors would do better to come out and admit their bias. The confusion -- for readers and especially for impressionable young reporters like Jayson Blair -- comes when a newspaper preaches one standard of fairness and objectivity but practices another.  On this journalistic score, a blow for fairer reporting was struck recently at the Los Angeles Times. Editor John Carroll pointedly rebuked a reporter for a story about the link between abortion and breast cancer for loading up adjectives and phrases that portrayed abortion opponents in a negative light. He wrote in a staff memo that he was "concerned about the perception -- and the occasional reality -- that the Times is a liberal, `politically correct' newspaper." This is the kind of adult supervision that editors are supposed to provide, and that readers once expected.
