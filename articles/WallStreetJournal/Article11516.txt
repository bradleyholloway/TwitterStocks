 Major Tells Hong Kong if Chinese Rule Goes Awry, Britain Will Be Little Help   By By Jesse Wong, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1991  Mr. Major told a news conference yesterday that Britain will do its best to help preserve Hong Kong's capitalist way of life, as China likewise has undertaken to do after 1997. But he said that uncertainty remains for the colony's largely ethnic Chinese population. He also acknowledged implicitly that, should anything go wrong after 1997, Britain's ability to help would be limited.  "The people of Hong Kong have to live with that reality every day," he said. "Sovereignty will revert to China in 1997." It is Hong Kong and China, he stressed, that will have to make a success of the territory's existence under Chinese rule.  Mr. Major's Hong Kong stop came at the end of a whirlwind tour during which he called on the leaders of the U.S., the Soviet Union and China. Being the first major Western leader to visit Beijing since China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests, he initially faced strong criticism at home.
