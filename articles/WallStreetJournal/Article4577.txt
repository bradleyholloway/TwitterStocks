 Conservative Indiana Ponders a Radical `New' Investment Tool   By By James A. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1989  Theodore Sendak is sounding the alarm that Indiana's pension funds are being led down the road to financial ruin. "I just think that {pension-fund} trustees have a higher duty than gamblers or speculators," the former Indiana attorney general declares.  Not quite. Indiana is considering what for the conservative state is a radical investment move. Legislators want to allow the state's pension funds to buy stocks.  That makes Indiana the last state with a constitutional ban on stocks. Now, some forward-thinking Hoosiers want to repeal it and allow the state's public employee pension funds, currently invested almost entirely in bonds, to buy stocks. To Mr. Sendak and others, however, stock still rhymes with hock and that spells trouble right there in Indiana.
