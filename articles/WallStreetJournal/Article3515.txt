 Credit Derivatives Survive a Series of Stress Tests As Demand for the Hedging Instruments Grows   By By Michael Mackenzie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  Last year was certainly the year for fallen credit angels, headlined by the default of Argentina and the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. -- the latter was an actively traded name in the credit derivatives market over the past three years. But Wall Street figures that successful negotiation of these credit craters has set the stage for further growth of credit derivatives, such as default swaps, total-return swaps and synthetic collateralized debt obligations.  "Credit derivatives earned their stripes in the aftermath of Enron filing for bankruptcy," said John McEvoy, cofounder of Creditex, a trading platform for credit derivatives. "The market did what it was supposed to do and that has apprised many investors of the value credit derivatives hold for hedging credit risk."  Hedge funds have been particularly active users of these instruments. Jeff Devers, president of Palladin Group LP in Maplewood N.J., a hedge fund that seeks to minimize risk and enhance returns from convertible bonds, uses credit derivatives to "isolate credit risk." This way his fund solely takes on the equity exposure of a convertible bond. Mr. Devers expects further growth of credit derivatives to add even more liquidity to the convertible bond market.
