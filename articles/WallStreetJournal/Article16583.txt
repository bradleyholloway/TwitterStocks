 Entertainment & Culture -- Essay: The Real Meaning Of 'Redneck Woman'; Country music -- more than abortion, church or guns -- shows what splits red and blue states   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  Ed Benson, executive director of the association, says the invitation to move the awards ceremony to New York this year came from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office but was readily accepted by the CMA. "New York is the major media center in the world," he says. "We will be able to attract media attention we wouldn't get in Nashville," where the show has been held for the last 38 years. The end result, he hopes, will be to "create an awareness that there is a lot of country- music enthusiasm in the New York area."  The real reason for country music's rising popularity is its storytelling. This is music in which the lyrics matter. It's not the escapist stuff; it's real life. As Trace Adkins sings in his deep baritone: "They're songs about me. And who I am. Songs about lovin' and livin' and good-hearted women, and family and God."  PATRIOTISM IS ALSO a big part of the country appeal. Many country- music stations continue to play the Star Spangled Banner at noon everyday -- a commonplace in the country four decades ago. And songs praising soldiers are frequent, from Toby Keith's "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" ("We'll put a boot up your ass, it's the American way") to John Michael Montgomery's tear-inducing "Letters From Home."
