 Reed Elsevier to Revamp Management Amid Painful Shift to Electronic Media   By By Robert Frank, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1998  Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier PLC, in the midst of a painful conversion to electronic media, announced plans to overhaul its management structure and begin a search for a new chief executive officer.  The company, which also announced lower earnings yesterday, said it will streamline its top management and appoint a single board and sole chief executive. Reed Elsevier is currently run by two co-chairmen and three boards -- a legacy of the merger in 1993 between Britain's Reed International PLC and Dutch publisher Elsevier NV.  Nigel Stapleton and Herman Bruggink, the current chairmen, will step down. Morris Tabaksblat, currently chairman and chief executive officer of Unilever NV, will become the nonexecutive chairman starting in April 1999. Mr. Stapleton and Mr. Bruggink will stay on as co-chief executives until a single chief executive is found.
