 Citigroup Is Acquiring Associates First In Stock Deal Valued at $29.83 Billion   By By Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2000  Associates shareholders will receive 0.7334 of a Citigroup share for each share they hold. Based on yesterday's prices, the deal valued Associates stock at $40.93 a share. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Associates jumped $10.63, or 38%, to $38.63. Citigroup eased $2.13, or 3.7%, to $55.81.  Citigroup, for example, is the nation's largest issuer of credit cards. But it is relatively weak in so-called private-label credit cards. Associates is a leader in issuing such cards for retailers offering financing to their customers, particularly oil companies. Associates' large U.S. operations, including consumer loans, credit cards and commercial-equipment leasing, will be woven into Citigroup's corresponding businesses.  Mr. [David Berry] also figures that despite the steep premium that Citigroup has agreed to pay, it is still getting a good deal. Based on his own profit forecasts, Mr. Berry figures Citigroup is paying a price equal to 15.5 times earnings per share for the year 2001. That compares with his forecast for 19.3 times 2001 earnings for Citigroup.
