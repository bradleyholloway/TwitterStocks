 Daisy Fails to Pay Interest Charges Of About $620,000   By By Stephen Kreider Yoder, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1989  Daisy, based in Mountain View, Calif., said it didn't pay approximately $620,000 in interest due on 6 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 by its wholly owned subsidiary, Daisy/Cadnetix Inc. Daisy makes computer-aided engineering systems.  Daisy has a 30-day grace period during which to make the payment, the company said, and plans to wait until the end of the period to see whether funds are available to make the payments. "We will use that period to reach a final decision on whether we will pay it," said Rodney Sloss, Daisy's chief financial officer.  Daisy has been saddled by debt related to its approximately $200 million acquisition this year of Cadnetix Corp. of Boulder, Colo. The postponed interest payment, said analyst Sanjiv Hingorani of Salomon Bros., is due to "a combination of the problems the company has had ever since it acquired Cadnetix and tried to assimilate it. It was inevitable."
