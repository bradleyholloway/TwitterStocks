 Home-Grown Mutual-Fund Firm Tries to Shake Dismal Numbers   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  U.S. Global, the only publicly traded mutual-fund company based in Texas, isn't living up to the promise of its ticker symbol, which is "GROW." Its stock funds consistently have posted some of the industry's worst returns. Its fund expenses as a percentage of assets are ballooning, and revenue is plunging: During the six months ended Dec. 31, revenue dropped 25% to $4.4 million from year-earlier levels. And after operating profitably for two years, U.S. Global is suffering losses again. Last year, its stock mutual-fund assets under management dropped 26% to $349 million. (The company has another $1 billion in money-market accounts, which account for a small part of revenue.)  The formula, they say: a new focus on fundamentals. The company is devoting 60% of its $120,000 marketing budget to pushing its two most successful funds, including the one managed by Mr. [Art] Bonnel -- a campaign designed to bring a new infusion of management fees. And since October, when Chief Executive Frank E. Holmes took on additional duties as chief investment officer, the company has required fund managers to meet strict performance standards for each stock in their portfolios.  His diversification efforts initially proved difficult. Efforts to market new funds to U.S. Global's existing base of customers -- die-hard gold bugs -- fell flat. And Mr. Holmes says it was tough to persuade five-star money managers to move to San Antonio. (Before coming aboard, Mr. Bonnel insisted on working out of his hometown, Reno, Nev.) Still, by 1994, Mr. Holmes had launched two new funds, including a second traditional equity fund -- the Bonnel fund, investing primarily in medium-cap U.S. stocks -- to supplement the existing All American Equity fund.
