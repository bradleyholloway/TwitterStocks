 Britain Is Seen Not Ready to Become Member of European Monetary System   By By Nicholas Hastings, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1990  With the British government showing little sign of caving in to pressure to make sterling a full member of the European Monetary System now, some analysts suggest Britain may not be ready to accept membership until after the next general election.
