 Leading the News: BellSouth, Sprint in Executive Spat --- Vice Chairman Is Blocked From Joining Rival as CEO; Noncompete Clause at Issue   By By Shawn Young and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2003  Mr. [Gary Forsee], who heads BellSouth's domestic operations, has a provision in his contract known as a noncompete clause that bars him from moving to a rival telecommunications company within 18 months of leaving BellSouth. Sprint and BellSouth compete for wireless and long-distance customers, and BellSouth is concerned that Mr. Forsee will take closely held trade secrets to one of its largest rivals.  BellSouth and Sprint are in talks about Mr. Forsee's proposed move to Sprint, said a BellSouth spokesman, who declined to comment further. A Sprint spokesman also declined to comment on the discussions, and Mr. Forsee couldn't be reached for comment.  Though Sprint was originally a long-distance company and BellSouth a local phone company, they are increasingly competitors. Mr. Forsee is chairman of Cingular Wireless, a joint venture between BellSouth and SBC Communications Inc., which competes against Sprint PCS. Recently, BellSouth gained regulatory permission to sell long-distance service throughout its home territory in the Southeast, putting it into direct competition with Sprint.
