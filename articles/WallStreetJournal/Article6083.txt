 Object of the Week: Very Fussy   By By Brooks Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2002  Mr. [Adam Fuss] made this photo by experimenting with one of photography's oldest techniques: placing an object on a piece of photosensitive paper and exposing it to light. (It's called a photogram.) These photograms, many of which are vividly colored, are the works most coveted by collectors at auction. But more recently, Mr. Fuss has begun producing daguerreotypes -- which are created through a process invented in 1839 where images are made from silver-coated copper plates -- of contemporary baby clothes and toys.
