 Alcoa, Alcan Aluminum Decline Amid Weight of Earnings Worries   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1999  Shares of Alcoa dropped 1 11/16 to 37 7/8, after rival Alcan Aluminium warned that its first-quarter earnings would come in weaker than expected because of low product prices and the devaluation of Brazil's currency. The talk affirmed an industrywide outlook that got under way in earnest last week when Reynolds Metals issued a similar earnings forecast. Reynolds shares, which fell to a 52-week low last week, inched up 1/8 to end at 43 1/16. Alcan shares dropped 1 1/8 to 23 11/16.  Meanwhile, rumors of a coming earnings shortfall stung Intel during the session. Talk on trading desks and among investors revived speculation that cropped up last week that the chip maker was going to issue a disappointing forecast for first-quarter earnings. Intel (Nasdaq) shares dropped 4 5/16 to 115 5/16.  A host of chip makers lost ground in the session. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 1 7/16 to 17 1/2, after the chip maker late Monday warned that production glitches would keep the company from posting a profit for the first quarter.
