 Barron's Insight: Blockbuster May Revive   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2004  Among its initiatives are a Netflix-style rental service, an expansion of videogame offerings and a DVD-trading program that allows customers to turn in used DVDs at Blockbuster sites for store credit. This program could turn the boom in DVD sales to the company's advantage as Americans now own an estimated two billion DVDs, and many people get tired of a movie after the first or second viewing. "We're taking Blockbuster from a place where you rent movies to a place where you can rent, buy or trade a movie or game, new or used, pay-by-the- day, pay-by-the-month, in-store or online," Mr. Antioco says.
