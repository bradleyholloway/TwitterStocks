 Forming Offshore Insurer Would Become More Costly Under Tax-Law Overhaul   By By Karen Slater, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1986  Establishing offshore insurance companies, which businesses and professionals have used to obtain coverage during the insurance crisis, would become much more expensive under the proposed tax-law overhaul.  A last-minute addition to the proposed tax package would require most U.S. companies that own a piece of an offshore insurer to pay tax each year on part of the insurer's profit -- even if those profits aren't distributed to the owners. That's in addition to the insurance premiums the companies pay.  Already, New York-based insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan Inc. says it has "suspended" development of Associated Professions Excess Insurance Co., a planned Bermuda insurer that was to provide professional liability policies to accountants, attorneys and others as of Oct. 1. The brokerage called off a meeting set for Sept. 24-25, at which participants were to sign commitments to fund the insurer.
