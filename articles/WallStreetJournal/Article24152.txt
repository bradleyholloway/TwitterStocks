 Arts & Entertainment -- Culture City: Add Swing, Then Wing It   By Catton, Pia, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2012  "In his own inimitable, bohemian manner, Art Blakey created a tapestry of rhythms, an Afro-Cuba jazz tapestry," said Todd Barkan, a concert and record producer and the host of a new series at the Iridium jazz club. (The relatively new program gives mid-career artists a salary and time to create commissioned work.) And his recent work, "Pavement," created for his own company, Abraham.In.Motion, has earned rave reviews for its unflinching picture of gang violence and the effect of crack cocaine in neighborhoods like the ones in his native Pittsburgh.
