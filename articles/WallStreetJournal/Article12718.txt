 Airbus Will Install More Safeguards On Its Aircraft   By By Daniel Michaels and Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2001  Europe's Airbus already is renowned for its reliance on computer-driven safeguards to spot mechanical problems or aircraft-handling mistakes by pilots before they can cause a crash. Now the big aircraft manufacturer is pushing further in that direction with plans to install additional fuel-system warnings on its long-range A340-600 models, due to begin service next year. The new safety feature, which Airbus stresses was in the works long before the Air Transat incident occurred Aug. 24, is designed specifically to raise an early red flag about any possible fuel leak.  Current safety features on Airbus aircraft are intended, among other things, to alert crews about an imbalance among fuel tanks, indicate fuel flow from each tank and provide a graphic representation of how much fuel is anticipated to be left in reserve at touchdown. But in the largest A340 models, Airbus intends to install additional cockpit safeguards.
