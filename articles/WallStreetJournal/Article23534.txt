 Turner Sports Takes Swing At New Baseball Coverage; President of Unit Hopes Regular-Season Excitement Continues in the Playoffs   By Kang, Stephanie, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2007  Turner is paying more than $100 million each year for the baseball rights, according to people familiar with the matter. It's part of a broader move by Turner to increase the proportion of original programming on both TBS and its sister channel TNT, after years of a diet heavy on movies like "Pretty Woman" and "Air Force One."  Mr. [David Levy]: We don't want to take away from the programming itself. . . . But there will be pop-ups and other things to promote our programming. One of the things that attracted us is this is going to be high-rated programming, and it's a great way to promote other [Turner] programming.  WSJ: TNT and TBS have invested in more original programming lately. You've got hit shows like "The Closer," critics' favorites like "Saving Grace" but also disappointments like "Heartland," which was canceled. How have advertisers responded to original programming and what's the payoff considering how expensive original programming is?
