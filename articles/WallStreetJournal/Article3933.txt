 Doe's Best, And Chassan's New Claim to Fame   By Fusilli, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2005  Recorded on vintage equipment in an old barn behind Mr. [Jordan Chassan]'s home in Nashville, the new disc moseys along with a gentle rollicking rhythm, its countryish music delivered by folk guitars, purring harmonica, upright bass and oddball touches like a whistling organ on "Wound Up Way Too Tight," which features Gillian Welch on harmony vocal. The sweet singing Mr. Chassan is a disarmingly clever and self- effacing lyricist: You've got to love an album that opens with the line "I ain't smart like I used to be" and ends with "It's hard work bein' a fool." You'll come away feeling the world might be a better place if everyone listened to "East of Bristol, West of Knoxville" at least once a day.
