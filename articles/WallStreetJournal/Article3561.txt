 Bush Faces Widening Gap With Europe --- Traditional Allies Seek Reassurance That They Aren't Being Sidelined   By By Jeanne Cummings in Washington and William Boston in Berlin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2002  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice yesterday said Mr. [Bush] would use the trip to "reaffirm the trans-Atlantic alliance" and "consult with some of our oldest friends and most important allies." But evidence of fundamental shifts in U.S. foreign relations can be found in Mr. Bush's itinerary.  An important part of the future alliance Mr. Bush will outline in his address to German lawmakers is improving the ability of the U.S. and NATO to respond quickly to a crisis. Ms. Rice said the Pentagon had trouble "marrying up horses with 21st-century air power" as it launched military operations in Afghanistan. It took even longer to figure out what roles the U.S. allies should play. With defense budgets in Europe shrinking, Mr. Bush is expected to urge leaders to rethink how they spend their resources in light of the new threats.  As the U.S. focuses less on Europe, the emotional ties of the past are weakening and the allies are continuing to struggle to redefine their relationship. "Berlin is no longer the front line of the Cold War," said Peter Rudolf, U.S. expert at Berlin's Science and Politics Foundation, a foreign-policy think tank. "And there is a feeling in Europe today that Europeans have no influence on American policies."
