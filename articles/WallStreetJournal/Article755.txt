 Letters to the Editor: The Wherefore of the Modern Y   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1986  Ellen Hume's March 31 second-front article describes the fight that some for-profit health clubs are trying to pick with YMCAs. A lobbyist for a health-club group perpetuates the peeling-paint perception of charity: "This isn't the Y you think of, with paint peeling. . . ." This implies that Ys should have shabby buildings that don't attract people who pay fees and therefore can't compete with for-profit health clubs and therefore are "good charities."
