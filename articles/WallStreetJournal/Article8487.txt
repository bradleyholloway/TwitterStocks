 Letters to the Editor -- We Reported a Story: Now Is That Hysteria?   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1994  At first, I chose to ignore Max Boot's April 13 editorial-page article "The Radiation Scare's Real Fallout," on the belief that any writer, no matter how misguided or inaccurate, is entitled to an opinion. But the May 11 pair of letters attacking the alleged reportage of the Albuquerque Tribune based on Mr. Boot's piece changed my mind.  Allow me to set the record straight before anyone else believes that Mr. Boot accurately summarized the work of Albuquerque Tribune reporter Eileen Welsome. Mr. Boot's piece apparently led the May 11 letter writers to conclude that the Tribune published a series of hysterical articles that refashioned a bunch of already reported facts into a sensational "new" story that would lead to countless suits against the U.S. government and tap the taxpayers' pockets.
