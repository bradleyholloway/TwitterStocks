 Viewpoint: Pentagon Buying Practices May Have Downed Flight 655   By By Alexander Cockburn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1988  Nine hours after either one or two missiles from the Vincennes disposed of the Iranian A-300 Airbus, Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, proposed the official line, which was that the Iranians -- those flying the Airbus carrying 290 people and those who let it ply between Bandar Abbas and Dubai under such conditions -- brought it on themselves. The Airbus was off course. It was descending toward the Vincennes on a presumptively hostile flight path. Its transponder, designed to identify its civilian status and course, was not switched on. The crew failed to respond to seven distinct warnings on both civilian and military radio channels. There were electronic indications suggesting that an attack by an F-14 was starting.  The Airbus was "off course." Yes, but by about four or five miles, which is not in the least unusual, and on the far side of the corridor of the Vincennes. By comparison, KAL 007 was 365 miles awry, and this was not at the time taken by the Reagan administration as being an exonerating factor. Adm. Crowe also made much of the fact that the plane was at an altitude of 9,000 feet, unusually low for a commercial flight. And he claimed the plane had a "threatening flight profile," notably in the alleged fact that it was descending.  He was correct in saying the plane was at 9,000 feet, but this was not peculiar, given that the Airbus had taken off only seven minutes earlier, and thus the normal flight profile would have been to keep climbing steadily to 25,000 feet before leveling off. Assertions of a menacing descent notwithstanding, there is nothing to suggest the Airbus was doing other than what it intended, which was to fly straight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai.
