 Nonfarm Sector Added 169,000 Workers in July --- Gain May Indicate U.S. Still Is Safe From Recession; Jobless Rate Falls 0.1%   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  The considerable growth in new jobs throughout the economy suggests the U.S. is still safe from recession, many economists say.  American businesses outside the farm sector added 169,000 new workers to their payrolls last month, with gains in construction, manufacturing and service industries, the Labor Department reported. The department also made a huge revision to its calculation of job growth for June. Employers added 250,000 new employees during the month, it said, many more than the 180,000 originally estimated.  Nevertheless, the latest employment numbers are another conclusive piece of evidence that the economy is slowing. The growth in employment, while impressive in a time of slowing production and demand, is still considerably below the monthly average employment gain of last year.
