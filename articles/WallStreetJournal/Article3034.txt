 IBM Says Net Rose, Warns On Asia Effect   By By Raju Narisetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1998  Lawrence Ricciardi, IBM's interim chief financial officer, said first-quarter earnings could be 10 cents to 15 cents below the $1.19 a share reported for 1997's first quarter. In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Ricciardi said IBM is faced this quarter with costs associated with the recent purchase of a software maker, marketing expenses from its participation in the winter Olympics, and pricing pressure on hard drives and personal computers.  IBM said it earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared with $2.02 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share were $2.11, compared with $1.93 a year earlier, when the company had 62 million more shares outstanding. IBM's basic per-share earnings, or profit divided by shares outstanding, were $2.16 compared with $1.97 the year before. IBM's performance fell below the expectations of analysts such as Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch & Co., who had expected the company to report $2.16 on a diluted basis, and John Jones of Salomon Smith Barney, who had expected $2.19 per diluted share. Mr. Milunovich said he plans to shave his $7.15-a-share estimate for 1998 by about 30 cents to 35 cents based on IBM's first-quarter profit warning, but added, "Frankly, for a company this big, it is not worth having a heart attack over."
