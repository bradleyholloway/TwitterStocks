 NASD Probes Bank One Over Processing --- Move May Hamper Credibility Push   By By Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2000  Still, it once again raises troubling questions about how well the 1998 merger was accomplished. It comes as Bank One tries to leave behind its miserable recent experience and rebuild its uneasy relationship with investors and stock analysts. It recently named Jamie Dimon, former president of Citigroup, as its new chairman and chief executive. Its 1999 annual report stated, "We are taking the right steps to begin to reclaim investor confidence."  Mr. [Robert] Rosholt was the top financial executive during the bank's warnings in August and November that 1999 profit would fall short of expectations. The bank blamed the shortfall on shrinking growth and profit margins at its once-highflying credit-card unit, First USA. Investors were shocked by the warnings: Bank One's shares are down more than 40% since the summer. In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares stood at $31.4375, up 68.75 cents.  Mr. Rosholt is the latest of several senior executives to leave the bank in recent months. Richard Vague, chief executive of Bank One's First USA credit-card unit, left in October, and John B. McCoy, Bank One's CEO, opted for early retirement in December. The bank said it has begun a search for a new finance chief that will consider both internal and external candidates.
