 The Arguments That May Define The Bush Years --- By Gerald F. Seib   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2001  Now, Mr. [George W. Bush]'s choice of former Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft to be attorney general, where he would greatly influence judicial picks, is a strong signal that he doesn't intend to disappoint conservatives on this front. But liberals will have their chance to fight back when Bush appointees seek confirmation in a Senate divided evenly between the two parties.  The main countermeasures Mr. Bush suggested during the campaign -- drilling for oil and gas in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and speeding up permits for building pipelines -- will both bring fights with the environmental lobby. If anybody thought Mr. Bush would shrink from those fights, he seemed to erase the doubts by picking Gale Norton, an outspoken proponent of allowing exploration in the Arctic refuge, to be his interior secretary.  MISSILE DEFENSE: The question of whether to build a system to defend the U.S. against missile attacks is huge: Tens of billions of dollars, as well as relations with Russia and China, hang in the balance. In theory, everybody on the Bush team, and a majority in Congress, agree the U.S. should go ahead with a defense system. Indeed, a resolution calling for deploying a system "as soon as is technologically feasible" passed the House 317 to 105 in 1999.
