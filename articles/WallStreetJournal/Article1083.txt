 Life-Expectancy Gaps Show Need To Focus on Prevention, Treatment   By McKay, Betsy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  The findings suggest health officials need to focus greater attention on preventing and treating heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and other chronic diseases, along with injuries in young and middle-aged adults, said Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the Harvard Initiative for Global Health and the study's lead author. Much of U.S. health policy emphasizes care for children and the elderly, and finding ways to provide health insurance for those who lack it, he said. But providing health insurance wouldn't always be enough to ensure that people with chronic diseases seek treatment, he said. "This really requires a rethink about what is the focus of health policy discussions in the U.S."
