 Spain's New Bank Giant, Bilbao Vizcaya, Aims to Be a European Financial Group   By By Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1988  BILBAO, Spain -- Now that its creation has been approved by shareholders, Spain's new banking giant, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, faces the challenge of becoming truly European.  "We want to be a European bank, not just a Spanish bank with operations in Europe," Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, BBV's future chairman, told shareholders last week. "We want to create a European financial group."  The product of a merger between two formerly regional banks, Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya, the new group has set itself the target of becoming one of two big Spanish international banking groups, ahead of the opening of European Community financial markets in 1992. (The other will be Banco Espanol Central de Credito, to be formed out of the planned merger of Banco Central and Banco Espanol de Credito.)
