 At Home Here   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1999  A century and a half ago, likely surveying Manhattan from Brooklyn Heights, Walt Whitman wrote of America that it was "a race of races," one people made of many. Today this is true to a greater degree than it was in pre-Civil War America. As this most American of weekends draws to a close, we pause to applaud this era's immigrants, people who have struggled successfully to make America their own.  Consider the very first step toward becoming an American: language. The common horror story tells of immigrants who, after decades in New York or Los Angeles, still live their lives entirely in their mother tongue. But this, Mr. (Gregory) Rodriguez found, is a rarity; within 10 years of coming to the United States, more than three-quarters of immigrants spoke English well or very well. To be sure, the rate of language acquisition varies: 92% of Vietnamese who arrived here between 1970 and 1974 spoke English well or very well by 1990. For Hispanics, the rate is slower.
