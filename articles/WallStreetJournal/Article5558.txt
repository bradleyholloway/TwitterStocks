 Film 1997: Actors Worth Their Stars   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1998  As famine suddenly strikes after the holiday feast that Hollywood hyped upon us, I think back on my most consistent source of fulfillment, or at least fascination, in the past movie year -- actors giving memorable performances. A few were memorably awful, and I'll get around to them before too long. In the best-case scenarios, though, actors found truth, humor, surprise and beauty in scenarios that actually possessed such precious qualities. In other cases, actors acted as if they'd found them, thereby lending distinction to scripts that would otherwise have seemed mighty drab.  The most conspicuous example of the latter was Leonardo DiCaprio in "Titanic." Though bad material can sink any performer, here's an instance where a buoyant actor kept his material afloat. It's hard to imagine how the movie could have held its audience with a standard-brand heartthrob in the role of Jack, the nervy adventurer who starts that fateful voyage in steerage, but Mr. DiCaprio gave his low-born character a lyrical soul that transcended James Cameron's lumpish writing.  Actors can be masters of surprise. Who would have guessed, from Matt Damon's likable but unexceptional work in "The Rainmaker," that this 27-year-old newcomer to stardom would give the strongest, most seamless performance of the year as a two-fisted math genius in "Good Will Hunting"? (The most spectacular performance was that of Robert Duvall in "The Apostle," a movie I'll discuss next week when it goes into national release.) Who could have imagined that Djimon Hounsou, a West African fashion model with limited acting experience, would create such a grander-than-life presence as Cinque, the leader of the slave revolt in Steven Spielberg's "Amistad"?
