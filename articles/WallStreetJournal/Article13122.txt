 SriLankan Air Shows Its Stuff; Tsunami Is Latest Challenge to Spunky Carrier's Recovery Efforts   By Michaels, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2005  On Dec. 26 the tsunami hit Sri Lanka's south and east coasts, killing an estimated 30,000. It ravaged the island's lucrative beach tourism business and upended SriLankan's growth plans. "We were just recovering, and now here comes another hit below the belt," said SriLankan spokesman Chandana De Silva.  Another boost for the airline is its rich investor, Emirates Group of Dubai, which has taken the lead in rebranding and relaunching SriLankan. The parent of fast-growing Emirates Airlines, which itself is building a global hub operation in its Persian Gulf sheikdom, took a 43.6% stake in SriLankan as part of the 1998 restructuring. Today it effectively runs SriLankan through SriLankan's chief executive, Peter Hill, who is an Emirates executive as well.  Emirates' unusual success in turning around SriLankan gives observers optimism about the carrier's future. Mr. [Craig Jenks], the aviation consultant, says that cross-border investments by one airline in another are "a history of spectacular failures" and SriLankan's revival under Emirates "is not the norm."
