 Divorced Couple Spar as `Innocent Spouse' Bill Nears   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1998  When Senate Finance Chairman William Roth unveiled a new taxpayer-rights bill, which the Senate will consider this week, Ms. Cockrell was by his side. She has been interviewed on television by Connie Chung. The New York Post quoted her lawyer portraying her as the victim of the "misdeeds of her miscreant husband."  The IRS later said the shelters were a scam and won convictions of the promoters. Investors' write-offs were disallowed. Mr. Crowley and Ms. Cockrell were left with a tax debt, including interest and penalties, that now totals more than $650,000. One or both of them have to pay. The question: Which one?  Ms. Cockrell, who runs a support group for divorced women suffering from tax debts incurred during marriage, fears Mr. Crowley's emergence will hurt the broader cause. "I don't care about me, but there are tens of thousands of women hurting who need the law changed," she says. "He has a vested interest in not having this legislation passed" since it would likely boost his tax burden. But Ms. Cockrell also has a big financial stake in the debate.
