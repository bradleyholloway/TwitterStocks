 Fed Keeps Focus On Inflation And Raises Rate; Increase to 3.75% Shows Less Concern Over Impact Of Katrina on Growth   By Ip, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2005  Yesterday's increase wasn't wholly expected: A minority of economists thought the Fed would pause to assess [Katrina]'s impact. And some Fed officials wanted to do so. Fed Governor Mark Olson cast the lone dissent yesterday, breaking a two-year stretch of unanimous votes.  In a statement, the Fed acknowledged Katrina's "tragic toll," but predicted it wouldn't derail the economy's expansion, and may aggravate inflation. "The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production, and employment will be set back in the near term," the Fed said.  Other officials may also have had misgivings, but these won't be known until the minutes of this meeting are issued. The Fed's policy- making committee comprises 19 officials, of which 12 may cast a vote on rate moves: the seven members of the Fed board of governors in Washington and presidents of five of the 12 regional Fed banks. With two vacancies on the Fed board, yesterday's vote was 9-1.
