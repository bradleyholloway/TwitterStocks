 TV Makes a Big Move To the Small Screen; New Pact Will Allow Viewers To See Live Shows on Phones; Setting Your DVR Remotely   By Grant, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2005  While other wireless companies, such as Verizon Wireless, already offer cellphone-TV and -Internet services, the latest offerings promise to be richer. Subscribers won't have to pick from a menu of prerecorded shows but can watch live TV shows as they are aired, as well as programs they've recorded on their digital video recorders at home. And if they miss their favorite show, they'll be able to program their digital video recorder by clicking a few buttons on their cellphone.  Other cellphone companies currently offer some live TV. Sprint itself has deals with a variety of networks including Fox Sports, ABC News Now, The Learning Channel and Discovery. But the program lineup offered by the cable venture is expected to be much richer, with the cable companies aiming to offer live programming from dozens of channels. The cable operators still have to make deals with programmers to route their shows to cellphones. But they are well positioned to do this since they're continually negotiating with these same programmers on standard cable deals. Also, both Comcast and Time Warner own numerous cable networks and will likely make some of this content available to the cellphone service.  "We call them snippets," said Brian Roberts, Comcast's chief executive. He suggested a snippet might be just David Letterman's "Top 10" list from the previous night or the last inning of a baseball game. "What we're doing today is enabling that next generation of content," he said.
