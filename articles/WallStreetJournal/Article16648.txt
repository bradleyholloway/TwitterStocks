 Mesa Fuels Hawaii Air-Fare War Via New Service Among Islands   By Carey, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2006  "I had to go to Maui on business on short notice," says Paula Simpson Takamori, owner of travel agency Travel to Paradise near Honolulu. "It was $200 round trip. That's a little extreme for a 20- minute flight."  The new, cheaper tickets are a boon both for tourists and Hawaii residents. The price war "has been all over the news here," says Kristen Bonilla, a public-information officer for the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. "It definitely prompted me to buy more tickets." She and her husband purchased six round trips on Hawaiian, on which they are frequent fliers, to visit her family in Kauai this summer. Although they were able to get the lowest fare once, Ms. Bonilla says the other five tickets still were lower than the normal $150 to $200, because of the new competition.  Such low fares don't bode well for the financial health of the state's three largest carriers, including turboprop operator Island Air. "We already have overcapacity," says Mark Dunkerley, CEO of Hawaiian. Mesa's "entry could precipitate one carrier leaving the market."
