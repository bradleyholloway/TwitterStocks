 Shift in Making Chips Bears Fruit; Semiconductor Companies Start Large Production With New Insulating Film   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2004  The insulating materials, known as "low-k" dielectrics, were developed in response to a technical bottleneck that loomed in the 1990s. Chip makers began shifting to faster copper circuitry to link transistors, which are constructed first as chips are built on silicon wafers. As the connections are placed closer together, signals from the wires can interfere with each other, hurting chips' speed and power consumption.  New chips from Xilinx's biggest competitor, Altera, will be manufactured by TSMC using Black Diamond. Francois Gregoire, Altera's vice president of technology, estimated the technology will improve the chips' performance by 5% to 10%, while reducing power consumption by a similar amount.  Nvidia Corp., an ATI rival whose chips are also manufactured by TSMC, hasn't chosen to adopt Black Diamond. David Roman, its vice president of corporate marketing, said it is pondering tradeoffs such as defect rates on chips in early production with the technology. "We aren't ruling out low-k," he said. "It's a matter of timing and application."
