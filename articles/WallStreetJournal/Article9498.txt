 Boeing and Lockheed Climb On Election News, Rate Cut   By By Shaheen Pasha, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2002  These stocks were given an additional boost from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's cautious statements about "geopolitical risks," which came as the United Nations is set to vote on a new resolution that wouldn't hinder the U.S. from taking action against Iraq. Dow industrials' component Boeing, building on the previous day's 6% gain, rose $2.06, or 6.5%, to $33.58 and Lockheed-Martin rose 1.30, or 2.4%, to 54.95.  Of course, the unexpected half-percentage-point reduction in interest rates by the Fed was the No. 1 mover for the overall market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 92.74 points, or 1.07%, to 8771.01, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 17.82, or 1.27%, to 1418.99, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 8.37, or 0.91%, to 923.76.  ABB climbed 36 cents, or 21%, to 2.10 on news that the European Commission will let General Electric buy a unit of the Zurich-based engineering company. The proceeds from the sale to GE are expected to help ABB, which is struggling with U.S. asbestos exposure, reduce its debt.
