 Handspring, Started by Palm Founders, Files for $300 Million Initial Offering   By By Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2000  Handspring's filing came less than a month after Palm's IPO, which investors initially greeted with exuberance. Priced at $38, Palm shares traded as high as $165 in their debut. They have lost much of their luster in recent weeks, trading at $44.875, down $1.625, Friday in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Even at that level, however, Palm, which is expected to record about $1 billion in sales in its current fiscal year, has a market value of roughly $25 billion.  Handspring, Mountain View, Calif., makes organizers that look much like Palm's and use Palm's operating system. Handspring's Visor organizer is cheaper than similar Palm devices and includes a slot for plugging in a modem, game player, cellular phone or other device.
