 Cessna Sees Air Force Saving $2 Billion By Scuttling Fairchild's Trainer Plane   By By Tim Carrington, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1985  Cessna Aircraft Co. told the Air Force it could save $2 billion by scuttling Fairchild Industries Inc.'s T-46A trainer aircraft and instead retooling Cessna T-37 trainers.  The estimated savings were part of a Cessna report presented shortly before the Air Force proposed eliminating the Fairchild program to save money in the fiscal 1987 budget. The cancellation is one of several cost-cutting proposals that have emerged from the Pentagon's budget-planning sessions during August. The Air Force also has proposed killing the costly HH-60 Night Hawk helicopter, made by United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft division.  Meanwhile, Russell Rourke, assistant defense secretary for legislative affairs, is the front-runner to succeed Verne Orr as secretary of the Air Force, according to Senate staff aides and Pentagon officials. Secretary Orr is expected to retire in November.
