 Capital Cities Predicts It Won't Match Rise In Net of Year Ago   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1985  Thomas S. Murphy, chairman, and Daniel B. Burke, president, said in the media company's annual report that "favorable comparisons" with 1984 gains would be "difficult" because of slowing inflation and dilution from $146.8 million of acquisitions last year. The first six months of this year would be the hardest to match with 1984, the Capital Cities officers said.
