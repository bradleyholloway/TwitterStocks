 Mr. Gates Goes to Washington -- Cyber Spectacle: Senate Meets Electronic Elite   By By John Harwood and David Bank, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1998  Mr. Gates, king of the nation's high technology boom, claimed the hot seat at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into computer-industry competition. But the spotlight he brought with him warmed every other chair inside the dark-paneled hearing room, as a tradition-bound Congress met the reigning cadre of cyber-celebrities.  "I have witnessed many changes in the American economy," barked 95-year-old GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina -- including, for example, the automobile, the airplane and the television set. But the computer revolution, concluded Mr. Thurmond, who won his Senate seat a few months before the 42-year-old Mr. Gates was born, "may ultimately prove to be the most significant."  A cavernous, ornate hearing room in an adjacent building holds more people, but for their backdrop the lawmakers chose the Hart Senate Office Building's central hearing facility, which is newer and more-media friendly with camera positions cut into the side walls. Since its debut in 1987, the room has hosted arms-control hearings, judicial impeachments, and investigations into campaign-finance abuses and Whitewater. But rarely has it held such a large crowd.
