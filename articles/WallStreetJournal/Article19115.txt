 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1998  Clinton plans a televised speech on Mideast peace to students in Israel next week and a talk to a Palestinian council in Gaza. Israelis lobby against Air Force One landing at the new airport at Gaza and fret over details of a possible Clinton stopover in the West Bank town of Bethlehem. "We won't cross any lines" in terms of sovereignty, says a White House spokesman.  The trip also aims to boost support at home for Clinton's plan to give the Palestinians an extra $400 million in aid. House International Relations Committee Chairman Gilman warns of "significant problems" with the request. To build support, Clinton plans also to propose an added $1.2 billion for Israel and $200 million for Jordan.  The White House invites lawmakers to join Clinton on the trip, with one requirement: They must go to both Israel and Gaza, not just Israel.
