 Whittle Sweetens Schoolroom TV Plan To Blunt Criticism of News, Ad Format   By By Joe Sharkey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 1989  At a news conference, Whittle's chairman, Christopher Whittle, said the revised system would offer three channels -- adding a channel for educational programming and one designed for professional educators to the news channel initially planned. Mr. Whittle said the company would spend $200 million to start up the system, which he said will begin broadcasting next March in 1,000 U.S. high schools, and will ultimately be installed in 8,000 schools, at the rate of 500-700 a month after start-up.  The Whittle plan, which was tested for seven weeks at six selected schools in March and April, has alarmed some educators and parents' groups who are opposed to one of its major aspects: the two minutes of commercial advertising that accompanies the daily 12-minute Whittle news program. In those schools that sign contracts, Whittle will provide the equipment, including video recorders and color television sets. Mr. Whittle said the contracts will commit a school to the program for three to five years. He added it hadn't yet been decided whether a school that dropped out of the program would be able to keep the TV sets and other gear.
