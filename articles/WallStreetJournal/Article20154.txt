 Remodeling Job: Market Swoons As Bear Stearns Bolsters Finances; Brokerage Raises Cash, Cuts Short-Term Debt; Spector Expected to Exit   By Kate Kelly and Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2007  The big securities firm also plans to oust Warren Spector, Bear's powerful chief of stock and bond trading and one of the firm's two presidents, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Spector, 49 years old, had been widely viewed as a leading candidate to become the firm's next chief executive. Bear's board is set to meet Monday to discuss Mr. Spector's departure, the person said.  In recent years, Mr. Spector, an established bridge player and golfer with homes in Manhattan's Greenwich Village section and on Martha's Vineyard, has overseen Bear's entire capital markets business -- a plumb but demanding job that includes monitoring stock and bond trading.  The recent downturn in its bond business, notably in mortgage-backed securities, is a rare weak spot for Bear, a firm known for its quick- witted trading and risk management as well as its expertise in the world of home loans. And while Bear's chief financial officer, Mr. [Samuel Molinaro], took note of gains in the equity and international businesses that will help to offset the revenue downturn in mortgage securities, the firm's business mix is weaker than that of peers such as Lehman, which has a robust investment-banking division as well as a huge mortgage unit.
