 Industrials Inch Up to New High; Dell Sinks, but J.P. Morgan Leaps   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1998  Shares of the computer giant had been a strong contributor to the tech sector's impressive ascent of the past two weeks. Dell had added 23% since it reported fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 18, and led a broad rally in tech names over that time. But the sector struggled without Dell's leadership yesterday.  Shares of International Business Machines fell 2 1/2 to 101 15/16, but a strong rally in J.P. Morgan and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing offset that weakness enough to spot the Dow Jones Industrial Average a lead in yesterday's trading. The industrials ended with a gain of 4.73, or 0.06%, to 8550.45.  Merger partners attracted investors' attention in yesterday's session. Shares of Coleman jumped 10 1/16 to 30 15/16, easily outstripping the 52-week high set Friday, after Sunbeam said it planned to buy the Wichita, Kan., maker of camping and leisure products, along with the makers of Mr. Coffee machines and First Alert smoke alarms, for $1.8 billion plus the assumption of $700 million in debt. Sunbeam added 3 7/8 to 45 5/8.
