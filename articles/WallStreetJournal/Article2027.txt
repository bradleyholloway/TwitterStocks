 Political Drama in Poland Brings Low-Key Reaction From Moscow --- But Official Response Masks Jitters About New Risks For Gorbachev's Policies   By By Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1989  Rather than sending tanks into the streets of Warsaw to defend socialism, as it would have done only a few years ago, Moscow has so far reacted calmly to the nomination of a Solidarity activist as Poland's new prime minister. Its non-interference seems to confirm what Soviet officials have been telling the skeptical West for months: that Soviet allies are sovereign states and free to choose their own social systems.  But officials here say privately that the end of the Communist Party's 45-year monopoly on power in Poland is also fraught with risks for Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev and his own political reform plans.  They believe it will increase the growing divisions in the East bloc, ending once and for all the cherished pretense of unity. And it is likely to be used as powerful ammunition by Communist Party stalwarts in the Soviet Union who are already declaring in public that the Gorbachev reforms have gone too far.
