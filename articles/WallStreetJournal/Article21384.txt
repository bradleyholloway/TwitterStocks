 Japan's `Invasion': A Matter of `Fairness'   By By Peter G. Peterson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1989  Is the U.S. suffering from a dangerous Japanese invasion? The American public seems to believe so. Opinion polls show Americans fear Japanese competition more than Soviet aggression and believe that growing Japanese investment here is a bad thing.  Whatever the merits of such deals, however, the fears of Americans are real -- however heightened by media pandering to American xenophobia and latent racism. The U.S. edition of Newsweek sounded a martial note in its cover story on Sony's purchase of Columbia: "Japan Invades Hollywood." In the Japanese edition, that same cover was toned down to "Japan Moves Into Hollywood." Apart from that stunning difference of nuance, it is worthwhile to ask why Newsweek saw Sony's move as so controversial that it warranted a cover story, while a similar Australian deal (Qintex's planned takeover of MGM/UA) was mainly treated by the media as a minor business-news item.  Some Japanese say: "It isn't right for Americans to criticize Japan for buying so much. British, Canadian and Dutch investors buy many companies in the U.S. too. Nobody worries about a British, Canadian or Dutch invasion!" Indeed, Japan is popularly vilified as the chief foreign "invader," even though its direct investments in the U.S. amount to half the British total and about the same as the Dutch. Japan ranks only fourth in the most sensitive investment area: manufacturing. Few reporters covering the "invasion" bother to set the issue in the relevant context: American firms, which began a long global investment binge in the 1950s, still earn three times as much from their foreign investments as foreigners do here.
