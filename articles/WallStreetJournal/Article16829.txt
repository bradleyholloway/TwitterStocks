 Court Weighs Medical-Device Liability   By Anderson, Mark H, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  In Mr. [Charles Riegel]'s case against Medtronic, his attorney, Allison Zieve, sought to convince the justices that federal law allowed Mr. Riegel to sue Medtronic over the catheter, which had received so-called premarket approval from the FDA.  Several justices, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, posed questions aimed at testing the limits of FDA authority over medical devices. Justice Kennedy asked whether a company can be sued if it sells a device while simultaneously seeking "serious" labeling changes for it at the FDA.  Mr. [Edwin Kneedler] and Theodore Olson, a lawyer representing Medtronic, said federal law allows product-liability lawsuits only when a company fails to report problems with a device and someone is injured or killed because of the flaw. In that instance, a medical-device company would face possible federal charges by the FDA that could be paralleled by a civil product-liability case.
