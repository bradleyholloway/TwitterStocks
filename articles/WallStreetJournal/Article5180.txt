 Endangered Species? Some May Thrive In Unexpected Places --- Bounty Hunter Phil Stevenson, For Hire by Dam Builders, Seeks One Little Mussel   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1994  Mr. Stevenson is an environmental bounty hunter, a seeker of new populations of endangered species outside their known habitats. If enough of the creatures are found, developers whose projects are stalled by officially endangered species can argue that the creatures aren't really imperiled.  "Have rake, will travel" describes Mr. Stevenson, a mussel specialist. The federal government designated his current quarry as endangered in 1990. Wilson, N.C., pop. 40,000, wants to build a dam to expand its inadequate water supply. Dwarf wedges live at the only available site. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service blocked the dam, asserting that it would jeopardize the species' existence.  Wilson's bounty isn't the first time a price has been put on the head of a creature that doesn't have one. Last year, the Idaho Farm Bureau offered $500 for information leading to the Bruneau Hot Springsnail outside its known habitat in Owyhee County, Idaho. Farmers there are fit to be tied by the snail, whose endangered status for a time curtailed irrigation. "WANTED! ALIVE" trumpets a poster issued by the farmers' group, complete with a photo and description of the gastropod accused of assaulting property rights. Height: the "size of a BB." Weight: "very small."
