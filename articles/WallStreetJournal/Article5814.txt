 Taste -- de gustibus: Back Home, The Talk's Swung to Golf   By By Jason L. Riley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  Tiger Woods's winning streak ended recently, but he remains at the apex of professional golf. Indeed, after Phil Mickleson finally bested Woods at the Buick Invitational last month, Mickleson told reporters: "To go against the best player in the world and come out on top means a lot to me."  It probably means a lot to Woods to have someone as talented as Mickleson make that comment. But who can doubt he deserves it? The 24-year-old's 17 career wins -- including two of the sport's four major championships -- have earned him more money than anyone in the history of the game, a feat that's taken him just over three years on tour to achieve.  In the media, Woods is approaching Jordanesque omnipresence. But a striking, though less reported, subset of Tigermania has been its effect on black America's attitudes toward golf. Not on the residents of bourgeois black enclaves like Ladera Heights in suburban Los Angeles or Silver Spring, Md., outside Washington. Blacks there were teeing up long before the world discovered Woods. I refer to working-class blacks of urban America, where Tigermania has gripped individuals who have traditionally shown no more interest in golf than they have in Neil Diamond or Bob Jones University.
