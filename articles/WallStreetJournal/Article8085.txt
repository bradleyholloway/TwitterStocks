 Surprising Stocks: Afraid to Miss a Rally, Pros Clamber to Buy, And Market Is Soaring --- Long-Ignored Smaller Issues Now Outpace the Dow; Some Little Guys Join In --- A Waiting Game That Lost   By By John R. Dorfman and Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1991  All around Wall Street, traders on the desks that deal in big blocks of stock are barking out orders in their clipped, staccato lingo -- exuberant because, for the first time in months, investors from around the world are calling and asking to buy stocks. "Call the dog and tell him 100,000 are trading at 1/4," one trader calls out. "Half-bid for 11-4 {11,400 shares}!" yells another.  Professional money managers, fearful of making the job-threatening mistake of missing a major rally in stocks, are plunging back into the market. And although the rally started with big institutions that manage pension money and the like, even the long-absent "little guy" seems to be starting to join in.  Strangely, it is the war against Iraq -- the bearish threat that weighed down the financial markets for months -- that set off the stunning rally in stocks. Many investment pros thought they had figured out a smart way to play the outbreak of fighting. "Everybody was waiting to buy when the market went down 200 points when the war broke out," says Kyle Krueger, a portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. Big investors had amassed huge reserves of cash and planned to jump back into stocks at bargain prices.
