 Board of Contributors: Inflation Is Here, Still   By By Herbert Stein, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1989  The producer and consumer price statistics for January caused a wave of discussion and disagreement about the prospects for inflation. A headline in this paper said, "January Price Jump -- Trend or Just a Blip -- Concerns Economists." The New York Times said, "The question on economists' minds is whether inflation has indeed jumped into a higher range or only poses a potential threat." The two most important economists involved are President Bush and Chairman Greenspan. The president is quoted as saying that they have "agreed to disagree" on this subject.  The idea of the president and the chairman of the Federal Reserve agreeing to disagree about the rate of inflation is tantalizing. The president has a budget plan that relies upon certain economic developments, including the rate of inflation. If the budget plan counts on a rate of inflation that the Federal Reserve does not expect or does not intend to achieve, someone is in for trouble.  One might argue that a 4% inflation rate is as good as zero. If everyone and everything were adjusted to the 4% inflation rate -- all contracts, including wage contracts and debts, incorporating the expectation of that rate -- the real world would go on just the same as if the rate were zero. And if everyone is adjusted to 4%, and expects that, trying to get the rate down to zero will cause unemployment to rise for a period, and for no purpose.
