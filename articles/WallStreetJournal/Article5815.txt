 Boeing Earnings Estimates Are Likely To Be Cut 20% or More Because of Strike   By By Jeff Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  Aerospace analysts said they are likely to clip Boeing Co. earnings estimates for this year's first quarter by 20% or more because of effects on jetliner deliveries and other aspects of the monthlong strike by engineers and technical workers.  The analysts, and some individual investors, said in interviews that they are increasingly wary of the impact of the lingering strike by about 16,000 workers on the Seattle-based aerospace giant's performance in commercial-jet and military lines for the full-year 2000, or beyond. Estimates for remaining year-2000 quarters are likely to drop if the strike isn't settled by March 31, the analysts said.  Joe Campbell, a Lehman Brothers analyst, said he expects to cut about 20 cents a share from the consensus, based on declining airliner deliveries related to the strike. He said reduced spending on research-and-development -- which is normally performed by the strikers -- could offset some of that cut. Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace union went on strike Feb. 9. Contract talks broke down over pay, benefits, and the less-tangible issue of their declining stature within Boeing.
