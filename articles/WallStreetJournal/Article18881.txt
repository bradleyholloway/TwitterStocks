 The Gingrich reality   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1997  An editorial makes light of the ethics charges brought by Democrats against House Speaker Newt Gingrich, pointing out that of 74 charges, 65 "were laughed out of committee." The editorial warns that if House Republicans let Gingrich be "blown away over next-to-nothing," they may as well turn the keys of Congress over to the Democratic House leadership.
