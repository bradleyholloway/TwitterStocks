 U.S. Sends Seasoned Peacekeepers to Baghdad --- Getting Handle on Episodes Of Armed Resistance Is Key To Withdrawal of Soldiers   By By Christopher Cooper in Washington, Yochi Dreazen in Mosul, Iraq, and Farnaz Fassihi in Baghdad, Iraq, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  Defusing the situation in Iraq is crucial to the U.S. strategy to drastically draw down its troops in coming months -- a plan whose timetable easily could slip if a low-grade war interferes with efforts to form a new government there. About 130,000 coalition troops currently are stationed in Iraq, including about 90,000 from the U.S. Pentagon officials say they would like to begin shuttling out of the region. The U.S. plans to set up an international military force in three regions of Iraq, with Poland and the United Kingdom controlling two zones and U.S. forces the third, U.S. officials said. France and Germany, the harshest critics of the war, on Saturday endorsed that proposal without much enthusiasm. Bringing in other nations -- the U.S. currently is talking to NATO members, as well as regional organizations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, about participating -- could temper anti-American feelings in Iraq and elsewhere.  A series of armed confrontations, which culminated in a pair of incidents in the town of Fallujah last week, underscore the trouble the U.S. faces as it tries to project an image of liberator to the war-torn country and restore order to a heavily armed society that is full of resentment toward Americans. Getting a handle on small outbreaks of resistance, U.S. officials say, is key to withdrawing troops from the nation, which the U.S. would like to do quickly.
