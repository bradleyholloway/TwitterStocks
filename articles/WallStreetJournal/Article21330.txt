 Ozone in the Sky Isn't as Beneficial At Ground Level --- Pollution by Gas Could Pose More of a Threat Than Thought to Farm Crops   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 2, 1989  The Environmental Protection Agency last year said ozone pollution was reducing yields nationwide about 12% a year. A study at Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research has found reductions nearly three times that.  "Farmers need to realize that air quality as affected by high ozone concentrations represents a significant production cost factor because they have to plant more acres to grow the same amount of crop," said plant pathologist John Laurence, who headed the study.  Scientists have long been convinced that ozone causes severe crop damage, but Mr. Laurence said, "What's new in our study was that the magnitude of yield reductions due to ozone was never so high."
