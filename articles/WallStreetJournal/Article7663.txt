 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Scaring the Public   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  Horror stories make bad public policy. Take formaldehyde, a too common example of how federal bureaucrats misjudge public health risks. Staffers at the Environmental Protection Agency are calling this widely used medical and industrial chemical a "probable human carcinogen," supposedly endangering the health of thousands of Americans. Some EPA officials are therefore urging strict federal regulations on formaldehyde.  To support this claim, the EPA recently produced some seemingly shocking -- and highly publicized -- statistics on the alleged cancer risks from formaldehyde exposure. The agency purports that three out of every 10,000 garment workers exposed to formaldehyde fumes risk getting cancer. For mobile-home dwellers exposed to formaldehyde-treated pressed wood, the cancer risk over 10 years is said to be two in 10,000. And for residents of conventional homes, the perceived risk is one in 10,000. Given the current widespread fear of cancer, these numbers were certain to scare many people.
