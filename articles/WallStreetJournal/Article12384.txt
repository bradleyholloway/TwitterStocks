 View / Culture: As Economy Falters, Asian Artists Unite   By By Diane Brady, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1998  Manila, Philippines -- Choreographer Lin Hwai-min has taken his famed Cloud Gate Dance Theatre across the world to perform, but rarely takes the Taipei-based troupe next door. "I go to Europe and skip Asia, go to Melbourne and skip Jakarta," laments Mr. Lin. "It would be good if we could do more here."  Seated at a cocktail party to kick off the Asian Cultural Council's first-ever conference on the arts, Mr. Lin is geared up to make new friends. At the very least, he wants to hear what his neighbors are doing and share experiences about coping with the economic crisis. Even in Taiwan, which has been spared the worst of the downturn, Mr. Lin admits to having "a very, very hard time" with fund raising right now and fears he may have to lay off dancers.  What timing. Since the economic turmoil broke last year, artists have watched what little funding they were able to squeeze from their governments in good times quickly start to dry up. Meanwhile, individual philanthropists in the region tend to support causes like education long before they'll consider seemingly more frivolous pursuits like arts and culture. ACC director Ralph Samuelson argues that, with the possible exceptions of Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, "support for the arts in most Asian countries was always a difficult proposition to begin with."
