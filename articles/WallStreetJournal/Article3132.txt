 Microsoft, Beating Estimates, Reports Jump in 1st-Period Net to $1.68 Billion   By By David Bank, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1998  The Redmond, Wash., software giant handily beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts for its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30, reporting net income for the period of $1.68 billion, or 62 cents a diluted share, including a one-time gain of $160 million from the sale of its Softimage unit. Excluding the gain, Microsoft earned 56 cents a share. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings, excluding the one-time gain, of 49 cents a share, according to First Call. In the same quarter last year, Microsoft earned $663 million, or 25 cents a share, including a one-time charge of $296 million for the purchase of WebTV Networks. Revenue rose 26% to $3.95 billion from $3.13 billion.  In a conference call with financial analysts, Mr. (Greg) Maffei took pains to point out other technology companies have also reported better-than-expected earnings, perhaps out of concern the strong results could be an embarrassment of riches as Microsoft stands trial on antitrust charges filed by the Justice Department and 20 states. Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system, the driver for the company's revenue in its first quarter, is the main object of the trust busters' attack.
