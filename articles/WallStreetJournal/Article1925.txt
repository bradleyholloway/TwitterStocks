 Bank of Boston Says 3rd-Period Net Rose 7% to $79.2 Million   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1988  Bank of Boston Corp. said its third-quarter earnings rose 7% to $79.2 million, or $1.14 a share, reflecting higher net interest revenue and venture-capital profit.  The increase in net interest revenue, to $299 million from $282 million, came despite the effects of an accounting change and narrower margins. The accounting change, which affected certain loan fees, reduced earnings eight cents a share for the quarter and 20 cents for the nine months, the bank said.
