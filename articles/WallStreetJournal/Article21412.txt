 On the Record: Payroll Tax Cut Dead, Deficit Under Control, Confident Bush Asserts --- In Interview With Journal, President Is Enthusiastic Over Gorbachev, Glasnost --- Touching Conservative Nerve   By By Michel McQueen and Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 1990  But Mr. Bush praised Mr. Gorbachev, who is on the verge of a crucial Communist Party Central Committee meeting that will deal with the Soviet Union's internal unrest. The president said Mr. Gorbachev "has done more in a short period of time for glasnost and reform than anybody in this room would have ever predicted. And I think the result has been a peaceful change in Eastern Europe that none of us would have predicted."  Mr. Bush dismissed the arguments of some Soviet dissidents -- and American conservatives -- that the U.S. shouldn't be supporting Mr. Gorbachev but rather should back Soviets who seek more radical, pro-democratic and pro-capitalist changes. "Well, I don't agree with them," Mr. Bush said.  Just before Mr. Bush spoke, events in Germany raised the specter of even further changes in Eastern Europe. East German Premier Hans Modrow -- whose government had previously opposed the idea of unifying East and West Germany -- formally unveiled a unification plan. Though some analysts worry that a Germany unattached to the West could emerge from a rapid-fire unification, Mr. Bush says events so far don't warrant a change in the traditional U.S. position favoring unification if both German peoples want it.
