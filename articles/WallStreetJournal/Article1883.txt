 For Airplane Lessors, Business Is Greater --- Rentals Give Carriers Flexibility, but at a Price   By By Eileen White Read, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 1988  They are operating lease companies -- the merchant bankers of aviation -- whose role in financing aircraft sales is helping cash-strapped airlines respond more quickly to market changes. Leasing companies purchase planes and lease them on a short-term basis, allowing carriers to operate planes on flexible schedules without taking on debt.  Such leasing firms relieve airlines of both the risk and the benefits of aircraft ownership -- and the service is very pricey and very popular. Leasing companies have purchased about 50% of the commercial jets ordered so far this year, including this week's record-setting $6.6 billion in orders from International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif.  Although they pay a premium to lease on a short-term basis, newly privatized international carriers such as Lufthansa, British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines have nonetheless at times viewed such transactions as more attractive than issuing public debt or arranging bank financing to purchase planes outright. Small airlines, such as Seattle-based Alaska Airlines Group, have been the leasing companies' other principal customers. America West Airlines, based in Phoenix, Ariz., says its launch in 1983 wouldn't have been possible if it had had to purchase outright its $70 million of aircraft.
