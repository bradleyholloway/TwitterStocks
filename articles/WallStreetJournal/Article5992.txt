 GM Nears Purchase of Daewoo Motor, Excluding Big Plant --- Parties Seek Way to Keep Huge Factory Running Under Other Ownership   By By Jay Solomon and Hae Won Choi, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2001  The creditors and GM are seeking ways to keep the Bupyung plant operating, but outside the U.S. auto maker's direct control, according to the officials. One way would see GM purchase a certain amount of the plant's output annually.  Auto analysts say, however, that the Bupyung plant's facilities are antiquated and wouldn't benefit GM in its drive to capture a larger market share in Asia. The plant has also housed the most militant arm of Daewoo Motor's labor union, which has vowed to use violence to block GM's takeover of the company. Large-scale riots shook the Bupyung plant in April, leaving hundreds injured, after 7,500 Daewoo Motor workers were fired.
