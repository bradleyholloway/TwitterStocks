 On Sports: At Candlestick Park, Winning's a Breeze   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1986  Summer and San Francisco have a tough time making contact. Mark Twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in the City by the Bay. Many a present-day San Franciscan has said the same thing about an evening at chilly, breezy Candlestick Park, where the baseball Giants play.  Similarly, the baseball pennant race, that rightest rite of summer, has been an infrequent visitor to these parts. The last time the Giants copped a gonfalon was in 1962, and their latest divisional title came in 1971. What has happened since? Not much more than the shivers. Last year's squad lost 100 games, a record for the venerable franchise. Fair-weather fans, a good deal more common here than fair weather, stayed home.  So dismal has been the Giants' recent history that it is something of an upset that the team is still in residence. Denver, Washington and nearby San Jose were considered as bases during the off-season, and it wasn't until just before spring training that Candlestick again got the nod. The team's publicists considered putting a wheel of fortune on the cover of their 1986 media guide.
