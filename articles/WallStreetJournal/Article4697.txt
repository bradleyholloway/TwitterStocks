 To Their Dismay, King Scholars Find A Troubling Pattern --- Civil Rights Leader Was Lax In Attributing Some Parts Of His Academic Papers   By By Peter Waldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 1990  In 1984, Mr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project to collect the papers and produce a multi-volume collection. And she chose Clayborne Carson, a Stanford University historian, to lead the project.  Now, Mr. Carson and his fellow researchers at Stanford, admirers of Mr. King, have found something they wish they had never discovered. They say that during his seven years of graduate school, Mr. King borrowed words and ideas extensively from other sources for his doctoral dissertation and other scholarly writings without giving proper citations.  For instance, in parts of Mr. King's doctoral dissertation at Boston University, he used the same general structure, many of the same words and the same section titles as another doctoral dissertation written a few years earlier at the university. Though Mr. King paid tribute to his predecessor's work on the fifth page of his dissertation and cited it again in his bibliography, he footnoted the heavily borrowed text just twice in the course of the 343-page dissertation.
