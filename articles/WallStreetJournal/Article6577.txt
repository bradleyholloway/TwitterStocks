 Politics & Economics: Democrats Wager on a Long Shot; Kentucky Republican's Seat Joins Expanding Battlefield In the Fight for U.S. House   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2006  "[Ron Lewis] has forgotten where he came from," says Democratic challenger Mike Weaver, a 67-year-old retired Army colonel and state legislator who laces his stump speeches with quotes from Gen. George Patton. "'When everybody's thinking alike, somebody's not thinking,'" is a Patton line that Mr. Weaver borrows to describe the Republican lock on Washington. Mr. Lewis is part of that mind-set, Mr. Weaver says: "He's a very nice person who follows with loyalty to his party."  "People won't vote for Mike Weaver as much as they will vote against the present administration. I hope by the fall more people will have come to their senses," says Jodie Haydon, 61, who served with the Bardstown Guard unit in Vietnam and supports Mr. Weaver. But his friend Jim Hagan down the street is undecided: "I like [Bush] a hell of a lot," he says, "He'll tell you exactly what it is, and he'll do it and he doesn't [care] if he's right or wrong."  His lack of visibility -- he speaks on the House floor only every other month -- hurts. A Taylor County farmer dismisses Mr. Lewis as a [Mitch McConnell] "puppet." One of the congressman's prized initiatives -- a bill to allow Congress to overrule Supreme Court decisions -- has yet to get a hearing from fellow Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. And Mr. Weaver scoffs at Mr. Lewis's claim that he "saved" Fort Knox during Army base closings last year. "He was just there like all of us were" says Mr. Weaver, whose Army and legislative ties made him part of the same lobbying effort.
