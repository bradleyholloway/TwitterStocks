 Affairs of the Heart: Some New Doctors Can't Hear the Beat --- Study Finds Many Residents Have Trouble Identifying Ailments With Stethoscope   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1997  In a study involving 453 physicians at various stages of residency training, as well as 88 medical students, researchers found that on average, participants correctly identified just 20% of 12 important abnormal heart sounds detectable through a stethoscope.  The instrument, invented nearly 200 years ago, has long been the standard tool for listening to heart and lung sounds during a routine physical examination. Many practitioners maintain that it is one of the most effective ways of detecting important medical problems or ruling out worrisome symptoms as insignificant.  "A lot of studies show that the stethoscope is an accurate, sensitive and specific way of making a bedside diagnosis," said Salvatore Mangione, associate professor of medicine at Allegheny University of Health Sciences, Philadelphia, and lead author of the new report. Use of the instrument is "a skill that is fading in our times of high technology."
