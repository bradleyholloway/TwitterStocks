 Genentech's TPA Is Dealt a Setback By Ontario Panel   By By Brenton R. Schlender, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1988  Genentech Inc.'s TPA anti-clotting drug received another setback yesterday when the Ontario Medical Association advised its members not to use the drug, saying that it costs too much.  The Canadian province's advisory, which only covers doctors and hospitals in Ontario, comes on the heels of a company setback in the U.S. Last week, the U.S. Health Care Finance Administration decided not to give TPA special treatment under Medicare health insurance for the aged to help cover the drug's hefty $2,000-a-dose price tag.
