 Firms' Profits Will Reflect Investor Shifts   By By Yuka Hayashi, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  Those hit most severely by the stock market's steep decline were likely companies such as Stilwell Financial Inc., parent of growth-stock specialist Janus Capital Corp., as well as T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. and Alliance Capital Management Holding LP. Beneficiaries of the fixed-income sector's relative strength include Federated Investors Inc., Blackrock Inc., John Nuveen Co. and Eaton Vance Corp.  As the sell-off in the stock market accelerated and investors started pulling money out of stock mutual funds, analysts lowered their earnings estimates for asset managers, sometimes repeatedly. For example, Guy Moszkowski and Brian Bedell of Salomon Smith Barney cut their earnings estimates for 10 asset managers they follow by as much as 15% at quarter's end.  While much of Stilwell's asset decline reflects weaker stock prices, retail investors have been redeeming shares from Stilwell's funds in recent months, including $1.8 billion in February, according to Financial Research Corp. of Boston. As the performance of Janus' tech-heavy portfolios continues to drop, analysts expect outflows to continue at Stilwell.
