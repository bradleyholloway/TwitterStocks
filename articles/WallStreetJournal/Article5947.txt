 Time Off: A Week of Diversions   By By Stuart Ferguson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  Now called Banius, this site in the Golan centers on a dramatic cave and spring devoted to the worship of the Arcadian god Pan. King Herod's son Philip ruled the surrounding territory (under Roman suzerainty) in the early first century, establishing his administrative center here and naming it Caesarea Philippi. Later monarchs transformed it into an impressive Greco-Roman city with a palace (afterwards converted to baths), market and theater. Following the collapse of the Byzantine empire it became an important Islamic educational center and then a strategic fort during the Crusades.
