 Animators Envision 3-D TV at Home   By Clark, Don; Charny, Ben; and Jerry DiColo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2009  [...] consumer-electronics companies want to create a much richer experience in the home, akin to the eye-popping effects being shown in theaters by companies such as DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. and Walt Disney Co. Their animated movies exploit a projection technology using polarized light and inexpensive plastic glasses, which creates effects that most viewers prefer over anaglyph technology. The company last month helped shoot a National Football League game in 3-D for the first time and is taking part Thursday in a 3-D broadcast of the college football championship game to theaters equipped with technology from RealD Corp. Getting such signals to homes will take time.
