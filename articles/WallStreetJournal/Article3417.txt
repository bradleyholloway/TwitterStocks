 Economists Now See Longer Slump Taking Shape   By By Steve Liesman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2001  Fueling this new wave of pessimism is growing concern about rising high-technology inventories, expectations of a prolonged bear market for stocks, weakening foreign economies and questions about the effectiveness of U.S. monetary policy. Although the pessimists applauded yesterday's move by the Federal Reserve, which reduced short-term interest rates for the third time this year, the pessimists believe the half-point cut won't be enough to revitalize the ailing U.S. economy in the near term.  Economist William Dudley at Goldman, Sachs & Co., who also has become more bearish on the economy, worries about the effectiveness of monetary policy. Although falling interest rates have helped to buoy the housing market and have given auto sales a lift, stocks seem to be immune to the Fed's easing. That is a concern, Mr. Dudley says, because it may indicate that problems in the economy won't be quick or easy to repair. Typically, when "the Fed eased monetary policy and was successful in preventing recession, in each case the stock market went up after the first easing. The fact that the stock market has gone down has to make one nervous."  Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, has been among those arguing that the economy's problems are mostly the result of an inventory correction in manufacturing and don't extend into other sectors. The Conference Board economist says most of the decline in consumer confidence has been in expectations, not in the assessment of the current situation. Sooner or later, unless large numbers of people start to lose their jobs, or they see tangible evidence of a deteriorating economy, consumer sentiment will rise, the Conference Board maintains. Moreover, says James Glassman, senior U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan & Co., the economy shrugged off manufacturing downturns in both 1995 and 1998.
