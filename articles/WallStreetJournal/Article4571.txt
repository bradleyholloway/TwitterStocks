 Florida Legislators Set for Battle In Special Session on Abortion   By By Martha Brannigan and Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1989  But the Democratic leadership controlling both the state House and Senate says it believes it can defeat the anti-abortion measures in committee. In addition, State Rep. Daniel Webster, an Orlando Republican who is supporting several anti-abortion measures, concedes: "It's going to be an uphill battle all the way."  One measure that has pro-choice activists somewhat anxious -- because it seems likely to draw the broadest support -- would require stricter health regulations at abortion clinics. The issue received considerable attention in Florida, where state regulators recently closed several facilities for health violations. Gov. Martinez pointed to problem clinics as justification for giving the state additional regulatory powers.  The Florida session is of particular interest because of a landmark Florida Supreme Court ruling last week that struck down a law restricting abortions. The ruling, which involved parental consent, said that privacy provisions of Florida's constitution protect a woman's right to an abortion, making Florida a stronghold for pro-choice activists.
