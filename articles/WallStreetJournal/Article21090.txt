 German GNP To Be Reported After Summit --- Processing Problem Delays Figures, Which Probably Will Show a Contraction   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1987  FRANKFURT, West Germany -- An unexpected statistical-processing problem has spared West Germany the embarrassment of arriving at next week's economic summit with data illustrating a poor economic performance in the first quarter.  The gross national product figures for the quarter, which private economists and government officials have predicted will show a contraction from the 1986 fourth quarter, were to have been released tomorrow. But because of incomplete processing, the Statistics Office said, they won't come out until June 11, the day after the Venice summit of the seven largest industrialized democracies ends.  At the June 8-10 meeting, the U.S. is expected to renew pressure on West Germany to take steps to stimulate its slumping economy. By spurring domestic demand, the U.S. believes, Germany can import more.
