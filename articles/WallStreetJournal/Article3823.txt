 Hong Kong Travel Booms Again   By Setoodeh, Ramin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2004  Now, business isn't just back, it's booming. Occupancy levels are higher than in previous summers, and the hotel's restaurants again require reservations. "I think people are making up for lost time," says Sally de Souza, a hotel spokeswoman. "Tables are full again. Everyone's back."  The average roundtrip, economy airfare from Hong Kong to the U.S. has more than doubled since last summer, to about 11,000 Hong Kong dollars, or US$1,400, from HK$5,000. Still, more travelers are booking flights, a sign the airline industry has recovered. "People are now going for the long-haul destinations," Ms. Wong said. "Travelers weren't exactly welcome [last summer], coming just out of the SARS environment."
