 Google to License Content From AP For New Service   By Sarah Ellison and Christopher Lawton, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2006  The deal could haveimplications for news organizations that have lost ad revenue to online "aggregators" such as Google and Yahoo Inc. Google traditionally hasn't paid for the news content it posts on its Google News site, claiming its use of the headlines and few sentences it posts doesn't infringe on copyrights.  While Google was quick to emphasize that the specific licensing deal with the Associated Press doesn't affect Google News, the deal appears to have been structured so that it satisfies AP's desire to get paid for its content, and at the same time allows Google to maintain its position with respect to "fair use" of content on Google News.
