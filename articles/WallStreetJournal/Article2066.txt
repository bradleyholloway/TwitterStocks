 Bush Modifying Proposed Cut In Tax on Gains --- Lower Long-Term Rates For Many Assets Sought As Investment Incentive   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1989  The Bush administration is modifying its plan for cutting the tax on capital gains, and is likely to propose a less-generous tax break but apply it to a broader variety of assets, administration officials said.  Officials say the administration is putting the finishing touches on a plan to reduce the tax bite on capital gains to 19.6% for the richest taxpayers and to apply the lower rate to securities, real estate, timber and most other assets except collectibles, such as antiques.  The administration won't suggest immediately setting a three-year minimum holding period for the lower capital-gains tax rate, because that could put a big dent in federal tax revenues. One of the politically appealing features of lowering capital-gains taxes is that it is perhaps the only tax cut that raises money, at least in the short run. By encouraging investors to sell assets, it increases tax revenues and helps narrow the deficit.
