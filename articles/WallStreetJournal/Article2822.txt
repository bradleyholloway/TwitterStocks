 Heard on the street: GM's hardball has fans, unless they get hit, too   By Pulliam, Susan; Dorfman, John R, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1996  In the coldblooded logic of Wall Street, where layoffs and corporate restructuring are often greeted with cheers, the two-week-old strike by the United Auto Workers at a General Motors plant in Ohio has been met with applause from auto investors. So far, at least. Since the strike began, GM's stock price has actually risen slightly, carried partly by the marketplace shift to cyclical stocks that could benefit from faster economic growth. On Mar 20, 1996, GM fell 3/4 to 53 1/2 in NYSE trading, not far from a 52-week high of 54 5/8.
