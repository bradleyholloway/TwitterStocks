 On Sports: The Last Stand of the Ivory Powers   By By Sam Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2001  All this comes as no surprise to administrators on these leafy private campuses -- they've been quietly watching their fortunes sink on the gridiron for years. Just four seasons ago, not a single private school finished in the AP's Top 20. And excluding the Miami Hurricanes (we'll get to them later), only three other privately endowed schools have managed to do so in the last three years. Says recruiting expert Allen Wallace of SuperPrep magazine: "Private schools are feeling a lot more vulnerable."  Worst of all, experts say, is something called the Northwestern Syndrome. After years of being a Big Ten doormat with some of the worst football facilities imaginable, the Wildcats shocked everyone in 1995 with a spirited charge to the Rose Bowl. And even after enduring a coaching change, they're still pretty darn good. The problem: Their success has inspired underachieving programs from Fresno State to South Carolina to dive into the market for top coaches, creating yet another hassle for private schools.  Of course, private schools aren't finished yet. Success in college football has always been cyclical, even for the biggest and most storied public programs. The National Collegiate Athletic Association has helped level the playing field in recent years with new rules limiting scholarships and raising academic standards. And there's no denying the success of Miami -- whose team is favored to win the national championship. Northwestern's case is even more remarkable: According to a recent NCAA study, the Wildcats lead all major colleges, with a 92% graduation rate for athletes. "We're small and private and academically minded and we still believe we can win," says athletic director Rick Taylor.
