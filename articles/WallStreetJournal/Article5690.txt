 Assembly Speaker Wants California To Open a Trade Office in Argentina   By By Shirley Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  Hoping that Gov. Gray Davis's trip to Mexico last week will open doors in the Latin American market, Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa plans to introduce legislation this session to establish California's first trade office in Argentina.  Mr. Villaraigosa, who accompanied the governor and business leaders on the Mexican trade mission, says he was persuaded that untapped opportunities for California business await in Latin America. The trip marked the first time in six years a Mexican president and a California governor met, and aimed to mend relations with Mexican officials, who were offended by former Gov. Pete Wilson's hostility to illegal immigrants.  The speaker plans to seek about $500,000 in the 1999-2000 state budget to open a three-person office in Buenos Aires. The current budget allots $5.7 million to run seven trade offices and open five smaller ones, in Calgary, Alberta; Manila, Philippines; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Seoul, South Korea; and Shanghai, China. According to the state Trade and Commerce Agency, the seven trade offices now operating -- in London, Mexico City, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Johannesburg, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- brought California more than $6 for every $1 invested in 1997-98, generating over $26 million in tax revenue.
