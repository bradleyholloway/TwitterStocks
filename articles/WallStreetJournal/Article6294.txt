 PepsiCo to Start Fresh Cola War With a Midcalorie-Type Soda   By Christina Cheddar Berk and Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2004  Pepsi Edge, per 12-ounce serving, will have 70 calories, 20 grams of carbs and 20 grams of sugar; a regular Pepsi has 150 calories, 41 grams of carbs and 41 grams of sugar.  Some beverage executives see midcalorie drinks as a way to make soft drinks appear healthier and win back consumers worried about their waistline. Marc Cohen, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the new drink could help Pepsi hold on to male consumers who give up regular colas and don't substitute a diet soft drink, as more females are apt to do.
