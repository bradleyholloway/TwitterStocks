 Chip Stocks Have Fans Despite Lofty Prices   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2004  "It was startling," says Richard Tortoriello, an S&P analyst. "There is a migration of value into the chips and the software that form the brains and nerves of electronics goods." Other electronics businesses, by contrast, are becoming standardized and outsourced, which cuts into their profit margins, he says.  The firm then looked at profit margins along with chip makers' price-to-sales multiples. While that multiple peaked at eight times sales in 1999, notes Mr. Tortoriello, it stands at a more-reasonable 4.3 times estimated sales in 2005, when profit margins should swell to around 63%. That combination of reasonable price-to-sales multiples and strong profit margins leads S&P to conclude that there is still price upside to the sector.  Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, meanwhile, has been a longtime owner of OmniVision Technologies Inc., which makes image-sensor chips used in digital cameras. "That stock has been one you tell your grandkids about," he says, referring to the stock's big gains. OmniVision's shares have more than quadrupled since early 2003 and the company announced a two-for-one stock split yesterday. The stock traded at 4 p.m. yesterday at $58.78, up 3.7%.
