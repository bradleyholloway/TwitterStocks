 U.S. taxpayers, thrifts to share cost of rescue   By Duke, Paul; Seib, Gerald F, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1989  According to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, the Bush administration's savings and loan bailout plan will be paid half by the taxpayers and half by the thrift industry over the next ten years. To prevent the crisis from happening again, the insurance premiums paid by banks and thrifts will be raised and the FHLBB will be "reconstituted." The plan also calls for the creation of the Resolution Fund Corp. to issue the government bonds that will raise $50 billion to liquidate the insolvent thrifts. The bonds with higher rates than Treasury bonds will cost taxpayers an additional $2 billion for the thrift rescue.
