 Bearishness Spreads on Some Insurers Facing Hurt Profits if California Voters Slash Rates   By By Sonja Steptoe, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1988  Investors are likely to vote against certain insurance stocks if a proposal to slash California insurance rates is approved in tomorrow's balloting, analysts say.  The anxiety-producing proposal is the only one on the California ballot that would reduce rates for most types of insurance. Three others affect only car insurance, calling, respectively, for a no-fault system; limits on certain auto claims and attorney fees; and lower auto rates for good drivers. Investors so far have focused only on a few regional car insurers.  Yet with polls showing that California voters strongly favor the plan to cut most insurance rates 20% immediately, Mr. Cholnoky and several other analysts are growing more bearish on companies that write a lot of policies in the state, including Chubb, Fireman's Fund, Safeco and Ohio Casualty.
