 Russia's Gazprom May Unload TV Stake --- Strategy Shift Would Allow Foreigners Opportunity To Get Majority Control   By By Andrew Higgins, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  Alfred Kokh, head of Gazprom-Media, the gas company's media arm, said in an interview that Gazprom is willing to sell some of its NTV shares to foreigners on condition that they reach a deal to buy the bulk of Mr. [Vladimir Gusinsky]'s stake in NTV. "If they have a sufficient quantity of shares and need only some extra shares in order to obtain a controlling interest, we are ready to help," said Mr. Kokh. He said NTV has a value of about $300 million.  Media-Most and other companies controlled by Mr. Gusinsky own nearly 50% of NTV, but his grip on the company is tenuous. Media-Most and its affiliates have debts of more than $800 million, including a $262 million loan from Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of Credit Suisse Group. Gazprom guaranteed this loan, due for repayment in July, and holds 19% of NTV and stakes in other Media-Most assets as collateral.
