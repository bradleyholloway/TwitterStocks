 Enough Cocaine? Meatier Queries For Candidates   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1999  THERE ARE. Here's the main course, virtually untouched so far in this campaign's "debate": China and Russia, home to almost four million active-duty soldiers and perhaps 20,000 nuclear warheads, are sounding more antagonistic toward the U.S., and more friendly toward each other. The main thing they agree on is that the U.S. is too dominant in the world today and should be knocked down a peg or two.  Mess up this question, and a president can start a war. The official U.S. position, of course, is that it pursues a "one China" policy, hoping that someday, somehow, China and Taiwan will peacefully reunite. But Taiwan's recent declaration that it wants "state to state" relations with China suggests it is edging toward independence, which China would consider an act of war. This quandary will get harder, not easier, for the next president to finesse, because Taiwan's new democratic system will give voice to many more pro-independence sentiments.  The Taiwan Relations Act is magnificently vague, saying merely that any attempt by China to forcibly determine the future of Taiwan would be "of grave concern to the United States." Some will push the next president to declare, without reservation, that he will defend Taiwan. Others will argue such a declaration only gives Taiwan a license to provoke China. We should know what a potential president thinks. Related query: Will the next president proceed with sales of missile-defense equipment to China?
