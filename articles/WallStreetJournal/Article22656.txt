 E-Business: Starting Gate   By By Anson Liaw, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2000  SAND HILL ROAD in Palo Alto has always been to venture capital what Wall Street is to investment banking. Now there may be some migration off the renowned road. Among the latest planning a departure is US Venture Partners, which has been on Sand Hill for 17 years. The firm plans to move when construction is completed on a new building a bit to the south on Page Mill Road. The firm will follow Trident Capital, which earlier this year moved out of its space on Sand Hill for digs in downtown Palo Alto.  Although Mr. [Matsamura] was the only one of the entrepreneurs who didn't lay out his business plan, he was the audience's favorite to receive funding, with 28% of the vote. All he would say was that Kalepa is working on "content distribution architecture in the peer-to-peer networking space." Translation: something that, like the music-sharing site Napster, ties together personal computers over the Internet.  Panelist Chris Kersey of Blueprint Ventures called the Kalepa presentation "tantalizing," in part because of Kalepa's founding team of guys with impressively geeky degrees in areas such as creating neural networks, though he said he would like a little more detail.
