 Accidental Candidate: The Strange Journey Of a Sunni Politician; Ali Ghaleb Boycotted Vote In Iraq, but Somehow He Was Elected to Legislature   By Trofimov, Yaroslav, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  On Mr. [Ali Ghaleb]'s trip back to Tikrit, the highway was blocked with traffic. Mr. Ghaleb's car took a bypass on a dirt road near the town of Latifiya, a notorious Sunni guerrilla stronghold south of Baghdad. Two pickup trucks full of insurgents waylaid the car.  Gunmen dragged Mr. Ghaleb out of the car and discovered that he was chairman of the U.S.-created Salaheddin council. He and the four other delegation members who were with him were locked in a shed. The captors sharpened a knife, pressing it against Mr. Ghaleb's neck, and discussed which captive's throat would be easiest to slash. "You collaborate with the Americans. You don't deserve to live," they taunted him, Mr. Ghaleb says. "If we deal with the Americans, we only do it to serve our own country's interests," Mr. Ghaleb says he replied.  The following day, they put Mr. Ghaleb and his associates under rugs on the floor of a minivan and delivered them to a different militant group several hours away. These insurgents, Sunni religious fundamentalists, gave Mr. Ghaleb a Quran and a thick book by Said Qutb, an Islamic ideologue from Egypt executed in 1966 who is widely revered by Islamic radicals world-wide. They forced Mr. Ghaleb and his fellow captives to read at least 50 pages of Mr. Qutb's writings every day.
