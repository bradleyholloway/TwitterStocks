 Heard on the street: Reebok shares sold by some dissident holders after their push to oust management fails   By Sandler, Linda; Pereira, Joseph, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1995  Many large dissident shareholders in Reebok International, after failing to get Paul Fireman to step aside as CEO, have sold their shares. The case shows the limits of shareholder activism. While shareholders like to think of themselves as having the muscle to oust managers and improve the way companies are run, they really only have power when a company has been badly managed for many years.
