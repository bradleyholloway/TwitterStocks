 PEOPLE PATTERNS   By By Alan L. Otten, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1990  Researchers for the department used six common indicators of "at-risk" status: coming from a single-parent family, coming from a household with income below $15,000, being home alone more than three hours a day, having a dropout as a sibling, having limited English skills and having parents who didn't finish high school.  A 1988 survey of nearly 25,000 eighth-graders in 1,000 public and private schools nationwide found that 53% had no risk factors and 26% had one. But just over 20% had two or more. These students already showed low grades and high absenteeism. The study will follow the sample as they move through high school and beyond, trying to identify factors fostering or hindering success in school.  Over half consider absenteeism a serious problem, and three in four worry about the number of latchkey children, those left on their own after school. Compared with a similar survey only four years earlier, much higher percentages of junior high and high school teachers list student drinking, drug use, teen-age pregnancy, dropouts and suicide as serious problems.
