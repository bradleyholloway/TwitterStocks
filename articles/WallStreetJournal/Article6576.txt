 Leadership (A Special Report); The Marketing Maze   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2006  "Our landscape is clearly changing at a rapid pace," says Andy Jung, Kellogg's senior director of advertising and media. "Advertisers and agencies must both assess the viability of the myriad of new communications options available, as well as their near-term and long- term scalability."  Complicating matters is that people have become inured to hard-sell marketing after years of messages blasting out of the TV screen. "People are just tired of being yelled at," says James Hering, executive vice president and director of integrated marketing at TM Advertising, a Dallas ad firm that's part of Interpublic Group of Cos. "There are just thousands of messages being pelted at us, and consumers are proactively filtering it. We're putting up mental blinders to get this stuff out of our heads."  Not all the marketing innovation is happening on a computer screen. Advertisers are also experimenting with ways to reach people in public places. The logic: If people see an ad during a regular daily activity, such as walking to work, they'll be more likely to study it because it's part of the scene -- not an unwanted message intruding on their entertainment. For instance, to get consumers interested in Verizon Communications Inc.'s SuperPages.com, an online yellow-pages directory, TM Advertising left a car in a parking lot covered in what appeared to be bird droppings. (They were fake.) As onlookers approached the automobile, says Mr. Hering, they'd see a sign, usually under the wiper blades, telling them how SuperPages might help them find a great local car wash.
