 More Creditors Let Computers Rate Applicants   By By Alexandra Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1987  Computerized "credit scoring" has already replaced credit analysts at most major banks. Now, as it becomes more affordable, credit scoring is making inroads with oil companies, local banks and retailers.  "More and more banks and retailers are using credit-scoring systems," says Robert Burke, general manager of the retail credit-card division of Bank of New York, which has used credit scoring for three years. "It automates the credit-granting process and makes it cheaper" and more impartial, he says, though supporters and critics find some pitfalls.  Computerized credit-scoring systems use many of the same criteria as credit analysts, like an applicant's income and debt outstanding, but in a more systematic way. For each application, a system assigns numerical values to the data supplied by the consumer. The values are based on analysis of consumer-repayment patterns, much as insurance companies use actuarial data in setting rates. For example, the scoring system for TRW Inc., operator of one of the largest's credit-reporting bureaus, is based on credit data about 133 million consumers.
