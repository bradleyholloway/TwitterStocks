 Off the Hook: Hughes Aircraft Chief Is Implicated Belatedly In Defense-Secret Case --- Statute of Limitations Makes His Prosecution Unlikely, But Civil Suit Is Possible --- A Subpoena Misses the Mark   By By Andy Pasztor and Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  Mr. Currie may have done more than just read excerpts from internal Pentagon papers passed along to him by underlings. According to testimony by several former Hughes employees and documents filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Currie approved a system to funnel hundreds of pages of Pentagon documents into Hughes while circumventing the company's normal security procedures. The allegations were made in open court last month but haven't been reported until now.  Yet the criminal investigation of Mr. Currie, which has been under way for several months, according to several law-enforcement officials, seems unlikely to lead to an indictment. Mr. Currie currently isn't a target of the grand jury investigating the scandal. But investigators are contemplating filing some sort of civil action against several companies and individuals, including Mr. Currie.  Prosecutors may be frustrated in pursuing a criminal case against Mr. Currie because of timing. The five-year statute of limitations covering the company's document-gathering activities expired three months ago. Also, the Justice Department complicated matters in March, when -- believing it had wrapped up its case against Hughes by getting a guilty plea and $3.6 million in penalties from the company -- it said it wouldn't seek criminal charges against senior management. The internal Hughes memoranda most damaging to Mr. Currie didn't surface until later, investigators say. Finally, the investigation has been slowed by the refusal of seven former and current Hughes officials to cooperate unless immunized from prosecution.
