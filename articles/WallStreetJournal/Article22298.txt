 Under Control: Doggedly, Uzbekistan Pursues Its Goal to Be Economic Powerhouse --- Oil-Rich Central Asian Nation Still Shuns Democracy, Shies From Open Markets --- Living Down Rights Abuses   By By Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1997  TASHKENT, Uzbekistan -- Western-style democracy is having to wait its turn here. So are liberal economics and a deal with the International Monetary Fund. Right or wrong, the leaders of Uzbekistan have their eyes on a higher goal: to become the economic powerhouse of Central Asia.  By contrast, a sense of purpose pervades the quiet, tree-lined boulevards of Tashkent. Since independence in 1991, oil production has tripled to make the country self-sufficient in energy. Foreign debt has been held to $2.4 billion. Factories already ship new export-quality goods including cars, shoes, milk and macaroni. Officials appear austere, hard-working and -- even rarer in the former Soviet Union -- passionately committed to making their country succeed.  Such an Uzbek awakening isn't a foregone conclusion, of course. Its Central Asian neighbors are wary of a country with the regional advantages of a central position, the biggest population of 23 million people and control of the leading cities, modern Tashkent and the fabled Silk Road entrepots of Samarkand and Bokhara. Some American policymakers hope that Uzbekistan can assure Western access to a region that lies over some of the world's biggest prospective oil and gas deposits of the next century; but Russia may one day challenge such changes in its old backyard.
