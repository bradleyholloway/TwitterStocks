 Columbia/HCA Healthcare Convictions May Bolster Case for Civil Settlement   By By Lucette Lagnado, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1999  The expectation on Wall Street has been that Columbia will end up paying about $1 billion in fines to the government. Now, however, the government is in a better bargaining position to secure a faster settlement with a potentially larger fine, and with that could come some sort of guilty plea, people familiar with the situation said. "It will be substantial," analyst John Hindelong of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said of any fine. "And certainly a decision like this wouldn't strengthen Columbia's case."  *ql0700,0216The Tampa federal jury found Jay Jarrell, president of the company's southwest Florida division, and Robert Whiteside, who had been director of reimbursement for Florida and became a reimbursement director at Columbia corporate headquarters, guilty on six out of seven counts of Medicare fraud. At issue was nearly $3 million in allegedly fraudulent overpayments by the federal Medicare program to Fawcett Memorial Hospital, in Port Charlotte, Fla., which became part of the Columbia system when it acquired Basic American Medical Inc. in the early 1990s.  Charles Wilson, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, whose office prosecuted the Tampa case, said he is "sure the verdict in this case will have an effect" on other government probes involving Columbia. He added the verdict "reflects our resolve to aggressively investigate, prosecute and punish fraud and abuse in the health-care industry." Mr. Wilson said his office, in Tampa, is pursuing additional inquiries related to Columbia. Prosecutors in other cities are likely to be emboldened by the Tampa trial.
