 U.S. Influence on Philippines Election: Does It Use It? Does It Even Have It?   By By June Kronholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1986  But many members of the opposition contend the U.S. should be, but isn't, pressing its influence in the election Friday between Mr. Cojuangco's sister, Corazon Aquino, and President Ferdinand Marcos. "They do a lot of jawboning" about the need for change, "but it's never backed up by action," complains Jaime Ongpin, the chairman of Benguet Corp. and Mrs. Aquino's economic adviser.  The U.S. helped pressure Mr. Marcos into calling the election 17 months ahead of schedule to prove he's still in control of the country. Fearing a fraudulent vote, the U.S. also pressured Mr. Marcos to allow an independent citizens' group to act as poll watchers and conduct its own tally. Further, the U.S. pressured Mr. Marcos to name a candidate for vice president, an office that has been empty since he declared martial law in 1972 and dismissed the rest of the government.  But Mr. Marcos was facing threats of a cut in U.S. aid. The watchdog group planned to conduct its count whether it was accredited or not. The vice presidential nominee, who would succeed the ailing Mr. Marcos were he to die in office, is 75 years old. And besides, Mr. Bosworth points out, "Marcos called the election because he thought he could win."
