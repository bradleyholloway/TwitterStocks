 A Taste of Paris   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  Make no mistake: This strike is a carefully timed union strategy to inflict maximum economic damage in exchange for maximum extortion at the bargaining table. The Transport Workers Union is playing hardball, and we only wish New York Governor George Pataki and other officials representing the state's commuters and taxpayers would be as tough. But since public-employee unions are among the largest donors to the coffers of the very politicians with whom they are negotiating, it's not surprising that the union bosses have full confidence that the state will eventually pay their ransom.  On the opposite page, Steven Malanga argues for firing the workers and hiring replacements. That's fine by us. But if that's too much for Messrs. Pataki and [Mike Bloomberg], they should at least announce that any fines imposed on the unions by the courts (such as the $1 million assessed yesterday) will under no circumstances be negotiated away in any settlement.
