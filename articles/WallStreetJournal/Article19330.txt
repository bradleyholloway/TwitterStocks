 Ex-DOE Official Faults FBI in Lee Investigation   By By David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  Notra Trulock, who served as the department's director of intelligence, told a Senate panel that he expected the FBI to investigate all 12 suspects identified by his department when a criminal case was opened in 1996 looking into the possible compromise of design information for the U.S. W-88 warhead. Once the criminal investigation began, however, "it was the FBI that focused solely on Dr. [Sylvia Lee]," Mr. Trulock told the Senate Judiciary Committee. His appearance was the first time he has publicly explained his role in the affair under oath.  Mr. Trulock's assertions appear to ignore the role that the DOE played in focusing the FBI on Mr. Lee. The agency concluded in its inquiry identifying the 12 suspects that Mr. Lee was "the only individual" with the opportunity and motive to give away the W-88 information, according to a person who has read the document.  Also testifying was former Los Alamos National Laboratory counterintelligence chief Robert Vrooman, who repeated his claim that Mr. Trulock and other officials investigated the Taiwan-born Mr. Lee because he is ethnic Chinese. Mr. Trulock's predecessor, Charles Washington, also has accused Mr. Trulock of racial bias. Mr. Trulock called the charge "contemptible."
