 BUSINESS: Countrywide Finds No. 1 Spot Isn't Easy   By Anders, George, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2007  A case study developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management analyzes Callaway Golf Co.'s missteps in the late 1990s, after its Big Bertha drivers helped it become the leading golf-club maker. Callaway kept expanding, but demand waned as Asian economies weakened and U.S. golfers balked at constantly buying fancier Callaway offerings. Inventory built up, profit skidded and a management shake-up ensued.  Another classic danger involves companies that grow rapidly by acquisition but fail to put the pieces together effectively. In the early 1990s, a takeover spree briefly turned Saatchi & Saatchi into the world's largest advertising agency. But the firm couldn't run its sprawling empire effectively. The founders were forced out and Saatchi & Saatchi was sold several times. It currently ranks No. 9 in revenue among U.S. ad agencies.  "It's easy to get blindsided when you're growing fast," Mr. [Richard H. Scott] says. "You have to build better legal and internal audit capabilities. You need to be able to deal with regulatory issues. But we were growing so fast we often hired people six months after we needed them."
