 Viag's Operating Net Doubled Last Year As Sales Rose 22%   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1995  Viag AG said its operating profit doubled to 850 million marks ($554.8 million) in 1994 and its sales jumped by 22%.  Viag said it has a "confident tone" going into 1995. Not only will a positive macroeconomic environment aid its development and the concentration on its core businesses, Viag said, but its acquisition of Bavarian utility Bayernwerk AG in August 1994 will also appear in Viag's full-year results for the first time in 1995.
