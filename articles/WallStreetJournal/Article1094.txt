 SmartMoney: More Investors Try Munis   By Bullock, Nicole, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  The secret is getting out. Investors have poured $16 billion into muni funds this year -- the largest amount in four years -- as they wake up to munis' many positive attributes. Eliminating taxes can really boost income. Before taxes, both municipal-bond funds and taxable-bond funds have returned roughly 5% over the past decade. Once the IRS took its cut, however, investors in the highest tax bracket still got nearly 5% on the muni funds, while the return on taxable- bond funds plummeted to about 3%. And unlike long-term Treasury bonds, which are yielding less than short-term Treasurys now, long-term rates for munis are higher than short rates. That gives investors a chance to lock in good long-term yields. And even though some high-quality munis offer yields that rival junk bonds' after taxes, municipal bonds have much lower default rates than corporate bonds.
