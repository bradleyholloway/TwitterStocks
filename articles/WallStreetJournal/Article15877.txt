 Oil Companies To Post Profits In 4th Quarter --- Surge in Oil Price to $24.50 A Barrel to Help Boost Results Over '98 Period   By By Bob Sechler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2000  AUSTIN, Texas -- Major U.S. oil companies are expected to report strong fourth-quarter earnings compared with a year ago.  But analysts say the comparison has been rendered all but moot because of a huge year-over-year climb in the price of oil: The benchmark West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, averaged about $24.50 a barrel in the 1999 fourth quarter, compared with a dismal $13 a barrel in the same period of 1998.  Eugene Nowak, an oil analyst at ABN Amro Inc., predicted a 14% increase in industry earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. In the year-over-year comparison, Mr. Nowak and other analysts are looking for industry earnings to double, simply because the 1998 fourth quarter was so poor.
