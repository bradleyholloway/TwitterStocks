 With Books-A-Million, Analysts Advise Waiting for the Paperback   By By Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1998  Two years ago, Wall Street analysts predicted the Birmingham retailer's stock would rise to $20 from $16, as the company exploited its niche: opening bookstores in midsize Southern cities that were below the radar of giant chains like Barnes & Noble and Borders Group.  Now the nation's third-largest publicly traded book retailer is trying harder. It's building 25,000-square-foot superstores in even smaller towns where its competitors aren't as likely to go. At the same time, Books-A-Million has added stores in the midsize cities that have been its niche -- cities like Athens, Ga., Chattanooga and Richmond -- in the hope of crowding out invading rivals. And it has even expressed informal interest in entering the Atlanta market through an acquisition.  So far, the numbers have lagged. For the nine-week period ended Jan. 3, encompassing the crucial holiday selling season, the company's same-store sales -- or sales at stores open at least a year -- rose only 1.4% from the same period a year earlier. By comparison, New York-based Barnes & Noble's same-stores sales jumped 10% for that period, and Borders, of Ann Arbor, Mich., saw same-store sales rise 8% for a 10-week period ended Jan. 11.
