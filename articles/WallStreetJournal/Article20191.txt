 Skydiving Is Not Falling   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2007  It is the popularity of skydiving ("Skydiving's Great Leap Forward," Weekend Journal, Nov. 23) and the general public's fascination with this unique sport that led to the development of wind tunnels. It is quite misleading to report that "skydiving has fallen on hard times" and that the skydiving industry is counting on kindergartners and wind tunnels to help rejuvenate the sport. Wind tunnels were developed to meet the needs of skydiving teams as well as passionate student and novice skydivers.
