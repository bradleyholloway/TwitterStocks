 WSJ Guide to Business Schools: Recruiter's Top Picks (A Special Report); The Journal Report Online   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2005  Avoid overstating your role in team projects. For some students, "everything is 'I did this, I did that.' It's off-putting," says Ken Bayne, vice president of finance and chief financial officer at Bairnco Corp., a multinational company based in Lake Mary, Fla., who's been recruiting M.B.A.s for seven years. During on-campus interviews, recruiters can meet several students who worked on the same project, he says, "and I'll get completely different points of view about who did what."  People I interviewed advised against it, and I agree. Career- office directors and executives with boutique investment banks say earning a second M.B.A. won't get you any further toward your goal. It even may cause hiring managers to question why you needed two degrees. "I could see someone saying, 'Why did you get a second M.B.A.?' " says Russ Landon, managing director of the investment-banking group at Adams Harkness, a Boston-based boutique. "It almost works against you."  To prepare to write your resume, identify the skills you've used in your most recent jobs that are valuable to the type of roles and employers you're seeking. Don't overlook your accomplishments as the household's chief caregiver and caretaker or assume those two years at home provide no transferable skills, says Terri Wanger, assistant dean of the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver. "With the expectations of employers surrounding using new technology and all the new relationships we have to handle, the issue of multitasking is absolutely critical."
