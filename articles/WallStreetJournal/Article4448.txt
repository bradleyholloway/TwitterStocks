 First Boston, Europe Affiliate Plan to Merge --- Deal, Valued at $1.1 Billion, Represents Major Boost In Credit Suisse's Power   By By Steve Swartz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1988  First Boston Inc.'s board approved a merger with its European affiliate, Credit Suisse First Boston, in a transaction that will take the combined companies private and trigger a major restructuring of their senior management.  The proposed transaction, which came after more than a year of internal strife and operating setbacks for First Boston, represents a significant boost in the power of Credit Suisse. The big Swiss bank will increase its ownership in First Boston and position its people to become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined companies. Some people close to First Boston said the transaction amounted to a takeover of the U.S. securities firm by the Swiss bank, in part because some members of First Boston's senior management had lost the support of some of their own key employees.  But some analysts and others close to First Boston said it is difficult to assess whether or not the price is fair because First Boston has numerous investments in other companies, from so-called merchant banking transactions, which go back several years and could add significantly to First Boston's value. Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said First Boston has been unwilling to provide information on many of these tranactions. He nonetheless said he thought the price was "good, given this {post-crash} environment."
