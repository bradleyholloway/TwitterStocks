 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: Haunted Hollywood   By Seipp, Catherine, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2004  The latest (unintentional) object lesson that this is nonsense comes courtesy of the "Hollywood Hell House," a walk-through theatrical satire that opened last week in Los Angeles. Its target is those church-sponsored, evangelical "haunted" houses -- part of the Halloween season -- that warn teens about the perils of Satan-worship, gay sex and the "convenient choice" (as the demon tour guide puts it) of abortion.  "Hollywood Hell House" sold out opening night and runs through Halloween at the Center for Inquiry-West, a self-described "secular humanist community organization" on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a funny idea and cleverly executed under the direction of Jill Soloway, a writer for HBO's "Six Feet Under." Her co-director, actress/writer Maggie Rowe, obtained the Hell House kit under not entirely truthful pretenses: She told Mr. Roberts that she was the director of a West Hollywood youth group -- accurate only in that she named her production company The Youth Group.  "We're not upset this is happening," Mr. Roberts said. "I'm out here to affirm what Hell House is all about -- that sin always leads to a devastating and destructive end, but that hope is found in Jesus Christ. In the heart of the entertainment capital, something that is important to us is being presented. It's an honor. Even if they don't agree with our message, they realize we've got something here."
