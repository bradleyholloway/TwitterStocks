 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Scott R. Schmedel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1990  Azar Nut Co. of El Paso reluctantly contracted to buy a new executive's house for market value if it fired him. Two years later, he was gone. Azar shelled out $285,000 for the home and put it up for sale. But the best deal Azar could get brought a $111,366 loss, which it deducted as an ordinary business cost. The IRS objected, so Azar turned to the Tax Court. The court's decision is a warning against such pacts, says Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton.  The IRS contended that the house was a capital asset producing a capital loss not deductible from business income. Azar argued that its expense was a form of employee compensation and also satisfied a business need. But Judge Drennen rejected this plea and applied a 1988 Supreme Court ruling that assets are capital unless defined otherwise by law. A house is a capital asset that produces capital gain or loss, the judge held. He denied Azar's deduction.  The time is fast approaching when you must file your return -- or a Form 4868 requesting an automatic four-month extension of the due date (send a check for estimated tax owed, too). One advantage of electronic filing over the mail is immediate confirmation that the IRS got your return. If you do rely on the post office, many preparers suggest using certified mail, return receipt requested, to have some evidence that you filed on time, even if it doesn't prove what was inside the envelope.
