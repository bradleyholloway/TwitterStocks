 Auto Watch: When to Drop Collision, Theft Coverage   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  Many people who drive older cars save money by dropping the collision and "comprehensive" coverage on their auto-insurance policies. The trick is knowing when to do it.  In many cases, "people's perception of the value of their car is inflated," Mr. [Robin Harbage] says. "You always think about what you paid for it and not the depreciated value," as you should. At Progressive, about 5% of auto policyholders file some form of auto claim in a typical year, he adds.  Still, dropping collision and comprehensive coverage may not be smart for everyone with an older car. "Obviously everyone has a different risk aversion," says Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. Drivers who have poor driving records, who live in areas with high accident rates, or who have teenagers just learning to drive may want to keep their collision coverage because they may have higher odds of getting into a collision.
