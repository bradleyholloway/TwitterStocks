 Retailers' Present for Job Market On Mend: More Holiday Hiring   By Jon E. Hilsenrath, Ann Zimmerman and Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2003  Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, says it is expecting the holiday season to be "a bit stronger" than last year and will staff accordingly, although it declined to give firm numbers. Consumer electronics chain Best Buy Co. says it will increase store staffing by 32% on average for the shopping season, up from a seasonal increase of 30% last year. Sears, Roebuck & Co. says it plans to hire 30,000 to 35,000 holiday workers, down slightly from previous years, despite recently improved sales. That's because Sears recently remodeled its stores to make some departments self-service, trimming labor costs.  Other retailers say that they're not yet ready to start hiring, though in general they've stopped cutting staff. Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and other department stores, Limited Brands Inc., whose chains include Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, and Target Corp. all say they expect to keep their payrolls flat this Christmas, compared with last year.  "We think we'll see a natural build in staffing because the sales projections are so healthy for the fourth quarter," says Daniel Butler, vice president of operations for the National Retail Federation. "Last year, we saw flat hiring, this year we think we'll see an increase."
