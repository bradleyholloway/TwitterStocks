 E-Business: Starting Gate   By By Lisa Bransten, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2001  Earlier this year, Mr. [JIM CLARK] held some exploratory talks with former Netscape Chief Executive Jim Barksdale, who founded the Barksdale Group venture-capital firm in 1999. Mr. Clark says the group invited him to become a partner and even held meetings with potential investors but he decided he would rather go it alone and bring others in. In April, he and Barksdale Group invested a combined $5 million into Neoteris for a 45% stake. Mr. Clark serves as chairman and Danny Rimer of Barksdale Group is the other outside director.  In contrast to Mr. Clark's earlier ventures, Neoteris is an exercise in frugality. The company created a commercial version of its product with just 25 people and plans to make the money last until the second quarter of next year. CEO Krishna "Kittu" Kolluri is an Silicon Graphics veteran who was the second employee at Healtheon.  Neoteris makes a computer box loaded with software that Mr. Kolluri says gives companies an easier way to let employees and partners securely access corporate networks using a standard Internet browser rather than loading special software onto laptops. Neoteris's systems compete with "virtual private networks" that create secure connections to corporate networks using the pipes of the public Internet, but generally require special software in both the corporate network and computers signing onto it.
