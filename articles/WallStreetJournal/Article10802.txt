 Marcos Sees History Remembering Him As 'Reforming President' of Philippines   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1985  MANILA, the Philippines -- His critics say that Ferdinand Marcos, in 20 years as president of the Philippines, has taken one of Asia's most promising developing nations and crushed its hopes, broken its once vibrant democracy, depressed a budding economy and broken the spirit of its people.  Mr. Marcos: I'll probably be remembered as the president who stayed on for 20 years -- because nobody else has been reelected. . . . I will probably be remembered as the president who radically restructured Philippine society and angered a lot of my old friends.  Mr. Marcos: I wouldn't say that, but let's assume that it is. But the truth of the matter is it's theoretical. . . . We feel that the greater bulk, 60% of the lower classes of our people, have received the bulk of growth while in the (other countries) it might be the upper classes. We feel that we are on the right track. We feel that our human resource development program is still the answer because now and in the years to come we will be facing the communist threat, whether I am the president or not. And the best answer to that is a strong entrepreneurship in the lower classes of our people. I am not saying that the other countries aren't conscious of this, but they aren't as conscious as we are.
