 Weighing the Results of Popular Diets; NIH-Funded Study Gives Atkins Slight Edge Over Zone, Ornish and Learn Programs   By Tara Parker-Pope and Jennifer Corbett Dooren, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2007  "Is this a vindication of [Atkins]? No, because they weren't really following Atkins," says Christopher D. Gardner, assistant professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the study's lead author. "But there's something to the low-carb thing that's intriguing. Cutting back drastically on simple carbohydrates -- the ones that have been adding up over all these years -- is clearly a step in the right direction to helping people lose weight."  The research represents one of the few well-designed diet studies that attempts to look at weight-loss efforts in the real world, where consumers flock to bookstores and read up on the latest diet fad. The researchers studied four diet books, meant to represent a range of approaches. "Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution" was the lowest- carbohydrate diet studied. "Enter the Zone," by Barry Sears also restricts carbs, but not as much as Atkins. The "Eat More, Weigh Less" plan by Dean Ornish drastically cuts fat, and "The LEARN Manual for Weight Management" is a higher-carb diet that essentially follows government health guidelines.  Nutritionists say the real message for dieters may actually be a simple one. Slashing carbs is a relatively easy concept to understand, and reducing the variety in your diet can also help you eat less. Even though the JAMA dieters didn't stick to the letter of the Atkins diet, the fact that they were trying to eliminate almost all carbs was helpful. "You have rules about what you can and can't eat," notes Dr. [Susan B. Roberts] of Tufts. "So you have a list and it is short -- the stimulus of being able to eat stuff is narrowed."
