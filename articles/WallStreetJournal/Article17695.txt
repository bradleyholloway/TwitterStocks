 Dollar Eases Against Most Units Despite Positive Economic Figures --- Statistics, Aides' Comments Only Narrow the Losses In a Still-Bearish Market   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1987  Dealers said trading, though active, was nervous and uncertain. Although market sentiment remained bearish for the dollar, traders were concerned that central banks may work together to break the currency's fall or that senior Western monetary officials will meet and decide on measures to bolster the unit.  In what traders said was a continuation of Monday's correction -- which followed last Friday's surge -- the U.S. currency fell in Tokyo trading yesterday and dropped further in Europe."This morning the dollar traded as if Friday had never happened," said Jack Kessler, a vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank. "The effect of the stronger-than-expected trade number was reversed."  The dollar then recovered slightly in late European and early New York trading yesterday following the release of strong U.S. economic statistics and a warning by a Swiss central bank official of possible coordinated central bank intervention to smooth markets and stem the dollar's decline.
