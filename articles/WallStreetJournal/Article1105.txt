 Enterprise: Small Beer Distributor's Santa Sets Off Dispute; St. Nick Labels Allowed By State Liquor Authority Following Challenge to Ban   By Lauren Tara LaCapra, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2006  Amy George, spokeswoman for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, says, "It's probably no surprise we think that using [Santa Claus] on a beer label is inappropriate and irresponsible. Santa Claus is for children's books; he's not for a beer label. And whether it's beer labels or alcohol advertising on television or magazines or products in store displays or whatever, we are against using images and icons like Santa Claus or animals or celebrities that appeal to youth."  When it comes to labeling, holiday beers aren't the only ones facing scrutiny. Shelton Brothers also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Portland, Maine, last week, on First Amendment grounds, because the state's liquor authority banned two beers with images of bare-breasted women on their labels. The agency classified them as "undignified and improper," which is against its approval regulations. In this case, the entrepreneurs will be represented by the Maine Civil Liberties Union.  Zachary Heiden, staff attorney for the MCLU, says the Sheltons have a strong First Amendment case, especially because similar labeling has been approved by Maine's liquor authority without a hitch. "We think art deserves the protection of the First Amendment whether it's hanging in a museum or on a beer label," says Mr. Heiden.
