 REIT Interest: Timing the Next Upswing for Retail   By By Dean Starkman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  That said, the stocks are cheap. Kimco notwithstanding, the sector badly lagged its peers during the 2000 run-up, gaining an average of about 18%, while office and apartments REITs each gained near 36%, and industrial REITs about 29%. Retail REIT shares trade near historic lows in terms of projected funds from operations, or FFO. The average regional-mall shares trade at about 6.8 times 2001 cash flow, well off the group's historic average of about 10 times cash flow. Larger strip-center REITs have experienced a similar contraction and now trade at about 8.5 times estimated 2001 FFO, according to Lee Schalop of Banc of America Securities, who is cautious about the sector in the near term.  Still, a couple of general principles are worth noting. For one, the Kimco experience shows investors will probably continue their flight to quality, as opposed to buying the cheapest shares. REITs with solid tenants that have good credit and long-term leases should weather a moderate recession with earnings remaining healthy. Also, REITs with strong balance sheets -- generally debt levels of 50% or less of total market capitalization -- should be buyers as their weaker rivals sell assets under pressure, providing another avenue for growth. Finally, mediocre malls should be among the hardest hit in a downturn.
