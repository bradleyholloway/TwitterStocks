 DMG Employees To Receive Stock As Part of Bonus   By By Patrick McGeehan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 1998  Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment-banking arm of Deutsche Bank, is preparing to surprise many of its U.S. employees by paying part of their 1997 bonuses in the German bank's stock, according to people familiar with the matter.  The moves by the German bank's U.S. securities unit and any possible fallout are being closely watched on Wall Street, where DMG and a few other European banks began driving up pay levels in 1995 and 1996 by bidding aggressively for top talent with offers of multiyear pay packages in an effort to build up their presence in the U.S. market. The question on their minds has been how long such generosity would last.  DMG managers are slated to tell employees early next week how big their bonuses for last year will be, an event known on Wall Street as "comp day." Year-end bonuses account for the bulk of the pay earned by the highest-paid investment bankers and traders.
