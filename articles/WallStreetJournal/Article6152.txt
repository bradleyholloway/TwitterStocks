 For Hemingway Fete In the Black Forest, The Sun Also Sets --- Tart Letters Leave Bad Taste In Mouth of German Town; `Look of Utter Stupidity'   By By Ian Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2002  Specifically, the group pressured Triberg to drop its "Hemingway Days," an annual summer festival dedicated to the author, who mentioned Triberg and other nearby Black Forest towns in his newspaper articles and in a famous short story, "The Snows of Kilimanjaro." The brainchild of Ms. [Renate Boekenkamp], the local official in charge of cultural matters who wanted to drum up a bit of tourism, the festival included [Ernest Hemingway] fishing (in nearby trout streams), Hemingway meals (smoked trout mousse, grilled trout and trout soup), Hemingway readings ("Fishing in Baden Perfect"), Hemingway films and an improbable writing competition that required participants to simplify German's complex sentence structure to match Hemingway's spare prose.  The action came over the summer in the form of a flier that proclaimed "Triberg Celebrates a Murderer," featuring a picture of Hemingway sporting a double-barreled shotgun. The back side announced, "Hemingway -- a War Criminal and Germany Hater," and cited letters that Hemingway wrote in which he boasted of having killed 122 Germans in World War II -- one of them an unarmed prisoner of war who pleaded for his life.  For many in Triberg, however, the events haven't erased Hemingway's presence in their lives. Mayor [Gallus Strobel] recently read through all of Hemingway's works. Ms. Boekenkamp learned some of his stories by heart. And Ms. [Dagmar Schneider-Damm] went on to win a national writing award, featuring the Hemingway style that she started using when she won last year's Hemingway writing competition: "Black walls. Black shadows. Black tunnel," she wrote. "The Black Forest is really black."
