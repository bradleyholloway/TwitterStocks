 Coming Soon to Your Car; Beleaguered Auto Makers Ramp Up Accessory Offerings; Color-Coordinated Wipers   By Jennifer Saranow and Gina Chon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2005  Products made by car makers often cost more than off-the-shelf versions. General Motors Corp.'s accessories typically cost about 10% to 15% more than those made by third-party suppliers. But GM, DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group and other companies that offer their own aftermarket products say third-party suppliers can't match car makers on issues like safety and integration.  Scosche Industries Inc.'s new Bluetooth Wireless Car Kits for iPods and MP3 players let you play the devices through your car's stereo while standing up to 30 feet away from your vehicle with music player in hand. The kits, which began shipping earlier this fall, run $199.99 for connectivity with aftermarket radios and $329.99 for connectivity for certain factory-installed radios.  MITO Corp., of Elkhart, Ind., also has a voice- activated Bluetooth kit called the TellPhone 4000. The product can hook up as many as four Bluetooth mobile phone connections and a graphic display shows Caller ID. It is priced at $419 and can be purchased on the company's Web site at www.mitocorp.com. For those who experience dropped calls or no network coverage, MITO is also offering the Call Capture, which boosts signal strengths by 10 times. It costs $279 and also can be purchased on MITO's Web site.
