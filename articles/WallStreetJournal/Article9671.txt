 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2004  Academics said Beijing's moves to deflate Hong Kong's democratic aspirations increase the likelihood that opposition lawmakers in Hong Kong will defeat candidates loyal to the Chinese government in September elections, setting the stage for potential gridlock between the legislature and Beijing's handpicked chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee Hwa.  As expected, the Standing Committee of China's Parliament yesterday passed a document requiring Hong Kong's chief executive to seek formal approval from Beijing before changes to the political system can be initiated. Hong Kong people are allowed to elect one-half of the city's 60 lawmakers; the chief executive is selected by an elite group of 800, most with connections to Beijing.  The parliament's legal-affairs committee recommended that parliament ask the European Court of Justice to review the legitimacy of the data-sharing accord. Also yesterday, the citizens' rights committee rejected the draft agreement between the EU and the U.S., following last week's vote by the full parliament calling the deal "inadequate."
