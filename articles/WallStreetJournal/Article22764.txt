 Budget Compromise Calls for 4.9% Spending Rise   By By Greg Hitt and Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2001  Under the agreement, spending for basic government services would grow to $666.8 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. That is higher than the 4% increase President Bush proposed in the budget request he sent to Congress in February, but well below the 8% endorsed by the Senate. The numbers were hammered out yesterday in negotiations among top Republicans on Capitol Hill, and hailed by Mr. Bush, who for the second straight day declared a budget victory at the White House.  Meanwhile, the House, by an overwhelming 407-24 vote, approved legislation to expand tax breaks for retirement savings accounts. The measure, the fourth tax bill approved this spring by the House, would gradually increase tax-exempt individual-retirement-account contributions to $5,000 from $2,000; increase the annual dollar limits on employee pension and 401(k) contributions, and allow employees aged 50 or older to "catch up" on pension contributions that they may have skipped when they were younger. It also makes regulatory changes to encourage more small businesses to offer such retirement plans.  At a quickly arranged White House meeting, Mr. Bush discussed the budget plan with GOP leaders and a handful of moderate Democrats who played key roles in deliberations on the final compromise. Among them was Louisiana Democrat John Breaux, who led a centrist coalition in the Senate that resisted Mr. Bush's first budget, and ultimately forced him to accept higher spending and a lower tax cut.
