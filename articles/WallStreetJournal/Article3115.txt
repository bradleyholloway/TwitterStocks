 Nestle Names Gut Of Credit Suisse As New Chairman   By By Margaret Studer, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1998  Credit Suisse Group Chairman Rainer E. Gut will succeed Helmut Maucher as chairman of Nestle SA, the food giant announced.  Meanwhile, Credit Suisse on Friday said its directors intend to propose Chief Executive Officer Lukas Muehlemann, 48, as Mr. Gut's successor as chairman. Mr. Muehlemann then would hold the position of both CEO and chairman.  Although Mr. Gut has been a member of the Nestle board since 1981, and vice chairman since 1991, an appointment as chairman was unexpected, analysts say. "Mr. Gut is a transition chairman," suggested Rene Weber, a food-industry analyst at Bank Vontobel. Mr. Gut can serve only four years, as Nestle has a compulsory retirement age of 72 for its chairman.
