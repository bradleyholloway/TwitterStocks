 Combing Gulf Coast, Faithful Secure Relics Of Battered Churches; Figures of Jesus, Mary, Joseph Provide Hope After Storm; Finding a Christ in a Tree   By Sataline, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  In Tallahassee, Ms. Aldridge's sister, Terri, placed the bust on her wood stove and clustered small crucifixes around it. A 48-year-old optometrist, Terri Aldridge hadn't practiced her faith for years. But in time, she says she started meditating by the bust of Jesus, staring at its parted lips and downcast eyes. It set her thinking about Christmas midnight Mass during her childhood, when the white-gloved altar boys had carried candles through the darkened church. "The spirit of that entire building is embodied in that head. It's like the church is sitting right there," she said, breaking into tears during a telephone interview. "It's damaged, but it's not gone."  After seeing the destruction of her St. Bernard Parish home, east of New Orleans, 60-year-old Lynn Adams ran next door to her church, Prince of Peace. She found the statue of Mary keeled over on a hassock, but otherwise fine, and moved it to her cousin's garage. "I'm not no holy roller, but I believe in signs, I do," Mrs. Adams says. The statue's survival proves God exists, she believes, and she said as much in a note she left in the statue's place: "He took care of His Mother."  The Aldridges weren't alone in sifting through the remains of Slidell's Our Lady of Lourdes. Hazarding collapsed beams and dangling stained-glass windows, Susan Daigle grabbed the Blessed Mother statue. On her way out, a hail of falling glass narrowly missed her, she says. She went back, scooped up a St. Joseph, and then scurried back again to snatch the St. Anthony, face-down in mud. "I do daring things," says Mrs. Daigle, 64. "But they're going to take care of me in the end!"
