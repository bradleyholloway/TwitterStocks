 Currency Trading: Canada's Finance Minister Is Fired by Premier   By By Joel Baglole, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2002  There is speculation that Mr. [Paul Martin] will now mount an open challenge to Mr. [Jean Chretien]'s leadership at a Liberal Party convention next February. Mr. Chretien's government has been plagued in recent weeks by allegations it awarded lucrative advertising contracts to companies that donated money to the Liberal Party. Last week, Mr. Chretien fired Defense Minister Art Eggleton after it was revealed he approved a lucrative government contract to a former girlfriend. Mr. Eggleton was replaced in the Defense post by former bank economist John McCallum.  On Friday evening, Mr. Martin had told reporters, "I'm going to have to reflect on my options," after Mr. Chretien said he plans to serve at least through the end of his current term in 2004 and threatened to fire any cabinet ministers who actively organize to succeed him. Mr. Martin has long been considered Mr. Chretien's likely successor. Mr. Martin has an active political organization and has made clear his desire for the top job. In 1990, Mr. Martin lost a bid to become leader of the Liberal Party to Mr. Chretien. Since then, the Canadian media has made much of the cool personal relationship between Mr. Chretein and Mr. Martin. People who work with Mr. Martin describe his relationship with Mr. Chretien as "professional."
