 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Plan B   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1990  The budgetary Noah's Ark that Dick Darman built doesn't look as if it's going to float. We hope someone in the environs of the Oval Office has a contingency plan for debarking.  The first vote on the deal was supposed to take place quickly yesterday. The congressional leadership, however, kept putting the vote off throughout the day, while White House operatives fanned out through the Capitol trying to press-gang Members to get on board Darman's Ark. In his speech the other night, Mr. Bush urged his listeners to call their Congressmen. They did, by all accounts producing a torrent of opinion against the deal and, we suspect, the dealers.
