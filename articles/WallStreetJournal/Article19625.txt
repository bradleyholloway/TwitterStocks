 SUVs for People Who Don't Want an SUV --- New Wave of `Crossover' Vehicles Targets Families Who Want the Space Without the Stigma   By By Sholnn Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  Crossovers are designed to blend the ride and handling of cars with the people- and cargo-carrying capacity of SUVs. A conventional SUV, such as a Chevrolet TrailBlazer, has a body bolted to a rigid truck frame. But crossovers are manufactured like cars -- with the floor, frame and upper body designed as a single unit. Typically, this leads to a lighter vehicle with a lower center of gravity, which makes it less likely to roll over. Still, government testing hasn't been done yet on many of the new crossovers.  Pushing crossovers will require some deft footwork from auto makers. The Big Three, and Japan's Toyota and Nissan, all plan to keep selling lots of large, truck-based SUVs. Of the 4.1 million SUVs sold last year, 3.4 million were based on trucks, according to industry consultant Art Spinella of CNW Marketing Research Inc. in Bandon, Ore.  Women, Mr. Spinella says, deserve much of the credit for this shift. In the 1990s, they began switching their families to SUVs from minivans. But many were unhappy with the harsh ride and concerned by growing questions about the safety of truck-based SUVs. Auto makers read the trends, and began putting more effort into crossovers. "It became critical to get the truck ride out of there," Mr. Spinella says.
