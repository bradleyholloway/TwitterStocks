 Bulls Fear Rising Rates May Persist --- Growth and Spending Keep Up the Pressure On Long-Term Yields   By Vogelstein, Fred, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1996  They're not pushing their views with a lot of confidence these days. "We've had to capitulate and say that the economy in the first quarter was stronger than expected" says senior economist Nancy Lazar, adding that "we're definitely still on the defensive."  General Motors Acceptance Corp., however, turned on a dime during the morning's short Treasury rally to offer a $500 million notes issue. It was Friday's sole public bond pricing. The GMAC notes, rated single-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and single-A-minus by Standard & Poor's, were priced as noncallable 7.125s of 2003 at 99.489 to yield 7.219%, a spread of half a percentage point above Treasurys. This week's calendar looks fuller. Hilton Hotels may sell a $500 million offering of 10-year convertible subordinated notes, through Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. Price talk was set Friday for a coupon of between 4.25% and 4.75% and a conversion premium of between 24% and 26%, according to MCM CorporateWatch.  Among next week's largest competitive deals are two from Minnesota. The state will sell $210 million in general obligation bonds on Tuesday, followed by $200 million in revenue bonds on Thursday. Late Friday, the state's GOs were upgraded to triple-A by Moody's, which cited the state's sound fiscal planning and moderate debt. The GOs are rated double-A-plus by S&P.
