 Barron's Insight: World Keeps Sippin' Mash From Brown-Forman Stills   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  Long-term investors in Brown-Forman have benefited from the growth of Jack Daniel's, which accounts for about two-thirds of the company's profit. Brown-Forman's class B nonvoting stock (BFB), however, has struggled in the past year, falling below $65 after Tuesday's global stock-market selloff from a record $82 in March 2006, and badly trailing the shares of the world's two largest liquor companies, Britain's Diageo and France's Pernod-Ricard.
