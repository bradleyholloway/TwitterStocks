 REIT Deals Stay Hot but Shares May Be Peaking   By Haughney, Christine, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  "You tend to see a lot of merger activity at the tops and bottoms of market cycles," says Ross Nussbaum, a Banc of America Securities REIT analyst.  Industry experts say that these shopping sprees recall investors' last infatuation. "It's been a little bit like what happened in the 1990s in the tech boom," says Peter Baccile, global head of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s real-estate investment banking group "There was a lot of money that wanted to get invested and values started to take off."  The vast amount of capital chasing real estate is the key driver behind the REIT deals. For private firms that invest for pension funds, endowments and high-net-worth individuals, buying a REIT is the most efficient way to quickly build a real-estate portfolio.
