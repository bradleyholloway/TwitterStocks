 Hughes's Krekel Is Named Boeing Satellite Chief   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2000  In an interview earlier this week, Mr. [Tig Krekel] disclosed that talks are under way to expand joint ventures and teaming arrangements with leading European satellite firms "to give us a larger footprint" in that part of the world. Though he wasn't specific, France's Alcatel SA and Astrium, a combination of the space business of DaimlerChrysler's DASA aerospace unit with the Franco-British joint venture Matra Marconi Space, are among those Hughes has in mind, according to industry officials. Barely a few years ago, such moves would have been considered anathema to longtime Hughes managers. "The Hughes culture was to stand alone and do all things for all people," Mr. Krekel says.
