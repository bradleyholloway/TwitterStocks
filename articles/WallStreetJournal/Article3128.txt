 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / NORTHWEST --- Economic Focus: Builder's Victory in Suit Has Come at a High Price   By By Rob Eure, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1998  Two years ago, Hillsboro general contractor Floyd Erwin won a jury award of $982.02 in a contract dispute. But because he had refused to settle the case, Mr. Erwin walked out of court owing his lawyer more than $21,000.  How's that? It's a question plaintiffs' lawyers and home builders in Oregon are asking after the state Court of Appeals ruled that Mr. Erwin was responsible for part of his lawyer's fees because he was the reason the case went to trial. They say the ruling essentially abolishes in contract cases the ages-old common law proviso of "loser pays."  At the time, the Tetreaults still owed Mr. Erwin $7,367.02, and they refused to pay. In February 1995, Mr. Erwin sued them in Washington County Circuit Court in Beaverton, claiming breach of contract. The Tetreaults countersued, saying the builder's work was inadequate and that they had already paid for materials that were never used. They asked for $21,948 in actual and punitive damages.
