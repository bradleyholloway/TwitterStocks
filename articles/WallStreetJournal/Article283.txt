 White Knight Unlikely in Olivetti Fight --- Bankers See Two Options For Telecom Italia: Surrender or Restructure   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Gautam Naik and Anita Raghavan in London and Thomas Kamm in Milan., The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1999  That leaves Telecom Italia with two choices: accept Olivetti's $58 billion hostile bid or massively restructure itself to fend off Olivetti.  Mr. (Franco) Bernabe's moves appear to have some resonance with investors. Yesterday, Telecom's stock climbed 5.2% to 10.06 euros ($11.07) in Milan, slightly above the 10 euros offered by Olivetti. "The sleeping giant has been awoken," one Wall Street trader said. "Olivetti is forcing Bernabe to do what he wants to do, and that is why I think the stock is trading better."  British Telecom is cool to rescuing Telecom Italia from the hands of Olivetti, people familiar with the situation say. Mr. Bernabe called Sir Peter Bonfield, chief executive officer of BT, last Friday, said one person familiar with the situation. But Sir Peter said he wasn't considering emerging as a possible white knight. Mr. Bernabe knows Sir Peter well; the Italian executive used to run energy concern ENI SpA, which holds shares in BT's small Italian telecommunications venture.
