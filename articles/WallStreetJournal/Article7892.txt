 Stop National Service Before It Starts   By By George Roche, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1989  The plan stirring most interest is one first put forth a year ago by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.). His proposal, supported by the Democratic Leadership Council and co-sponsored by Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), would provide a $100-a-week stipend and a $10,000-a-year tuition credit voucher for young people aged 18 to 26 who join a proposed Citizens Corps for two years, or serve in the armed forces at a special reduced pay rate.  Sen. Nunn made a big push for the Citizens Corps at last year's Democratic convention in Atlanta, and he has been trying to build broad support for it ever since. He figures the plan has something to appeal to everyone: Conservatives should delight in seeing young people out hustling for their college money, instead of floating on student loans that too many never repay. Liberals should revel in the large numbers of idealistic youths (as many as 800,000, Sen. Nunn estimates) performing social-service work.  There are other objections to the measure, however, that are more worthy of contemplation. Pentagon planners worry about the impact on recruitments and re-enlistments. The all-volunteer military has proved a popular and effective route to higher education and civilian career training, especially for working-class and minority youths. Competition from a Citizens Corps could drain an already shrinking pool of service-age young people. And the military-service option in the Nunn-McCurdy bill would create a two-tiered system. Enlistees serving under the plan would put in only two years, instead of the three-year or four-year stints that make for better manpower stability and allow the services to get a fuller pay-back from the training and resources invested in enlisted personnel.
