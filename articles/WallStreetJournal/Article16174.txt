 More Hot Air on Kyoto   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2002  The good news in all this is that the Administration truly appears determined to stay out of Kyoto. "The Kyoto treaty would severely damage the United States economy, and I don't accept that," Mr. [Bush] said yesterday. Though you'd never know it from the media reports, the most important part of the EPA tome was that it dared to say the great unsaid: Even if you do believe in global warming, there's only so much that can be done. In other words, Kyoto won't help.  He has been making the rounds with the nearby graph, which shows changes in the world's temperature -- both with Kyoto and without -- over the next 100 years. The graph, the work of a noted global-warming researcher, shows that if nations religiously follow the treaty, we will see an expected increase of temperature of 1.92 degrees Celsius by 2100. If we don't follow Kyoto, we will get hit by the same increase by 2094. In otherwords, Kyoto saves us six whole years.
