 Pentagon Slows Its Push for a More Lax Interpretation of the 1972 ABM Treaty   By By Tim Carrington and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1987  The Pentagon is slowing its push for a more lax interpretation of the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, which limits testing and development of anti-missile systems.  In a meeting with Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and other lawmakers, Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle said the Pentagon will make sure its anti-missile activities are in keeping with a narrow interpretation of the agreement pending a new State Department legal assessment of the broader interpretation. The State Department analysis won't be completed until May, officials said.  The State Department will analyze the ABM treaty from two vantage points. It will consider whether the Senate ratified the treaty in 1972 based on an understanding that the narrower interpretation would prevail. In addition, the analysis will focus on statements and actions by the U.S. and the Soviet Union since 1972 that would reflect the original intent of the treaty.
