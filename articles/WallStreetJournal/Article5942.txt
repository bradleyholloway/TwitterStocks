 Letters to the Editor: Microsoft's Predatory Practices   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  Predation can succeed when a very wealthy predator need spend no more than a much less wealthy prey during the warfare. Hence predation by sham litigation has been shown to succeed. By pricing its browser at zero, thus requiring Netscape to do the same, Microsoft cut off Netscape's revenues and forced it to match Microsoft's fixed costs of research and development. Netscape's browser could not survive in that environment. That tactic was spelled out in Microsoft's internal documents and proved entirely successful: by November 1998, Netscape's once highly profitable browser business was valued at zero.  The Microsoft case is not about "unfair competition" or "market dominance." It is about a carefully planned and executed campaign of predation to prevent equally or more efficient firms from mounting a challenge to the operating system monopoly. Microsoft's browser did not become better than Netscape's until the latter's revenues were cut off so that it could no longer compete in research and development. It may be that the courts will ultimately rule for Microsoft, but courts have made antitrust mistakes before; this would be another, and a particularly egregious, anti-consumer one at that.
