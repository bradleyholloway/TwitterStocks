 Theater: Peter Stein, Straight Shooter   By Kaufman, Joanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2010  Mr. Stein, 72, is known as much for high-toned theatrical marathons as for the highly charged productions -- "Saved," "Vietnam-Discourse," "The Mother," "Torquato Tasso," "The Changeling" -- that established him 40 years ago as Germany's pre-eminent postwar stage director. "Fifty years later, I got the proposition of the artistic director of a theater in Turin to do 'Les Possedes,'" he continued, referring to the Camus drama based on "The Demons," Dostoyevsky's story of ideological mayhem and murder in prerevolutionary Russia.
