 Television: Holidays and the Huxtables   By By Martha Bayles, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1987  This year Christmas Eve comes on Thursday, which means that many Americans will be separated from their loved ones, namely the perfect Huxtable family on "The Cosby Show," and united with semistrangers, namely the imperfect relatives who insist on stopping by for eggnog or, worse, visiting from Cincinnati. Youngsters will find it particularly onerous to forgo the blissful passivity of being entertained by Bill Cosby in order to make conversation with this or that unprepossessing uncle who refuses to make clownish faces or crack wry jokes about the onset of puberty. The Huxtables on "Cosby," the Keatons on "Family Ties," the Seavers on "Growing Pains," the Witherspoons on "Our House" -- TV barrages us with so many seemingly perfect families that we end up feeling depressed about our own.  It's not as if the producers of these shows are unaware that the American family is in trouble. They pay attention when critics cite the grim statistics of divorce and instability. Yet they sometimes use these statistics to justify their shows' lack of realism. The argument is similar to that made by less high-minded Hollywood types justifying the use of sex in the AIDS era. The threat of AIDS may dampen the public's erotic adventurism, this argument goes, but that is only a reason to put more, not less, titillation on the screen. If audiences can't experience the real thing, then their appetite will be all the keener for vicarious thrills. In similar fashion, the producers of idealized family shows occasionally argue that stress and conflict in the real world create a craving for vicarious calm and harmony.
