 Cell Transplant May Help Undo Stroke's Effects   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  Doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said they have performed the first transplant of human nerve cells into a patient's brain in an effort to reverse paralysis and other effects of stroke.  The procedure involves a novel technique for manufacturing human neurons. If it proves safe and effective, researchers say it could set the stage for new treatments not only of the debilitating effects of stroke, but also of other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and spinal-cord injury.  The doctors, led by Douglas Kondziolka, a neurosurgeon at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, injected some two million neurons through a tiny opening in the skull of a 62-year-old woman who had suffered a severe stroke last fall. The patient, who is now undergoing traditional rehabilitation for paralysis and speech problems, will be closely monitored for several months for both side effects and possible improvements from the therapy. Eleven more patients are expected to be treated over the next few months in the first stage of the experiment.
