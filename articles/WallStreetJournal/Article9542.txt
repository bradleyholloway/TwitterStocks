 Leading the News: Vivendi's Record Loss Reflects Write-Down of Media Assets   By By John Carreyrou, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2003  Despite the larger-than-expected loss, Vivendi made headway in tackling the biggest issue dogging it: the massive debt load inherited from the serial dealmaking of its former chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, who was ousted last July. Vivendi projected that, at the end of March, its net debt would be 15.1 billion euros, nearly 4 billion euros less than when Mr. [Jean-Rene Fourtou], a former pharmaceuticals-industry executive, took over from Mr. Messier last summer.  Mr. Fourtou said Vivendi would continue to sell assets at a brisk pace to get its debt down. He said the company aimed to sell a further 7 billion euros in assets this year, on top of the 8 billion euros worth of sales it has made since July. On the entertainment front, Mr. Fourtou confirmed meeting Sumner Redstone, chairman and CEO of Viacom Inc., last week in Los Angeles to talk about Viacom's potential interest in buying parts of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, or VUE. "He's not the only one I saw, and he's not the only one I'm going to see," Mr. Fourtou said.  Mr. Fourtou appears to be leaning away from selling Universal Music Group this year because he doesn't think he can get a fair price for the unit until concerns over music piracy diminish, according to the people familiar with the matter. Frustrated at the delay, Mr. [Marvin Davis] has threatened to withdraw his offer, which also includes the assumption of $5 billion of debt, if Vivendi doesn't open exclusive negotiations with him. A person familiar with the matter said that Mr. Davis didn't hear from Vivendi after yesterday's board meeting, and remains interested in pursuing a deal despite his earlier threat.
