 Pressure Builds for Cleanup of Closed Plants --- New Jersey Pollution Law Stirs Interest in Other States   By By Barry Meier, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1985  Closing a factory may take longer than opening one -- as Witco Chemical Corp. has discovered. The company has lined up a buyer for a chemical plant in New Jersey that ceased operations in 1983, but the state has blocked the sale until Witco assures that any pollution on the property will be cleaned up.  Cleanup bills are adding significantly to the cost of closing a plant. Ford Motor Co. recently agreed to pay at least $4.3 million to remedy groundwater contamination and other pollution at a car assembly plant in Mahwah, N.J., that was closed in 1981. Estimates of cleanup costs stemming from the closure of Allied Corp. chemical plants in Baltimore and Syracuse, N.Y., are in the "millions of dollars," Allied says.  "Companies are much more concerned today about avoiding future liabilities" from toxic substances at closed plants, says H. Richard Seibert, vice president for resources and technology for the National Association of Manufacturers. Mr. Seibert also thinks cleanup costs at such plants will rise, particularly for those where toxic-waste disposal units were operated.
