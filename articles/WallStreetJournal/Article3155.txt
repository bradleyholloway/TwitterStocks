 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  Q. I am a retired senior executive. I have always had a secretary, and do not type well. I earn my living today as a public speaker. I installed Dragon's NaturallySpeaking software on my Compaq Presario laptop (which appears to meet the specs required by Dragon) and spent hours trying to get the software to recognize my voice. I can't seem to get above an 80% recognition level, though I have been told I have excellent diction. I read recently that the densely packaged internal architecture of my Compaq laptop is the source of my problem. Is this the problem? And if so, is there an inexpensive ($500-$700) desktop computer that would work well with Dragon?  A.Dragon NaturallySpeaking really does work, for most people most of the time, at much better than an 80% recognition level. However, like all speech-recognition software, its performance is affected not only by the speaker's voice, but also by environmental noise, the speed and capacity of the computer, and -- most of all -- by the quality of the computer's sound card and microphone. I can't say for sure what your problem is, but I doubt it is merely the fact that you're using a laptop and not a desktop. I've used the program successfully on two different laptops, as well as several desktops. And Dragon's Web site (www.dragonsystems.com) lists a whole bunch of laptops on which it's known to work well with the right microphone, including one of the Compaq Presario models.
