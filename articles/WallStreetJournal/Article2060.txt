 Recognition Equipment Wins Acquittal   By By Karen Blumenthal and Joan Lebow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1989  Mr. Voss pleaded guilty in 1986 to accepting illegal gratuities from the consulting firm Gnau & Associates. John Gnau, president of the firm, pleaded guilty in 1986 to participating in the scheme, as did another Gnau employee in 1987.  Recognition, a Dallas maker of data management equipment, hired Gnau & Associates in 1985 to help it win Postal Service contracts at Mr. Voss's recommendation. But the judge said in his opinion that "there is a complete lack of evidence to suggest that the defendants knew of the illegal payoff scheme" between Gnau and Mr. Voss.  The judge also said he didn't find evidence that the company engaged in a conspiracy or in illegal behavior to try to change Postal Service personnel and, in particular, to push for the firing of former Postmaster General Paul Carlin. Although Recognition was openly critical of Mr. Carlin and other postal service employees for opposing the purchase of Recognition's equipment, the judge said, the company was "entitled to tell the world" that it disagreed with the Postal Service's views.
