 Tech Watch: Before You Pick a Web Phone Service. . .   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2006  Most providers charge a flat monthly subscription fee depending on how much local and long-distance calling time is included. Vonage's Basic 500 plan costs $14.99 a month for 500 local and long-distance minutes. Incoming calls and those to other Vonage customers don't count and are free, and extra minutes each cost 3.9 cents. Vonage also has a $24.99 plan with unlimited minutes.  People who use a home phone very little might consider cheaper options such as SunRocket's $9.95 monthly plan, which includes 200 minutes and free incoming calls. Willing to talk over your computer? Skype, a unit of eBay, offers a PC-to-phone service that costs an average of 2 cents a minute for outgoing calls to anywhere in the world, with no monthly subscription fee.  Most subscription plans bundle together local and long-distance calls. But if you mostly call regionally or locally, you may be able to find better deals. AT&T's CallVantage offers a $19.99 monthly plan with unlimited local calling; it charges an added 4 cents a minute for long distance.
