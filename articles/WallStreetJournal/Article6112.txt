 Detasseling Corn Is An Unforgettable Job For Farm-State Kids --- Twenty Days of Labor Builds Character, Parents Think; Alas, the Tradition Wanes   By By Ellen Byron, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 9, 2002  Corn detasseling is the crucial last step in producing hybrid corn seed. It involves removing the pollen-producing top part of the plant, the tassel, so the corn can't pollinate itself. Instead, pollen from another variety of corn grown in the same field is carried by the wind, pollinating the detasseled corn. The result is corn that bears the genetic characteristics of both varieties and can produce healthier crops with higher yields. Despite technological advances in agriculture, detasseling is still a task that for the most part is done by hand.  The tradition of detasseling could be coming to an end. Seed companies are developing ways to make wider use of what's called "male-sterile corn" -- corn whose tassel doesn't produce pollen, thereby eliminating the need for detasselers. It's planted next to a corn variety that is able to pollinate, so cross-pollination can be achieved more efficiently.  Mothers of corn detasselers are sometimes known as "corn moms," according to Deborah Sloup, whose three children -- now 15, 18 and 20 -- have grown up detasseling in Seward. Two of them just completed another season. "A corn mom cheerfully gets up at 4 a.m. and makes sure everybody gets out of bed. I always make their lunches, and I always pack their favorite food because they've earned it. When they come home, I tell them to just drop their stuff outside, and I take care of it. I spray everything with a hose first, to get the mud off. At night I give a lot of tea and sympathy -- and a lot of back rubs."
