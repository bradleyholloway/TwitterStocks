 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Focused   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1992  There is little feeling in the land that the electorate is struggling with a profusion of grand options. We heard one thoughtful caller to C-SPAN yesterday attempt to build an acceptable candidate from the better parts of the three. Alas, the presidency is no Barbie doll; under our system, you have to choose one of the above or stay home (or limit your day to throwing the congressional bums out).  Amid the disaffection of the current election, though, we find a phenomenon that bodes well for the future. The public is very interested in this election. Unusually so. We suspect, moreover, that this intensity of interest extends beyond a single presidential election, that in fact the American people are doing some hard thinking about what has become of their country and where they want it to go.  We wouldn't have guessed that any such intensity of interest existed back during the primaries. Turnout in many states, especially for the Democratic primaries, was low, suggesting that voters were turned off by the choices being offered. What became apparent over time was that most Americans were following this election intently. The poorer the choices, it seemed, the higher the interest.
