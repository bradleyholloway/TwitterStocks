 The Middle Seat: FAA Spreads Flight Delays More Widely; In Busy Summer of Bad Weather, Program to Reduce Bottlenecks Achieves Mixed Results So Far   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2004  Some airlines say the new system has improved flying -- for them. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines often squawked because O'Hare flights were slowed but Chicago Midway flights were not. But now they see other airlines suffering along with them. "It's working reasonably well," says Robert Reding, American's senior vice president of technical operations.  Long Delays  Despite FAA efforts to shorten delays, the air-travel system hasn't gotten any speedier.
