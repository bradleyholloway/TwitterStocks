 U.K. Tech Firms Ease Ties to Cambridge   By By David Pringle, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2001  In an office adorned with aerial photographs showing expanses of green space in and around Cambridge, Simon Meecham, the city council's principal economic policy officer, recognizes that many companies seeking to expand in Cambridge want to stay near the university and the city's commercial research labs because they value the interaction among technology experts. Some companies also want the status of a Cambridge postal code and telephone number.  Consider three of the area's best-known companies: software firm Autonomy PLC, chip designer ARM Holdings PLC and communications equipment developer Virata Corp. -- now collectively valued at more than $10 billion. Autonomy now has dual headquarters, in Cambridge and San Francisco, and its chief executive spends more than half of his time in the U.S. Virata has gone further, reincorporating in the U.S. in 1999 following a listing on Nasdaq. ARM's CEO, Robin Saxby, is based more than 100 miles away, near London's Heathrow Airport.
