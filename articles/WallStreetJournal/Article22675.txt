 Fannie Mae Sells $11.5 Billion in Bonds, Fueling Its Efforts to Become Benchmark   By By Gregory Zuckerman and Patrick Barta, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2000  Still, market observers note that the spreads between Fannie Mae securities and 10-year Treasurys are still around one percentage point above comparable Treasurys, much wider than the 0.60 point seen at the beginning of the year, forcing Fannie Mae to pay more when selling bonds.  Meanwhile, the size of the sale highlighted what many critics have been saying for months-that Fannie Mae and its smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, are taking on enormous amounts of debt. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, another similar government-sponsored enterprise, are on a pace to surpass the U.S. Treasury in debt outstanding by as early as 2003, while Fannie Mae alone has seen its debt grow to about $579 billion, compared with about $123 billion a decade ago.  While the controversy surrounding Fannie Mae's future has forced the agency to pay higher rates to sell its bonds, Fannie Mae's plan to regularly sell big bond deals seems to be working, helping to offset some of the pressure on rates. Investors said they were eager to buy Fannie Mae's bonds because they are liquid, or easy to trade, in part thanks to the benchmark program, and now serve as a guidepost for all bond investors.
