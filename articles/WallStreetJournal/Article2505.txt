 Budweiser Hopes Fall Classic Blitz Replicates Success of Bud Bowl   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 1993  Budweiser raised beer sales in January, the slowest month to move the sudsy product off the shelf, thanks in large part to the quirky advertising of the Bud Bowl: In commercials during the Super Bowl, longneck bottles of the brew come to life and compete in a Super Bowl of their own.  Not to worry. Anheuser-Busch isn't going to subject baseball fans throughout the land to an infuriating Bud Series with battling bottles. Instead, "we're taking the Bud Bowl formula and turning October and the Series into a major media event," says Michael Owens, marketing director of Budweiser. "We want to drive consumers to retail stores and drive them to watch the World Series. We've been looking for something to build around the season."  "It's becoming kind of a drag," says David Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard. "Enough already." Mr. Vadehra says the plunge in the Bud Bowl popularity should be more worrisome to Budweiser since it is broadcast only once a year and obviously doesn't become annoying by mere repetition like other ads, such as the Duracell bunny spots. "Even once every 12 months is too much for the Bud Bowl," he says.
