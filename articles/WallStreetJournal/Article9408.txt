 E.ON Leads Revival of Europe's Utilities --- Once Takeover Fodder, It's Now on the Prowl For Acquisitions Itself   By By Neal E. Boudette, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2002  After the merger, Mr. [Ulrich Hartmann] and other E.ON executives came to a pivotal conclusion, say people familiar with the matter. Enron traded energy among thousands of small U.S. utilities that needed to meet demand spikes or hedge risk. But in Europe, deregulation was leaving one or two national champions in each country, each with a large energy supply. In this environment, E.ON concluded, acquiring assets, not emulating Enron, was the way to go.  Mr. [Ed Wallis] eventually came back for serious talks, and Mr. Hartmann's offer of a 25% premium above PowerGen's share price clinched a deal. Mr. Wallis "closed his eyes for a moment, then said, `We have a deal,' " Mr. Hartmann recalls. A few days later, Mr. Hartmann flew to Kentucky, and told LG&E managers that their company would lead a grand expansion in the U.S. funded by E.ON's deep pockets.  To meet a U.S. requirement that regulated utilities have few operations outside electricity or gas, E.ON announced an asset swap in July: Aral for BP's Ruhrgas stake. In December, as Enron was collapsing, U.S. regulators approved the LG&E deal, clearing E.ON to start scanning the U.S. for new targets.
