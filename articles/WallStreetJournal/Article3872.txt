 Maryland's Medmal Mess   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2004  Medmal isn't a stand-alone problem. It's part of Mr. [Robert Ehrlich]'s effort to revive Maryland as a state friendly to business and job creation. Since he was elected two years ago, Maryland's unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9%, one of the country's lowest. Some 50,000 new jobs have been created, including at Dreyer's Ice Cream, American Woodmark Manufacturing and other businesses that moved in or expanded in the state. Mr. Ehrlich has trimmed state employees by 7% and held back huge new state spending in all areas except education.  The Maryland medmal reform has a reasonably good chance of passing next week. It's been helped by a grassroots campaign that grew out of rallies Mr. Ehrlich held with doctors around the state. It's a sad commentary that a medical crisis has to push the system to the brink before it responds. Let's hope Maryland's legislature has the good sense to save its health-care system before the lawyers tear it down.
