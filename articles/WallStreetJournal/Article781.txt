 Intel, Advanced Micro Post Big Losses For 2nd Quarter; Motorola Doubles Net   By By Brenton R. Schlender, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1986  Two major semiconductor companies posted big second-quarter losses, while a third computer chip maker more than doubled its profit in the period. The industry's leading indicator slipped for the second month in a row.  The losses at Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., as well as lackluster quarterly sales at the two companies, signal an early arrival of the industry's customary summer doldrums.  As W.J. Sanders III, Advanced Micro's president and chief executive officer, put it, the "summer slowdown and the absence of any significant signs of improvement in demand from the computer sector indicate a postponement of recovery for the semiconductor industry."
