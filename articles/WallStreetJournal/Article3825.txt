"Right now, the market would rather see companies use cash for buybacks than put the cash in an investment that may or may not return something to you," says Teun Draaisma, a market strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. "In the late 1990s, investors took buybacks as a sign of defeat. The thinking was, 'If you need to buy back shares, you don't have anything else to do with the money and it must be bad news.' But now share buybacks are seen as a healthy sign."
