 Keefe Bruyette's Chairman and Founder Quits in Dispute Over Sale of Division   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1989  In a clash with associates over the future of the securities business, Harry V. Keefe Jr. resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a closely held securities firm that specializes in bank and thrift stocks.  Mr. Keefe, 66 years old, who in 1962 founded the firm that prides itself as "the house that banking built," stepped down after his partners overrode him and sold the firm's Keefe BankWatch division, which rates bank and thrift obligations for investors, to International Thomson Publishing Corp. for an undisclosed price last month.  To succeed Mr. Keefe, the firm elevated Gene F. Bruyette to chairman from vice chairman.
