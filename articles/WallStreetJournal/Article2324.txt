 Illinois and Chicago Pick Tentative Site For Proposed Airport   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1992  The state of Illinois signed a pact with the city tentatively choosing a proposed far South Side site for an airport that would be larger than O'Hare International, the world's busiest airport.  Under the proposal, the airport -- the Chicago area's third -- would be built in the Lake Calumet area, in parts of two Illinois suburbs and a section of Hammond, Ind. The airport would be 14 miles from the Loop, Chicago's downtown business area. O'Hare is 15 miles from the Loop, and Chicago's Midway Airport is eight miles from it.
