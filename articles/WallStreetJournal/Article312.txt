 The Americas: What Will One Billion American Dollars Buy in Colombia?   By By Mary Anastasia O'Grady, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2000  As it happens, Bill Clinton will visit Cartagena Wednesday to reinforce U.S. support for Plan Colombia, Mr. [Andres Pastrana]'s latest proposal to right the country from both civil war and severe recession. But the U.S. aid package will neither beef up direct guerrilla-fighting efforts nor support economic reform. Instead, $1 billion is targeted at wiping out coca growing, with another $300 million going to other countries in the region for similar purposes. Colombia will receive 60 helicopters with a qualification that they may not be used to fight communist insurgents. Other uses of the money include programs to foster crop substitution and infrastructure development.  In the 20 years since the global cocaine business began to boom, this is the most misguided idea that drug warriors have yet devised. It ignores economic fundamentals and won't end the supply of cocaine to U.S. users. Moreover, its severe restrictions on helping institutionally fragile Colombia build a strong, professional military mean U.S. aid will not support restoration of a rule of law. Further, there is no requirement for Colombia to radically liberalize its economy, the key first step toward easing social unrest. Faster economic growth would enhance the popularity of Mr. Pastrana, giving him greater power to make deep institutional reforms.  Washington could influence Colombia in reaching these economic goals. An offer of open access to U.S. markets, for example, would go a long way toward persuading the Colombian Congress to support its own trade liberalization. To take a cynical view, the $1 billion would be better spent buying off protectionist congressmen and the interests they represent in both Colombia and the U.S.
