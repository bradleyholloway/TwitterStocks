 Asian Markets Continue to Rally; Four Indexes Set Records; Nikkei Hits Seven-Year High   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2007  "It's very bullish across emerging markets," said Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong. "It's not just a local phenomenon."  In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index gained 1.3%, or 285.69, amid near- record volume to 22817.43, its fifth straight record close, as investors focused on stocks that had lagged behind recent gains in the market. The index has risen 4.8% in a week. Conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa jumped 4.1% to a six-year high, building on Friday's 6.3% advance, as analysts said prospects of the company's third-generation mobile operations are brightening. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, operator of the local market, bolted 7.2% to a record, helped by the recent massive volume.  In MUMBAI, India's benchmark share index also closed at a sixth straight record as it settled above 15000 for the first time. The 30- share Sensex rose 0.6%, or 81.61, to 15045.73. The index has risen 2.7% so far this month. Export-driven software-services firms such as Infosys Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services extended gains even as some analysts expected them to report that their earnings were hit by the rupee's rise of almost 7% against the dollar in the just-ended quarter.
