 Atkins, Executive Plead Innocent In Tax-Fraud Case   By By William Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1987  Tax-shelter promoter Charles A. Atkins and Ernest M. Grunebaum, a top executive at Yamaichi International (America) Inc., pleaded innocent in a tax-fraud case involving more than $350 million in allegedly false deductions.  The two men were indicted March 25 along with a third man, lawyer William S. Hack. The indictment charged the three with participating in several tax-shelter operations -- called the Securities Groups -- that generated $1.3 billion in fictitious losses in government-securities trades from 1978 to 1983.  Messrs. Atkins and Grunebaum, who is a senior executive vice president at New York-based Yamaichi International (America), entered their pleas before U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa yesterday. The judge released each man on a $100,000 bond pending trial.
