 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2003  A number of businesspeople were implicated, including Mr. [Zhou]'s wife, who was charged Monday by investigators in Hong Kong with conspiracy and other violations. Bank of China's top Hong Kong official, Liu Jinbao, also was recalled to Beijing this year for his actions in releasing $226 million in loans to Mr. Zhou. A prominent Shanghai lawyer, Zheng Enchong, was jailed for three years in October on charges that human-rights groups say followed his efforts to sue Mr. Zhou for corruption on behalf of homeowners.  At a news conference, Takefuji President Akira Kiyokawa described the chairman's arrest as "a bolt out of the blue" and said his boss wasn't involved in the alleged wrongdoing. Mr. Kiyokawa said former Takefuji employees, not [Takefuji] itself or Mr. [Yasuo Takei], were involved in the wiretapping. Mr. Kiyokawa said he couldn't comment in any detail as the police investigation was still continuing. The company will fully cooperate with police, he said.  Ms. [Elba Esther Gordillo] also carries weight in the party based on her roots and influence in the national teachers' union, a key element in many of the party's electoral campaigns. Leaders of that union have suggested they might even quit the PRI over the Gordillo dispute.
