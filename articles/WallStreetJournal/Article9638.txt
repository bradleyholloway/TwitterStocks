 Gains Continue; ExpressJet Rises   By Schreiber, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2004  Small stocks outpaced the blue-chip stocks for most of the session following a drop in monthly factory orders and a disappointing report on services-sector growth. But the early gains waned toward the end of trading and the Russell 2000 rose just 0.97, or 0.17%, to 569.89, which still was enough for a 45-month high. The Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index shed 0.70, or 0.26%, to 273.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index of large-cap and small-cap stocks gained 10.01, or 0.49%, to 2057.37.  As the new year begins, some money managers said they are focusing more on large companies than on small ones, mainly because big-cap stocks didn't participate as much in the market's rally last year and therefore are relatively less expensive than small caps. Nonetheless, stocks both large and small could have a good year as the economy continues to gather strength.  "I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water on small caps, but I would certainly not expect small caps to outperform large caps this year," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. in Boston.
