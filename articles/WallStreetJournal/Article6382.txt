 Should Access to Medical Research Be Free?   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2004  Bringing quality science to the public is a laudable goal, but the government and scholarly publishers alike must be careful ("Journals Resist Free Access to Medical Data," Oct. 28). The National Institutes for Health proposal for free access to research articles should be carefully studied for its potential effect on the quality and quantity of research and the possibility of unintended consequences. For example, the push could shutter many scholarly journals that operate on the edge of profitability or at a loss, underwritten by organizations like mine that believe in and invest in knowledge dissemination to advance science and for the public good. A decrease in the number of dissemination outlets available to researchers would decrease the exchange of science information rather than increase it.
