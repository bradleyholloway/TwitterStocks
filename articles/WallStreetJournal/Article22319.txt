 As It Battles Home Depot, Lowe's Builds Support Among Analysts   By By John Hechinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1997  In the past several months, Lowe's stock price has slipped as the North Wilkesboro, N.C., company struggles with a challenge as daunting as building a house without power tools. The 51-year-old company has started moving into major urban markets, away from its traditional base of small-town Southeastern cities. Now Lowe's is going head-to-head with Atlanta-based Home Depot, which has crushed other well-respected rivals.  So far, investors haven't thought much of the effort. Shares of Lowe's, which has annual sales of less than half of Home Depot's, are selling for about $35 apiece, down from their high of around $43 in November. Meanwhile, Home Depot stock is trading near its all-time high.  "I like Lowe's better [than Home Depot] as an investment right now," says analyst Neal Kaplan of Scott & Stringfellow in Richmond, Va., who predicts Lowe's shares will soar to $50 within a year and a half.
