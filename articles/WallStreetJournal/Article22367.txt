 Oil Prices Slip Amid Mixed Signals About Iraq   By By Terzah Ewing, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1998  Crude-oil prices fell to their intraday low of $16.70 a barrel after Mr. Annan's announcement. Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein's continued resistance to United Nations weapons inspections exerted a countervailing bullish pressure. Consequently, a mood of caution dominated trading pits.  Crude oil for March delivery settled at $17.05 a barrel, down 16 cents in New York Mercantile Exchange trading. The April contract finished at $17.24, down 13 cents. Petroleum products followed suit. March gasoline fell 0.66 cent to 52.64 cents a gallon, while March heating oil fell 0.73 cent to 47.38 cents a gallon.  A report that Mr. Hussein had been persuaded by Russian diplomats to allow U.N. weapons inspectors into as many as eight sites also pressured prices. But the effects of early reports were short lived. Prices recovered somewhat after Iraq denied any deal was struck with the Russians. Meanwhile, Mr. Annan's proposal ultimately had little effect on prices either, traders said, because Iraq greeted it coolly. Baghdad believes the U.N. should lift sanctions instead of renewing the oil-for-food deal.
