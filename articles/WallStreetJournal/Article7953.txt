 Letters to the Editor: Drugs: All Youngsters Are at Risk   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1989  Drug education as promulgated by the various governments has been a failure for the most part. Young people continue to use drugs for non-medical reasons. Most drug-education efforts have neglected two major components that should have been included: The recognition of adolescent risk-taking behavior and inclusion of parents in attitudinal change.  All generations have faced the issues of risk taking. In my generation, it was alcohol, tobacco and sex, in whatever order of personal preference. Bainbridge Island students certainly validate this recurring pattern. Parents need to understand that all young people are at risk and stop denying the possibility that their sons and daughters may be involved.  I was disheartened to read that only about 8% of Bainbridge parents showed up for an anti-drug seminar. These are your children. Don't be fooled into thinking it won't happen to them. A drug user is not just the long-haired, skinny guy dressed in black, it is the cheerleader and scholar, too. Family support may be the only element missing from Bainbridge's anti-drug program.
