 LEISURE & ARTS -- Bookshelf: Fixing Some Problems Without Choosing Sides   By Rosen, Gary, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2003  [Matthew Miller]'s "The 2% Solution" is a small marvel of a book, an extended discussion of domestic policy that will wake you up rather than put you to sleep. Mr. Miller's aim is to spark a far-reaching national debate on how to improve the lot of America's poor and unskilled, but he's no ghost of the Great Society. A syndicated columnist and public-radio commentator with a previous stint as a budget adviser in the Clinton White House, he is a self-consciously "New" Democrat, unabashed in his praise of free-market dynamism and plenty. As he sees it, we can fix our problems in ways that both liberals and conservatives "can love."  The "2%" of his title is that much of the country's $11 trillion gross domestic product -- about $220 billion. For this annual sum, Mr. Miller contends, we could finally get "serious" about creating "equal opportunity" and a "decent minimum" for all Americans, goals proclaimed by both parties but given symbolic attention, at best, by timid Democrats and complacent Republicans as they jockey for partisan advantage.
