 The Outlook: Recessions Can Bring Benefits With Pain   By By Alfred L. Malabre Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1990  No one knows for sure whether a new recession is setting in. If one is, it will bring serious pain: lost jobs, failed companies, reduced living standards. About the only good thing that one can say about recessions is that they always end -- at least they always have in the past -- and that they sometimes serve to cleanse the economy of serious imbalances, clearing the way for sturdier growth in the future.  Until recently, the notion had been gaining ground that a full-fledged recession was a thing of the past. The business cycle, in this view, was deemed dead. The economy, remarkably diverse and resilient, was seen entering a new era of recession-free growth, marred only by occasional minirecessions rolling from one part of the country to another or from one industry to another.  In fact, most economists believe that a national recession, if not here already, soon will be. The critical question for some forecasters has thus become, not whether there will be a recession, but whether it will be stern enough to correct imbalances that have built up over the past eight years, while not so harsh as to throw the economy into a long, deep decline.
