 WSJ(5/12) UPDATE: Senate Approves $70 Billion Tax Bill   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2006  European leaders said they would cancel plans for punitive tariffs on U.S. imports once Congress moved to strip the tax breaks for U.S. exporters. The move could end a contentious and costly trans-Atlantic trade dispute and ease relations strained by stalled global trade talks. "This is an extremely welcome development," European Union trade spokesman Peter Power said. "Assuming the measures are adopted, we will move immediately to remove the retaliatory measures."
