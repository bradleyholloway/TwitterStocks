 Continental Bank Is to Post 3rd-Period Loss --- Deficit of $140 Million Seen After a Special Charge; Dividend to Be Reduced   By By Fred R. Bleakley, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1991  Continental Bank Corp. said it would take a $150 million special charge in the third quarter to build reserves for potential loan losses, an indication that regulators are not letting up on their conservative valuation of real estate loan portfolios.  The charge, plus another $25 million provision for restructuring, will result in a loss for the quarter. Analysts estimate it will be roughly $140 million, wiping out earnings of $62 million for the first half. In addition, Continental said it would cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cents from 25 cents, reduce its work force another 5% and withdraw as a primary dealer in government securities.  Continental Chief Financial Officer Hollis Rademacher maintained that the special charge was "purely voluntary and not in reaction to anything threatened or written" from examiners. He said in an interview, "The economy has not rebounded strongly and we should be prepared in case commercial real estate deteriorates further." He declined to comment on exactly how wide the third-quarter loss will be.
