 Barron's Insight: Altria in Pieces Is Likely To Keep Investors Hooked   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2007  The first step of the breakup will occur next month, when Altria distributes its Kraft stake, some 1.45 billion shares. Altria holders will get roughly 70 shares of Kraft for every 100 Altria shares. That translates into $24 of Kraft stock for each Altria share. The price of Altria stock is likely to fall by about $24 when the Kraft distribution is made. Altria's current dividend yield of 3.9% is likely to rise to about 4.4% after the Kraft split. Kraft now yields 2.8%. One risk is that Altria's legal opponents in cigarette litigation will seek to block the Kraft spinoff, fearing it will reduce assets that could be used to settle cases or to pay legal judgments. But Mr. [David Adelman] and other analysts doubt that such a move would be successful.
