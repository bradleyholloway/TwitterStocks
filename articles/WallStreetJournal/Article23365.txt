 Tax Report: Wealthier Taxpayers May Gain If Bill Allows Move to Roth IRAs   By Wells, Rob, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2006  "It would be a huge deal," says James M. Spindler, a senior financial adviser and vice president at Univest Corp.'s Wealth Management and Trust Group in Souderton, Pa. "I would think that anyone who can possibly have the means to do it would have to sit down to talk to their financial adviser" about converting their IRA.  The Roth IRA -- created in the 1997 tax bill and named for former Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth (R., Del.) -- doesn't permit a tax deduction for funds contributed to the accounts. But funds grow tax-free and can be withdrawn, tax-free, with few restrictions. In addition to withdrawals made by people age 59 1/2 and older, amounts categorized as "qualified distributions" aren't taxed or subject to the 10% tax on early withdrawals, such as first-time homebuyers' expenses of up to $10,000. And Roth investors can withdraw regular annual contributions at any time, as well as sums converted from a traditional IRA after five tax years.  House and Senate lawmakers are urging IRS Commissioner Mark Everson to reverse the decline in Free File use and renegotiate an agreement with companies such as H&R Block Inc. and Intuit Inc. Members of the Free File Alliance offer free electronic tax filing services, which taxpayers access through the IRS's Web site (www.irs.gov).
