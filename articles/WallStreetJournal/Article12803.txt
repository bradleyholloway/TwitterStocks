 Financial, Oil and Health Stocks Lead the Pack   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2002  In the energy sector, small caps are showing an average of 15% earnings growth while large caps are seeing a 30% decline. Mr. [Satya Pradhuman] credits oil-service stocks, many of which are small caps that are still seeing demand for exploration services. Mr. Pradhuman is keeping an eye on FMC Technologies in this group.  Small caps also fall behind in the transportation area, down 30% to big caps' 7% gain. The culprit: once-mighty airlines that are now small-cap stocks. That happened Friday, when airlines were socked, pushing Northwest Airlines' stock to small-cap size with its decline of 80 cents, or 4.4%, to $17.57; the stock now carries a market cap below $1.5 billion, the criteria for inclusion in this column.  Ameripath engaged in a game of musical chairs and emerged as the small-cap beneficiary of the merger between Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer. Compaq's departure from the S&P 500-stock index left a vacancy that First Tennessee, a member of the S&P Midcap 400 Index, was tapped to fill. That meant some company had to replace First Tennessee on the S&P 400, and Constellation Brands was named, which required shifting the company over from the S&P SmallCap 600. That left a vacancy on the S&P 600 to be filled, and Standard & Poor's index selection committee chose Ameripath, a Riveria Beach, Fla., physicians group that rose $2.21, or 8.1%, to $29.43 as a result of its new place at the table.
