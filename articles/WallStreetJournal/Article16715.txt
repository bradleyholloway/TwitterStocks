 Off the Beaten Track / Anchorage, Alaska   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2006  Where to eat: For some of the best hand-crafted beer in the country, the Moose's Tooth Pub and Pizzeria is a must. This family-style eatery offers a long list of specialty pizzas (such as blackened halibut) and a broad selection of award-winning beers brewed off-site (Tel. 907- 258-2537, www.moosestooth.net). Downtown's Glacier Brewhouse is another Alaskan beer garden, but one dishing up locally caught seafoods and rotisserie-roasted meats (Tel. 907-274-2739, www.glacierbrewhouse.com). For upscale dinning, head to Kincaid Grill.
