 Glasgow's No Mean City Anymore   By By Terry Trucco, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1988  Glasgow, Scotland -- As a city official tells it, the worst thing that ever happened to Glasgow was when a pair of local boys made good and wrote a best-selling novel some 50 years ago. The book, "No Mean City," was set in Gorbals, Glasgow's South Bronx, where everyone, it seems, lived in stinking tenements and brandished straight-edge razors, slashing each other when things got dull.  These days, no one lives in Gorbals, which looks like a vast, deserted parking lot. But the memory lingers. "These guys write this bloody book and convince the entire Western world that Glasgow is full of razor gangs," the official sighs.  Glasgow isn't Belfast, but it's not exactly the first British city you think of in connection with high culture. Yet a few months back, Glasgow stunned much of Britain by getting itself chosen as European City of Culture for 1990.
