 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 2, 1989  CARL ICAHN SOLD his 17.3% stake in Texaco for $2.07 billion, ending a 1 1/2-year battle for the oil giant and touching off speculation about where he will strike next. USX and Williams shares surged in anticipation of possible hostile moves by Icahn. The sale of the Texaco stake will bring him a $600 million pretax profit on a $1.4 billion investment.  Sun Microsystems said management problems will end sales growth and cause lower earnings or even a loss for the current quarter. The sharp downturn follows seven years of rapid growth by the computer firm.  Employee stock ownership plans will be allowed to publicly sell bonds to finance stock purchases without losing an important tax break. The imminent IRS ruling is expected to be a bonanza for Wall Street.
