 Commodities Report: Cocoa Bulls Keep Riding Wave, Including Squeeze in London   By By Enza Tedesco OsterDowJones Commodity News, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2002  A convergence of technical and fundamental factors has made cocoa such a relentless bull market, participants said.

Luis A. Rangel, vice president with brokerage firm Fimat USA Inc. in New York, also pointed to the shift in the market sentiment in the past several sessions and the gradual conversion of the market bears to the bulls' creed.
