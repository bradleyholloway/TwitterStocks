 International Corporate Report: Paribas's Shares Jump 18% After Its Denationalization   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1987  The French stockbrokerage Nivard-Flornoy, which supervised the sale, said buy orders eclipsed sell orders. Sales covered only 10% of the 2.5 million shares demanded.  Paribas and Nivard-Flornoy both denied that the bank itself had supplied the shares that were sold. But Nivard-Flornoy said almost all the sellers were institutions, and that at least some of them probably were "friends of Paribas."
