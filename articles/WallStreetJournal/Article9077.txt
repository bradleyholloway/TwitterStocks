 Autos: Suddenly in the Rearview Mirror --- Cadillac and Lincoln Race to Catch Imports   By By Gregory L. White and Fara Warner, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1999  Four months into 1999, two brands have vaulted to the top of the luxury-sales chart: Mercedes-Benz, made by DaimlerChrysler AG, and Lexus, from Toyota Motor Corp. Third is Cadillac, from General Motors Corp., then BMW from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. Puttering along in fifth is Lincoln, a unit of Ford Motor Co.  But now the two U.S. luxury-car brands, trailing companies they barely noticed a decade ago, are scrambling to reinvent themselves. Lincoln will be revving up its luxury-truck operation over the next few years, focusing mainly on the American market. With more global ambitions, Cadillac will be banking on sleek new designs, hoping to out-German the Germans.  The drive to improve the Cadillac image is evident in the company's design studio in Warren, Mich., where pictures of stealth fighters adorn the walls, emblems of the spare new approach the company calls "Art and Science." Cadillac designers say they want to meld sleek lines and modern styling with American high technology to carve out their own niche. "American big is gone," says design manager Tom Kearns. Cadillac hopes to use the new look to take on Mercedes and BMW in Europe.
