 Russia's Ayn Factor   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  Add that to the many mysteries surrounding Vladimir Putin, who will be inaugurated Russian President on Sunday. One of his economic advisers recently revealed that a Russian translation of [Ayn] Rand's novel sits on a shelf in Mr. Putin's private library. We'd have preferred to hear he had a worn copy of Hayek's "Road to Serfdom" at his bedside, but we can think of worse influences on a Russian president. At the least, Rand's devotion to reason and individualism, and her moral defense of capitalism as the system that best allows these ideals to flourish, could use more airing in Russia.
