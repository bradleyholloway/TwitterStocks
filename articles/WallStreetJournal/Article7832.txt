 Year's Delay in Disclosing Nuclear Leak Creates a Public Furor in West Germany   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1988  FRANKFURT, West Germany -- A U.S. magazine report on a brief radioactive emission at a West German nuclear power plant, details of which had been held under wraps since the incident occurred in December 1987, has created a public furor.  The case nevertheless gives ammunition to political parties and interest groups hoping to wind down West Germany's nuclear-power industry. They are demanding a full investigation into the leak, which occurred at a 14-year-old, 1,200-megawatt pressurized-water reactor at the Biblis nuclear-power facility near Frankfurt.  The leak at Biblis, owned by the Rheinisch-Westfaelishes Elektrizitaetswerk AG, or RWE, West Germany's largest utility, was first reported to Hesse state authorities on Dec. 21, though full details weren't given to the government until March and April. West Germany's federal environmental minister, Klaus Toepfer, said Monday he didn't hear of the Biblis accident until April.
