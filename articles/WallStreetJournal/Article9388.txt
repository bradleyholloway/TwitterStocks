 Advantage: Buyers --- With Housing Sales Slow, Buyers Demand Deals, Fancy Extras; A Sub-Zero and 0% Down   By By June Fletcher, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2001  Some of the best deals are being offered by builders, who for the first time in years are facing slowing sales. New-home sales across the country fell 4.6% in October from the year before, and building permits fell 3.6% that month from the month before. That has builders buying down interest rates, subsidizing closing costs, and throwing in extras to get their houses sold. Carr Homes of Annandale, Va., for instance, is not only giving buyers $5,000 toward closing, but it is offering loans three-quarters of a percentage point below the prevailing rate. (How can they do that? Carr has built the cost into the $750,000 prices of its custom homes.)  To be sure, anxious sellers have thrown in incentives before, from grand pianos to pricey art and even cars. But those have usually been offered by the owners of high-end homes using the extras as gimmicks to prop up inflated prices. This time around, the goodies are available at almost every level of the market -- and they often come on top of a discounted sales price. And what's being offered is often cold hard cash, in the shape of those discounted mortgages or givebacks on closing costs. Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands, a Houston community, says it was selling just 12 homes a week after Sept. 11, down from 30 or more before. So at the end of October, the developer and builders there started offering $1,000 gift certificates, $5,000 toward a golf-club membership, even $25,000 in upgrades. Last month, 80 houses sold, and the incentives will probably continue into next year. "We think it will be necessary," he says.
