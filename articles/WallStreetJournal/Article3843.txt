 Water on Some Planes Is Contaminated, Tests Show   By Soto, Alonso, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2004  A wide array of planes were tested in August and September, ranging from small commuter planes to international jets, though none were identified in the report. Thomas Skinner, head of the EPA's enforcement office, said the results were surprising and his agency is working with the industry to take steps to ensure acceptable drinking- water quality.  "This is not an indication of an imminent health threat," Mr. Skinner said in a conference call announcing the test findings. "We need more testing to analyze the scope of the problem."  While the news is unpleasant for travelers, Mr. Skinner pointed out that just 90% of municipal drinking-water systems meet EPA standards. The agency's testing showed airline water was only slightly worse: 87.4% of the planes tested had water that met EPA standards.
