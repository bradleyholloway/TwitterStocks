 Compaq Turns Its Attention To PC Servers --- Company Is Set to Shake Up Market With New Line Of Low-Cost Machines   By By Kyle Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1992  Compaq Computer Corp., having already rattled the personal computer industry with its new line of bargain-priced machines, has shifted its sights to the PC server business.  The Houston computer maker is expected today to announce two new server families, including an entry-level system priced as much as 55% cheaper than Compaq's current bottom-of-the-line machine. Like all servers, Compaq's systems, which sit on the floor or in a closet, use juiced-up processing power and additional memory capacity to act as data repositories and electronic traffic cops for networks of PCs.  Like Compaq's PC family before the unveiling of its inexpensive ProLinea line this summer, the company's SystemPro server sales have been undercut by a slew of smaller upstarts, including clone computer companies that sold less-advanced machines, but at a cost far below the $6,000 price tag on Compaq's cheapest model. As a result, sales have been sluggish, with analysts predicting only $220 million in server revenues for Compaq this year. "Compaq realized it had priced itself out of the market," said Gary Stimac, a Compaq senior vice president.
