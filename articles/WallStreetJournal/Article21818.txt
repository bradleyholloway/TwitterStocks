 Letters to the Editor: Good Reasons Behind FDA's Arduous Rules   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1993  Dr. Leonard G. Wilson's June 24 editorial page article "FDA Red Tape Dooms Transplant Drug" is an example of, to paraphrase Admiral Farragut, "Damn the regulations, this drug works!" The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its supporting Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regulations mandate how drugs, biologics and medical devices are to be manufactured. They rightfully do not apply different manufacturing standards to academic institutions than those applied to commercial entities.
