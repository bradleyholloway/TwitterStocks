 Presidential Candidates Embrace Gay Issues, Donations   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2000  The shift has been most evident in the recent competition between Democratic candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley for the votes and campaign checks of their party's sizable homosexual constituency. Both men have pledged to allow gays to serve openly in the U.S. military, and Mr. Gore last week went so far as to declare agreement with that stance a litmus test for appointment to the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff.  By retracting that assertion two days later under criticism from military officials and Republicans, Mr. Gore showed that embracing gay causes too avidly remains potentially treacherous. Yet leading Republican candidates themselves are nodding to changing public attitudes by striking tones of rising tolerance.  Four years after then-GOP front-runner Bob Dole returned a check from a gay Republican group for fear of conservative backlash, candidate John McCain has accepted such donations and met with the Log Cabin Republicans group. Texas Gov. George W. Bush says he wouldn't hold such a meeting for fear of provoking a hubbub, but he joined Mr. McCain in endorsing the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy instituted by the [Hillary] Clinton administration for the purpose of curtailing inquiries into the sexual orientation of service members.
