 Earnings Digest: Gazprom Profit Falls 25% on Higher Costs   By Andrew Langley and Lidia Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2007  "As the company's gas sales within Russia are still near the break- even level, it's European sales that mainly determine the company's current profitability," said Alexander Burgansky, a senior oil and gas analyst at investment bank Renaissance Capital in Moscow, which reiterated its "buy" rating on the company.  "Gazprom has disappointed in terms of cost control," said Deutsche Bank analyst Pavel Kushnir, noting in particular the company's staff and maintenance costs. Staff costs rose on higher salaries and pension obligations. Mr. Kushnir also has a "buy" recommendation on the company.
