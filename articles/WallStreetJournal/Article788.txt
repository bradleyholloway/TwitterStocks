 Spy Case, Budget Restraints Presage Cooling of the U.S.-Israeli Love Affair   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1986  -- The scheduled transfer of power in Israel this fall from Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who is perceived here as a flexible leader ready to negotiate peace with the Arabs, to hard-liner Yitzhak Shamir, who many Americans view as far less attractive.  -- The recent capture of a U.S. intelligence worker operating as a spy for Israel and alleged efforts to acquire illegally U.S. technology. Israel handled these matters clumsily and embarrassed many of its friends.  "You could argue that from the time Mr. Peres became prime minister (in September 1984) to early this year was a real high point in U.S.-Israeli relations," says William Quandt, a Mideast expert at the Brookings Institution. "There was a strong desire on the Reagan administration's part to help Peres gain strength. They genuinely preferred him to the alternative and wished him success." But, he adds, "As we get further into this year, it's clear that things have peaked."
