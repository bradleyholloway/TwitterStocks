 On Sports: NCAA Irony   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1993  With no apparent sense of irony, the National Collegiate Athletic Association made a couple of recent announcements. One, several weeks ago, disclosed plans for a program to develop what it called the "life skills" of athletes at member schools, helping them cope with such problems as competitive pressures and a lack of free time. The other, made this week, approved the addition of the Alamo Bowl, to be held Dec. 31 in San Antonio, Texas, to the college football postseason schedule.  The juxtaposition underscored the philosophical muddle that surrounds big-time college athletics in this land. The universities that constitute the NCAA talk a good game of making the sports-entertainment giant they've created serve the interests of the youngsters who make it possible. But their good intentions are frequently, and quickly, stashed when the giant roars for new infusions of cash.  Nothing illustrates this better than the football bowl scene. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., was the first -- on New Year's Day, 1902 -- and, until 1935, the only postseason football competition for collegians; begun when intersectional contests were rare, it provided a winter-sunshine reward for one pair of excellent teams. The number of bowl games remained small through World War I.
