 Newell Rubbermaid Shares Fall 20% As an Earnings Shortfall Is Predicted   By By James P. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1999  Newell specializes in selling to discount retailers a variety of household products. The company said Friday that it expects third-quarter earnings to be between 43 cents and 47 cents a share, below the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 51 cents a share. Newell expects full-year 1999 earnings of $1.65 to $1.75 a share, below the consensus of $1.80 a share.  Despite the broad market's surge Friday, Newell dropped $8.4375 to close at a 52-week low of $32.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume was heavy at about nine million shares; the selloff trimmed Newell's market capitalization by $2.38 billion.  "The sky is not falling, but it's awfully dark, and the clouds are going to stay dark over the stock for the short term," said Timothy Reiland, an analyst at Tucker Cleary Inc. in Milwaukee. Mr. Reiland, who lowered his rating on Newell to "accumulate" in May, said on Friday that he was reducing it further, to "hold."
