 Nissan's Ghosn, on Track to Run Renault, Faces Bumpy Road   By Sapsford, Jathon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  Now, as he is slated to rise in April to CEO of both Nissan and its controlling shareholder, Renault SA of France, Mr. [Carlos Ghosn] (rhymes with "stone") faces one of his biggest tests: Can he fulfill his public promise to boost Nissan's annual sales by one million vehicles before September 2005?  By 2002, Nissan had gone from bleeding red ink to all-time record profits. In May of that year, Mr. Ghosn set out a series of new goals called "Nissan 180" with each digit -- 1,8,0 -- representing a target. By 2005, he would boost annual vehicle sales by one million units, raise operating profit margins to 8% or more, and cut the car maker's long-term debt to zero.  "If I said we aren't feeling any pressure at all, well, that would be a lie," says Norio Matsumura, who as head of global sales at Nissan is a key executive in charge of keeping Mr. Ghosn's promise. Mr. Matsumura has his sales team producing regular internal reports to monitor weekly progress. But he adds determinedly: "We will definitely make it."
