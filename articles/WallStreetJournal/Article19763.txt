 Investor Was a One-Man Market, SEC Claims   By Emshwiller, John R, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2004  Mr. [Suheil M. Judeh] allegedly used 26 false or stolen identities to create accounts at two brokerage houses. He used those bogus accounts to trade stocks with an account he had under his real name at a third brokerage house. He constructed the transactions so that his real account would profit while his fake accounts lost -- leaving the two brokerage houses holding the bag. In setting up and using the fake accounts, Mr. Judeh exploited an apparent loophole in the security systems of at least some of the nation's brokerage houses.  Efforts to locate Mr. Judeh for an interview were unsuccessful. The SEC's Mr. [Robert Mitchell] says it took several weeks for the agency to find Mr. Judeh to serve him with the complaint. To date, he doesn't appear to have a lawyer in the case. The SEC attorney declines to give details of how or where Mr. Judeh was found.  Ira Sorkin, former head of the SEC's New York office and now a prominent Manhattan defense attorney, likens the circumstances of the Judeh case to an auto dealer letting a customer have a car before the check clears. "If you give them the keys," Mr. Sorkin says, "shame on you."
