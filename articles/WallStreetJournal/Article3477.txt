 Attacks Raise Likelihood of Higher State Taxes   By By Will Pinkston, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2001  To close budget gaps, states this year began turning to minor increases. New Jersey sought to generate $420 million in new revenues by closing a business-tax loophole, Indiana projected it would raise $280 million by suspending a property-tax credit and West Virginia forecast its new video-poker tax would add $123 million. Fiscal experts believe such minor increases will be the first tools states use to generate extra revenue, if it is needed.  While Mr. [Warren Neel] is lowering Tennessee's fiscal 2002 sales-tax projections by $100 million to bring them in line with Gulf War-era performance, he fears losses ultimately could be greater as consumers cut spending more amid fears of job cuts and the psychological impact of attacks on U.S. soil. The situation places added pressure on Tennessee, where Gov. Don Sundquist and lawmakers have squabbled over the Republican governor's earlier proposal to pass an income tax to raise extra revenue.
