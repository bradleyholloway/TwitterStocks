 Leveraging Hits Like 'Lost' And 'Desperate Housewives'   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2005  Mr. [Mike Shaw]: We're getting double what we charged for "Lost" in the upfront, and we're getting triple what we charged for "Desperate Housewives" in the upfront. It's been very well received and the ratings we are delivering are very large numbers.  Mr. Shaw: There is going to be a beginning, a middle and a conclusion within each individual "Alias." That's going to be very different. The fact that we have a very successful drama leading into another drama that has not popped but we are determined that it will -- that's the best possible chance, because we believe it's a very similar audience demographic . . . We have not been able to pop the show as much as, certainly, Jennifer Garner's star power has. You would have thought the show would have mirrored that, and I think there is a great expectation that we really have a big opportunity here.  Mr. Shaw: We are certainly not organizing the staff at this point. As of today, you've got estimates ranging from somewhere around 4% of homes in America having a DVR, and I would put the number of TVs having it around 1.5%, with the multi-set nature of the homes themselves. I don't feel that we're at the point, certainly, where the sky is falling. Is there a reaction to the point of the technology? Absolutely . . . Whether it's VOD or in our case whether we release a "Lost" on DVD, there are a lot of different ways that we need to monetize our content. Quite frankly, the [programming] costs are not mitigated, and we have got to figure out other revenue opportunities.
