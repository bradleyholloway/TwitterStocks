 Diverse Interests Haggle Over the Seaport's Future   By By Shirley Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1998  Frank McCourt, a 44-year-old developer, owns 20 pivotal acres he bought in the late 1970s that stretch from the front door of the planned convention center to the courthouse area near the water's edge. Right now, the land is mostly parking lots, but it could be the site of office buildings, restaurants, parks and possibly a hotel.  Thomas N. O'Brien heads the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city's economic-development and planning agency. Mr. O'Brien, 35, must balance the oft-competing concerns of people like Messrs.  So Mr. McCourt is moving slowly. He owns much of the land near the courthouse, and that proximity could be the starting point for his building plans: high-end office space for law firms. But to really sustain the critical mass of people, Mr. McCourt wants to fill the bottom floors with restaurants, shops and art galleries.
