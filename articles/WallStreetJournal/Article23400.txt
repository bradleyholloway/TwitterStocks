 Love & Money: It's Time to Tweak the Allowance -- Again   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  As regular readers of this column know, this isn't the first time we've changed how we treat our son's allowance. And I doubt it will be the last. Because there's one thing we have learned in using money to motivate our kids: You can't always go by what worked yesterday. Every now and then, you have to take stock, and aim your wallet in a different direction.  In theory, it's the same as paying him an allowance, and he still loses the ability to buy something for actions that fail to meet our clear expectations. In practice, however, it's worlds apart, at least in his mind. As he explained to me when I asked him about this new arrangement, "I like that I'm not losing something. I'd rather work toward gaining something. I like that better."  "It's just like at work: If I tell my employees they must show up on Saturday to help do inventory, some are going to choose to get paid at time-and-a-half because the money motivates them. Some will choose a day off later, because time away from the office is a motivator. We're looking for that 'something' that motivates our son, and from talking to him, this might be it."
