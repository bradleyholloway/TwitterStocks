 Backers Help Monique Silva Attend University   By By Daniel Golden, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2000  Ms. [Monique Silva], who doesn't have a green card, has been caught in the country's ambivalent policy toward the 50,000 undocumented immigrants who annually graduate from U.S. high schools. Such students attend public elementary and secondary schools for free, but are ineligible for federal financial aid for college and must pay higher out-of-state tuition at most public universities. Although she came to this country from Brazil at the age of eight, Ms. Silva, 20 years old, is classified as a foreign student by Gallaudet, which will charge her $25,000 annually, twice the tab for domestic students -- a fee she cannot afford.  Ms. Silva, whose acceptance at Gallaudet was deferred, plans to start at the school next month. In an e-mail, Ms. Silva said she "jumped and screamed for joy" when she realized she was going to college. "Is it miracle?" she wrote. Ms. Silva said she intends to leave the laundry job soon to "rest and read more books for a few weeks" before student orientation.
