 Technology (A Special Report); The Journal Report Online   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2006  "The World Summit on the Information Society was the site of last fall's showdown between the U.S. and the rest of the world over ICANN. The U.S. retained its right to govern new domain-name extensions and agreed to create an international forum on various Internet issues. At this site, you can see the 'Tunis Commitment' document that preserved ICANN's operation under U.S. authority."  "Although they're a bit dated, the essays in this volume offer a good legal overview of the issues of internationalization and cyberspace. Especially interesting is the lead article by David Johnson and David Post, 'The Rise of Law on the Global Network.' "  THE BULL CASE: Knightspoint Group, which owns 13% of Sharper Image, wants to replace the board. Analysts nodded their approval, as did investors -- news of the plan sent shares up 23%. Jason Kremer at Caris & Co. wrote that Knightspoint's "nominees intend to set a new course" for marketing and product development. Cid Wilson at Kevin Dann & Partners, who raised his price target to $13 from $10, says any turnaround could unlock Sharper Image's "hidden value" for investors.
