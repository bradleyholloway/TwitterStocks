 The Lockout's Ripple Effect: Well-Prepared Alaska, Hawaii Take Halt in Stride   By By Jim Carlton in San Francisco, Susan Essoyan in Honolulu and Allen Baker in Anchorage, Alaska, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2002  Alaskans haven't done as much stockpiling because, unlike the island state, they have more transport options: shipping goods via barges, which are unaffected by the labor dispute, or by truck up the Alaska-Canada Highway. Already, officials at Anchorage-based Carlile Transportation Systems Inc. say they are running nearly 40 truckloads this week over the highway linking the lower 48 states with Alaska, compared with a normal schedule of six. Barges are also taking on bigger loads. For instance, officials at Neeser Construction Inc. in Anchorage say they opted to switch their order for steel (for a new high school in Anchorage) from steamship carriers to the barge lines.  Indeed, both Alaska and Hawaii could feel more of an impact from the docks shutdown if it continues for a long time. Already in Hawaii, some produce sellers are feeling a pinch. For example, officials of Armstrong Produce Ltd., a top Hawaii distributor, say they have flown in some fruit and vegetables that were stranded on the mainland, and are booking air-cargo space to bring in more of the perishables. But air freight costs 2 1/2 times what the company pays to ship its goods by sea -- a cost that could eventually be passed on to Hawaii's consumers.
