 Toyota Owners File Suit Seeking Camry Recall   By By David J. Jefferson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1988  Attorneys representing Toyota owners filed a lawsuit in state court here seeking a recall of more than 400,000 Toyota Camrys sold in the U.S. between 1983 and 1986 to correct an alleged brake problem.  Repair costs range from $790 to $1,380 a car, and attorneys for the plaintiffs claim that total damages to Toyota could exceed $100 million. The suit, which seeks class-action status, was prompted by more than 1,000 complaints by Camry owners to the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group.
