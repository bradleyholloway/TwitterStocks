 American Airlines To Revise Program On Frequent Fliers   By By Carolyn Phillips and Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1988  American Airlines said it will revamp its frequent-flier program, adjusting award levels and revising some rules to check free-travel promises that are no longer tenable.  The unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, isn't the first to try to rein in the runaway bonus program. Last month, Allegis Corp.'s United Airlines unit announced a similar move and analysts predicted that other carriers would follow. Even Delta Air Lines, which initiated the triple-mileage awards seen as culprit in the out-of-control programs, recently introduced some new restrictions of its own.  "The economics of frequent traveler programs have changed," said Mike Gunn, American's senior vice president, marketing. Echoing concerns heard throughout the industry, American said the old structure of its program didn't address questions about accounting practices, future liability or continued profitability for the airline should free-travel awards displace too many paying passengers.
