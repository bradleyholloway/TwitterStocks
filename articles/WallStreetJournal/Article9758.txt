 Junk-Bond Market Fails to Continue Momentum; Last Year's 11% Increase, Prospect of Higher Rates Create Investor Wariness   By Covel, Simona, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  "Anytime you've had the kind of run we've had in high yield, you need confirmation of the positive trend," said Brian Lavin, senior portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management. "It's hard to feel good when [those minutes] are the latest piece we have from the Fed."  Between the solid fundamentals and the volatile hedge-fund movements affecting intraday trading, "I don't think there's much depth in people who want to sell," said Mr. [Ming Shao]. Rather, he said, the recent weakness is "more a technical than a bearish view."  After the apparently hawkish Fed minutes, said American Express's Mr. Lavin, the feeling is that "if we have continued good employment numbers, they're going to take a nip of [a quarter percentage point] every time they meet." That sentiment would weigh on high-yield bonds.
