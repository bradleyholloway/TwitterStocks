 Industrials Rise 33.20 To Top 4200 --- Late Program-Buying Gives Index a Boost; Bonds, Dollar Gain --- By Michael Gonzalez   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1995  Late buying helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 4200 for the first time, as investors cheered evidence of a slowing economy. Bond prices rose and the dollar inched up.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33.20 to a record 4201.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3.39 to 505.24 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 1.80 to 273.29. Both broader indexes reached highs.  But stocks and bonds had been up all day on signs that the economy is slowing down to noninflationary growth. Declines in home building and public construction contributed to a 0.5% drop in February construction spending, to a $523.3 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate, the Commerce Department said. It was the secondstraight monthly decline, and the January figures were revised down as well.
