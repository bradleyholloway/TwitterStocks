 Bond Inflows Gained Ground As 1997 Ended   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1998  But 1997 ended on a very different note. More investors are shying away from stock funds, and many have begun romancing bond funds, the first serious flirtation with these portfolios since 1994. Some fund companies say they believe investors' appetite for bond funds will blossom in 1998 as prices of fixed-income securities continue to benefit from low interest rates and low inflation.  The Investment Company Institute, the mutual-fund industry's leading trade organization, reported yesterday that bond funds pulled in more than $10.36 billion in November, compared with just $3.74 billion in October. Through November, bond funds took in $39.06 billion of new investor cash, compared with just $10.29 billion for the first 11 months of 1996.  Total assets in stock funds continue to dwarf those in bond funds; through November, total stock-fund assets increased to $2.358 trillion, compared with $1.014 trillion in bond funds, according to the ICI's final November results. (The results were delayed because information-gathering was slowed by the holidays.) Also, 1997 appears to have been a record year for new money flowing into mutual funds; Charles Schwab & Co. says that last year, more new money flowed into stock funds through its mutual-fund marketplace than in any previous year.
