 World Watch   By Compiled by David I. Oyama, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 20, 2001  After years of courtship, British conglomerate GKN and Australian industrial-services company Brambles Industries made it to the altar. In an expected two-step deal, GKN will spin off its support-services activities and then merge that concern with Brambles to form a new corporation. The new entity, to be listed in both London and Australia, will be called Brambles Industries and will be 57%-owned by Brambles and 43%-owned by GKN. The new Brambles will include both companies' stakes in the Chep pallet and Cleanaway waste-management and recycling businesses, plus GKN's Meineke auto-repair business in the U.S. GKN, meanwhile, will retain its London listing and will be left with its automotive business and an aerospace business. GKN said the new Brambles will have a market capitalization of about GBP 6.9 billion ($9.85 billion).  Australian mining and steel conglomerate BHP said its attempt to take control of Brazilian iron ore miner Caemi Mineracao e Metalurgia has been thwarted by Japan's Mitsui & Co. Mitsui, which already owned a 40% stake in Caemi, edged BHP out of the deal by exercising its right of first refusal to buy the remainder of Caemi's stock and then selling 50% of Caemi to Brazilian iron-ore miner Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, or CVRD. CVRD said it agreed to buy half of Caemi from Mitsui for about $280 million. BHP had intended to buy a 20% stake in Caemi for $332 million, ahead of an offer for a further 40% stake.
