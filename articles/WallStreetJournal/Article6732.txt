 Republicans Spar on Economy; Giuliani, Romney Argue Over Spending Records; Thompson Joins Fray   By Jackie Calmes and Amy Schatz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2007  At one point, Mr. [Romney] took a dig at Mr. [Fred Thompson], who leads him in national polls. "Is this our sixth debate?" Mr. Romney dryly asked the others. Referring to the television show that featured Mr. Thompson, Mr. Romney continued, "This is a lot like 'Law & Order,' senator. It has a huge cast, the series seems to go on forever, and Fred Thompson shows up at the end."  Mr. Thompson defended the U.S. trade record, saying, "So far there's been more jobs gained. . . . Free and fair trade has been wonderful for America." Mr. [John McCain] said, "It sounds like a lot of fun to bash the Chinese and others," but "free trade should be the continuing principle that guides this nation's economy." Invoking President Ronald Reagan, he later said, "All this bashing free trade -- he must be spinning in his grave."  While Messrs. McCain and [Tom Tancredo] both cited the costs of entitlement programs -- Social Security and Medicare -- Mr. Thompson has made it something of a signature issue in his fledgling campaign. "We are spending money we do not have," he said, referring to the programs' growth, which will balloon as baby boomers begin retiring after 2008. While he has proposed no solutions, he called the trends "the foremost challenge facing our country economically." He said Social Security costs could be forestalled by changing the formula for retirees' initial benefits to link to inflation rather than wages, which rise faster.
