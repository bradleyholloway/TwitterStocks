 A Global Journal Report: U.S.'s Talk of a Coalition Courts Overstatement   By By Christopher Cooper in As Say-liyah, Qatar, and Mark Maremont in Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  Only three countries -- Britain, Australia and Spain -- are contributing significant numbers of troops or equipment to the effort to disarm Baghdad and oust Saddam Hussein. About a third of the 33 countries that have been publicly identified are offering little more than a right-of-way for aircraft or warships, or facilities out of the war theater for landing and refueling jets. The White House declines to identify the other 15 nations -- or others it claims have signed on since the fighting started -- saying they are more comfortable operating behind the scenes. And many coalition members, such as Nicaragua and Georgia, are too poor to offer much. "Our contribution will be pretty modest," admits Levan Mikeladze, Georgia's ambassador to the U.S.  France was a major participant in 1991's Operation Desert Storm, contributing jets, tanks and 20,000 troops. Germany helped out in 1991 and, despite its opposition in the U.N. this time around, sent a chemical-detection team to help in the inspection process. Those soldiers remained in Kuwait City as U.S. troops began moving into Iraq yesterday. Italy has offered only airspace and landing strips.  Six nations have contributed aircraft to the effort to disarm Iraq, and a senior U.S. military official in Saudi Arabia says they weren't hard to integrate. He pointed out that the U.S. routinely conducts war games with allies to work out any kinks. "If it were the first time we were doing this, it might be a problem," he said.
