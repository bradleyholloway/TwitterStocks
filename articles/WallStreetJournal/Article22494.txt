 State Decries Union Tactic On Contract   By By John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1999  State officials are fuming over what they say is an attempt by Florida's main public-employee union to furtively remove a privatization provision from the collective bargaining agreement reached last year.  Officials say leaders of Florida's American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees agreed to the provision during negotiations in 1996, and again last spring when the contract came up for renewal. The provision -- the interpretation of which is also in dispute -- says that "the state will make a reasonable effort to notify the union of the contracting out or privatization of services" and to provide an opportunity to consult when a decision to privatize is being made.  But when the union submitted the new contract to its members for ratification last year, the provision dealing with privatization was removed, apparently by cutting it and then photocopying the edited page, state officials say. State officials say they first noticed the change in November, when union officials sent the contract to the governor for his signature.
