 IRS Appears to Break Rules on Credit Checks   By Miller, Michael W, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1991  An examination of a sample of 455 IRS credit checks in a report obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Privacy Times, a Washington newsletter, shows 21 checks appeared to break rules that require summonses for such checks to be made. The IRS says the 21 checks could have been made under extenuating circumstances but that it does not know who made them.
