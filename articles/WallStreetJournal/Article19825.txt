 Qualcomm Profit Rises 35%, Damped by Inventory   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  Qualcomm estimated its licensees sold about 41 million handsets in the quarter, down from its prior forecast of 46 million units. Qualcomm attributed the decline partly to a slowdown in South Korea, where manufacturers had stocked chips in anticipation of rising demand.  Most companies would like Qualcomm's problems. The company has patents covering one of the main technologies for cellular telephony, dubbed CDMA, for code-division multiple access. Most handset makers pay Qualcomm a royalty, even if they don't buy Qualcomm's chips.
