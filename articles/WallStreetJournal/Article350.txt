 Art & Money   By By Brooks Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 23, 2002  CLEVELAND COUP: This weekend, the Cleveland Museum of Art opens "Raphael and His Age," an exhibition featuring drawings by the Italian Renaissance painter; the works almost never leave their home at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille, France . . . . NAMING NAMES: Scrappy Internet magazine Artnet.com raises tempers this month with its pick of the seven L.A. artists who matter, its charge that many 1980s artists don't -- and the names of some contemporary art stars who are painting at top speed right now to sell art before the market tanks . . . . POWER OF THE PRINT: A traveling exhibition of 2,000 photographs of the World Trade Center attacks taken by amateur shutterbugs rolls into the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The show, which has already been mobbed in New York and Chicago, opens Sept. 7.
