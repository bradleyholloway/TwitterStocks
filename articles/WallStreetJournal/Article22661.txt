 Grid Operators Diverge Widely On Price Caps   By By Rebecca Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2000  New York's grid operator established a price cap of $1,300 per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity, the highest level in the nation's deregulated markets, while its equivalent in California moved in the opposite direction. The West Coast operator lowered the maximum it will pay for energy to $500 per megawatt hour from $750 -- and indicated it may go lower yet.  The divergent moves demonstrate the difficulty grid officials are having in fulfilling their duty to protect consumers from abusive prices without stifling the "price signals" needed to attract investors to build badly needed power plants. Both California and New York are wrestling with power scarcities and transmission problems that threaten reliability. Likewise, they are competing with neighboring states for finite supplies of electricity and fear that a cap -- if set too low -- could chase suppliers away.  The board chose the $1,300 cap because that is the highest price paid this summer for electricity in the day-ahead market. The ceiling will remain in effect from July 7 until Oct. 28. At $1,300, New York's cap is $300 higher than the one set by PJM Interconnection LLC, the grid operator for the mid-Atlantic states. The New England ISO has no limit, although it has been considering setting one. Many generators straddle more than one market and can sell into whichever auction looks most lucrative.
