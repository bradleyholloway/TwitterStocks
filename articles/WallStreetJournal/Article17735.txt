 Abitibi-Price Reaches Contract Agreement With 6,000 Workers   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  Abitibi-Price Inc. reached a tentative agreement with 6,000 unionized production workers for a new three-year contract.  If approved, the agreement with the Canadian Paperworkers Union will avert a threatened strike and probably will become the pattern for settling contracts involving 30,000 paper workers at more than 20 paper companies in eastern Canada.
