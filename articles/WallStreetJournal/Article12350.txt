 CBS's Earnings Jump Fourfold, But Its Stock Sags   By By Kyle Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1998  CBS Corp. said its net income quadrupled in the second quarter, to $4 million, or one cent a diluted share, thanks to continued strong performance from its radio and television-station group.  The results, however, weren't high enough to counter some Wall Street skeptics, who sent the media giant's shares down $2, or about 6%, in New York Stock Exchange trading to $31.6875. CBS's earnings were a penny below analysts' estimates, according to First Call Corp.  CBS's net income was up from $1 million, or a loss of two cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Last year's second-quarter results included industrial businesses that the company has since sold. Excluding those businesses, CBS's second-quarter loss last year was $11 million, or 4 cents per share.
