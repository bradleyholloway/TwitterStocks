 Scrutiny Intensifies for Russian Businesses --- Foreign Shareholders Gain Greater Say on Boards; Gazprom ADRs at Issue   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2000  Separately, the Russian government could decide by September whether to strengthen or abolish a cumbersome two-tiered stock system for Gazprom that forces foreigners to buy expensive American depositary receipts and forbids them to buy cheap domestic shares, a top government official said. Russia established the two-tiered system in 1996, believing that the company could raise more money through equity issues by limiting foreign access to Gazprom shares. Gazprom issued its first ADRs, representing 10 local shares, in October 1996 for $15.70, at a time when each local share cost 60 cents. But foreigners found a way around the rule by investing in local shares through Russian front companies. The ADR price subsequently plunged and shows little prospect of rising.
