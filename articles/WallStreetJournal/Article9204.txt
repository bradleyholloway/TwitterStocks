 Mexican President Tries to Quell Fears on GDP Growth --- U.S. Visit at Hand, Zedillo Pooh-Poohs Any Overheating   By By Peter Fritsch And Jose de Cordoba, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2000  Mr. [Ernesto Zedillo] also pointed to the democratization process his party has undergone. Last year, the PRI, whose presidential candidate was traditionally handpicked by the departing president, nominated Mr. [Francisco Labastida] through an open primary. Analysts have criticized the so-called New PRI as a mirage. The party's democratization "is a great success," President Zedillo said. "No other party selected its candidate via a primary."  Mr. Zedillo spoke on the eve of a working visit to the U.S., where he is scheduled to meet with bankers in New York and with President Clinton. Mr. Zedillo's trip comes six months after it was originally planned. Mexico's Congress refused to approve a trip scheduled for December because of budget talks then under way.  Only days after taking office in late 1994, Mr. Zedillo was forced to devalue the peso, plunging Mexico into years of recession. But the administration has engineered a remarkable turnaround, thanks largely to foreign investment and trade under the North American Free Trade Agreement and a white-hot economy in the U.S., a major recipient of Mexican exports. Since Nafta, commerce between the U.S. and Mexico has expanded by more than 150% to $220 billion last year.
