 Congress, Let the Railroads Get Back on Track   By By James M. Voytko, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1988  Common sense, an essential requirement for workable agreements between labor and management, is normally found in reasonable quantity in an economy as flexible as that of the U.S. A big exception, however, is the rail industry, where Alice-in-Wonderland "logic" pervades labor agreements that contain provisions:  These and a host of other such provisions in rail labor agreements may seem anachronistic and amusing but rarely cause for outrage. Think again. These agreements and the extraordinary costs they impose on the rail industry are a major reason -- perhaps the major reason -- for the ills that plague the railroads. There is nothing amusing about agreements that result in more than $1 billion each year in additional labor expense.  It was Congress that granted rail labor unions (virtually alone among unions in the U.S.) the right of "secondary boycott," which allows them to strike and economically cripple railroads that are not parties to a local labor dispute. This and the negotiation procedures Congress mandated have largely emasculated rail management at the bargaining table while arming the rail unions with powers so extraordinary they are expressly forbidden to most other unions. It was also Congress that directed the Interstate Commerce Commission nearly a decade ago to impose on the rail industry the infamous "New York Dock" provision, which guarantees six years of job protection (or earnings) to many rail workers hurt by mergers, sales or abandonments.
