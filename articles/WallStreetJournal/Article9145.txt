 Solo Acts: Who's Yahoo's CEO? Who Cares! Surely Not One-Stock Swappers --- Messrs. Ratner and Easton Trade a Single Company Hundreds of Times Daily --- Of Stuck Mice and `Sick' Men   By By Bryan Gruley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1999  One computer screen to Mr. [Gary] Ratner's left, Jeff Easton is trading shares of Yahoo! Inc. -- and nothing but Yahoo, as he has for the past nine months. And who is Yahoo's CEO? "Ted Koogle," Mr. Easton blurts. Actually it's Tim Koogle, but no matter; Mr. Easton has netted nearly $2,000 himself, with plenty more to be made before the closing bell.  Messrs. Ratner and Easton are rarities in a rarefied world: day traders who trade one stock and one stock only. On this Thursday in September, while other traders flit among the day's hottest dot-com stocks, Mr. Ratner will trade more than 130,000 shares of CMGI -- accounting, by himself, for nearly 2% of the company's total daily volume. And Mr. Easton will swap almost as many shares of Yahoo, or nearly 1% of that company's volume.  Mr. Ratner, a trim 24-year-old in jeans and a button-down shirt, started the day buying CMGI -- "sim-gee," as he pronounces it -- and quickly selling it off as the price climbed. He's following the lead of Instinet, an ECN that keeps showing up on his screen as a high bidder. A blood-red stripe that splits the screen says Mr. Ratner has traded 32,000 shares of CMGI, which invests in and manages Internet ventures. He has netted $2,159, after deducting Broadway Trading's commissions and other fees.
