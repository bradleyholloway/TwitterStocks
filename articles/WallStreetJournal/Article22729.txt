 Deals & Deal Makers: Bridge Says a Creditor Has Filed Involuntary Bankruptcy Petition   By By Gregory Zuckerman and Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 2001  In a prepared statement, Bridge said it was evaluating its options, which may include seeking a dismissal of the involuntary filing or converting it to a voluntary bankruptcy case. A person close to the firm said Bridge is leaning toward converting to a voluntary Chapter 11 filing in a matter of days, which would allow Bridge to restructure rather than liquidate. Under the involuntary proceeding, Bridge is allowed to operate its business unless the court orders otherwise.  Last week, Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, reported a preliminary fourth-quarter loss of $19 million, in part because of a one-time charge of $84.1 million to write off any remaining value of its investment in Bridge. Dow Jones acquired $150 million of Bridge's preferred stock in connection with Bridge's acquisition of Telerate, a financial-data provider, from Dow Jones in 1998. In the third quarter, Dow Jones had taken a charge of $82.3 million related to Bridge.
