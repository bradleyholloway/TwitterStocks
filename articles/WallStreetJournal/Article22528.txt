 Cities Are Hoping Bull Market Will Heal Ailing Pension Funds   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1999  The bonds, called pension-obligation bonds, were largely unheard of until just a few years ago. But a number of municipalities -- mainly Northeastern cities with relatively weak economies and growing pension obligations -- are trying to avoid raising taxes or cutting benefits to city workers by selling bonds to play the market.  Twenty-eight pension bonds were sold last year, up from seven in 1997 and 11 in 1996. As recently as 1991 there was just one such bond deal. This year, Philadelphia sold $1.29 billion in bonds, the second-largest pension deal ever, and one of $1.4 billion of such bonds issued around the country this year. A conference on the subject in Worcester, Mass., this year drew 500 government officials from all over the country.  The concept is straightforward enough. A municipality can raise money by selling bonds with an interest rate of only about 6.5% (the rate is higher than on most municipal bonds because interest on pension-obligation bonds isn't exempt from federal taxes). The money is then added to a municipality's pension plan. As long as the plan generates an average annual return of more than 6.5% over the life of the bonds, it will cover the interest costs of the bonds as well as bolster the financial health of the pension plan.
