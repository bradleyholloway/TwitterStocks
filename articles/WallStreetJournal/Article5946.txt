 Billions for Failure   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  President Bush, who campaigned on school reform and then put forth an ambitious education proposal during his first days in office, understands the benefits of both.

He added, "After spending $125 billion . . . over 25 years, we have virtually nothing to show for it."
