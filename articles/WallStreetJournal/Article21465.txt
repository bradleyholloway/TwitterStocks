 U.S. Foreign Debt Widened Last Year; Nation Remains World's Largest Debtor   By Stout, Hilary, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1990  America's foreign debt swelled again last year, further miring the nation in its rank of the world's largest debtor.  During the year, foreign holdings in the U.S. grew nearly twice as much as U.S. holdings abroad, the Commerce Department said. As a result, the U.S. was left shouldering a net debt burden -- the difference between U.S. holdings abroad and foreigners' holdings here -- of $663.75 billion. That was nearly 25% higher than the nation's $531.08 billion net debt position in 1988.  A continued surge in foreign investment in everything from New York office towers to Treasury securities to entire U.S. companies, hoisted foreigners' assets in the U.S. to $2.076 trillion last year from $1.797 trillion in 1988. That swamped the growth in U.S. investment abroad, which lifted U.S. foreign assets to $1.413 trillion from $1.266 trillion in 1988.
