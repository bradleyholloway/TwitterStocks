 Sprint Spinoff Has Bold Plans For Expansion   By By Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1996  Sprint Corp.'s planned cellular-phone spinoff will expand aggressively as it tries to pre-empt some of the newer wireless players, including its former parent, its chief executive said.  For investors clamoring for a "pure play" cellular stock, the business, renamed 360 Communications Co., will have a market value of about $4.1 billion and will be the second largest domestic "pure play" after AirTouch Communications. 360 is also one of the fastest-growing cellular companies.  One critical asset will be lost, however, in the spinoff: the widely recognized Sprint brand name. And 360 faces intense competition from AT&T Corp. and other wireless players that will include its former parent.
