 Canada Proposes Drug Law Changes That Offer Stronger Patent Protection   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1986  The Canadian government proposed new drug patent law changes that the generic drug industry said give in to the demands of U.S. brand-name drug companies.  Brand-name drug firms, supported by the Reagan administration, have campaigned for years to get Canada to scrap its existing drug legislation, which has provided Canada with much lower drug prices than the U.S. The existing law, known as compulsory licensing, allows generic copies of patented drugs to be imported and sold in Canada, provided a royalty fee is paid to the patent holder.  The brand companies have pledged that in exchange for greater patent protection for their products they will do more research and development and other activities in Canada. Three brand name companies have called a news conference for today to announce new investments in Canada. They are Parke-Davis Canada Inc., a unit of Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, N.J.; Upjohn Co. of Canada, a unit of Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich., and Ortho Pharmaceutical (Canada) Ltd., a unit of Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J.
