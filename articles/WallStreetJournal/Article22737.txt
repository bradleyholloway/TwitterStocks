 Clarifying the Tax Hit Taken by Your Funds   By By Theo Francis, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 2, 2001  The new SEC rule, on its face, seems relatively simple. Currently, the SEC requires funds to report pretax total returns for one-, five- and 10-year periods in their prospectuses. When the new rule kicks in, funds must also list after-tax returns for each time period in two ways: one assuming investors will hold onto their fund shares and thus only pay taxes on distributed capital gains; and the other assuming investors are selling their shares, thereby triggering the capital-gains taxes on any increase in the fund's net asset value.  The devil lies in the details of how the SEC wants funds to calculate post-tax returns, the ICI contends. The agency decided to use a "worst case" scenario for the tax bite by assuming all investors are in the highest individual federal income-tax bracket, currently 39.6%. The calculation also assumes that capital gains from securities held in the fund more than a year are taxed at the top 20% capital-gains rate for securities, while shorter-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, again at the 39.6% rate.  The fund industry grouses that using the top bracket is misleading, since that rate only kicks in for most people once their taxable income exceeds $288,350; better to use a lower rate that applies to more investors, the ICI says, noting that a typical fund-owning household earns $55,000 a year. And the ICI objects to the SEC assumption that sold shares should be subjected to a 39.6% tax rate, rather than a 20% long-term tax that typically would apply if the shares were assumed to be held for a year and a day.
