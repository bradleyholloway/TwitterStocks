 Angang Steel to Buy Parent's Assets   By Chan, Ka Sing, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2005  Angang New Steel & Iron reported net profit of 3.43 billion yuan in 2003, under Chinese accounting rules. Angang New Steel reported net profit of 1.34 billion Hong Kong dollars ($172.4 million) and earnings per share of 45 Hong Kong cents for the same period.  The acquisition of its parent's upstream assets will transform the Chinese steelmaker into an integrated heavy metal producer and give its core steel-making operations more control over costs of raw materials. "An integrated steel-production process will enhance the company's competitiveness and profitability, as well as enable cost reductions," Angang Chairman Liu Jie said.
