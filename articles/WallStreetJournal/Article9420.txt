 Dallas Mavericks Owner Bets Big on HDTV   By By Elliot Spagat, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2002  Don't expect any Emmys soon. HDNet is filled with homegrown programming such as Mavericks cheerleader tryouts and Mr. [Mark Cuban]'s new weekly talk show. During a recent taping of his show at a Dallas bar, Mr. Cuban recalled teaching disco dancing for $25 an hour at Indiana University and gave a video tour of his sparsely furnished 24,000-square-foot home, where he played whiffle ball in one room. There was a show on where to walk your dog in Manhattan and documentaries on the Wyoming wilderness and drag-boat racing in Waco, Texas.  HDNet is also doing some horse-trading to get additional programming and find its way into more homes. News Corp.'s Fox is letting HDNet "piggyback" on 80 Major League Baseball and 65 National Hockey League games this season. In exchange, it has options to buy "somewhere between 10% and 30%" of HDNet and a chance to learn the technology and economics of high-definition, said Robert Thompson, president of Fox Sports Network. Hughes Corp.'s DirecTV says it agreed to similar financial terms for making HDNet available to its 10.7 million satellite subscribers. Mr. Cuban says both have options but declines to discuss percentages.  When NBC wanted someone with technical expertise to share the costs of broadcasting the Olympics in high-definition, they called Mr. Cuban. "It was a logical phone call for us to make," says Gary Zenkel, executive vice president, NBC Olympics. HDNet aired Salt Lake City Olympics coverage on a one-day delay, using NBC announcers.
