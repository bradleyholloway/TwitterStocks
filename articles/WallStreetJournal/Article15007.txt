 REAL ESTATE   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1992  The transaction should make Southern California homeowners uneasy. Some of the assets include lots, at discounts of as much as 35% from prices in the late '80s. Cheaper land allows builders to put up less-expensive homes, undercutting prices of existing houses. Some builders expect California land prices to fall as much as 50% from their 1989 peak.  Greystone bought A-M Homes, based in Newport Beach, Calif., from Jennings Group, a cash-strapped Australian builder. Under the agreement, Jennings turned over A-M Homes' California operations, including existing projects and more than 1,000 lots. Greystone, a closely held entity, won't discuss terms, but housing analysts say it probably paid as little as $80,000 each for lots in hardest-hit Southern California, compared with roughly $120,000 for comparable lots in 1989.  Under this theory, Ingo Winzer, editor of Local Market Monitor in Wellesley, Mass., calculates that median prices are still 20% to 30% higher than equilibrium in such distressed markets as Los Angeles and New York. Those prices must fall some more, or incomes must grow while prices remain flat, or mortgage rates must continue to fall, or a combination of the three must occur.
