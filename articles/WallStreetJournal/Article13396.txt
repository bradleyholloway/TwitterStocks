 Love & Money: When a Kid's Game Becomes Your Life   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  "It's incredibly hectic and expensive," [Melissa] says, "and it's difficult to plan your life." One of the biggest challenges: homework. [Mitchell] completes his homework in the car before practice, or must finish it late into the evenings after practice. "And every other interest is put on hold or it just goes away," Melissa says.  Ultimately, she and [Mike] like their son's sharp focus on soccer, "because the kids spend so much time into this sport that they don't have time for the bad things that get you into trouble," Melissa says. "Plus, we're closer as a family because we're together so much. We enjoy the road trips."  During the week, Colleen heads in one direction with their daughter's band and youth orchestra demands, while [Drew] manages their son's soccer obligations. Friday afternoons, Drew and his son head out to soccer tournaments in Memphis, Tenn.; Birmingham, Ala.; Jackson, Miss.; or elsewhere, and if the team does well, Drew says he doesn't return home until late Sunday night, "just in time to say 'hi' to my wife, kiss her and go to sleep -- and then start the cycle again Monday."
