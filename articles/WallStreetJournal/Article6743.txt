 Stocks, the Comeback Kids, Lose Edge; The Dow's 3-Day Loss Is the Worst in 5 Years; Tech Shares Succumb   By Peter A. McKay and Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  There are "so many wild cards hanging over the broad economic outlook," said Stephen Minton, an analyst at IDC, that the tech sector won't be immune to the turmoil now gripping financial firms or to a downturn in the economy. Still, he adds, tech spending remains solid.  "This sometimes happens with tech at this time of year because it's the first time that many tech companies give their annual guidance for the next year," said Mark McKechnie, an analyst at American Technology Research in San Francisco. He notes that many other tech companies two weeks earlier reported strong earnings and a positive outlook, including bellwethers such as Apple, Google, Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.  That was overshadowed early in the day by Wachovia's announcement of a $1.1 billion pretax hit because of bad mortgage bets. Although its stock rose 0.9%, it fueled concerns that bad news about the effects of the mortgage downturn isn't over.
