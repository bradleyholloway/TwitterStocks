 Old Europe Is Late for the Capitalist Ball   By By Richard Rahn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2003  In the vanguard of the movement is a consortium of new free-market think tanks. On Feb. 6 and 7, the Stockholm Network -- a working group of European free-market think tanks -- and the Centre for the New Europe sponsored a conference in Brussels, ending with a formal Capitalist Ball in the Brussels Bourse. The consortium -- along with providing a central point for scholarship and forward thinking, is helping to commend and publicize the achievements of Europe's new wave of free-market leaders. At the ball, former prime minister of Estonia Mart Laar was given the Adam Smith Award in recognition of his contributions to the principles of the free-market economy.  Prime Minister [Margaret Thatcher] and President [Ronald Reagan] succeeded, in part, because they were able to draw on the scholars and experts from the free-market scholarship that was coming of age in the U.K. and the U.S. back then. The Mont Pelerin Society, formed by Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman and others in 1947, became the breeding ground for the development of the modern day, limited government, free-market think tanks, more formally known as public-policy organizations.  Some of us, who were involved in the economic transition in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, helped establish free-market think tanks in former communist countries. (In the Balkan countries alone there is a vibrant collection of free-market groups known as the Balkan network, some of whose members from Montenegro and Bulgaria participated in the Brussels conference.) Many countries of the world now have one or more free-market-oriented economic think tanks. The U.S. now has dozens, as many have been formed to deal with state or regional issues.
