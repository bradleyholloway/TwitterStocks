 AT&T May Bring in Operating Chief To Help Manage Breakup of Company   By By Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2000  The AT&T chief operating officer position could be a tough sell for a lot of potential candidates. AT&T is about to go through an enormous transformation and what will remain of the company will consist of its slowest-growth businesses that are experiencing a rapid decline due to pricing pressures in the voice long-distance business. And AT&T has already been searching for someone to head the consumer long-distance business since early this year.  If AT&T does end up hiring a chief operating officer that person could, ostensibly, even succeed Mr. [Michael Armstrong]. The 62-year-old CEO has said he plans to stay with AT&T through the transition but could leave the company before the mandatory retirement age of 65. Some speculate that Wall Street's cool reception to the breakup plan could force Mr. Armstrong to leave earlier.
