 Grain futures prices decline as killing freeze forecast for entire corn belt fails to materialize   By Taylor, Jeffrey; Kilman, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1993  Grain prices are declining on the CBOT as a killing freeze forecast for the entire Corn Belt failed to materialize and favorable weather in the Midwest has allowed harvesting to begin.
