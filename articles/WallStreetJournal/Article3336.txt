 Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2000  Ms. St. John, whose "The Essence of the Thing" was short-listed for Britain's Booker Prize in 1998, carries this off with exceptional economy and clarity. This slim volume is enormously eloquent about love, faith, betrayal and compromise. For [Flora] isn't merely the pathetic cuckolded wife. Aware that something's deeply wrong with her marriage -- though unaware of the precise nature of [Simon Beaufort]'s betrayal -- she returns to the Christian roots she cast off when she first met Simon.  Flora's exploration of religious faith has a direct bearing on her struggle with the lack of honesty in her marriage. In both cases, she is engaged in a search for some kind of overarching truth. Ultimately, readers come to care less about when Flora will discover Simon's affair than where she is heading on her personal journey. Still, there is no need to brace for a heavy-duty account of one woman's spiritual evolution. Far from it. "A Pure Clear Light" is composed of a series of short chapters with lots of dialogue, reflective of Ms. St. John's light, wry touch.
