 More Limited Form of Mold Insurance Emerges   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2003  As mold has become a big legal and financial problem for landlords, many insurers have sharply reduced or even stopped offering mold coverage in their traditional property and liability policies. Instead, a handful of insurers are offering mold coverage in separate environmental insurance policies, under the umbrella of indoor air quality.  Environmental policies that include mold insurance tend to pay mold-removal costs and sometimes will cover the cost of rebuilding the property if the situation warrants that, says Eric T. Schake, a managing director at insurance broker Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Cos. of New York. The policies also tend to pay the costs for defense of any claims from tenants, he says. But the payouts are capped at an average of about $20 million. Such coverage under property and liability policies had limits of hundreds of millions of dollars in the past, Mr. Schake says.
