 Freddie Mac, Motorola, Alcoa Decline in Down Day for Stocks   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2003  Freddie Mac plummeted $9.62, or 16%, to $50.25 after announcing President David Glenn was let go due to "serious questions about the timeliness and completeness of his cooperation and candor with the board's audit committee counsel." Fannie Mae, which like Freddie Mac provides liquidity in the home-mortgage market, fell 3.63, or 4.8%, to 71.31. Other diversified financials were also chilled by the news, with Capital One Financial dropping 2.57, or 4.9%, to 50.08, Providian Financial declining 56 cents, or 5.5%, to 9.55, and Total System Services losing 1.05, or 4.7%, to 21.50.  Motorola tumbled 21 cents, or 2.4%, to 8.68 after cutting its sales and earnings outlook for the second quarter, blaming the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome and too much inventory in Asia. Communications-chip makers suffered on the news, with Texas Instruments losing 73 cents, or 3.5%, to 20.22, National Semiconductor dropping 89 cents, or 3.9%, to 22.25 and Silicon Laboratories plunging 1.57, or 5.4%, to 27.42 on the Nasdaq, becoming a small stock because it no longer meets the large-cap threshold of having at least a $1.5 billion market capitalization.  Oracle fell 23 cents, or 1.8%, to 12.86 on the Nasdaq after its $5.1 billion unsolicited buyout offer was rejected by PeopleSoft. PeopleSoft added eight cents to 17.90 and J.D. Edwards, the applications-software maker PeopleSoft wants to buy, shed 13 cents, or 1%, to 13.07, both on the Nasdaq.
