 Some Common Sense And Uncommon Effort Spare Vermont Diner   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  Ian Zoda moved to Brattleboro last spring. After eating at the restaurant, he started attending the weekly Wednesday-night members meetings to see how he might help. Mr. [Dan Savel] showed him the kitchen and said, "If you want it, it's yours."  Saving the Common Ground requires doing some pretty basic things -- like paying bills. When Mr. Zoda arrived last May, the restaurant had $4,000 in the bank but owed thousands to the telephone and electric companies, Black River Produce, and other suppliers. It had been making only the minimum monthly payments required to keep the lights on and the phones working.  THERE WAS ALSO the matter of back taxes. Several months ago, a local IRS agent told the new crew the restaurant hadn't filed taxes for six years. He and Mr. Zoda worked out a payment plan. To date, the Common Ground has paid about $10,000 toward debts, Mr. Zoda says. "Anything extra in the bank is going back to paying bills," he says.
