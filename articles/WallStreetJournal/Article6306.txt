 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Books: Call It Viagra   By Akst, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 2004  Such questions are at the heart of "Wordcraft," [Alex Frankel]'s look at the business of naming names. A young journalist in San Francisco, Mr. Frankel had some first-hand experience as a "naming consultant" during the dot-com boom and afterward decided to research the whole subject. The result is a thoughtful and engaging exploration of how companies and products get their names nowadays, as well as the function of brands in a global culture.  Mr. Frankel focuses on BlackBerry and four other brands: Accenture, Viagra, the Porsche Cayenne and IBM's "e-business." His account is leavened by, among other things, a chronicle of his own naming misadventures, a brief survey of how brand names function in contemporary fiction and a profile of a typically quirky freelance "namer." Readers of "Wordcraft" will discover that Shakespeare is credited with coining some 1,500 words ("including lackluster, bandit and watchdog") and that most of us have learned 60,000 words by the time we're 18 -- meaning we average 10 new words a day from our first birthday on.  So just how do companies and products get named? It's not easy. Businesses are so obsessed with branding that names are seen as crucial, yet finding a good one -- not yet trademarked -- can be difficult. On "Seinfeld," when Cosmo Kramer and Frank Costanza invent a product to relieve the stresses of male mammary overdevelopment, their do-it-yourself approach to naming ends up in an argument over the relative merits of "the bro" and "the manssiere."
