 Dollar Gains Slightly on Euro   By Molinski, Dan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was at 119.72 yen, compared with 119.73 Tuesday, while the euro was at 149.88 yen from 150.10 yen. The euro was at $1.2524 from $1.2537. The dollar was at 1.2723 Swiss francs from 1.2700 francs, while sterling was fetching $1.8552 from $1.8548.  The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's Sept. 20 meeting, at which interest rates were left on hold at 5.25%, weren't conclusive one way or the other about the Fed's leanings on rate moves. However, analysts noted that inflation remains a strong FOMC concern.
