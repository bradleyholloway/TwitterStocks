 Freddie Mac Profit Rose 16% in 3rd Period   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1989  RESTON, Va. -- The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s third-quarter earnings rose 16%, mainly reflecting an increase in net interest margin.  Net rose to $112 million -- a record quarterly level for Freddie Mac -- or $1.68 per voting common share, compared with $97 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier.  David Glenn, chief financial officer, attributed the improvement to a $35 million increase in net interest margins -- the difference between the return on Freddie Mac's sold and retained portfolio of mortgages and what it paid out as interest on debt securities and for related costs.
