 NASD Charges Josephthal With Fraud; President of Sterling Foster Is Fined   By By Terzah Ewing, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2000  The NASD said Josephthal, which underwrote the initial public stock offering of VictorMaxx Technologies Inc. and was the company's major Nasdaq Stock Market market maker, supported the stock from August 1995 until the beginning of May 1996. The NASD said Josephthal over that time built an inventory of VictorMaxx stock and suffered a loss of between $3 million and $4 million on it.  In late May of 1996, the NASD alleged, Josephthal officials, including Dan D. Purjes, its chief executive officer, Paul H. Fitzgerald, its managing director of capital markets, and Matthew I. Balk, its former senior managing director for equity marketing, decided to make back the losses by selling the stock to Josephthal's customers. Moreover, the NASD said the three officials offered the firm's sales force commissions of about 29% of an investor's total purchase of the stock.
