 In The Fray: Fouling Out the Wrong Player --- Why Penalize LeBron James When the Whole System Profited From His Talents?   By By Allen Barra, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  The decision to end Mr. [James]'s amateur status was made by the Ohio High School Athletic Association. The OHSAA is a member of the National Federation of State High School Associations, which is roughly the high school equivalent of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. As with the NCAA, one of the OHSAA's primary functions is to be watchdog for its members' athletic financial concerns. In practice, this means keeping a tight control over the athletes' revenue-generating potential, and in LeBron James, St. Vincent-St. Mary High School found a cash cow bigger than anything it had previously dreamt of.  Why? The dirty secret behind the enormous success of the NBA (and, for that matter, the National Football League) has been that they are subsidized by American colleges. Unlike baseball with its extensive minor league system, pro football and basketball pay not a dime for the training and development of their own players. Not only that, but traditionally their major stars arrive gift-wrapped in national celebrity. In many cases, the players were already household names before playing a single minute as a pro. In Mr. James's case, the NBA is lucky; it would be impossible to be more famous before turning pro than Mr. James is right now. Unfortunately for the NBA, the same cannot be said for many other future players who will lack the polish, maturity and, alas, the name recognition of LeBron James.  The OHSAA, the NCAA and the NBA would all have us grieve over LeBron James's missed opportunities for a college education. But it is not a college education that James is giving up. It is college basketball, and $20 million or so can get you some crackerjack tutors.
