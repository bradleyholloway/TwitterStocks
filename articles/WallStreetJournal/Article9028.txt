 Theater: The Metamorphosis of a Classic   By By Joel Henning, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1998  Chicago -- Mary Zimmerman doesn't exactly write her plays, nor does she exactly direct them. Instead, she transforms old texts into new staged works over the course of rehearsals. Her "Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci," which Ms. Zimmerman created for Chicago's Goodman Theatre in 1993 and then took to New York and Seattle, is an intensely visual and elaborately choreographed interpretation of Leonardo's notes and observations. She's also brought a fresh perspective to "The Odyssey," "The Arabian Nights" and the ancient Chinese epic, "Journey to the West." And now we have Ms. Zimmerman's newest creation, "Ovid's Metamorphoses," in an extended run through the holidays with her resident troupe, this city's Lookingglass Theatre Company.  In an interview, Ms. Zimmerman, who keeps her day job as an assistant professor of performance studies at Northwestern University, said she was looking for scientific texts on sight and vision to share with her theater students when she came upon "shelf after shelf" of Leonardo's notebooks. "I found the quality of his writing mysteriously animated, double-valenced, symbolic, wanting to be released." She was taken with his justification for anatomical drawings of human organs as opposed to mere textual descriptions, and quotes Leonardo: "For with what words could you describe this human heart? The more you try, the more it shall elude you." Leonardo, says Ms. Zimmerman, "talks about physical properties in a way that is absolutely anthropomorphic and philosophical. For example, he says that `Force is only the desire for flight.' That's physically true, but it also says that people who act out of force are acting out of panic and aggressiveness." When Ms. Zimmerman stages such texts, "I can get multiple meanings. That's what the theater excels at, unlocking treasure boxes of meaning and image."
