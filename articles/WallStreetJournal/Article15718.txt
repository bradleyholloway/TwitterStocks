 Taste -- de gustibus: Digging In To Save Civilization   By By Max Boot, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1998  Those who work with me at the Journal's editorial page -- or who read my occasional articles -- no doubt think that I spend all my waking hours deeply pondering judicial activism and its grave repercussions for our legal system. Not so. Denouncing the legal system is only my hobby. My true passion is gardening.  Like many converts, I came by my calling late in life. Before this year, when I was still an apartment dweller, I used to spend my weekends on such idle pursuits as beach-going, tennis-playing and cockroach-hunting. Now I feel as if I have awakened from a dream: How could I have wasted so much time when I might have been rooting around in the dirt like a kid?  The scales fell from my eyes after my wife and I moved into a house in the suburbs. Along with the antique appliances, a leaky basement and other amenities came a swath of green cradling the house. I had seen such things before, but only from a distance. As an apartment dweller, I knew that trees and bushes and lawns existed; but only in the sense that you know Mars exists. It never impinged on my own existence.
