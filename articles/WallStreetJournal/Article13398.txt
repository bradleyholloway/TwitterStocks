 Health Costs: Bigger Burden for Women   By McGinley, Laurie, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  Part of the reason women need more health care is "just biology," Ms. [Judith Waxman] says, as women's reproductive systems need regular checkups. In addition, the study found women more likely than men to use prescription drugs on a regular basis, and twice as likely to have mental-health problems such as depression and anxiety.  Ms. Waxman also speculates that women, determined to take care of their families, end up denying themselves needed health care if there's not enough time and money for everything. "It's hard to get to a specialist, both in terms of time and money," she says. "And women put their kids first."  Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, an Alexandria, Va., think tank that promotes free-market health reform, criticizes the analysis as "overly narrow." She notes that high- deductible plans tend to have lower premiums than traditional policies, allowing women to use the savings for routine expenses. She also says that many high-deductible plans cover mammograms and other preventive services.
