 Sunday Investment Dartboard: Calling All Entries for Stock Contest No. 14   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2003  It's time for another Sunday Journal Investment Dartboard contest, the latest in our series of overlapping six-month games where readers vie with each other and a dartboard portfolio to be the best. Don't delay. The final day for entries in this new competition will be Sunday, Dec. 21.  Don't worry about getting beaten by a bunch of pesky darts. No matter how well the dartboard stocks perform, there is always a human winner in our competitions. The reader and dart choices will be announced in early January.
