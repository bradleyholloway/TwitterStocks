 As Europe Redraws Its Rules, Firms Call for Focus on Growth --- Tussle Between Social, Economic Aims Resurfaces As EU Drafts a Constitution   By By Brandon Mitchener, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2002  Striking that balance is nothing new for the EU; its key 1992 treaty on closer union emphasized both growth and stability. Big business, however, says it wants the union to finish what it began in that year: the creation of a borderless economy in Europe, with no barriers to the free movement of goods, capital and people. "A lot of people think the common market has been completed, but it's not," says Timo Lahteenmaki, head of the European Telecommunications Platform, which represents telephone companies.  He calls for greater enforcement of the rules that rolled back barriers to cross-border trade and investment in Europe. To that end, business groups are lobbying the convention to give EU courts and the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, more power to enforce regulations. An EU Constitution must "strengthen the ability of the European Commission and the European Court of Justice to monitor and police the application of EU law," Unilever Chairman Niall FitzGerald told convention delegates in October.
