 Future of `Nightline' Discussed Before Talks With Letterman   By By Joe Flint and Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2002  The news that Walt Disney Co.'s ABC was trying to replace Ted Koppel's "Nightline" program with a David Letterman talk show shocked ABC News staffers last week. But in reality, Disney and ABC officials have been mulling the future of "Nightline" for some time, with ABC News officials often included in the discussion, according to people close to the situation.  Others counter that it may be hard for ABC to match even the $25 million or so in profit that people close to Mr. Letterman's "Late Show" say CBS makes. For starters, ABC will pay more for the show than CBS does. Currently, Mr. Letterman gets about $30 million a year and his production company takes in around $50 million in license fees. Both figures are expected to go up no matter who gets Mr. Letterman.
