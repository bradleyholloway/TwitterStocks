 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2004  A: No, replies the Internal Revenue Service. See Publication 526 ("Charitable Contributions"), available on the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov). Turn to page six, and look under the heading: "Contributions From Which You Benefit."  If you receive, or expect to receive, a "financial or economic benefit," you can't deduct "the part of the contribution that represents the value of the benefit you receive," the IRS says. That answer specifically includes "tuition, or amounts you pay instead of tuition, even if you pay them for children to attend parochial schools or qualifying non-profit day-care centers."  Tuition payments aren't deductible as charitable donations because "there really is no 'gift,'" says Victoria B. Bjorklund, a partner at the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York. The person making the payment "is receiving education services in return for her payment," says Ms. Bjorklund, a former head of the American Bar Association tax section's committee on exempt organizations. "This is a very commonly asked question."
