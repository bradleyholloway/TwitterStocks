 Entertainment: Shopping Around [2]  By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  Designer Cynthia Rowley and business partner Ilene Rosenzweig are introducing cards under their Swell label later this month. Handbag maven Kate Spade is selling holiday cards with crisp designs like a black-and-white snowball print, and retail chain Anthropologie is featuring its own cards bearing chic-looking skaters with sweaters of real fabric. They are part of a new wave of cards informed by the spirit that holiday cards don't have to be tacky.
