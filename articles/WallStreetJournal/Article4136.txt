 Jovito Salonga Faces Tough Odds In the Pursuit of Marcos's Wealth   By By Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  As chairman of the Philippines's new Commission on Good Government, he has no full-time investigative staff. His Washington counterparts are volunteers. The commission's $2.5-million budget contains no provision for administrative expenses, and it's hardly enough to finance potentially exhaustive, and certainly expensive, legal battles to win back billions of dollars the commission believes Mr. Marcos appropriated during his presidency.  Moreover, when Mr. Salonga comes to Washington on Wednesday, he will face a White House that already has told his commission that the administration is leaning toward declaring itself a non-custodian of documents Mr. Marcos brought with him to Hawaii, meaning the claimants would have to take their demands down the long road to court.  One focus of the commission is the supposed Marcos real estate holdings in New York. Over the weekend, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) returned from Manila to announce that he had seen in Mr. Salonga's possession a "smoking gun," "dynamite" evidence linking Mr. Marcos to Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, two brothers in New York real estate who manage the properties in question.
