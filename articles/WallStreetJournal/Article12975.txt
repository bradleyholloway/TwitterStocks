 Moving On: Papa, Don't Preach: Why Some Fathers Don't Relate Well to Their Daughters   By Zaslow, Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2003  The Michigan conference was designed to confront these feelings. I have three daughters -- ages 14, 12 and 8 -- and like other fathers, I winced as session leader Kimber Bishop-Yanke gave us the bad news. Most of our daughters, she said, will be lifelong dieters, have a distorted body image, and be emotionally scarred by cliques and bullies. "We have a lot of girls walking around saying mean things to themselves: 'I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm stupid.' " A dad's job is to remind a daughter of her strengths, and to guide her as she moves into womanhood.  That's why it's crucial to monitor the influences in our daughters' lives -- to know not just their friends, but their friends' parents. We can't leave the job to mom alone.  Charlie Solis attended the conference because his 17-year-old daughter heard about it and filled out his application. They've been at odds, mostly over her demands for more freedom. She has a generous curfew of 1:30 a.m. on weekends, but her friends have no curfew at all, which leaves Mr. Solis exasperated that their parents won't set boundaries. He's also perturbed by the way his daughters' peers dress. "At her high school, I'd swear I was walking through the red-light district," he says.
