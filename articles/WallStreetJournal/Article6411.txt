 What Hewlett-Packard Seeks in a Successor to Fiorina   By Joann S. Lublin and Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2005  Ms. [Patricia C. Dunn] said she anticipates that H-P will select an external candidate, "but we don't know for sure." The board also will scrutinize internal prospects, she added. An H-P director since 1998, she is vice chairwoman of Barclays Global Investors, the huge U.S. money-management arm of Barclays PLC and H-P's third biggest institutional investor.  The most likely internal candidates are Vyomesh "VJ" Joshi, who leads H-P's printing and personal-computing division, and Ann Livermore, head of services and enterprise computing. Under a reorganization plan discussed by the H-P board last month, directors considered a management revamping that would give Mr. Joshi, Ms. Livermore and a third executive more authority and autonomy over key operating units.  H-P would risk losing credibility by choosing an insider "because this is a company that isn't succeeding," said Steve Mader, a vice chairman of Cleveland recruiters Christian & Timbers. The firm assisted H-P in luring Ms. [Carly Fiorina] from Lucent Technologies Inc. to become its first outside leader in July 1999.
