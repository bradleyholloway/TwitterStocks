 Simmons Increases Pressure to Get Chief Of Sea-Land to Quit   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1986  So far, Joseph F. Abely Jr., the Sea-Land chairman and chief executive, hasn't been amenable to the suggestion, a spokesman for Mr. Simmons said. Sea-Land wouldn't comment on the matter.  The investor and two of his representatives have been nominated for seats on Sea-Land's nine-member board, and Mr. Simmons has said he will seek a majority of the board seats next year. Further, Mr. Simmons has said Mr. Abely has told him that Mr. Abely plans to remain in his job only an additional year or two. Mr. Simmons reasons, "Why have a lame duck as CEO?," his spokesman said.
