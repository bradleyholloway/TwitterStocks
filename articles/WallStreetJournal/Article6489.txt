 Personal Health (A Special Report); The Journal Report Online   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  There's not a lot of companies interested in developing drugs to treat flu. There's really not enough producers of vaccine, and we're using 60-year-old technology to make our vaccine. And most of our major innovations in drug- and vaccine-development are driven by economic incentives in the private sector. Flu vaccine is a very low- profit-margin item. To develop a new and better vaccine is something that's well within the reach of the science, but it's going to require a lot of investment for what might not be a very large return. We just have to help motivate them.  About 32% of those polled in the online survey of 2,286 adults say in the past they haven't filled a prescription because they felt it was unnecessary, while 16% didn't get a diagnostic test. And more than one-fifth of respondents say they've chosen to get a second opinion because they felt their doctors' recommendations were too aggressive.  Much attention "has been given to public concerns about aggressive profiteering on the part of pharmaceutical companies and other sectors of the health-care industry," says Katherine Binns, senior vice president at Harris Interactive. "These findings suggest that to some extent the public is also leery of the motivations behind physicians' decisions regarding patient care."
