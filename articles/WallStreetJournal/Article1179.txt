 Videogame Titans Show Split on Sales Strategy   By Nick Wingfield and Yukari Iwatani Kane, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2007  Nintendo's offerings included a new wireless controller for its Wii console that users will press with their feet as they perform a variety of physical activities like heading virtual soccer balls and doing stretches. The company also played up plans to use a variety of games to appeal to "hard core" gamers, a market that Sony and Microsoft are vigorously courting with their PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems, both of which enable more realistic graphics than is possible with the Wii.  Nintendo said it plans to take the Wii deeper into the realm of fitness with its new pressure-sensitive controller, dubbed the Wii Balance Board, that users will stand on to manipulate on-screen action. The company showed the board in action with a game called Wii Fit, in which players can earn points by hopping on and off it like an aerobic step board in sync with visual cues on the screen.
