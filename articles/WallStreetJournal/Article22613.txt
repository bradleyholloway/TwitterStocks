 New Hampshire Primary -- Potomac Watch: A Vote for Character...   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2000  This is the only way to explain this week's rebellion of the nonrebellious, in which voters in both parties elevated two insurgent candidates despite peace and prosperity as broad as any in 75 years. Republican John McCain trounced George W. Bush by running explicitly as the anti-Clinton. Bill Bradley nearly beat a sitting vice president because he finally, in the last week, linked presidential trust to Democratic principles and their chances in November.  This is the essence of both the McCain and Bradley appeals, as rallies two days apart in this liberal bourgeois village showed. Wandering around a McCain event at Exeter High is Ken Khachigian, a charter Reagan tax cutter now working for the Arizona war hero.  Mr. Bradley's trust riff is kinder and gentler than Mr. McCain's, and it can be condescending. As Ron Brownstein has put it, as reformers Mr. McCain is the warrior and Mr. Bradley the priest. But in the last week the Democrat borrowed from Mr. McCain by connecting the dots between Mr. [Al] Gore's "distortions" and the Democrats' ability to win in November. "If we don't clean our own house, the Republicans will clean it for us," Mr. Bradley now says.
