 Love & Money: When Kids Are Appreciative...Not   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2007  The main problem, he says, is that "a lot of money" doesn't mean much to her. "It's just a number," he says. "A $5 Beanie Baby is sort of equivalent to a $100 theater ticket or a $500 weekend trip to an amusement park. She doesn't truly appreciate them any differently because she doesn't make money. So how could she really understand why I want a lot more appreciation for one over the other?"  Still, he says, "when I do the guilt-trip thing, she'll thank me and say she appreciates it, and she'll usually stop complaining, at least out loud. But it's frustrating because I can tell they are just words. It isn't coming from her heart."  As for the guilt trips, "avoid them," [Denise] says. "Instead, try to step back and speak from your own experiences with appreciation and how it relates to this incident. Guilt isn't going to work, and at some point it's going to affect the way your child thinks."
