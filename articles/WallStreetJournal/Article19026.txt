 Factory Orders Slipped 0.9% In February   By By Elizabeth Daerr, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  Factory orders slipped moderately in February, but demand for manufactured goods still remained strong indicating continued strength in the U.S. economy.  The 0.9% drop in orders followed a 0.6% increase in January, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, however, orders increased 0.2% in February.  As part of its report, the Commerce Department also revised upward the preliminary estimate for February factory orders for durable goods that was announced last week. Orders for durable goods, big-ticket items made to last more than three years, fell 1.1% for the month, instead of the previously reported 1.7% decline.
