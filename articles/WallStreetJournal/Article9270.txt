 Watching the Web:   By By Andrea Petersen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2000  For my first attempt, I ordered a Polaroid I-Zone camera as a birthday present for my friend Marla. From my temporary Mexico City home, I arranged to have it giftwrapped and sent to her in New York. (Kozmo.com warns that someone has to be at the recipient's address to sign for the delivery. I had to call and make sure Marla would be home, which kind of ruined the surprise. Kozmo.com will make one additional delivery attempt at no extra cost.) I paid $2.99 for giftwrap and a $3.99 gift handling fee.  This service sends traffic information to users' cell phones, pagers, Palm devices or the Web. Just input your normal driving routes -- including the highways and exits you frequent -- and TrafficStation will send warnings of accidents or bad traffic to your preferred device. (Though those using TrafficStation's free service can get only e-mail alerts.) You can specify which days and hours you want alerts, for example: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. TrafficStation monitors only highway traffic, so it won't tell you about the gridlock on side roads. The site's "QuickCheck" has free traffic maps of more than two dozen U.S. cities. TrafficStation's information on public transportation is disappointing. The service, called "Transit-Check," consists of links to the home pages of various regional transit authorities. It would be much more useful if -- at the very least -- TrafficStation sent users directly to those sections that display service alerts. TrafficStation lets users track one route and get two alerts via e-mail per day for free. Subscribers, who pay $5.95 a month, can track as many as 20 routes and get unlimited e-mail, WAP phone and pager alerts.
