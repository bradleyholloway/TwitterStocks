 No Exit in Somalia   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2007  The strikes in Somalia are also a reminder that in the war on terror there is no "exit strategy" short of victory. The last U.S. military venture in Somalia is broadly remembered as a military and political fiasco, particularly after the notorious "Black Hawk Down" battle in which 18 U.S. servicemen were killed, in part for want of adequate armor.  What the U.S. can do for Somalia is offer meaningful logistical, military and humanitarian assistance to the Transitional Federal Government, which the CIA previously eschewed in favor of financing local warlords. TFG President Abdullahi Yusuf may not be a model democrat, but he showed his stripes well enough when he said of Sunday's air strikes that the U.S. "has a right to bombard terrorist suspects who attacked its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania." If only we received the same level of candid cooperation from Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.
