 Moving the Market: Merrill Settles Enron Claims   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2006  Merrill also agreed to drop about $74 million of claims in bankruptcy court against the remnants of Enron. Earlier, Merrill had transferred about $10 million of claims to another party. Previous claims in the Enron bankruptcy have been settled at about 20 cents on the dollar.  "The settlement reflects that Merrill Lynch was involved in fewer transactions with Enron than certain of the other MegaClaim defendants," Enron said.
