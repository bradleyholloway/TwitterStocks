 Federated, Dayton Hudson Overcome Poor Holiday Season, Post Solid Results   By By Wendy Bounds and Robert Berner, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1998  Despite a dismal holiday shopping season, two major retailers posted strong fiscal fourth-quarter profits, with net income rising 31% for Federated Department Stores Inc. and 66% for Dayton Hudson Corp.  For the 13 weeks ended Jan. 31, Cincinnati-based Federated reported net income of $379.1 million, up from $289.2 million. Diluted earnings per share, or net income divided by common shares outstanding plus potential new shares from securities such as options, rose to $1.66 from $1.31 a year earlier.  Sales for the quarter climbed to $5.06 billion from $5.03 billion a year earlier. The sales gain came even amid a weak holiday season that plagued retailers across the country, including Federated-operated stores such as Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's. Notably, on a comparable-store basis, Federated's fourth-quarter sales inched up only 1.4%.
