 Merrill Lynch Told To Pay $2.27 Million In Award by Jury --- Client Estate Wins Damages For Excessive Trading; Brokerage Plans to Appeal   By By Janet Guyon, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1987  A federal court jury in Sioux Falls, S.D., awarded a late widow's estate $2.27 million because of alleged churning in her account by brokers of Merrill Lynch & Co.  The award, which includes $20,000 in compensatory damages and $2.25 million in punitive damages, includes the largest punitive damage against a stockbroker in the state, attorneys said. Churning is excessive trading in a customer's account by a broker seeking to generate commissions.  According to the attorney for the estate of Ethlyn Davis, brokers in Merrill's Minneapolis office made an inordinate number of trades between February 1982 and August 1984, when the account was handled by a sales assistant, Stephen Ulrich, after Mrs. Davis's husband, Leonard, died in 1981.
