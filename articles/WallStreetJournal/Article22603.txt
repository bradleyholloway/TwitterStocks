 Y2K: A SMOOTH START -- Demand for Cash Was Normal at Banks, So Fed Will Take Back Extra Currency   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger and John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  The Federal Reserve, anticipating heavy demand for cash by Americans worried about possible year-2000 disruptions, flooded the nation's banks with extra currency in recent months. With the changeover complete and no panic in sight, the Fed will now help drain all that money out of circulation.  Starting today, banks are expected to pack the cash into armored cars and return it to Fed offices. Fed officials said that if banks make a special request by 1 p.m. in their local time zones today, regional Federal Reserve Banks will consider extending the normal hours that they receive armored cars delivering return cash from private institutions.  With help from the Fed, "we're going to see the river reverse its flow," said Fed governor Edward Kelley, the agency's point man on Y2K. "We're sensitive to the fact that depository institutions want to get that excess cash out of their vaults and off their balance sheets as fast as they can."
