 Dance: Something `Altogether Different'   By By Robert Greskovic, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1999  New York -- Downtown is traditionally where you go in America to find a city's main attractions. New Yorkers do it upside down. In this city's dance world, uptown is where the big leaguers play; downtown is for smaller scale enterprises and budding artists in plain and sometimes raw spaces. Straddling the middle ground, at least in style, is the Joyce Theater.  Even though this prettily converted movie house is just down the block from Dance Theater Workshop, one of downtown's more venerable performance spaces, the Joyce is still considered a step up in the climb from budding dance organization to big-time establishment status. Since 1986, the Joyce has offered specially planned samplers of various groups deemed ready to make a break into what might be called more "legit" dance theaters. The now-annual winter series has been dubbed "Altogether Different."
