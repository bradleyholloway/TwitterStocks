 Currency Plan In EU Spurs Bids For U.S. Laws --- Bankers and Traders Fear A Deal Won't Be a Deal After Launch of Euro   By By John Carreyrou, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1997  There are still plenty of doubters that the euro, as the common currency is to be called, will ever come into being, let alone arrive on schedule in 1999. But just in case, several financial-market associations have spearheaded passage of new state laws to prevent people in the U.S. from trying to opt out of unprofitable contracts by arguing that they are based on currencies that no longer exist.  The legislatures of New York, Illinois and California are in the midst of passing bills to guarantee that financial contracts in German marks, Dutch guilders and other European currencies slated to become obsolete remain valid beyond the planned Jan. 1, 1999, launch of the currency union.  Among the most perilous is a 1964 case, Interstate Plywood Sales Co. vs Interstate Container Corp. The case involves a contract under which Interstate Plywood Sales had the option to buy a certain quantity of plywood from Interstate Container at "market price," which was defined as the "published market price" of five mills.
