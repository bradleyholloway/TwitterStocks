 The Economy: Workers' Productivity Tops Earlier Estimate --- Job Creation Is Concern; Gauge of Services Sector Rises to Four-Month High   By By Greg Ip and Joseph Rebello, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2003  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the International Monetary Conference in Berlin Tuesday that the U.S.'s "exceptionally weak labor market" is "in large part a consequence of the inability of our economy to grow sufficiently fast -- that is, faster than underlying productivity growth -- in order to get the demand for labor to move up."  Yesterday, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert McTeer said increased international competition has "spurred productivity growth because a lot of U.S. firms in recent years have not been able to make pricing increases stick. So they've been forced to cut costs and do things more efficiently. Trade and imports from places like China and Mexico have been very important in helping us to bring the inflation rate down and to the extent we are now in the range of price stability . . . it has obviously brought us closer to the problem of deflation."  U.S. manufacturers say China's pegged currency has given it an unfair trade advantage, by making its exports cheaper in the U.S. Mr. McTeer said the dollar's recent fall should help narrow the U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world.
