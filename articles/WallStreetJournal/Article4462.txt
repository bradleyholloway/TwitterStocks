 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Lynn Asinof, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1988  Personal-computer software sales grew 48% during the first three quarters of 1988, says the Software Publishers Association. "The growth rates are up significantly since last year," when no category grew more than 25%, says Kenneth Wasch, executive director. One reason: More people are updating their software, buying new releases much as they do in the record industry, he says. Moreover, proliferation of low-cost PC clones "has helped the market tremendously," says Heidi Roizen of T/Maker Co., Mountain View, Calif.  "Ten years ago, most people wouldn't have been caught dead going out of town on Thanksgiving," says Nina Meyer of Vision Travel Inc., Miami. Now, she says, people see the holiday as a way to get away, noting some 60% of Thanksgiving travel has nothing to do with families getting together. Professional Travel Corp., Denver, says reservations for Thanksgiving travel are up 25% to 30% from last year. The top destination: Las Vegas. Other popular Thanksgiving spots include Florida and the Caribbean, which get "hotter" every year, says a Michigan AAA travel spokesman.  November is increasingly a time to be thankful for frequent-flier programs, says Jennings & Sliva Travel Services Inc., Detroit. More than half its Thanksgiving bookings are frequent-flier awards. Lower airfares also help. Still, some say Thanksgiving trails other holiday weekends. "We don't get nearly as many requests from people going away for Thanksgiving as we do for Easter, New Year's and Memorial Day," says Pearl Nina of Nina Travel Service, Miami.
