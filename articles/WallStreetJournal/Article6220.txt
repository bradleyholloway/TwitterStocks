 SEC May Give Investors More Power; Plan Allows Shareholders To List Board Nominees On Official Company Proxy   By Solomon, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2003  "Something measured has to be done to make it possible for significant shareholders who are not simply intrusive and disruptive to be involved in the process," one SEC official said. In April, SEC Chairman William Donaldson said the "time has come" for a thorough review of the proxy rules to "ensure that they are serving the best interests of today's investors."  In a letter to the SEC last month, the Business Roundtable, a trade group representing large corporations, said investors "may nominate directors for self-serving reasons, such as personal gain or to further a political agenda." Intel Corp., in a letter last month, said giving investors access would "turn the proxy statement into a municipal or state voter's handbook" and confuse shareholders with too many candidates.
