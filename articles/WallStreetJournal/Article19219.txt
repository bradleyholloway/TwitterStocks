 HSBC Nears Pact for Republic New York --- Safra, Bank Firm's Founder, Offers to Restructure Sale of His 29% Stake   By By Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1999  Edmond J. Safra, the Republic founder who owns a 29% stake in the bank, is offering to restructure the sale of his stake to help facilitate a deal, these people say. One idea under discussion would have Mr. Safra putting as much as $1 billion from his $3.3 billion stake into an escrow account, which would cover the cost of settling any claims linked to a recent scandal involving a unit of Republic. Mr. Safra would get the balance.  On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shares in Republic were down 18.75 cents at $64.6875. Shares in HSBC fell 0.48%, or to 731 pence from 734.5 in London. An official at HSBC declined to comment. A Republic official said Mr. Safra was unavailable for comment.  HSBC put the deal on hold after federal prosecutors alleged an employee of the Republic unit had inflated the assets held on its books at the behest of Mr. (Martin A.) Armstrong of Princeton Economics International Ltd., in New Jersey. In September, Mr. Armstrong was arrested on fraud charges for allegedly using Republic documents misstating the value of assets under his control to entice Japanese investors to invest in products Mr. Armstrong was marketing in Tokyo. Mr. Armstrong has denied the charges.
