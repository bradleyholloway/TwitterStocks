 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Tastings: Fair-Weather Friends; For Summer, a Few Faithful Whites; What We'd Serve at the Ballpark   By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  WHEW. FINALLY, warmer weather is here, which means it's time for us to drink some of our favorite white wines. We have written before about many great summer whites -- Pinot Gris from Oregon, Muscadet from France, fine white Bordeaux and many others. This time, we thought we'd share with you some other specific whites that have been our own summer favorites over the years. These wines haven't necessarily been the best in our blind tastings. They're simply special to us for one reason or another. When we run into a store to pick up something familiar and comfortable in summer, these are the bottles we often look for. In today's language, we guess you'd call them our "default" choices, but somehow that doesn't convey our genuine affection for these wines. Of course, there's no reason to drink them only in summer, but we associate them with warm weather, so that's what we do.  -- La Spinetta (Rivetti) Moscato d'Asti from Italy ($18.99). Moscato d'Asti is one of the world's most delightful wines -- light as a feather, slightly sweet and spritzy and filled with life. It's also low in alcohol (La Spinetta is about 5.5 percent), which we prefer in hot weather. Talk about high praise: We were planning Grandma Dot's 80th birthday when we retasted this recently, and Dottie immediately began to wonder if we could get enough to serve at the party in Tallahassee. As with all of the wines on this list, there are many good alternatives, but in this case, for instance, if we don't see the Spinetta, we tend to turn to Saracco ($13.99).
