 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  Under the old law, Americans working abroad could exclude as much as $80,000 of their foreign-earned income when filing their U.S. taxes. Under the new law, the "foreign earned-income exclusion" rose to $82,400 for this year -- but income above that now is subject to higher tax rates. The new law also greatly reduces the maximum amount of housing costs that workers abroad may exclude or deduct.  "As an American who formerly lived abroad for over 35 years paying full U.S. taxation, the news of yet another tax hike really made my blood boil," a reader writes. "Why the government feels that Americans living abroad need to pay even higher taxes is ridiculous. America is one of the few countries in the world that requires tax payment from nonresidents, and it is particularly galling since basically all that one derives from the tax payments is the ability to carry a U.S. passport. It is basically 'Taxation without Representation.'"
