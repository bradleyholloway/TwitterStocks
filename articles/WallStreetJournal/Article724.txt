 They Serve Less Roe Along Embassy Row As Glamour Fades --- Social Whirl in Washington, Affected by the Realities, Loses Much of Its Glitter   By By Jane Mayer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1986  "A little of the fizz is gone," says power broker and party goer Frederick Dutton. Confides Ina Ginsburg, a socialite and American Film Institute official: "There are fewer of the fun things. It's simply not the same." And a State Department official and veteran party-circuit mainstay, asking to have his name withheld so as not to offend past and future hosts, says: "How has glamour changed in Washington? It was before, and it isn't now."  In short, there is a glamour gap in Washington. The reason: a transformation on Embassy Row. For years, embassies have been "the backbone of Washington glamour," as social columnist Betty Beale puts it. Traditionally, they have operated in a diplomatic never-never land, exempt from such real-world concerns as local parking ordinances and local taxes, and obliged by custom to entertain lavishly. Recently, though, they have found themselves rudely treated by such real-world forces as weakened currencies, faltering economies, revolutions and even terrorism.  There are, of course, exceptions to the broad trend. "They still entertain well at the Swedish Embassy," says the very social Ms. Ginsburg, "and God -- I mean really -- when you start thinking, who else?" The Italians, the French, the Brazilians and the British still have been known to entertain quite sumptuously. Yet some complain that the Italians turned their embassy into "a promotional palace," with blatantly commercial events promoting Italian businesses. And others whisper that the food at the French Embassy hasn't been the same since the Socialists took power.
