 Wedtech Bondholders Looking for Redress After Firm's Quick Trip to Bankruptcy Court   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1987  Wedtech issued $75 million of speculatively rated bonds Aug. 22. The underwriter was Bear, Stearns & Co. On Dec. 15, Wedtech filed for court protection from creditors -- two months before the first interest payment was due.  Wedtech, which makes pontoons, spare parts and small engines, got defense contracts available to minority-owned businesses through the Small Business Administration. But in mid-October, news reports began detailing its financial ties to Rep. Mario Biaggi (D., N.Y.) and to former White House aide Lyn Nofziger, and this triggered a spate of official probes.  But in November, Wedtech said it expected to post a substantial third-quarter loss because of a drop in new government contracts. It has yet to release results for that period. And at a meeting after the bankruptcy-law filing, creditors were told the government receivables were far less than previously reported. (Wedtech said yesterday that its accountant, Touche Ross & Co., has resigned.)
