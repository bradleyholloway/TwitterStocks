 Ashland Coal Inc. Seeks Acquisitions To Boost Its Sales   By By Alecia Swasy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1988  Ashland Coal Inc., attempting to boost coal sales more than one-third, is seeking to make "substantial" acquisitions of other coal companies within the next few months, William C. Payne, president and chief executive officer, said.  While declining to specify the size of the acquisitions, Mr. Payne said the Huntington, W.Va., coal producer is considering several purchases of operators in the Appalachian coal fields of West Virgina and Kentucky. "Fortunately, we're in a fine financial position to spend a lot of money," he said.  Mr. Payne expects the company to focus on growth from acquisitions rather than developing new mines on its own. Coal sales should climb to 10 million tons a year "in a year or two" from current-year estimates of 7.5 million tons, he said in an interview, adding: "And we won't stop there."
