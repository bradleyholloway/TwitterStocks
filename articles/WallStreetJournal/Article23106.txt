 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Sports -- By the Numbers: Call Him Special K   By Allen St. John, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 2, 2004  1. [John Wooden]: While college basketball purists -- and Duke haters -- would consider it sacrilege to compare Mr. [Mike Krzyzewski] to Mr. Wooden, it isn't as big of a mismatch as it seems. Coach K's tournament winning percentage of .800 is within range of the Wizard of Westwood's mark. And while Mr. Wooden's 10 titles are unparalleled, the game has changed enough to merit a footnote. Coach Wooden's title teams played fewer games and stayed in the West region for early-round contests. More to the point, the lure of the NBA has altered college hoops. Since 1999, Mr. Krzyzewski has lost six star players to the pros. If Lew Alcindor, Bill Walton and Gail Goodrich left UCLA early, or skipped school entirely, Mr. Wooden's resume could look a little different.
