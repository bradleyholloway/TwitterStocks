 Lawmakers Expect To Increase Funds For Tsunami Relief   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2005  The $350 million pledged thus far by the Bush administration is "going to go up considerably, I would predict," said House International Relations Committee Chairman Henry Hyde yesterday as lawmakers gathered for the start of the new Congress. The Illinois Republican added that all donor countries should meet "to map out areas of responsibilities" and ensure a more-efficient use of available funds.  Mr. Hyde said he didn't anticipate that the U.N. would run the relief effort, but instead that the body would provide a forum through which donors could coordinate with one another. "There has to be authority to do that, and I would hope it would be the U.N. rather than the United States," he said. When Congress acts on new relief funding, the chairman said any money should be accompanied by a formal authorization that could also "recognize the authority and some structure to help coordinate relief."  "Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood," Mr. [Dennis Hastert] said, quoting the architect Daniel Burnham, who helped design his home city of Chicago. "In this Congress, big plans will stir men's blood. The 109th Congress will be a Reform Congress."
