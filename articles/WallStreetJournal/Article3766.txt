 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2004  In "The Birth of Venus," [Sarah Dunant] credibly recreates a past world and evokes a young woman's passion for its art. Alessandra's glimpses of quattrocento masterpieces, the models for her own untutored efforts, suggest the thrill that contemporaries must have felt at the sight of now-classic works. The cloistered girl makes an improbable yet effective narrator, describing her surroundings with a painter's eye and assembling a rich account of the period from the reports of various first-hand sources.
