 Washington vs. Microsoft: Don't Repeat IBM Debacle   By By James V. DeLong, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1998  Before going any further down this road, the Senate and the Justice Department should refresh their recollection of some not-so-distant history. In 1982 William F. Baxter, assistant attorney general for antitrust, signed a stipulation of dismissal in U.S. v. IBM. It is a short document, only five paragraphs, declaring that the government had conducted a review and "concluded that the case is without merit and should be dismissed."  The pursuit of IBM was a travesty of legal procedure. The case was filed in 1969; in late 1974, on the eve of trial, the government was allowed to amend its complaint drastically. By 1977, eight years into the case and two years into the trial, IBM had produced 61 million pages of documents -- whereupon the government issued a new subpoena for five billion pages, which were located in 2,000 different IBM facilities. IBM estimated that compliance would have taken 62,000 man-years and cost $1 billion.  IBM was supposed to be a monopolist, but the relevant markets were never clearly defined. When asked, different government lawyers gave different answers. Nor was it clear what specific IBM conduct was supposed to violate antitrust law. An economic autopsy of the case written later by some of IBM's expert economists noted that the government assumed that the company was a monopolist even though it did not act like one. The government dealt with this embarrassing inconsistency by "distort(ing) IBM's competitive acts into `anticompetitive' ones. Nothing is more revealing about the government's case than its constant complaint of low rather than high prices as the symptom of monopoly."
