 Medicine: Vote Sets Back P&G, Syntex On Analgesic   By By Gabriella Stern and Rose Gutfeld, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1993  A joint Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recommended against granting marketing approval to an over-the-counter version of the pain reliever Naprosyn.  The rejection dealt a blow to Procter & Gamble Co. and Syntex Corp., which planned to market the product in a joint venture. P&G has been trying to enter the analgesics market for years to supplement its chest of over-the-counter products, while Syntex, which makes the drug for prescription use, badly needs a growth product to boost earnings, analysts said.  The FDA, which is expected to rule on the application by year end, isn't bound by the joint committee's vote and could choose to approve the application. However, the FDA typically follows advisory committee recommendations.
