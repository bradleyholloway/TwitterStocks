 Starting Up: Venture Funding Turns Positive   By Grimes, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2005  Venture investments rose to $20.4 billion for 2,067 deals from $18.9 billion for 2,092 deals in 2003, according to the new data. Early and "seed-stage" deals for the youngest companies captured 33% of all deals, up from 31% the year before, and accounted for 37% of all venture deals in the fourth quarter, the highest percentage since 2001.  While final figures aren't in yet, many venture experts expect venture capitalists to raise between $16 billion and $17 billion for new funds for 2004 compared with $8.7 billion for 2003. "What new money does is enable people to start to invest at an earlier stage," Mr. [Bryan Pearce] said. "That is in part what is driving the early-stage increase up to 37%."  Mr. Pearce and other experts attributed that to "bulges in the cycle" and more time-consuming early-stage deals. "Lots is going through the pipeline in the latter part of '04 that will be closing," he said.
