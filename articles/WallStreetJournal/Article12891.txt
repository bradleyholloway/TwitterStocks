 Powell Uses Spy Photos, Tapes To Argue Iraq Is Deceiving U.N.   By By David S. Cloud and Marc Champion, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  Reminiscent of Adlai Stevenson's display of spy photographs to the U.N. during the Cuban missile crisis, Mr. [Colin Powell]'s presentation, televised live internationally, sought to document in detail to the U.N. Security Council that Iraq is flouting U.N. disarmament demands and deceiving weapons inspectors.  The new evidence included intercepts of Iraqi officers seeming to order subordinates to stop mentioning nerve agents in radio transmissions and to hide "modified vehicles" -- a possible reference to mobile weapons labs, rocket launchers or some other banned vehicle. One of the phone calls, played while a nearby screen showed U.S.-supplied English translations, was intercepted last Nov. 26, two days before U.N. inspectors were scheduled to return to Iraq for the first time since 1998. After noting the inspectors' pending return, a brigadier general checked with a colonel on whether all his modified vehicles had been evacuated. "They're worried," Mr. Powell said of the two Iraqi officers. "Their concern is that it's something they should not have, something that should not be seen."  To charge that Iraq is harboring al Qaeda-linked operatives, Mr. Powell focused on Abu Musab Zarqawi, an alleged chemical-weapons expert who was briefly hospitalized last summer in Baghdad. Mr. Powell said "al Qaeda affiliates based in Baghdad now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network." But a senior U.S. intelligence officials said Mr. Zarqawi, though he has al Qaeda connections, is more of an independent operative, undercutting Mr. Powell's contention.
