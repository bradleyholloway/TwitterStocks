 Andersen: Called to Account: Grab a Partner: Andersen Rivals Freely Swoop In   By By Sarah McBride, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2002  It also means every Andersen country deal that is announced will be greeted with increased skepticism until it actually closes, because the collapse of the unified Andersen front outside the U.S. makes it easier for local Andersen practices to change their minds and ally with whoever offers them the best terms.  That is on top of Andersen's Hong Kong and China practices announcing a deal with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Japan and Thailand practices announcing deals with KPMG, and the Australia and New Zealand practices announcing deals with Ernst & Young. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu has announced an agreement to merge with Andersen's Spanish practice, but so far hasn't made any moves in Asia.  Take the Hong Kong and China practice, one of the first to defect from the Andersen-KPMG agreement, by signing a memorandum of understanding with Pricewaterhouse. Despite that memo, Ernst & Young Global's head, William Kimsey, said he was flying to Hong Kong last night for internal meetings and hoped to talk to Andersen partners in the city while he was there. Allan Aw, Andersen Hong Kong's managing partner, said he was leaving for London last night and wouldn't be able to meet with Mr. Kimsey.
