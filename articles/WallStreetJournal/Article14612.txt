 Study Says Drug Helps Stroke Victims Cut Risk of Heart Attacks, More Strokes   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1989  A Sanofi S.A. drug seems to cut stroke victims' risk of heart attacks, cardiac deaths and further strokes, according to a study backed by the French pharmaceutical company and Syntex Corp. of the U.S.  The drug, called ticlopidine, apparently lowers such risks by about 30%, with slightly greater benefits for women than for men, the three-year controlled study indicated. The research, involving 1,053 U.S. and Canadian patients, is reported in Lancet, a British medical journal.  Ticlopidine seems to do many of the same things as aspirin, which doctors often prescribe to protect stroke patients despite conflicting reports about its effectiveness. Ticlopidine "looks very promising and is interesting," said Dr. Graham Mulley, a consultant in geriatric medicine at St. James University Hospital in Leeds, England.
