 World Wire [1]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1994  Malaysia's crusade against an unorthodox Islamic group known as Al-Arqam could culminate today with a regional ban on the sect. The Malaysian government views Al-Arqam as a threat to foreign investment and rapid economic growth.  Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are considering barring the teachings of Al-Arqam. The Asean countries are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Most already have initiated some restrictions on the group.  And tomorrow, Malaysia's National Fatwa Council, which rules on Islamic orthodoxy, could decide that Al-Arqam has sharply deviated from the country's religious mainstream. Such a ruling would lend legitimacy to a government crackdown under various laws ranging from secret societies to trade.
