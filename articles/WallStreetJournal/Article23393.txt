 Bill to Aid 401 (k) Investors Raises Bias Concern; Financial Firms Would Get Entree to Advise Workers; Some See Conflict of Interest   By Stearns, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2006  Larry Moss, a senior vice president at Raymond James Financial Inc., who has a 401(k) component to his practice, said the potential conflict of interest for fund companies is a concern, but the expansion of advice options for workers is an offsetting benefit. "There's a retirement crisis in this country. Any way we can get people to participate more in 401(k) plans is a plus," Mr. Moss says. "Any advice is better than no advice."  Many observers say employers are reluctant to provide advice because of the fear of lawsuits by workers dissatisfied with the performance of their portfolios. Under current law, anyone giving investment advice to 401(k) plan participants assumes "fiduciary duty," a legal obligation to act in an investor's best interests. Employers can retain third-party advisers to help employees decide where to put their money, but that doesn't free them from legal liabilities if an employee's account drops sharply. Many believe this has chilled the market for advice.  Employees already have some options for 401(k) advice. Several firms, including Morningstar Inc. of Chicago, Financial Engines of Palo Alto, Calif., and 401K Toolbox of Athens, Ga., provide advice or retirement-account management. In some cases, investors retain these firms directly. In others, employers and 401(k) providers use them to outsource their advisory services. For example, Merrill Lynch uses a third-party service from Morningstar's Ibbotson unit to provide advice directly to investors in the 401(k) plans it provides, which have more than $1 billion in assets.
