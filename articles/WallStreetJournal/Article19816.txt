 Surprising Its Critics, Electronic Balloting Had Minimal Glitches   By Squeo, Anne Marie, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  Though there were scattered problems, early results suggest the machines turned in acceptable, if not perfect, performances, bolstering prospects for Diebold Inc., the industry's biggest player. The company's machines "worked perfectly in Maryland," says Linda Lamone, the administrator of elections for the state, which along with Georgia and Nevada had completely upgraded its older voting technology to touch-screen systems for this week's election.  In Greenville, S.C., for example, two precincts had to use paper ballots in the morning because poll workers didn't set up electronic- voting machines properly. In Florida's Broward County, touch-screen machines failed at various precincts, requiring the provider, Election Systems & Software, based in Omaha, Neb., to replace 21 terminals with backup units. "No votes were ever lost," says Jill Friedman, a company spokeswoman, noting that the company is "confident in the accuracy, reliability and security" of its iVotronic system.  Even Aviel Rubin, the Johns Hopkins University professor who initially found the security and encryption problems in Diebold's software, says users at the Maryland polling station where he worked on Tuesday seemed to like the machines. "Five or six people went out of their way to say they loved them," Mr. Rubin says. Still, he and others suggest one way to alleviate concerns with these machines is to have voter-verified paper receipts that ensure votes were recorded as intended. California, for one, has mandated that its machines have such equipment by January 2006.
