 Kohlberg Kravis Is in Talks to Sell Stake   By By Kara Scannell, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2002  Oregon Investment Council, which oversees roughly $40 billion, first invested with KKR when the buyout firm acquired Fred Meyer Inc. in 1981. The following year it invested in KKR's first pooled-investment fund and has been an investor in each subsequent fund. Washington State, which manages $50.9 billion in retirement money, also invested in KKR's first buyout fund.  Yet the deal also carries risks. Washington and Oregon are already huge investors in KKR, accounting for half of KKR's $5 billion investment fund. Buying a stake in the business would increase their concentration even further and expose them if the firm ever ran into trouble. Some KKR investors have expressed concern about the returns at the firm, which have fallen from their peak in the 1980s.  Formed in 1976 by Henry Kravis, his cousin George Roberts and Jerome Kohlberg, KKR was among the first groups to use large amounts of debt secured by assets to acquire a company in transactions that came to be known as leveraged buyouts. Its early returns were stellar, but in the 1990s, as competition for deals increased and less leverage was available for deals, KKR returns began to suffer, falling behind peers.
