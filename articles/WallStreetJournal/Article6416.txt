 The Old and the New   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2005  There's also the matter of what newcomers do for the country's overall economy. Quite a bit, it turns out. Halting immigration, the SSA data show, would reduce both the growth rate of the U.S. labor force and the rate of the country's GDP "by approximately one quarter of one percent (0.25%) per year, initially, a notable amount." That's a point lost on anti-immigration Republican lawmakers who claim to know something about labor markets.  Immigration alone won't close the Social Security funding gap, so the sooner we begin moving away from the current system, the better. In recent House testimony, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his support for "the general issue of increased immigration" because "it's good for the country," not because it will fix our Social Security problems, which run deeper. That said, immigration both buys us time and ultimately will help make entitlement reform easier. Even under the Bush Administration's proposal to divert a small portion of a worker's payroll tax into a private account, the bulk of the system would remain pay-as-you-go for many years to come.
