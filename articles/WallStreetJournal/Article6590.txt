 How Inflation Gets Fed   By Darda, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2006  The strongest case against the Fed's decision to pause this week was presented by the behavior of several forward-looking price-level indicators in the commodity, currency and credit markets: Gold prices have risen $135/oz. on the year, while the dollar has fallen 6% against G-6 currencies and inflation-linked bond spreads have widened by 33 basis points. In the aftermath of the Fed's decision to pause, gold prices have risen further, inflation-linked bond spreads have widened more and the dollar has continued its weakening trend against the currencies of fairly accommodative central banks. In other words, the FOMC's assumption of "contained inflation expectations" isn't credible.  A host of indicators also cast doubt on the Fed's belief that "the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors" likely will restrain "aggregate demand." Despite 17 Fed rate hikes, real short-term interest rates remain below historical norms and well below levels typically associated with inverted yield curves and recessions. Monetary velocity, the torque behind the money stock, is growing at an above-trend pace with commodity indicators close to record highs. The 1.65 percentage point gap between annual nominal GDP growth and the Fed funds rate continues to stand nearly one full percentage point above historical norms. Emerging-market credit spreads, usually the weakest link in the global liquidity chain, actually have been tightening recently and remain close to record lows. These are not the trappings of a restrictive monetary policy or future weakness in nominal demand.
