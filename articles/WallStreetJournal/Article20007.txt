 Health Costs: HSAs for the Over-65 Set   By McGinley, Laurie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2006  The accounts would differ somewhat from the HSAs offered to younger people, because of restrictions in federal law. Only Medicare -- not individuals -- would be permitted to contribute to the accounts. And beneficiaries wouldn't be permitted to combine their new accounts with any HSAs they set up before enrolling in Medicare.  Even with the limits, Dr. [Mark McClellan] argues, the accounts "make sense for just about anyone who wants to take control over their health-care spending." In particular, he says, "If you have chronic illness but you can control how money is spent, you can get better care at lower cost." In addition, he says, money in the accounts could pay for expenses not covered by Medicare. Some other fans of HSAs agree.  Both sides agree on one thing: The elderly won't move quickly to adopt HSAs-like accounts."This is probably going to be a gradual process" as workers with HSAs enter the Medicare population, Dr. McClellan says.
