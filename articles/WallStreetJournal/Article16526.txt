 Barron's Insight: Restructured Trump Is Still a Big Gamble   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2005  Investors now have the opportunity to bet again on Trump's casinos. The company has emerged from bankruptcy and has a new stock trading on the OTC Bulletin Board for around $13 a share. Now called Trump Entertainment Resorts (DJTE), the company hopes to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the "near future." [Donald Trump] owns about 25% of the stock.  Trump's three Atlantic City casino/hotels -- Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza and Trump Marina -- have been cash-starved in recent years and need to be spruced up. The properties have experienced weakening financial performance, and Atlantic City itself faces growing competition because neighboring Pennsylvania has legalized slot machines at racetracks. The slot operations in that state should open for business next year.
