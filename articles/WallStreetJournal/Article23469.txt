 The Fast and the Furious Join the Country-Club Set   By Herrick, Thaddeus, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2007  Mr. [Bill Georgas] and his partner, Dan Gage, both of whom previously worked in telecommunications, hatched the idea for Racers Ranch several years ago while driving their Porsches at a road course near Fort Worth. In their downtime, they found themselves either wilting from the heat or bundling up against the cold. "We thought, 'If we had a clubhouse, we could be having a drink, relaxing right now," says Mr. Georgas.  U.S. motor-sport road courses are becoming increasingly popular places for amateurs to drive their cars -- and live. The Autobahn Country Club in Joliet, Il., has plans to build 40 condominiums. But the residential nature of Racers Ranch coupled with its secluded, rural setting is something of a novelty. Mr. Georgas and Mr. Gage are looking to sell 40 five-acre lots for $275,000, a price that also includes full use of the clubhouse, track, two pit areas and day-use garage. So far he has only 14 commitments. "We've got a lot of people sitting on the fence," says Mr. Gage."  Like a golf community, Racers Ranch aims to attract members as well as residents. Lou Gigliotti, a long-time Dallas area professional race-car driver and Corvette aficionado, is among those who have reserved a lot. He says the chief selling point of Racers Ranch is that many of the cars produced today are built to reach speeds drivers can never experience -- if they're obeying the law. The track's one half mile straight-away will allow drivers to reach speeds as high as 150 miles an hour, about the same as racers on professional courses such as upstate New York's Watkins Glen International. "To hot rod it, you've got to have a place like Racers Ranch," says Mr. Gigliotti.
