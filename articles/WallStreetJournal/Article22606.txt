 Mattel Directors To Meet to Discuss Earnings, Barad   By By Lisa Bannon and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2000  Mattel Inc.'s board will meet today in New York in an emergency session to discuss the company's fourth-quarter financial results as well as the future of Chief Executive Jill Barad, according to a person familiar with the situation.  The biggest concern is at Learning Co., the software company that Mattel acquired for $3.5 billion last year and which already reported surprising losses in the third quarter. At the time, Ms. Barad assured investors and the board that Learning Co.'s problems had been dealt with and the losses would be contained to that quarter.
