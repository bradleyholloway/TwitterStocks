 Private Equity Looks at Sainsbury for U.K. Comeback   By Singer, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  A deal by the consortium to buy Sainsbury would be the largest private-equity purchase in Europe, and the U.K. is a particularly important market as one of Europe's largest for mergers and acquisitions. Sainsbury has been a target for private-equity firms since October 2004, when it hired a new team of investment bankers to help defend the company from a potential bid. At the time, newly hired Chief Executive Justin King apologized to shareholders for the chain's poor performance and rolled out another in a series of turnaround plans.  Friday, London-based Sainsbury, the U.K.'s third-largest supermarket chain by sales behind Tesco PLC and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Asda unit, said "no proposal has been received" from the private-equity group, and it declined to comment further.
