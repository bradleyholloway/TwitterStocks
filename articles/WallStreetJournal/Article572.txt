 Religious Concern Denies It Hasn't Sent Assistance to Ethiopia   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1985  A California organization whose Ethiopian relief appeals are being investigated by state officials denied reports that it hasn't actually provided aid in Ethiopia and said that the amount of money collected by the organization has been exaggerated.  International Christian Aid, a religious evangelical group affiliated with Inter-Aid Inc., Camarillo, Calif., said it received $251,487 last year for Ethiopian aid and that it "remitted" money, goods, and services valued at $168,575 in that period. The group said that a further $83,000 has been donated to the group for Ethiopian relief since Jan. 1.
