 Dollar's Weakness Bolsters Eurobonds In Other Currencies --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1987  Amid light primary market activity, dealers reported moderate demand for a #125 million ($217.4 million) floating-rate issue by Investors in Industry International BV, a unit of the British bank-owned business financing institution.  Prices of Texaco Inc.'s two convertible Eurobonds outstanding fell about five points in early trading yesterday to about 85, following a decision by the Texas Supreme Court upholding Pennzoil Co.'s huge judgment against Texaco. But a surge of buying out of New York later pushed the price back up into the low 90s, traders said. The bonds were quoted at 89 bid in late trading.  Separately, Cregem Finance NV, a unit of the Belgian bank Credit Communal de Belgique SA announced 15 billion yen ($109.5 million) of five-year floating-rate notes paying long-term prime minus 0.55 at 100.25. LTCB International Ltd., the lead manager, said the issue had been largely placed already.
