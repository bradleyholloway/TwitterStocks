 Bullish Investor Sentiment Faces Tough Test   By By E.S. Browning and Robert McGough, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  It isn't an idle concern. Since 1994, the stock market has roared ahead in large part because investors believed stocks had nowhere to go but up. People shoveled their savings into U.S. stocks, even after the shares surged to valuation levels beyond anything the market ever had seen. If that changes now, the future of the bull market could be in peril. But if investors decide that the slide of the past three weeks was just the pause that refreshes, then the bull could catch its breath and charge further into uncharted territory.  So far, the bullish psychology seems to be holding. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 299.43-point drop on Tuesday, the market came gingerly back. The industrials rose modestly on Wednesday, Thursday and again on Friday, when the average posted a gain of 20.34 to 8598.02, to make the week's decline an overall 285.27 points, or 3.2%.  To Mrs. (Linda) Fine, a former banker who stays home to take care of the kids, the market's "300-point drop is no big deal.. .. I have more faith in the stock market" than Mr. Fine. Although she has primary responsibility for managing their investments, she has agreed that if the market tumbles in the coming week, she will move some money from stock funds to moneymarket or bond funds.
