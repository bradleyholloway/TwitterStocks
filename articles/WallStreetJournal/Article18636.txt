 Bibb May Suffer, But Most Parents Are Rejoicing   By By Emory Thomas Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1995  Bibb's worst problem from continuing operations is big and purple and has green spots on its back. It's Barney, the dinosaur, whose goofy image is licensed by Bibb, even as his popularity now plummets.  Barney was the toast of the toddler set in early 1993. Today the kiddies are putting him aside, causing Bibb's sales to decline 6% during the first nine months of 1994. The singing dinosaur's rapid fall from favor helped slash the company's operating cash flow by more than half during that time, to $14 million from $31 million, Moody's says. Many stores saw double-digit growth in home furnishings while Bibb's sales fell.
