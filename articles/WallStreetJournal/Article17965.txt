 Parretti Revises Filing With SEC On Criminal Case   By By Kathleen A. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1989  Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti revised his description of Italian criminal charges against him in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing after a story in this newspaper raised questions about the accuracy of an earlier filing.  Mr. Parretti, who controls Pathe Communications Corp., formerly Cannon Group Inc., has triggered intense speculation in Hollywood by promising as much as $800 million to buy a collection of small movie companies or to back new movie companies. However, many of those deals have since fallen apart.  In the company's original year-end filing with the SEC, Pathe said Mr. Parretti was charged in Naples with "fraudulent documentary bankruptcy" but the filing made the charges appear relatively trivial. It said Mr. Parretti was charged with failing to file the 1983 balance sheet of a private company on time. The filing went on to say that the problem occurred after he had resigned as managing director.
