 Coup May Alter Mauritania's U.S. Ties   By Trofimov, Yaroslav, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2005  Despite world-wide condemnation of this week's military putsch, Mauritania's new ruling junta has consolidated its hold over one of America's and Israel's most collaborative allies in the Arab world.  Wednesday's bloodless coup d'etat ousted long-serving President Maaouiya Ould Taya, who was visiting Saudi Arabia at the time. Hours later, the new junta -- which calls itself the Military Council for Justice and Democracy -- named as Mauritania's temporary leader Col. Ely Mohammed Vall, one of the deposed president's closest aides and head of the country's police and intelligence services.  The new junta's communique, read on national television, decried the "totalitarian practices of the deposed regime" and promised to create "true democratic institutions" after a two-year transitional period. Such progressive language notwithstanding, the junta consists of senior military officers who, like Col. Vall, held senior jobs in Mr. Taya's government, and who themselves were involved in the recent crackdowns on the Islamist opposition.
