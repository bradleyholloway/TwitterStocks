 Corporate Focus; BUSINESS: Money Is Everywhere, But for How Long?   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2007  That's not because the Texans have a crystal ball telling them great private-equity investment opportunities lie ahead. Rather, it's because they see what they've already missed. Savvier pension funds and endowments that made private-equity bets five or 10 years ago have enjoyed huge returns, and everyone else is now scrambling, belatedly, to get in the game.  In the meantime, big public companies such as General Electric, whose plodding shareholder returns have put them out of favor with the pension-fund crowd, are selling off poorly performing businesses to -- who else? -- private equity. At his company's annual outlook meeting last month, GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt expressed wonder at his ability to sell off the company's dogs. "You know, there is just money everywhere today," he said. "So you've got a lot of options."  As long as the good times are rolling, don't expect Mr. [Ben Bernanke] to cut interest rates. That's a tool he'll only use when the economy takes a serious turn for the worse. Those who predict otherwise haven't been listening to what he's been saying.
