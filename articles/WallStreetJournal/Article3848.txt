 Progress in Iraq   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2004  If we have one reservation about the current progress in Iraq, it's the apparent truce with Muqtada al-Sadr. The good news here is that Sadr City in Baghdad has been pacified for the moment, and that Sadr's Mehdi Army has handed over some heavy weaponry. The bad news is that Sadr has American and Iraqi blood on his hands, and our failure to arrest or kill him may set another bad precedent. But unlike the April Fallujah deal, at least we're not ceding territory to the bad guys but gaining it.  Mr. Bush deserves credit for going on offense now, since the path of least resistance would be not to stir up the hornets' nest of the Sunni Triangle before November 2. Acting now and with urgency tells Iraqis we intend to honor our pledge to hold elections by January. There was always going to be violence in Iraq in the run-up to November 2 as the Baathists and Islamists sought to demoralize American voters. So why not attack instead of waiting for the bombs to hit? We're guessing we're not the only ones who will feel better about the Administration's Iraq policy on Election Day if the liberation of Fallujah is finally under way.
