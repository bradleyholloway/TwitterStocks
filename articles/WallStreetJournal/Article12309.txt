 Amazingly, They're Human   By By Cathy Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1998  In 1994, journalist Elinor Burkett, a self-described "old liberal warhorse," was stunned by the sight of the Republican women newly elected to Congress. They were championing causes that, in Ms. Burkett's view, "no self-respecting independent woman could support"; yet they seemed independent and "positively spunky." To resolve this paradox, she decided to do something radical: to treat conservative women with respect and "listen carefully to their voices." Her effort is chronicled in "The Right Women" (Scribner, 288 pages, $23), a rather confused yet provocative and even fascinating book.  Ms. Burkett confesses that before her "quest," she had "never actually talked to any woman who refused to call herself a feminist," or even a woman who opposed activist government. Bringing laudable humility to her task, she comes to appreciate the concerns of mothers who find that the public schools are actively hostile to their values; of businesswomen choked by regulations; of gun owners who wonder why the feminist reverence for "choice" does not extend to their decisions.  Ms. Burkett's portrait gallery includes militia members, libertarians, black conservatives and "ornery" Western women who didn't need a movement to tell them they could work as hard as any man. She also looks at conservative politicians and activists, from the pastel-colored offices of Concerned Women of America to the hip parties of miniskirted cigar-smoking "babes." (Ms. Burkett finds these rebels reminiscent, in their cocky absolutism, of the jeans-clad revolutionaries of her generation -- something that, for her, is both reassuring and scary.)
