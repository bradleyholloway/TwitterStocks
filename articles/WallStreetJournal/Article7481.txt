 Tandy, British Firm End Venture to Sell Computers in Europe   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1986  Tandy Corp. and Apricot Computers PLC said they're disbanding an unprofitable venture to jointly market personal computers in Europe, citing "the general slowdown" in the microcomputer market.  The year-old venture, called AT Computerworld Ltd., has 29 stores in Britain, and once had plans to expand to the Continent. Under an agreement, Tandy will get the 13 stores owned by AT Computerworld and Apricot will get control of the venture's 16 franchise stores. Apricot previously was called Applied Computer Techniques PLC.
