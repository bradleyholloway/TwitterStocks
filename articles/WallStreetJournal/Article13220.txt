 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2005  If you'd like to see the IRS pronouncement, go to www.irs.gov and click on "The Newsroom." Look for "IR-2005-130," dated Oct. 28, 2005. The headline reads: "2006 Inflation Adjustments Widen Tax Brackets, Change Tax Benefits." Also see IRS Revenue Procedure 2005-70.  The IRS also reported that the basic standard deduction for 2006 will be $10,300 for married couples filing a joint return, $5,150 for those whose filing status is "single," and $7,550 for "head of household." The standard deduction is a flat amount based on your filing status. It's very important since nearly two out of three taxpayers choose it, rather than itemizing deductions.
