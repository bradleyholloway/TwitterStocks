 Hot Topic: Bernanke and Inflation: A Headache for Markets   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2006  THE HAWKISH TONE caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to drop below 11,000 points Wednesday -- its lowest level since March 9 -- and it also closed below the marker Friday. The fall, and a global swoon in many emerging markets, came after Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech Monday that recent rises in inflation were "unwelcome" and that the Fed would remain "vigilant" in keeping inflation down.  Mr. Bernanke has warned that the recent slowdown won't replace an active anti-inflation policy. Still, inflation doves worry the Fed might over-react, raise interest rates too much and thereby stifle economic growth and cause general economic malaise. In the mid-'90s, Fed tightening efforts precipitated a slowdown that had numerous side effects, including the Mexican-peso crisis and the Orange County bankruptcy filing.  "They don't teach you this in business school -- how to communicate to the market. This is learning on the job. . . . It's a difficult environment, the economy's slowing, inflation's accelerating and the Fed has already tightened quite a bit. It's not a slam-dunk decision."
