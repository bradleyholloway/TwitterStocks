 Results of Kmart Shareholders Vote On Unions' Proposal Are Questioned   By By Robert Berner, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1996  Kmart Corp. said a preliminary count shows that a proposal by two unions to elect Kmart's full board on an annual basis failed to get a majority of votes. But the unions and an association representing pension funds countered that mistakes made in vote counting were responsible for the proposal's failure.  Shareholders at Kmart's annual meeting May 21 also rejected another proposal by the Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees and International Brotherhood of Teamsters. That proposal would have ended retirement benefits for directors once they retired from the board. The unions and the Council of Institutional Investors, an association that represents 100 pension funds, didn't dispute that vote.
