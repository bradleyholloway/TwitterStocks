 After EMU, American Monetary Union Is Debated   By By Chip Cummins, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1999  Debate over the many shades of monetary integration in the Americas is likely to ratchet up as economists keep a close eye on how Europe's common-currency experiment pans out and as Lawrence Summers settles in at the Treasury. The secretary-designate is at least open-minded to the most likely manifestation of currency union, dollarization. But even that stepping stone to an eventual regional currency bloc stays in the realm of speculation for now.  The concept of monetary union surfaced from the deep reaches of academia in late 1998 after a yearlong global financial crisis that rattled traditionally vulnerable currencies like the Brazilian real and that shook the Canadian dollar. Even the U.S. currency suffered the indignity of a 9% drop against the yen in a single day. With the launch of European economic and monetary union on Jan. 1, the question arose: can monetary integration work in the Americas?  Brian Fabbri, a New York-based economist at Paribas, says that while EMU has been viewed by many as an economic means of strengthening political ties in Europe, "there is no political incentive to {increase} ties between this country and other countries in the hemisphere." With the U.S. economy booming, there is also likely little will in Washington to seek strengthened monetary ties on purely economic grounds.
