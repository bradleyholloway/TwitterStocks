 Moxie Pays Off for Harvey Rosenfield, The New Scourge of California Insurers   By By Ken Wells, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1988  It's hard to hurt Harvey Rosenfield's feelings. He laughed when he was branded "Pee Wee Harvey" -- a reference to television simpleton Pee Wee Herman. He shrugged off television commercials accusing him of being a slightly unstable publicity hound.  This week, an insurance company executive, in a press release, called Mr. Rosenfield "a vindictive snake oil salesman who has hoodwinked the people into furthering his own cause. . . ." Mr. Rosenfield sighs: "We should put some of these guys into a padded room until they can calm down and behave themselves."  Indeed, appearances, as the California insurance industry learned, are deceiving. A year ago, Mr. Rosenfield was considered just another poorly paid, overzealous, garden-variety liberal lawyer pounding the concrete in California for various consumer causes. Then, two weeks ago, his brainchild ballot initiative, Proposition 103, was narrowly adopted by California voters despite a $70 million insurance industry campaign aimed at derailing it.
