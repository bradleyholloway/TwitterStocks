 U.S. Will Retest Twice Before Any Mad-Cow Alerts   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2004  Now, the USDA says, if an initial test shows any sign of possible infection, two secondary rapid screening tests will be performed before any announcements are made.

Then, the sample would go on for conclusive lab tests.
