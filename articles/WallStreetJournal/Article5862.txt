 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review --- Closed-End Funds: Closed-Ends Face Some Pressure From the Alternative of ETFs   By By Joe Niedzielski and Christopher Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2000  ETFs aren't without their own imperfections. One stems from their reliance on floor specialists and arbitragers to keep the price that investors pay for shares in line with the price of the fund's underlying assets. While this has worked relatively smoothly for large established ETFs like the $22 billion-in-assets Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts, or SPDRs, tracking the big-company S&P 500-stock index, managed by State Street's State Street Global Advisors unit, some ETFs tracking illiquid foreign markets have drawn criticism for not tracking their benchmarks closely enough.  Ironically, some closed-end-fund fans see salvation in the ETFs. Barry Oliff, chief investment officer at City of London Investment Management, which invests mainly in emerging-markets closed-end funds, says some of these funds, which can be extremely volatile, are even more attractive as value plays now that sophisticated players have better hedging tools in the ETFs. Investors choosing South Korea closed-end funds, for example, can hedge them by short-selling Barclays Global Investors' iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund, which roughly tracks the Morgan Stanley Capital International Korea Index, Mr. Oliff says.  ETFs have given investors a new way of gaining easy exposure to the markets long favored by many closed-end funds. Barclays PLC's Barclays Global Investors unit began launching the first of 19 single-country ETFs, originally known as World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS, but recently named iShares, in 1996, and plans to launch as many as nine others. All told, the Barclays international ETFs have $2 billion under management, while closed-end country-fund portfolios hold $14.2 billion.
