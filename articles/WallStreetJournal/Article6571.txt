 Politics & Economics: U.S. Trade Chief Plays Down the Rising Deficit   By King, Neil, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2006  "The trade deficit is always a good talking point," said Ms. [Susan Schwab], speaking to reporters the day the Commerce Department announced another monthly increase in the U.S. trade gap, up about 12% through April over last year's record pace. Ms. Schwab said that if you look at the trade numbers in detail and consider wide signs of strength in the U.S. economy, the deficit "looks much more complicated and much less dire."  Because of that deadline, Ms. Schwab said the Doha Round of World Trade Organization talks would likely fall apart if the WTO member states can't wrap up the negotiations by the end of 2006 -- a target few expect can be met. The administration already has made its best offer by promising to slash farm subsidies, she said, and wouldn't be offering any extra "sweeteners."
