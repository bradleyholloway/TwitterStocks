 Lernout's CEO Is Preparing To Step Down   By By Mark Maremont and Jesse Eisinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2000  Mr. [Gaston Bastiaens] has been president and chief executive of the Belgium-based company since 1996. His successor is John H. Duerden, formerly head of L&H's medical unit. Mr. Duerden, 59 years old, had previously been chief executive of Dictaphone Corp., a provider of recording and dictation products that L&H acquired in May for $504 million in stock. L&H is expected to announce the executive change today.  Mr. [Jo Lernout] said Mr. Bastiaens's departure was unrelated to the Korean situation. But a person familiar with the situation said Mr. Bastiaens's departure was hastened by the Journal article. Although there was no concern in the company of any problems with L&H's Korean sales, questions were raised about whether Mr. Bastiaens had handled the situation improperly by providing incomplete information to Journal reporters, the person said.  Ellen Spooren, the senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications, also is stepping down from her post, but for the time being will remain at L&H, a company spokesman said. Ms. Spooren and Mr. Bastiaens worked together at Quarterdeck Corp., a U.S. software company that Mr. Bastiaens had previously headed. Ms. Spooren didn't return calls seeking comment.
