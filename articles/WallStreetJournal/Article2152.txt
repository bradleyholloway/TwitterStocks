 Northrop Pact Lists 11 Areas In U.S. Probe --- Criminal Inquiry Was Ended In February Settlement Of Weapons-Test Case   By By Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1990  A previously sealed court document indicates that the Justice Department decided not to pursue at least 11 areas being looked at by criminal investigators as part of a settlement agreement it signed last February with Northrop Corp.  But the dropping of the criminal inquiries has miffed some parties close to the matter, who contend that the government gave away too much for too little. "We are extremely disappointed," said Phil Benson, an attorney in the law offices of Herbert Hafif. The firm, based in Claremont, Calif., represents a number of employee whistle-blowers who raised many of the allegations against Northrop.  Mr. Benson said he was particularly irked that criminal investigations into two matters weren't being continued. One involves allegations that Northrop circumvented normal supply channels and installed components from neighborhood stores like Radio Shack into MX-missile guidance units. The other involves contentions that the company wrongfully charged the Air Force for equipment, known as the dry integrated test system.
