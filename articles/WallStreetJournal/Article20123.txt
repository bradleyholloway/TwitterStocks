 HSBC Keeps to Organic Growth in Asia   By Linebaugh, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2007  The bank would consider acquisition opportunities for tactical reasons on a "purely opportunistic basis," HSBC Asia Chief Executive Michael Smith said in an interview. "I don't see any need to do a transformational acquisition," he said.  In China, HSBC has been ahead of rivals, making its first investment in a Chinese bank six years ago with a small stake in Bank of Shanghai, in which it currently holds an 8% stake. Since then, it has invested $5 billion buying into Chinese banks and insurance companies, including a 19.9% stake in the country's fifth-largest bank by assets, Bank of Communications Co. HSBC also has a 15.98% stake in Industrial Bank Co. through Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
