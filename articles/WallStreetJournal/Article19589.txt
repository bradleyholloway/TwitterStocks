 Scottrade Swims Against Current, But Stays Afloat Amid Downturn   By By Gaston F. Ceron, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2002  The story is a little different at Scottrade, a brokerage house run by Chief Executive Rodger Riney and mostly owned by his family. Scottrade's payroll actually has grown, and Mr. Riney continues to push ahead with plans to expand. Moreover, Mr. Riney says he has no plans to imitate his rivals, either by seeking a sale or by abandoning his focus on discount and online trading.  To be sure, Scottrade hasn't been immune from the online-brokerage slump. Back in early 2000, the business was "extremely lucrative," but recently has experienced just "modest profitability," Mr. Riney said. Like other Web-brokerage firms, Scottrade has seen its clients' trading activity recede from peak levels, when the company averaged 54,000 trades a day in March 2000.  "By not having the extra layers of management that publicly traded companies have to have, we can make more money at $7, maybe, than someone can at $8," said the executive, referring to Scottrade's trade commissions. The location of Scottrade's headquarters also keeps overhead down. "I think everything's less in the Midwest than it is in the coasts," Mr. Riney said.
