 Marconi Sells Unit To Philips, Issues Earnings Warning   By By David Pringle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2001  Marconi said it is cutting jobs due to a steep decline in capital spending by telephone companies in Europe, which it expects will result in a 15% sales decline in the fiscal year."Our customers in Europe really turned off the tap in terms of capital expenditure," said George Simpson, Marconi's chief executive.  Marconi justified the suspension by saying it wanted investors to have the complete picture before trading its shares on the back of the Philips deal. Before they were suspended, Marconi's shares were at an all-time low of 245.25 pence, more than 80% off their peak of GBP 12.50 in August 2000.
