 Singapore Leader Urges U.S. to Keep Trade Doors Open   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1985  The House postponed a vote on textile-import limits aimed at Asian nations moments after the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, delivered a poignant appeal to keep American trade doors open.  House Speaker Thomas O'Neill pulled the bill, which was all but certain to win overwhelming approval yesterday, from the House calendar as a "courtesy" to Mr. Lee, whose remarks came in a speech before a joint meeting of Congress. "I didn't think it was the right thing to do on the same day as this address," Mr. O'Neill said.  In his speech, Mr. Lee said open markets had spurred the growth of the economies and the democratic systems of small Asian nations. He warned that U.S. protectionist barriers would jeopardize Singapore, which has been independent for only two decades.
