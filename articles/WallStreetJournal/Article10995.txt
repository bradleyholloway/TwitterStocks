 Treasury Sale Seen Attracting Japanese Buyers --- Bond Yield Spread May Lift Interest From Overseas; Dollar Becomes Firmer   By By Charles Hunter, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1987  A General Accounting Office report yesterday afternoon saying the dollar "may have to fall further" to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and a Federal Reserve Board official's hint that the Fed is reluctant to tighten credit further had little effect.  Although foreign interest will be difficult to assess until tomorrow's sale of 30-year bonds, traders said, many now expect that Japanese buying, recently a source of concern, will be substantial. They cited the yield spread between U.S. and Japanese long-term bonds, which has widened to five percentage points or more in favor of the U.S. instruments from less than two points early this year.  James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., called the wide differential "practically compelling" to Japanese investors. Mr. Vick and other traders cited a research report yesterday that said Japanese buyers of long-term U.S. debt at current yields still would realize a better gain at maturity than on comparable Japanese instruments, even if the dollar fell below 100 yen.
