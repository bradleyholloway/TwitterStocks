 EU Lawmakers Are Set to Vote On Data Accord; U.S. Quest for Information About Airline Passengers Shows Chasm Over Privacy   By Shishkin, Philip, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2004  "This is a new issue which came up in our talks with the United States only relatively recently," Frits Bolkestein, the European commissioner responsible for the U.S.-EU negotiations on the matter, told the Parliament on Monday. "The commission is still holding discussions with the U.S. on this point."  As the legal limbo continues, European airlines fear they may be stuck between two unappealing options: Ignore the U.S. rules and face steep penalties there or ignore the European privacy rules and invite legal action at home. For now, most airlines are sending passenger data to the U.S. based on an interim agreement. "We are stuck in the middle," said David Henderson at the Association of European Airlines in Brussels. "We want this sorted."  Some European and U.S. officials also blame the acrimony on many European officials' latent mistrust of the Bush administration. Recent U.S. security measures, such as a requirement to fingerprint and photograph visitors from Europe (among other visa-exempt countries) upon arrival in the U.S., have added to the discomfort.
