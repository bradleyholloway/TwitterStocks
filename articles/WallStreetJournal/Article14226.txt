 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Let the Chips Fall   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1986  American mercantilists are fretting over the troubles of U.S. companies that make semiconductors, the little silicon wafers that have revolutionized electronics. U.S. chip makers want relief against "dumping" by the Japanese, but U.S.-Japanese government talks to smooth over this problem collapsed in discord last week. The chip makers do have a few legitimate gripes, but more with the differences in the way the U.S. and Japan approach government than with the direct practices of the Japanese.  The semiconductor business has long been a boom and bust trade, and for more than a year now it's been bust. U.S. companies like Intel have been hit by falling prices spurred by brutal Japanese price-cutting. Thus sprang the charges that the Japanese are dumping, even selling chips in the U.S. at less than it costs to make them. The Commerce Department has supported the dumping claims, which are headed next to the International Trade Commission. The government-to-government talks are intended to speed along this process before innovation makes it all academic.
