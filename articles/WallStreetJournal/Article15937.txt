 Tale of Pacific Thrift Shows Perils of High-Risk Lending   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2000  Pacific Thrift is "a study of the things that can go wrong," says James Sexton, the FDIC's director of supervision. Executives at PacificAmerica Money Center Inc., which owned the now-defunct Pacific Thrift and which itself filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.  Like other subprime lenders that securitize loans, Pacific Thrift typically kept a small piece of its pooled mortgages, a so-called residual. The amount of the residual-minus estimated losses from future defaults and prepayments-is booked as the profit. If a lender accurately projects these based on historic trends, the residuals will not only cover the losses but leave a tidy profit. But residuals can concentrate a lender's risk, since losses incurred in securitized loan pools are first paid out of the residuals until they are depleted.  It is a tale regulators now hold up as an example of the possible excesses breeding in a corner of the consumer-debt market known as subprime lending. Across the country, a small but increasing number of banks and thrifts are wading into these risky loans to boost profits amid relentless competition for borrowers. Some are finding how perilous it can be. Six of the last 13 bank failures -- all in the past 21 monthswere subprime lenders, including Pacific Thrift and National Bank of Keystone, W. Va., which last fall became one of the 10 largest bank failures since the Depression. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. estimates the cleanup of subprime lenders that have gone bust so far will cost taxpayers $1 billion.
