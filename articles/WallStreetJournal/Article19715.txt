 IRS Examines Derivatives Schemes   By Connor, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2003  The IRS's Mr. [Mark Scott] said it's not yet clear how pervasive the new, derivatives-related abuses are. But he said, "We are finding more problems than I expected." He said the agency's investigation is expanding.  "Recent examinations involving advance-refunding bonds with put options in the escrow highlight increasing concerns about the use of derivative-type products as a more-sophisticated yield-burning or general abusive arbitrage scheme," said Charles Anderson, manager of the IRS's tax-exempt-bond field operations. "In the case of a put- option escrow, there is simply no reasonable need for the purchase of a put in an escrow that is already sufficient for defeasance of earlier bonds." He said that "any time people can sell products paid for with money normally rebatable to Uncle Sam, you will see the sharks circling."
