 Brockovich Takes Aim at PG&E Again   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2003  Officials of PG&E, a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., deny they tried to influence the scientific panel in any way. "None of the work by panel members was done on behalf of PG&E, and none of the members were paid by PG&E for any work concerning the panel," said PG&E spokesman John Nelson.  According to court documents, one of the panelists, John Froines, an environmental-health professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said one of the reasons he resigned from the panel was his protest over having to share the body with two of PG&E's former paid experts: Dennis Paustenbach, a consulting toxicologist from Menlo Park, Calif., and Marc Schenker, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Davis who has also served as an expert witness for PG&E. Upon learning of Dr. Paustenbach's appointment, an associate at his consulting firm sent an e-mail to a colleague saying: "It looks like we got `one of our own' on the panel," according to documents obtained by Ms. [Brockovich]'s lawyers.  Other supporters of PG&E and industry in the past tried to help out. For example, a group called the Alliance for Responsible Water Policy, which consisted of one former PG&E lobbyist and another former PG&E paid expert, wrote a "Chrome 6 Strategic Action Plan" in April 2001 calling for it to, among other things, "influence selection of panelists."
