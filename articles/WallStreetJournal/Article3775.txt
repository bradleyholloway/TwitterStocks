 Watching The Web: Forget Miles, Points, Cash -- Think Savings   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2004  When you have clocked up $50, BondRewards automatically buys a $50 savings bond in your name and mails it to you. The company's chief executive officer, Brian Anderson, says the average customer earns 15 savings bonds a year -- that's $750.  BabyMint offers a similar model, but the savings go to a tax-free college savings plan -- any 529 plan or Coverdell account qualifies. When you shop at one of the more than 500 retailers in the BabyMint network, you earn "BabyMint Bucks" (one Buck is worth $1).  Another option is to get the BabyMint credit card and earn 1% on purchases anywhere; that's on top of what you earn anyway from the Bucks program with the participating retailers.
