 Russia Won't Let Go of Natural Gas Firm --- Foreign Buyers Are Locked Out of Big Privatization   By By Steve Liesman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1995  With more than $6 billion in revenue, keen foreign-investor interest and billions of shares outstanding, the stock of Russia's natural gas giant Gazprom should be the darling of the country's new equity markets.  But eight months after the shares were auctioned off in a landmark privatization, most brokers consider the stock to be almost worthless. The reason is that Russians can't freely buy or sell the stock and foreign investors, who provide the underpinning to most Russian stocks, can't buy it unless they pay 10 to 20 times what brokers estimate its value to be.  The controversy shows the lengths to which some directors, many of whom remain distrustful of the market and shareholders, will go to maintain control of enterprises. Nationalism is another factor, with the government and the company striving to keep foreigners from obtaining more than 9% of Gazprom shares. Gazprom directors want to price shares sold to foreigners at more than 100 times what Russians paid, and by most accounts have prevented share transactions.
