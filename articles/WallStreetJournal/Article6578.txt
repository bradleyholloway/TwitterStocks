 Leadership (A Special Report); Wisdom for the Web: Search-engine advertising is crucial these days; But marketers have to know what they're doing   By Delaney, Kevin J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2006  Search advertisers bid in an online auction system to have their ads displayed each time a consumer searches for a specific keyword or keyword phrase, such as "mortgage" or "Nantucket bed and breakfast." The advertisers pay only when a consumer clicks on their ads, forking over roughly 50 cents per click on average, according to analyst estimates. Related "contextual" ads are displayed when the advertisers' chosen keywords appear in articles or other content that a consumer is reading on a Web site.  Many businesses say they're very satisfied with the results they get from search ads. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, a unit of New York-based Cendant Corp., calculates that it generates $14 in revenue for every $1 it spends on search advertising. Encouraged by such returns, the hotel company has increased its search ad spending by 500% since 2001. Roughly two-thirds of its online ad budget, and close to 15% of its overall marketing budget, goes to search ads pegged to keywords such as "Bahamas hotel" and "Phoenix golf."  Many big companies have created staff positions for search experts to handle such issues. Even online advertising specialists say search marketing demands lots of attention. "Every single day there's a new change, a new iteration," says Curt Hecht, chief digital officer at GM Planworks, a unit of Paris-based Publicis Groupe SA's Starcom MediaVest Group that handles all buying and planning for the estimated $3.2 billion General Motors advertising account. "The agency that falls asleep at the switch on search is not the best for their client," says Mr. Hecht. General Motors bids to have its ads displayed alongside roughly 750,000 to one million keywords, including "GM," "Chevy" and "Buick."
