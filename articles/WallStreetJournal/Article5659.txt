 Hershey, Faced With Limp Pasta Sales, Announces Plans to Sell Eight Brands   By By Vanessa O'Connell, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1998  Hershey, Hershey, Pa., said it hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. to help it find a buyer for its eight regional pasta brands, including Ronzoni, Skinner and San Giorgio. A spokesman for Hershey declined to provide a price tag, or say what, if any, bids it has received thus far. But Wall Street analysts said the pasta brands might fetch about $500 million, or about 1.2 times their 1997 sales.  Better known for its portfolio of chocolates, including Reese's peanut-butter cups and KitKat bars, Hershey is the nation's leading seller of pasta, with a 27% share of sales. Pasta accounted for 9.3% of Hershey's $4.3 billion in sales last year. Yet Hershey's operating-profit margin for pasta is about 10%, roughly half that of candy, according to analyst Andrew Lazar of Lehman Brothers.
