 Retailers Use Bans, Guards and Ploys to Curb Teen Sport of Mall-Mauling   By Woo, Junda, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1990  It's Saturday afternoon at the Fort Worth Town Center mall, a time when security guards go on red alert. Suddenly, three suspicious characters approach the main entrance.  Although teen-agers constitute some of its biggest customers, in June the Fort Worth, Texas, mall began barring the under-18 set on Saturday afternoons unless an adult comes along. The reason: juvenile rowdiness. Last year alone, love-struck teen-age boys started four fistfights over girls. Others drew retailers' wrath by massing in front of doors and window displays.  Town Center isn't alone. Fed up with skateboards thrown through plate glass, shoplifting and what sometimes seems the congenital surliness of teens, retailers around the country are resorting to increasingly extreme measures to control teen-age shoppers.
