 Continental Air Sets 15% Cut in Flights From Denver; Judge Eases Eastern Order   By By Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1988  Continental Airlines will reduce by 15% its flights from Denver, its largest hub and biggest stronghold. Meanwhile, a federal judge said he will modify a temporary restraining order so that it prohibits only layoffs at Eastern Airlines, Continental's sister carrier.  The retrenchment at Denver's Stapleton Airport suggests Continental's chief rival there, UAL Inc.'s United Airlines, has gained the upper hand in that hub city, which is strategically important for western traffic flow. Both Continental and Eastern are units of Houston-based Texas Air Corp.  Aircraft freed up at Denver could be redeployed to other routes. Continental recently increased departures from its Cleveland hub as part of its fall schedule. "Market demand has been stronger in certain areas of the East Coast, and in particular Cleveland," the spokesman said. He said it wasn't clear late yesterday whether the fall schedule calls for an overall service reduction.
