 Is Lou Dobbs Of Two Minds On 'Offshoring?'   By Bandler, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2004  Mr. [Lou Dobbs], host of the popular cable program "Lou Dobbs Tonight," is a fierce critic of U.S. companies that replace American workers with cheap overseas labor. He routinely blasts the move, dubbed offshoring, in his "Exporting America" segments of the program, and recently railed against corporations that were doing "very well" while "working men and women in this country" are "simply being screwed." On his section of CNN's Web site, Mr. Dobbs has compiled a list of nearly 800 companies that he claims either send American jobs overseas or "employ cheap overseas labor, instead of American workers."  In an interview, Mr. Dobbs said he would change his newsletter in response to critics' concerns. In the future, Mr. Dobbs said, every examination of a company and every interview in the newsletter will include mention of that business's offshoring record. "It makes absolute sense," Mr. Dobbs said. "If this is a concern -- and it certainly is a concern of people -- I will respect that. It's something I will begin implementing in the newsletter."
