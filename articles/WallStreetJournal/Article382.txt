 Helicopter Sector May Consolidate; Comanche Halt May Bring Long-Debated Shrinkage Among Three U.S. Players   By Lunsford, J Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2004  Some people in the industry say that Monday's decision by the Army to cancel the high-profile Comanche helicopter program might have been the event that prompts further consolidation discussions. The three players in the U.S. helicopter industry, Textron Inc., Boeing Co. and United Technologies Corp., hugely reliant on the U.S. military, have essentially been treading water in recent years.  Boeing Chief Executive Harry Stonecipher has said he believes the company's helicopter division has a "promising future." A Boeing spokesman said yesterday that the Comanche announcement "has not changed our view of the helicopter business." A spokesman for United Technologies declined to comment about prospects for consolidation in the wake of the death of the Comanche program, saying "we don't know yet where this is going to lead." A spokeswoman for Textron declined to comment.
