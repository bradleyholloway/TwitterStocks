 Domenici Indicates Bush Won't Submit Budget, but Will Seek Deal With Congress   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1988  Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Sen. Domenici pointed out that the law requires President Reagan to submit a budget in early January before he leaves office, but doesn't require the new president subsequently to offer a revised fiscal plan. Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.) asked the senator, "You don't think he (Mr. Bush) should submit a budget?" Sen. Domenici replied: "He won't."  Mr. Domenici, who is likely to play a major role in budget negotiations next year, spoke on the telephone late last week with both Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State-designate James Baker, according to aides. But it wasn't clear whether either man suggested there would be no Bush budget. Aides to the Bush transition say they are paying close attention to the "no budget" idea, but have not decided whether to pursue it.  The strategy has been suggested by Richard Darman, who is expected to be named budget director as early as today. The idea is to save Mr. Bush the political embarrassment that could arise because any budget he would submit almost surely would be declared dead on arrival in Congress. His problem is that in order to meet the deficit targets set by the Gramm-Rudman law, he either would have to propose tax increases, which he flatly ruled out during his campaign, or make deep cuts in domestic spending that are certain to be attacked by Democrats and Republicans alike.
