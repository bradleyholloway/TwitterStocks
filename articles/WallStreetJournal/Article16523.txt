 In Search of a Euro Mortgage; EU Is Forced to Scale Back Vision of a Single Home-Loan Market   By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2005  More than five years after vowing to create a single European mortgage market, the European Commission is coming to the same conclusion. "We would like to allow an apartment buyer in Brussels to shop for the best loan deal in England, Austria or Ireland with the click of a switch," said Charlie McCreevy, the EU's commissioner for its internal market. "But there are a lot of obstacles in the way."  A populist-minded change has little appeal to consumers. A recent EU-sponsored poll showed that just 1% of house buyers are interested in getting a mortgage from another country, and this figure would rise only to 2% to 3% if it became easier. "Consumers are intimidated by mortgages because they're so complex," says Laurence Baxter, senior policy adviser for a consumer watchdog in the United Kingdom. "We're not so sure that a lot of choice will make prices come down."
