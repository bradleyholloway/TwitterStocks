 Saks, SEC Probe Unit's Collections From Its Vendors   By Byron, Ellen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2005  The investigation involves markdown-allowance collections at one of Saks Fifth Avenue's six merchandising divisions. The vendors involved weren't identified. In addition, Saks said the probe is examining the adequacy of an internal investigation the company conducted in 2002 into the same matter.  Saks said it intends to "reimburse or otherwise compensate the affected vendors" for any improperly collected markdown money. The company also said it plans to take "appropriate personnel actions" following the investigation, even though most senior management during the years under scrutiny have since left.
