 Shell Officials Kept Board in Dark; Directors Weren't Told Until December of Problems With Reserves From 2002   By Cummins, Chip, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2004  Members of Shell's audit committee -- made up of nonexecutive directors from Shell's two parent companies -- requested and received a "routine" briefing about the company's oil reserves as recently as October 2003. But the briefing, conducted by a senior finance executive in the company's exploration-and-production unit, didn't indicate that top executives of Shell were aware of large potential shortfalls in the company's tally of oil and natural-gas reserves, according to this person.  Instead, nonexecutive board members -- directors who don't hold management roles at the company -- were informed that there was an unspecified reserve problem only in late December, this person said. At the time, the directors were asked to attend emergency board meetings in early January to review the problems. After those meetings, on Jan. 9, Shell disclosed publicly that it would slash its tally of reserves by the equivalent of 3.9 billion barrels of oil, or about 20%. The news prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a fall in Shell's share price.  A.G. JACOBS, a director and chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's audit committee that is conducting an internal review of reserve bookings at the company, said in a statement that the committee has recommended to the company's two boards and external auditors that they should feel confident in relying on the "representations" of the group's current senior management. An article yesterday incorrectly used the word "representatives."
