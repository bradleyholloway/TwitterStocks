 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Sports: Softball, Hard Questions; On America's Other Diamonds, Players Try Doctored Bats; How Bobby Buggs Got an Edge   By Dougherty, Conor, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 2005  On a chilly May night at the Connecticut Sportsplex in North Branford, men with nicknames like Kookie, Mouse and Bump gathered for twilight games. Hit after hit soared more than 300 feet over the top of the outfield's 16-foot fence. Jim "Jimmy Dogs" Consiglio, the team's sponsor and its part-time catcher, guessed there were a half- dozen doctored bats in his game, though he wouldn't say who might have used them or from which dugout. "Do I care? No," says Mr. Consiglio, 53 years old, whose team lost the game. "It's hard to fault guys for being human."  Players sought an edge from guys like Robert Russell. An entomologist by day -- in softball circles, he's known as [Bobby Buggs] -- Mr. Russell says he got into bat doctoring by accident a few years ago. Disappointed with the performance of a new $500 bat, he hit the garage, removed the bat's end cap and examined its innards. "I'm a very diagnostic individual," he says. He had the barrel shaved down at a machine shop, and discovered it hit balls farther than an unmodified bat did. He posted his findings on the Internet, and was "flooded with requests" to modify other players' bats.  Many players find the whole idea baffling. In Brooklyn, N.Y., members of the co-ed Williamsburg Softball league can be seen wearing goofy uniforms -- on the Enid's bar team, it's pink shirts and socks -- and sometimes start drinking beer before the first pitch. The league has few equipment rules, and its commissioner, 28-year-old Brooklyn architect Joe Godsy, says he wouldn't think of seeking an edge with a tampered bat. "I figured that was for a complete lunatic," he says. Adds Mitch Torres, a 37-year-old UPS driver who plays for the league's Pourhouse team: "I'm a fanatic, but I wouldn't do anything extreme like that."
