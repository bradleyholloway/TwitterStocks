 Smith Corona Seeks Protection Of Chapter 11 --- Typewriter Maker Struggles In Face of Competition By Personal Computers   By By Jonathan Auerbach, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1995  Smith Corona Corp., which has been struggling to sell its typewriters and word processors in a booming personal-computer market, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Smith Corona, based in New Canaan, Conn., has been hit on two fronts. The market for its word processors has shrunk dramatically as customers moved to increasingly affordable PCs. At the same time, price competition within the remaining typewriter and word-processor market has remained intense.  Smith Corona shares, which last traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $1.50. Shares had moved up 12.5 cents on news that Smith Corona hired crisis manager Ronald F. Stengel as interim chief executive officer, president and a director and Stengel's firm, R.F. Stengel & Co., Valley Forge, Pa., as financial restructuring and turnaround advisers.
