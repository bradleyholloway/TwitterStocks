 Summit Snubs Takeover Bid From Paladin   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  Summit Managing Director Alan Eggers said the offer of one Paladin share for every 2.04 Summit shares was timed to come two weeks before an anticipated change in the Australian Labor Party policy on uranium mining, a change that could lift Summit. A local state government bans uranium mining in the area where Summit has a uranium project but is considering a change to the policy.  Mr. Eggers said Paladin's understanding of the value of Summit had risen through its participation as joint-venture partners in the Skal and Valhalla uranium deposits near Mount Isa in Queensland state. The project contains one of the world's top five uranium deposits. He said the hostile bid from Paladin wasn't unexpected.
