 Deals & Deal Makers: Profits at Brokerage Firms Fall Sharply Amid Slump   By By Cheryl Winokur Munk and Susanne Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2001  Despite the profit drops, Goldman, Bear Stearns and Lehman performed at or better than expectations. Research analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call expected Goldman to earn 90 cents a share and Bear Stearns, 87 cents a share. Without the charge, Lehman earned 73 cents a share, in line with expectations.  David Goldfarb, Lehman's chief financial officer, says the firm expects to recover a "significant" portion of revenue lost due to Sept. 11 through its business-interruption insurance coverage. He said he couldn't be more specific as the firm is still working with its insurers. Mr. Goldfarb said Lehman expects to recover at least the carrying value of its headquarters; he confirmed yesterday that Lehman won't return there.  While trading was a sore spot for Lehman, Goldman's bond business hummed, with net revenue from bond, currency and commodities operations jumping 80% to $867 million from year-earlier levels. Goldman attributes the increase to strong performance in commodities, bond derivatives, money markets and credit-sensitive businesses. Goldman's net revenue from stock trading, however, was off 44% from year-earlier levels to $435 million.
