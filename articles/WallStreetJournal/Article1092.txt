 Chinese Banks Try Self-Promotion; Hard Facts, Not Gauzy Image, Are Focus of Ad Campaigns As Competition Draws Near   By Areddy, James T, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  Instead of brand-building by the banks, "we've seen more in China around products and specifics," says Oliver Stratton, head of the banking practice in Hong Kong at Bain & Co., a consulting firm. Bain estimates Chinese financial institutions are spending as much as $450 million annually on advertising -- much of it to promote credit cards, which bankers consider a way to get a foot in the door with customers. Television is estimated to account for 70% of the spending.  Tom Doctoroff, chief executive at WPP Group's JWT agency in Shanghai, says Chinese customers respond to "tools to help you succeed."  Chinese banks are thrusting inherently complex products at people who a decade ago couldn't even get a home mortgage from their bank. Also, product minutiae are pumped into mainstream media like newspapers and magazines because Chinese banks often don't send monthly statements, eliminating a favored U.S. marketing channel: direct mail.
