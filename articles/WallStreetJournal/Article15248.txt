 Letters to the Editor: `A Blatant Misuse of Science'   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1994  DNA testing may someday spot products taken from illegally killed whales, but C.S. Baker and S.R. Palumbi haven't done it. Contrary to your Sept. 9 Technology and Health report, the Baker and Palumbi study was a blatant misuse of science for political advocacy. The study, funded and promoted by the antiwhaling group Earthtrust purports to "prove" that there is widespread marketing for illegal whale meat in Japan, with the implication of extensive pirate whaling and the taking of threatened and endangered species.  Baker and Palumbi's "library" for type sequence comparisons consisted of only 16 cetacean species out of the more than 80 species found in the waters of the world. Worse yet, their library failed to contain sequences for the cetacean species most common in waters around Japan, such as the north Pacific minke, Baird's beaked whale, North Pacific brydes, Dall's porpoise, or striped dolphin. The authors admitted to the Scientific Committee of the IWC that, "Evaluating the legality or illegality of the products was complicated by . . . the lack of regional `type' samples for most species."
