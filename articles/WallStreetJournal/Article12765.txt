 In Japan, Rising Clamor for a Bank Bailout --- As Tokyo Stock Prices Slide, Lending Capital Shrinks; S&P Downgrades Seven   By By Michael Williams, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  Pressure to throw the banks a lifeline intensified yesterday as Japan's popular stock benchmark hit an 18-year low and a U.S. rating agency downgraded the creditworthiness of seven major lenders. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.6% to 9475.60, its lowest close since December 1983, and below the low of 9504.41 set Sept. 17, amid a selloff that followed the terrorist attacks on America. The Topix index, a broader measure of share prices, dropped 1.83% to 926.27, marking a third consecutive 17-year low.  Adding to the pall, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of seven lenders, citing their growing bad loans and widening capital shortfalls. The move could lead to higher fund-raising costs for the affected lenders, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., UFJ Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., Yasuda Trust & Banking Co., and Mizuho group members Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.
