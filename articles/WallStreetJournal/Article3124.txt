 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / NORTHWEST --- Cherry Growers in Washington Are Expected to Have a Rosy Year   By By Janet I. Tu, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1998  But these days, any positive number is welcome. With tons of wheat sitting in surplus storage and a record apple crop expected to more than meet declining world-wide demand, the rise in cherry exports "really does help mitigate" some of the pain, says Janet Leister, international marketing program manager for the state Department of Agriculture.  When all the export numbers are in, Ms. Leister expects cherries might be one of the only Washington agricultural commodities whose export figures will be higher at the end of its sales season. According to the Yakima-based fruit commission's preliminary report, exports of Washington cherries since July totaled some 21,664 tons -- up more than 10% from the 19,543 tons in the same period last year.
