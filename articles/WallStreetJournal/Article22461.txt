 The Really Real Thing: Coke to Peddle Brand of Purified Bottled Water in U.S.   By By Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1998  The soft-drink giant expects to introduce in select markets its own brand of purified bottled water early next year, with a national rollout likely by May, according to people familiar with the plans. A leading candidate for the brand's name is Dasani. The water will come from the tap or wells, be purified and then have minerals added, which Coke will sell to bottlers.  A nationally branded water by Coca-Cola has been the subject of intense speculation in the beverage industry. Many industry executives say Coke can't wait any longer, given the explosive growth of bottled water during the past few years. Coke officials reason that if consumers are going to drink bottled water, they might as well drink a Coke product.  Furthermore, several Coke bottlers have been urging Coke to market a national brand of water so they don't have to sell a hodgepodge of little-known waters. Currently, Coke bottlers sell a variety of bottled waters, which they make a significant profit on. Several have said they are willing to pay a royalty to Coke if it puts marketing muscle behind a bottled water.
