 U.S. Weighs New Program to Fight AIDS --- People Infected by the Virus Would Get Free Tests, Drugs to Block Disease   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1989  During his remarks at the Fifth International Conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome here, Dr. Mason took pains to emphasize that he is opposed to any record keeping under the plan that might discourage participation by people infected by the AIDS virus.  Infected people whose T-cells dip below a count of 200 -- the point where they're considered at risk of developing AIDS and related infections -- would receive preventive treatment for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (pcp), which is the most frequent cause of death in AIDS patients. Recent tests have shown pcp is prevented by several drugs, including aerosol pentamidine, made by Lyphomed Inc. of Chicago and others. Dr. Mason said the proposed program is an outgrowth of the recent move by FDA Commissioner Frank Young to allow wide pre-approval distribution of aerosol pentamidine.  "Today, there are extraordinary personal, medical and public health reasons why a person should know if he or she is infected with (the AIDS virus)," Dr. Mason said. If he were infected by the virus, Dr. Mason said, he "would want to be followed clinically (and have T-4 cells monitored), so treatment could be instituted on my behalf."
