 CBOE, in Battle Over Direction, Seeks to Oust Its Vice Chairman   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  In a Dec. 4 letter signed by all directors except Mr. [Mark Duffy], the board said it "voted unanimously to initiate proceedings that could result in" Mr. Duffy's removal. It said Mr. Duffy "appeared to have abused his authority as vice chairman in matters pertaining to the exchange's exercise of its regulatory authority, and that he may have misled" Securities and Exchange Commission officials.  Acting on its concerns, the CBOE board said it had hired the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell to conduct an independent investigation. According to the board, Davis Polk found Mr. Duffy had attempted "to exercise improper influence" over the exchange's regulatory activities. Specifically, Mr. Duffy was said to have "inappropriately attempted to control regulatory aspects of the exchange's rule-filing process in ways that went beyond his authority as vice chairman and that, publicly and in committee meetings, he disparaged the regulatory staff of the exchange in an unprofessional and inappropriate manner." More details weren't available.
