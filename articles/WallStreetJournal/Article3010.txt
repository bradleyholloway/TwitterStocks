 Levitt Says Wave of Accounting Mergers Could Affect Independence of Auditors   By By Elizabeth MacDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1997  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur C. Levitt said he is "concerned" that the accounting industry's recent merger wave could impinge on the independence of auditors as they review corporate books.  Mr. Levitt's remark, in an address to accounting industry officials yesterday, reflected his oftstated fear that as mergers create full service accounting consulting firms, auditors will give corporate clients favorable treatment to help co-workers win consulting jobs, at the expense of shareholders.  But Garret Rasmussen, an antitrust attorney with Patton Boggs LLP, Washington, D.C., said, "the Justice Department would seriously consider Mr. Levitt's comments, which may slow down the mergers' approval process." Mr. Levitt's "concern could be taken quite seriously by the antitrust division," said Jeffrey Zuckerman, another Washington antitrust attorney.
