 Enron's Auditors Debated Partnership Losses --- Andersen Memos Show That the Accountants Knew of Raptor Status   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2002  Enron set up four Raptor entities starting in 2000, ostensibly to help hedge company assets against any potential drops in value that could have resulted in charges to Enron earnings. These partnerships, which were related to other partnerships controlled by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were largely capitalized by putting Enron's own stock into the entities. But they also owned a variety of speculative holdings whose value, like Enron's stock, was falling sharply in 2001, leaving the Raptors severely weakened financially. The Raptor-related memos released yesterday show how Andersen allowed Enron to account for those holdings under a "heads I win, tails you lose" system, as Mr. [Carl Bass] described it in a March 4, 2001, memo. As previously reported, Mr. Bass was removed from his Enron oversight role on March 12, 2001, in response to complaints by Enron's chief accounting officer at the time, Richard A. Causey, about Mr. Bass's resistance to the company's financial-reporting practices.  To Enron, the first alternative, which Andersen agreed to, was preferable. That's because it had set up a series of offsetting transactions between the Raptors and other off-the-books entities controlled by Mr. Fastow. That allowed Enron to ostensibly use losses in one entity to offset another. Among the Andersen partners who concurred on that method were David Duncan, the lead partner on the Enron account; and two other partners on the Enron account, Debra Cash and Mike Lowther; as well as Michael Odom, the audit practice director for Andersen's Houston office, internal Andersen documents show.
