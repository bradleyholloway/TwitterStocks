 SN Brussels and Virgin Express To Join Forces, Ending Dogfight   By Knight, Victoria, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2004  Under a complex set of arrangements, shareholders of SN Brussels will receive a 70.1% stake in a new combined holding company. Mr. Branson's investment vehicle, Virgin Sky Investments Ltd., which holds 89% of Virgin Express, will hold the other 29.9%. Virgin Sky Investments has offered to buy out minority shareholders in Virgin Express, paying 1 euro a share. It then would seek to delist the shares from Euronext Brussels.  Stephen Murphy, a member of Virgin Express's board, said that given the current tough market conditions, the airlines' best chances of survival lay in joining forces. The Brussels airport, which can barely support both SN Brussels and Virgin Express, the only two airlines based in the city, also faces a rising challenge because low-cost Ryanair Holdings flies to nearby Charleroi.
