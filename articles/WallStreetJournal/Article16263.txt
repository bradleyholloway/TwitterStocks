 Viacom Seen as Top Vivendi Bidder --- Auction for TV, Film Units Expected to Draw a Crowd; Diller May Not Be a Factor   By By Martin Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2003  Attempts by Vivendi to unwind Vivendi Universal Entertainment, making a sale of the entertainment assets easier, have also gone nowhere, say several people close to the situation. While USA could retain its minority stake in the venture, one person close to Vivendi said USA's presence could deter some buyers. A further sign that Mr. [Barry Diller]'s interest may be cooling is that Liberty Media Corp., which was expected to partner with Mr. Diller in any Vivendi deal, is putting less priority on such a deal. Liberty CEO Robert Bennett said in an interview earlier this week that while Liberty remains interested, it was more actively pursuing other deals, such as a possible bid for control of DirecTV owner Hughes Electronics Corp., part of General Motors Corp.  Nine months after Vivendi ousted Chairman Jean-Marie Messier amid a brush with financial disaster, the company, which reports fourth-quarter earnings after tomorrow's board meeting, finally appears to be setting a course for the future of its entertainment businesses. Vivendi's entertainment assets include the world's biggest music company, Universal Music Group, as well as the Universal film studio and the USA and Sci-Fi cable networks. Vivendi is preparing to canvass potential bidders for its film and TV entertainment assets and also to consider how much money could be raised in an initial public offering of the entire entertainment business.
