 With Confusing Results for 1st Quarter, It Isn't Surprising the Market Is Stalled   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1993  You aren't alone. Just look at some of the results of first-quarter earnings to date. Auto makers and heavy equipment manufacturers turned in surprisingly good earnings. But steelmakers, whose products are the core of autos and machinery, produced lousy profits. And while banks had a surprisingly good first quarter, investors now are dumping them.  Analysts sorting through the surprises in first-quarter earnings, both positive and negative, say it isn't surprising that the stock market has been stalled for the past few weeks. Economically sensitive stocks dominated the list of positive surprises for the quarter, but played a big role in the list of negative surprises as well. While some analysts think the best is still ahead for stock prices, others are warning that a substantial correction may be in the making.  "Overall, first-quarter earnings came in about as expected, but it appears that we're losing earnings momentum," says Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "It looks like we're going to have not only a sluggish economic recovery, but a subpar recovery in earnings, too."
