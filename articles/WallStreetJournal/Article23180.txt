 JWT Hire Signals Shifting Strategy; Montague, Who Is Known For His Guerrilla Marketing, Joins Traditional Ad Shop   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2004  Mr. Jeffrey, who took over as CEO of JWT in January, has been working overtime to elevate the creative output in many of the agency's 310 offices world-wide, scouring the globe for creative talent. But changing JWT, a Madison Avenue icon whose clients include Ford Motor and Pfizer, won't be easy. The firm long has been saddled with a sleepy creative reputation, say new-business consultants. The image is a result of its long association with consumer packaged-goods companies such as Unilever, which for years used nonsexy advertising that largely was formulaic in nature.  Mr. Montague's former firm, Wieden + Kennedy, widely is credited with devising newfangled marketing techniques to sell products. Last year, for example, Mr. Montague and his team produced an hour-long documentary on boxing champion Roy Jones Jr. to promote Nike, the firm's major client. Mr. Jones is a Nike pitchman and during the film he wore the company's Jordan apparel -- such as knit caps -- featuring the Nike Jumpman logo. While the feature cost about $650,000 to produce, about twice as much as a high-profile commercial, Walt Disney's ESPN2 cable channel agreed to air it free of charge.
