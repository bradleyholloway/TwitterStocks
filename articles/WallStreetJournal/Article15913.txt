 As U.S. Population Grows, All States Are Far From Equal   By By Peter Francese, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2000  In recent weeks, census questionnaires have been delivered to 120 million housing units in 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. But one thing already is clear: The Census Bureau estimates that half of the 26-million-person growth over the past decade took place in just six states, each of which gained more than a million new residents since 1990. In order by total growth they are California, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina. Those six states, home to just 24% of Americans in 1970, today are home to 33%. Washington state ranked seventh in terms of growth since 1990, but fell short of gaining a million residents.  The top destinations for interstate migrants were Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, with the largest migration losses occurring in New York, California and Illinois. Meanwhile, immigration is increasing in almost every state, including New York, which gained over a million new immigrants. But nearly half of the new arrivals, mostly from Latin America or Asia, went to the top three growth states: 30% to California, 10% to Texas and 9% to Florida.  But migration between California and other states during the 1990s was a big departure from past decades. Instead of a net inflow of more than a million people per decade -- as was the case in the 1980s -- the census is likely to show a net outflow of at least a million, and perhaps as many as two million people, during the '90s. One of the main reasons Nevada and Arizona were the two fastest-growing states during the past decade is because so many people moved there from California.
