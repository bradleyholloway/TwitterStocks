 Mint's Bad Taste; U.S. Farms See Sales Fall As Toothpaste, Gum Makers Buy Cheaper Oils Overseas   By Brat, Ilan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2005  Instead, U.S. gum and toothpaste companies are buying cheaper mint oil in other parts of the world, like India. Now the 52-year-old Mr. [DREW EGGERS] hopes his aging equipment will last until his planned retirement in about five years. "It's just harder and more difficult to do it these days," says Mr. Eggers. "It's a dead-end road."  Other American mint farmers are hurting as well. Even though world- wide consumption of mint-related products rose 27% from 1998 to 2004, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, the U.S. industry is dwindling. In 1997, at the peak, about 800 U.S. farmers in seven major mint-producing states generated 14 million pounds of mint oil, according to the Mint Industry Research Council. This year those numbers dropped to about 400 farmers and 8.9 million pounds. Meanwhile, mint oil imports from India have more than doubled to 3.4 million pounds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service.  Companies like Wrigley don't buy mint oil directly from farmers. Rather, they contract with suppliers such as A.M. Todd. Many U.S. suppliers say they buy mint mainly in the U.S. but also outside the country. A Wrigley spokesman said the company's mint comes from the upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the U.S., although "some sourcing takes place from different geographies." For competitive reasons, manufacturers are reluctant to reveal whether they are buying more mint overseas, or stronger varieties. While India doesn't have huge commercial mint farms, more farmers in recent years are producing mint, although exact numbers aren't tracked.
