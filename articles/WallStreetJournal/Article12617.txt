 Disease Fighters: A look at where the genome breakthrough is now leading researchers   By By Arthur Fisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2000  Nir Barzilai is director of the Longevity Genes Project at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York City. The first group enrolled in his project consists of 100 subjects whose average age is 100, as well as their spouses and children, for a total of some 400 people. Previous research indicates that genetic influences on longevity are strongest in very old people. As part of Dr. Barzilai's research, the DNA of these "old old" is analyzed to see how it may differ from the norm.  Recent compelling research shows that there is a genetic basis for longevity in cells and lower organisms. For example, one of the most dramatic life extensions was a threefold increase in the life span of C. elegans, a nematode, by inducing mutations in its DNA. Some specimens lived for 30 days rather than the normal 10 days. When researchers examined the DNA of these long-lived specimens, they found that specific genes were involved. Much evidence indicates that similar mechanisms apply to humans, and that there are some genes that ensure longevity.  Many genes that lead to decreased life expectancy have been identified, including ones associated with premature death, such as a breast cancer gene and one responsible for unhealthy levels of blood lipids. "Now," says Dr. Barzilai, "there are at last four candidate genes that have been initially implicated in longevity. These genes are likely to enhance life expectancy by protecting from killer diseases, such as atherosclerosis. There may be `longevity' genes and `killing' genes."
