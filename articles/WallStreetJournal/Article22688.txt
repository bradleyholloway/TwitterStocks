 Artists See Visions of `Apocalypse' Now   By By Lesley Downer, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2000  Since then there has been a barrage of prepublicity. We have been inundated with key images from the exhibition, among them Jake and Dinos Chapman's "Hell" and Maurizio Cattelan's "La Nona Ora" ("The Ninth Hour"), a life-size wax sculpture of Pope John Paul II struck down by a meteorite. All this hype only results in us approaching "Apocalypse" with a fair degree of skepticism. Would it be yet another display of shocking images by Damien Hirst and his cronies, the media-anointed YBAs (Young British Artists)? Since when did art by its nature have to be shocking? Could we still be shocked when shock has become a commercial commodity? And why had the staid old Royal Academy once again gone all out to shock us?  After the bombardment of close-ups of the Chapman brothers' panoramic vision of hell, showing bloody torn-off limbs and mutilated figures in Nazi uniforms, reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch's depictions of the netherworld, the first surprise is how small it is. The figures torturing, hanging, crucifying and eating one another turn out to be tiny tin soldiers in a miniature landscape. There are gas chambers, pools overflowing with corpses, forests of heads on poles and a volcano with a mushroom cloud of smoke, laid out in nine tableaux to form the arms of a swastika. According to Mr. [NORMAN ROSENTHAL], "Hell" is the centerpiece of the exhibition. But the Chapmans -- whose phallic-faced children in the "Sensation" exhibition were surely far more offensive than Mr. [Chris Ofili]'s "Virgin" -- have been quoted as saying that it is all a grotesque joke. It is a cartoon version of hell, too Hollywood to shock and certainly far less beautiful or profound than the work of Bosch.
