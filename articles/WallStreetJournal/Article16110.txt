 USX-U.S. Steel, Bethlehem May Merge --- Government Help Is Sought; Competitors Are Invited To Join New Company   By By Robert Guy Matthews, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2001  Combining the top two integrated steel companies isn't expected to raise antitrust issues, at least in the U.S., because the industry is so fragmented and the combined company would probably control less than 25% of domestic steel production.  Antitrust officials in Europe, though, are likely to voice opposition to any consolidation of U.S. companies, as they have to several other recent high-profile U.S. mergers.  The consolidation plan would allow U.S. integrated steelmakers to cast off a huge portion of their expensive legacy costs, obligations that many foreign steel companies don't have. Many foreign steelmakers were privatized in recent years from formerly state-run enterprises.
