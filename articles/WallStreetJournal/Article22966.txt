 Letters to the Editor: Charter-School Train Chugs on Past `The Blob'   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2003  I do not quibble with the facts you presented, but the imagery of a sputtering engine is something else. When an engine threatens to stall out, that usually signals a mechanical defect. To the contrary, the charter-school engine is running strong. The rubble strewn in the path of this within-the-system reform by Big Education's vested interests, aka The Blob, is what causes a healthy engine to labor.
