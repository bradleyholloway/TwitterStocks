 Can Yanks Export Good Times to Latins? --- U.S. Theme Parks, Cinemas Rush into Brazil, Argentina   By By Jonathan Friedland, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1997  "Our business is exploding," says Mr. Kahn, who hails from New York and whose new company, Futura-Tech Brasil, creates fantastic facades for restaurants and theme parks. "I've got 50 workers now, and we'll probably be 150 within six months."  Mr. Kahn has come to Brazil as part of an army of U.S. entrepreneurs who are taking part in the latest multibillion-dollar investment boom to grip the region. Latin Americans may have invented salsa, samba and the stadium wave, but until now, no one has sought to cash in systematically on their love of a good time.  That's changing rapidly. A half-dozen amusement and water parks are under construction in Argentina and Brazil, at a total cost of around $1.5 billion. Developers are ringing the region's big cities with malls grouping multiplex cinemas, laser shoot-'em-ups and game centers. And theme restaurants, ranging from international leaders such as Planet Hollywood to home-grown alternatives such as the Rock In Rio Cafe, are sprouting everywhere.
