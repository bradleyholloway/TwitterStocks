 Fairness Doctrine Bill Is Approved By House, 302-102   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  The House voted 302-102 for a bill making the fairness doctrine a law and sent it to the White House.  The fairness doctrine, which dates back to the early days of television, requires broadcasters who air controversial material to give opponents free air time to respond. Last fall, a U.S. Appeals Court panel ruled that the doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission regulation, hadn't been specifically required by law, thus freeing the agency to repeal it. Passage of the legislation making the doctrine a law, however, has forestalled any FCC action.
