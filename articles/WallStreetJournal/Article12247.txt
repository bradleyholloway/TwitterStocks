 Total Madness   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1997  In the same news cycle that saw the U.S. send the aircraft carrier Nimitz to the Persian Gulf because Iranian and Iraqi warplanes were jacking up tensions there, we have the Prime Minister of France declaring that he "rejoices" in a project that might give Iran the wherewithal to acquire nuclear missiles. That, indeed, is how Prime Minister Lionel Jospin described his reaction to the new $2 billion deal by the French Total Oil Group (along with Russia's Gazprom and Malaysia's Petronas), which will provide Iran with a new income source.  Mr. Jospin, of course, knows that Total's actions could trigger sanctions under the U.S. D'Amato law, which he, like nearly every politician and opinion-maker in Europe claims is an illegitimate "extraterritorial" extension of U.S. law. In fact, a lot of laws all over the globe are extraterritorial in the sense of exacting punishment when foreign interests conflict with some domestic interest. D'Amato seeks to curb access to the U.S. market and financial resources by firms investing heavily in Iran's energy sector; the law's intent is to deny Iran (and Libya) funds to develop weapons of mass destruction. France doesn't let foreign firms do as they will in France either, if their activities are in some way contrary to French law or policy.
