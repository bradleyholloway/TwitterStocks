 U.S. Auto Sales Reported Flat For Oct. 21-31 --- Stock Drop Impact Is Slight But Some Officials Say Outlook Still Uncertain   By By Joseph B. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1987  Dealers sold 218,649 cars in the Oct. 21-31 period, compared with 218,740 in the same period last year. For the Big Three U.S. auto makers, total vehicle sales in late October -- including domestic cars, imported models and light trucks -- rose 11.5% to 334,165 vehicles from 299,634 a year ago.  "We feel encouraged about it (the late October sales performance)," said John O. Grettenberger, General Motors Corp. vice president in charge of the Cadillac Division. Cadillac sales were up 28% in the most recent 10-day period, and up 2.3% for the month. But Mr. Grettenberger added that customer traffic in Cadillac dealerships is down. "We feel there are some dark clouds on the horizon in the months ahead," he said.  Meanwhile, most of the major Japanese manufacturers saw their U.S. car sales hold steady, or inch up. An exception was Nissan Motor Co., which saw its total U.S. sales of both imported and U.S.-built cars slip 8.7% in October. However, Nissan's share of the total market was up to 5.3% for the month from 5.1% a year ago. Another loser was Isuzu Motors Ltd., which saw its October sales slip 42.8%.
