 WORK & FAMILY   By By Sue Shellenbarger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1992  General Motors offers some managers overseas "professional development" stints of up to six months, rather than the two- to three-year assignments of the past. Other companies send people overseas earlier in their careers, giving them international experience before they get too settled, says Calvin Reynolds of Organization Resources Counselors, a New York consultant.  The numbers don't fully reflect the burden on many low-income workers. One fourth of 1,500 members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union surveyed recently said child care consumed more than 35% of their gross pay. Maria Estela Acero, a sewing-machine operator in New York City, spends $105 of her $200-a-week income on care for her two young sons. Through a translator, Ms. Acero says she keeps working because she doesn't like being idle.  Others take on debt to pay for high-quality care. Pat Ward and her husband, parents of two, borrowed money from her parents to pay $10,000 a year, their half-share of the salary of an experienced caregiver for her first child and a neighbor's child in New York City. "We had to make a decision about our priorities," says Ms. Ward, a child-care specialist for the National Council of Jewish Women. The couple chose to take on debt rather than settle for less-expensive care. "If you borrow money to finance an education, why not child care?" asks Ms. Ward.
