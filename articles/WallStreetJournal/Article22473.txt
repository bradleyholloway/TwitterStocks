 Massachusetts Nears Pact In IPO Probe   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1998  The Massachusetts Securities Division is in advanced settlement talks with Joseph Charles & Associates Inc. to force the Boca Raton, Fla., brokerage firm to abandon its policy of penalizing brokers who allow their clients to "flip," or quickly sell, IPOs in the state, according to people familiar with the matter.  The pact, which is likely to be made final in the next few weeks, would mark the first regulatory fallout from scrutiny into such IPO practices. Federal and state inquiries were triggered this summer by articles in The Wall Street Journal that described how securities firms try to persuade individual investors to hold on to IPOs while allowing big institutional investors to flip hot new stocks with impunity.  "Requiring firms to abandon their penalty-bid policies is one of the more severe sanctions we will impose," said Matthew Nestor, Massachusetts enforcement chief. Though he declined to discuss the Joseph Charles settlement, Mr. Nestor said generally: "We remain concerned that penalty bids are not being disclosed to customers." Joseph Charles declined to comment.
