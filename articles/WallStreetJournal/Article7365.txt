 United Air Says It Will Retain Some Discounts --- Decision Is Triggering Fears Of Renewed Fare Wars; Airline Stock Prices Fall   By By Delia Flores and Harlan S. Byrne, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1985  United Airlines said it retained certain discount fares, a decision that challenges the latest industry fare structure and could trigger a new fare war.  The carrier said it will keep its Super Coach fares in the 300 markets where it competes directly with cut-rate carriers People Express and Continental Airlines, or about 10% of its markets. United had planned to drop the discount fares Feb. 18.  In response, Trans World Airlines, American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., and Delta Air Lines, said they would follow United's lead in markets where they compete.
