 Not Tonight, Honey: The Plight Of the Dual-Income, No-Sex Couple   By By Sue Shellenbarger, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2003  Dual-earner lifestyles aren't the root cause, says Janet Hyde, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Fatigue is a better predictor of low sex desire in women than work roles, Dr. Hyde and others found in a study of more than 500 women and their husbands. And homemakers reported just as much fatigue as employed women. The notion that wives' employment causes celibacy may just be a handy way to dodge deeper sexual problems, Dr. Hyde says.  Women aren't the only ones refusing sex, either. In a study of 75 married people in sexually inactive marriages, Dr. [Denise Donnelly] found that in 60% of the cases, it was the man who had stopped the sex. The couples cited a variety of apparent reasons, from extramarital affairs to demanding jobs, drugs, alcohol or finances.  -- "Just do it." Giving credit to Nike for this borrowed slogan, Ms. [Michele Weiner Davis] advises low-desire spouses to consider having sex even when they don't feel much like it. Before all you individual-rights advocates jump out of your chairs to protest, think about it this way: Real giving in marriage involves providing what your spouse wants and needs, without necessarily understanding or agreeing with why he or she needs it, Ms. Davis says. Ideally, that's a mutual process.
