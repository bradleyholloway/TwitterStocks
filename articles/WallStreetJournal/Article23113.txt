 Big Drug Mergers Can Be Hard to Swallow; Investors Point to Anemic Precedents When Assessing Novartis's Potential Bid for Aventis   By Anita Raghavan and Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 2, 2004  Similarly, the stock of Sanofi-Synthelabo -- maker of the popular blood-thinning drug Plavix and Ambien, a sleeping pill -- has risen only 59% in the three years since completing the merger of the two French pharmaceutical concerns. Sanofi's stock had more than tripled and Synthelabo's stock had rocketed more than fourfold in the three years before the merger was unveiled. And AstraZeneca PLC's stock has climbed 33% in the three years after the two companies closed their deal. But in the three years prior to announcing their merger, Astra's stock jumped 63% and Zeneca's stock leapt 95%, says Birinyi. (An AstraZeneca spokesman, saying it is important not to place too much weight on such data because stock-market conditions vary, notes that the company's share price performed well in 2003 both in absolute terms and relative to an international group of pharmaceutical companies.)
