 Advanta's Earnings for Third Quarter To Be Below Forecasts; Shares Fall 33%   By By Anne Marie Chaker, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2000  Advanta Class A shares were off $3.56, or 33%, at $7.25 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading, a 52-week low. The stock had been trading as high as $21.875 in March.  She added that "if you believe the economy is softening, then naturally the number of business failures is going to rise" -- a prospect that led Advanta to increase its credit-card reserves.  Advanta said the $23 million charge also includes higher costs at the company's office-equipment leasing business, for which it had been using brokers, resulting in higher expenses during prior periods.
