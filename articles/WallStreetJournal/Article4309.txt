 Supercomputer Accord Aims to Improve U.S. Makers' Access to Japanese Market   By By Kathryn Graven, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1987  A new agreement between the U.S. and Japan should make it easier for American companies to sell supercomputers in Japan, but American firms aren't expected to sweep the Japanese market in the near future.  Friday's exchange formalized previous moves by the Japanese government. In mid-July, after studying U.S procurement procedures for nine months, the Japanese government issued new guidelines which call on public institutions to publicly announce plans to purchase a supercomputer.  Analysts say that of the three big U.S. manufacturers of supercomputers -- Cray Research Inc., Control Data Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- Cray is the one likely to benefit the most from the new Japanese guidelines. Minneapolis-based Cray has made the greatest strides in the Japanese market so far. Analysts say the company has an advantage because it offers a much wider selection of supercomputer software than the Japanese competitors do.
