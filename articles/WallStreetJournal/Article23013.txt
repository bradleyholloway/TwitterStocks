 Pedaling With the Tour de France --- Cyclists May Still Find Spaces Available on Trips That Track the Big Race   By By Rose Marie Burke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2003  Prices range from less than $200 a day for Graham Baxter's bring-your-own-bike trips and VeloSport's self-guided tour, to more than $1,000 a day for one of U.S.-based Trek Travel's packages (promising VIP access to the Tour de France Village and the chance to rub elbows with the U.S. Postal Service team, including the current Tour de France champion, Lance Armstrong.)  Participants have a chance to do a century -- 100 miles, or 160 kilometers. The rest of each trip is divided into viewing days and riding days of 50 kilometers to 100 kilometers. The three tours during the Tour de France this year are: Lyon to Avignon, July 10-16; Geneva to Toulouse, July 12-19; and Toulouse to Paris, July 20-28.  Graham Baxter, based in the United Kingdom, is in its 14th year on the Tour de France, with 13 trips open to bicyclists and nonriders. The packages range from GBP 169 ($277) for the start weekend (July 4-6), to GBP 1,050 for a 14-day trip featuring the mountain stages (July 10-23).
