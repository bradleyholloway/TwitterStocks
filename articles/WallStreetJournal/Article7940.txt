 Princeton Judge Imposes Terms Up to 6 Months --- Light Sentences Are Blow To Use of RICO Statute Against Securities Aides   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1989  U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter sentenced five officials of Princeton/Newport and a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader to prison terms ranging from three to six months. The federal racketeering law under which they were convicted allows for sentences of as much as 20 years per count.  Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman, all of whom were general partners of the investment firm, were sentenced to three-month prison terms. Steven B. Smotrich, Princeton/Newport's comptroller and Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel junk-bond trader who worked for Mr. Milken, also received three-month sentences. Mr. Berkman was fined $100,000, Mr. Rabinowitz was fined $50,000, and Messrs. Newberg and Zarzecki were fined $165,000 each.  Judge Carter upheld RICO asset forfeitures for Mr. Zarzecki and Mr. Newberg, ordering Mr. Zarzecki to forfeit $1.38 million and Mr. Newberg to forfeit $200,000. The judge said that because those two defendants were convicted of helping Drexel to manipulate the price of C.O.M.B. Co. stock on behalf of Drexel, in addition to creating fraudulent tax deductions, RICO forfeitures were an appropriate punishment. Judge Carter noted, however, that he believed the forfeiture in Mr. Zarzecki's case was "draconian" in relation to the crime.
