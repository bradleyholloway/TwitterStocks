 Dangerous Mission: Young Iraqi Judge Arraigns Mr. Hussein; Despite Risks, Raad Juhi Aims To Build Nation's Future; 3 Attempts on His Life   By Fassihi, Farnaz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 2004  "Anyone who tells you 'I'm not afraid' is lying," says Mr. Juhi, dressed in a navy-blue suit and red tie in his office at a government building, where bodyguards mind the door. "I tell myself I have a moral responsibility to see justice implemented, but at the same time I can't forget that I have a family and have to be very cautious."  Mr. Juhi has played an important behind-the-scenes role in the occupation of Iraq for more than a year, as one of the young Iraqi professionals crucial to the new government's efforts to hold the country together. He investigated the assassination of a member of the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council. He was also the judge who issued an arrest warrant for firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. President Bush cited the indictment when he ordered a major offensive against Mr. Sadr and his militia several months ago. Mr. Juhi also sentenced a U.S.-appointed governor of Najaf to 14 years in prison on corruption charges last July.  Concerned that Mr. Sadr's movements were disrupting the occupation several months ago, U.S. authorities earlier this year unsealed an arrest warrant Mr. Juhi signed in August. President Bush then approved a major offensive against the cleric's armed militia, citing Mr. Juhi's warrant as justification. It did not identify Mr. Juhi by name.
