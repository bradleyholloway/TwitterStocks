 Endesa Share Offering Outcome May Set Tone of Spain's Privatization Effort   By By Carlta Vitzthum, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1997  The outcome of next month's share offer by Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA -- the largest-ever in Spain -- is likely to set the tone for the remainder of the government's ambitious privatization program.  While share offers by telephone company Telefonica de Espana SA and oil and gas group Repsol SA proved to be a smooth success earlier this year, Endesa, as the big 67-state-owned electricity utility is known, is likely to face a rougher market, analysts said.  The Endesa offer is expected to be followed later this year by the sale of government stakes in several other companies, including duty-free chain Aldeasa and insurer Musini SA. Earlier this week, Industry Minister Josep Pique said the state hoped to raise as much as 1.5 trillion pesetas ($9.78 billion) through asset sales before year end. Spain is expected to continue with its privatization effort next year with the sale of shares in banking group Argentaria Corp. Bancaria de Espana and tobacco company Tabacalera SA.
