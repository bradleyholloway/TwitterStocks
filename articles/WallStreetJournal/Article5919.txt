 Foreign Investors Debate Whether Stock Rallies In South Korea, Taiwan Have Staying Power   By By Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  Coming off a dreadful year that sent U.S. investors running for cover, stocks in South Korea and Taiwan are off to a fast start in 2001. Fickle foreign money is pouring in once again.  Despite laying claim as the home to a host of world-class technology companies, Taiwan and South Korea were among the worst-performing stock markets globally last year. The Kospi slid 51%, while the Taipei blue-chip stocks did only marginally better, falling 44% to four-and-a-half year lows.  In TOKYO, the Nikkei 225 Index fell 1.9%, or 257.10 points, to 13610.51. Stocks of export-oriented companies slumped despite continued weakness in the yen that makes their products more competitive globally. NEC fell 3.4% to 2,120 yen, while Fujitsu shed 2.4% to 1,717 yen. Matsushita Electric Industrial declined 1.8% to 2,750 yen and Fuji Photo Film fell 1.2% to 4,810 yen. Bank stocks were weaker on concerns that their sagging equity portfolios and bad-debt problems may pressure earnings and may hinder the banks' efforts to improve the status of their loan portfolios. Mizuho Holdings fell 2.7% to 696,000 yen, and Daiwa Bank fell 3.3% to 176 yen.
