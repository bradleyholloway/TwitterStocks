 South Korea Is Planning More Steps To Fund, Restructure Ailing Banks   By By Hae Won Choi, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2000  The Financial Supervisory Commission, South Korea's financial watchdog, said yesterday it would inject seven trillion won ($5.82 billion) into the banks by the end of December. The six banks include Hanvit Bank and Seoulbank, large banks taken over by the government after previous injections of capital.  The government's need for more funds to support the financial sector reflects South Korea's continuing struggle to deal with bad loans, debt-laden companies and shaky financial institutions three years after a debt crisis forced Seoul into a bailout led by the International Monetary Fund.
