 Taste -- de gustibus: 'Tis the Season For Surly Shakedowns   By By Tunku Varadarajan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 2002  Of the dowdy, drugstore variety, the card had a festive scene on its face and "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays" printed inside. Enclosed was an envelope that [Leon] had addressed to himself. Naturally, there was no stamp. Inscribed in the card, in a careless script that reflected not so much his possible under-education as his mercenary haste, were these words: "Give thanks!" No name, no "Best wishes, Leon," just "Give thanks!"  It would seem, if I may take Leon as an emblem of Western Civilization's still-declining state, that what used to be requests -- gently expressed expectations of reciprocal civility -- have now become demands. Leon, 20 years ago, would have inscribed a note in his card saying, perhaps: "I hope you have been satisfied with your service this year." (For some, even that would have seemed too pushy.) It would never have occurred to him to behave like a home-delivery "squeegee man."  Leon isn't alone. Doormen, babysitters, supers, mailmen, indeed anyone with whom one has a relationship involving the routine provision of services, can now be counted on to perform an elaborate act of throat-clearing in the run-up to Christmas, accompanied by the dropping of hints -- no, make that the sending up of flares -- about what sum of money might be the most appropriate for a tip (inflation-adjusted). Few merely suggest a gratuity or a little holiday sweetener; most badger or clamor for one.
