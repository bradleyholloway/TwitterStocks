 Market Finishes Day About Unchanged As Volume Amounts to Just 114 Million   By By Sonja Steptoe, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1989  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished largely unchanged, down a scant 0.10 to 408.20, on volume of only 114 million shares. Among larger issues, the Nasdaq 100 Index of nonfinancial stocks grew just 0.22 to 372.40. The Nasdaq Financial Index didn't do much better, adding 0.20 to 401.22.  William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said trading action at his firm was busier than it has been in about a week. But, he added, "It wasn't anything to write home about. It wasn't sustained stuff."  Mr. Sulya also said he sees little evidence to support the claim that small stocks will significantly outperform larger ones over the next several months. Although the stock market overall has rebounded nicely from its October 1987 cold minor lapse, he said, "for {smaller} issues to break out, there has to be investor confidence in the market, and I don't think that kind of confidence is there."
