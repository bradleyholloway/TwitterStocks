 Time Warner Said to Consider Plan to Pay Debt --- Rights Offering Is Expected To Be Disclosed Today; Stock Price Drops $6.25   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1991  Time Warner Inc. directors met to consider a plan to raise as much as $3 billion through an unusual rights offering that would be used to pay down part of the company's $11 billion debt, according to people familiar with the plan.  Time Warner declined to comment, and wouldn't confirm that the board had met. But the company is expected to announce the plan today. Although terms couldn't be learned, sources described it as a "rights offering with a twist" that would give current Time Warner shareholders the right to buy newly issued stock in the company at a discount.
