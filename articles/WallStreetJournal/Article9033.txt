 Perhaps the Small-Caps Rebound `January Effect' Should Be Called 'Mid-December Effect' Instead   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1998  "In the past few years, the small caps' rebound usually came in late December, not just in January," says Claudia Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential Securities in a report released late last month. Much of the effect, in fact, "has played out by the end of the first week of the new year," she says.  But Ms. Mott and other analysts contend the phenomenon isn't really a January effect at all, but a turn-of-the-year event that stretches from mid-December to the first two weeks of the new year. She suspects the recent improved performance of small-cap issues marks the beginning of the effect.  Data compiled recently by Goldman, Sachs' equity-derivatives research department shows that since 1979 the Russell 2000 small-cap index has performed 2.1% better from mid-December to mid-January. In January itself, the small stocks' performance edge drops to below 1%.
