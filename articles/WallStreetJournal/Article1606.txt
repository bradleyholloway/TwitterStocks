 Arts & Entertainment: A Day in the Life of a Life-Size Doll --- After a Film That Blurred the Line Between Family and Art, Artist Blurs Line Between Reality and Art With New Show   By Chou, Kimberly, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2011  Since the success last fall of the film "Tiny Furniture," artist Laurie Simmons, whose work has appeared at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among other institutions, has found herself recognized in new ways. (Their real-life father is the painter Carroll Dunham, who isn't in the film.) Much of "Tiny Furniture" was shot at the actual Simmons-Dunham apartment downtown, with fake art made for the film on the walls of Ms. Simmons's studio downstairs. "Since the character of Siri wasn't really me, I didn't think it was appropriate for the art to be mine," Ms. Simmons said.
