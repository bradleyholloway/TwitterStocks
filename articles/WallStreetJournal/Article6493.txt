 Insurers Lincoln, Jefferson-Pilot Are Close to Setting Merger Pact   By Dennis K. Berman, Theo Francis and Leslie Scism, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  Barring any last-minute snags, the transaction between Lincoln, of Philadelphia, and Jefferson-Pilot, of Greensboro, N.C., could be announced as early as this morning. Both companies have long itched to move from their perch as midsize players in the insurance and annuity business and find in each other firms of roughly equivalent size.  A spokesman for Lincoln declined to comment. A Jefferson-Pilot spokesman didn't return requests for comment.  Lincoln's earnings are dominated by its annuity business. In the second quarter, Lincoln's earnings from annuities were marginally above analysts' expectations, and in line for life-insurance results, according to a Morgan Stanley report. Life-insurance sales were flat, the report said. Those results point to the tough competitive environment facing life insurers, one reason that analysts say mergers and acquisitions make sense.
