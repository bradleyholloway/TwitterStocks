 Shares Fall Across Much of Asia as Investors Respond to Currency Woes, Rising Default Risks   By By Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1997  Manila fell 3.4%, Thailand slid 1.2% while Indonesia dropped 0.5%, although volumes were fairly low. Even in Hong Kong, where the currency has remained firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar despite currency turbulence elsewhere in Asia, worries about the property sector sparked a 2.3% decline in the Hang Seng Index.  Tokyo bucked the trend in Asia with a 1% rise inspired by domestic institutional buying. Meanwhile European markets ended the day mixed, as investors focused on the sales of several state-owned European telecommunications companies, including France Telecom, the largest initial public offering out of France.  In MANILA, the Philippines Stock Exchange composite index shed 68.43 points, or 3.4%, to end at 1961.24 on concerns that the banking sector will suffer from further defaults on loans following a rise in domestic interest rates. Many of the banks have substantial exposure to the real-estate sector, an area which some investors expect to suffer from impending new supply.
