 Partnership Launches $14-a-Share Offer To Buy Duro-Test   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1987  NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- A partnership led by Yale University Professor William P. Lyons launched a $14-a-share, or $66 million, tender offer for the 92% of Duro-Test Corp. it doesn't already own.  The offer by TCA-IV L.P. follows the North Bergen, N.J., light bulb maker's rejection last week of the partnership's $13-a-share, or $61 million, takeover proposal. Duro-Test had termed the proposal inadequate.  Duro-Test has 5.1 million shares outstanding. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Duro-Test shares closed yesterday at $14, up $1.625.
