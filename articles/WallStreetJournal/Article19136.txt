 U.S. Sees `Hoglift' to Honduras Aiding Both Nations   By By Jeanne Cummings and Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1999  His assignment: Prepare to move 5,000 hogs from hard-pressed farmers in the Midwest and deliver them to farmers in Honduras who were devastated by Hurricane Mitch. If Honduras agrees to the idea, the pigs probably would travel via a converted military C-130 flown by a volunteer National Guard pilot. And, not so coincidentally, many of the hogs would be purchased from farmers in Iowa, which just happens to be the first state to hold presidential caucuses next year.  President Clinton may learn more about the fate of the porklift proposal next week, when he travels to Central America to view the hurricane recovery efforts. In addition to Honduras, Mr. Clinton's five-day tour will include stops in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. Hoping to shore up the fledgling democracies there, and to discourage widespread illegal immigration to the U.S., the Clinton administration has proposed $1.2 billion in emergency assistance to the countries.  The U.S. aid initially included plans for sending 10,000 hogs -- with half of them going to Nicaragua. But, after reassessing the hurricane damage to its domestic hog industry, Nicaragua took a pass. Honduras has yet to respond. A relocation of thousands of hogs would be a significant infusion of breeding stock into a Central American nation. And while it would amount to just a fraction of the U.S. pig population, for the American farming community any help is welcome.
