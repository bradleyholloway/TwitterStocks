 Attacking America's Drug Menace: The Bush Plan --- Cocaine Crusader: Behind Antidrug Plan Is the '60s Odyssey Of 'Czar' Bill Bennett --- Once-Liberal Academic Saw Dope Ruin Many Lives, Got Thoroughly Fed Up --- His Date With Janis Joplin   By By Paul M. Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1989  On a May morning in 1979, William Bennett arrived for a visit at the Bedford Hills, N.Y., home of one of his mentors, Charles Frankel. Mr. Bennett never had a chance to unpack his bags; shortly after arriving, he was summoned back home on urgent business.  Indeed, all of Mr. Bennett's brushes against the drug world figured in the formulation of the nation's new drug strategy. As a student and professor of philosophy from 1961 to 1975, he witnessed firsthand the spread of drug abuse and "the wreckage" it caused among young people. As a graduate student at the University of Texas, he once dated the singer Janis Joplin, who became heavily involved with drugs. At Harvard, he fought lenient faculty colleagues to impose stiff punishment on students caught selling prescription pills. Years later, as secretary of education, he toured urban high schools besieged by cocaine-dealing gangs.  His critics accuse the "drug czar" of letting his rash personality get in the way of his policies. "Bill Bennett's bluster may endear him to TV audiences, but his prescription won't defeat drug violence-only prolong it," says Richard Dennis, president of Chicago Resource Center, a civil-rights foundation. Many Americans, Mr. Dennis insists, "strongly believe that people should be allowed to do what they want, even if it injures themselves, as long as they don't present a clear and present danger to others." Criticism of Mr. Bennett doesn't just come from liberals; some prominent conservatives, such as Milton Friedman, have even suggested legalizing some drugs.
