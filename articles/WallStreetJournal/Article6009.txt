 Investigation & Mobilization: Bush Directive Limiting Classified Data To Congress After Leak Angers Leaders   By By Jim VandeHei and David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2001  Yet while Mr. [Bush] lashed out at Congress for leaking top-secret information, he signaled that he will likely back down just enough to allow more than the current eight lawmakers to receive classified antiterrorism briefings. "I want Congress to hear loud and clear, it is unacceptable behavior to leak classified information when we have troops at risk," said Mr. Bush. But, he added, "if there are concerns we will work it out."  The most sensitive details about covert actions by the Central Intelligence Agency, for example, are already sharply restricted. But the presidential directive narrowed the list to the top four leaders in both houses of Congress plus the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. This fits the notification practice set out in the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980, but it runs counter to a longstanding practice of notifying the Appropriations Committee leadership of covert actions.  Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D., Mich.) and other lawmakers said it is customary to withhold details on operations while they are being conducted, but he said the president's directive went much further. The opening portion speaks of protecting "military operational security, intelligence sources and methods" -- a goal Mr. Levin supports. But in a later portion the blackout is much broader and bans any briefing of members "regarding classified or sensitive law enforcement information."
