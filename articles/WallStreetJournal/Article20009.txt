 Check Which Hat Your Broker's Wearing   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2006  Brokerage-firm representatives and regulators reply that brokers are subject to more numerous regulations and standards than are investment advisers. "There's a whole book of regulations they have to follow. It's not just suitability," says Elisse Walter, senior executive vice president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the brokerage industry's self-regulatory body. For instance, brokers promise to provide "best execution" of transactions.  Adding to the confusion for investors is the fact that brokers rarely call themselves "brokers" anymore, preferring confidence- inspiring titles such as "financial adviser" or "financial consultant." Moreover, many individuals are registered as both brokers and investment advisers, meaning they can act in both roles.  Under the SEC's rule, brokers who do financial planning fall under the same fiduciary standard as investment advisers. But when acting primarily as fee-based brokers, they may offer financial advice that is "solely incidental" to their job of selling securities. Critics say the SEC's interpretation of "solely incidental" is too loose.
