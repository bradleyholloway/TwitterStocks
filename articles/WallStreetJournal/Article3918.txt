 Style & Substance: Diamond Store in the Rough; Opening of De Beers Boutique Will Test the Public Image Of Giant South African Miner   By Agins, Teri, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 2005  Four years later, as De Beers LV prepares to open its first U.S. store next month on New York's Fifth Avenue at 56th Street, it faces a host of challenges to its transformation to retailer from supplier. After opening a De Beers boutique in London and four in-store shops in Japan, the joint venture hasn't made the splash other retailers initially feared. Now, it faces several daunting tasks in the U.S., including establishing a distinctive brand image, refining its merchandise mix and winning over fickle consumers, who know the De Beers name mainly from the ad slogan written in 1948, "A Diamond is Forever."  While acknowledging growing pains at De Beers LV, Mr. Belloni, of LVMH, says the company has gotten "the basics absolutely right." Sales for the first two years, which he declines to disclose, have been "quite satisfactory" and in line with expectations, he says, adding, "But that isn't to say that we haven't made mistakes. We are learning and improving."  Unlike the intimidating formality at many high-end jewelers, the De Beers boutique has a number of features meant to make it feel more inviting, including the "Sparkle Room," a lounge area where shoppers can have the experience of being "inside a diamond," he says. A "Bridal Bar" on the mezzanine will be reserved for engagement-ring shoppers. And there is a high-tech flourish -- the "Beauty Scan," a microscope-type gadget that lets shoppers see on a screen how sparkly a diamonds is.
