 Getting Going: Rule No. 1: Don't Always Follow Rules   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2004  As we manage our money, we are forever being told "don't do this" and "don't do that." And most of the time, we should heed these warnings.  "Buying a tax-deferred annuity in your IRA is stupid," says Bob Frey, a financial planner in Bozeman, Mont. As he points out, you are paying extra fees for the annuity but you aren't getting any benefit from the annuity's tax deferral, because the IRA already gives you tax-deferred growth. Nonetheless, Mr. Frey says buying a tax-deferred annuity inside an IRA could make sense -- but only if you plan to turn the annuity into a stream of income right away. His reasoning: Money withdrawn from an IRA is taxed as ordinary income, so there's no tax disadvantage to holding an income-paying "immediate" annuity inside your IRA.  Suppose you delay purchasing a house, because you expect home prices to drop. "The risk is that, even if home prices go down, mortgage rates go up and you end up with a larger mortgage payment," Mr. Maloon says. All this, however, assumes you plan to stick around for a good long time. What if you don't? "Wasting money" on rent may indeed be the sensible choice. After all, if you put down $30,000 on a $300,000 home and move two years later, all it would take is a 10% dip in home prices to wipe out your down payment.
