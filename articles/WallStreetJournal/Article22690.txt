 Bridgestone May Ask U.S. Chief to Step Down   By By Todd Zaun and Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2000  Mr. [Masatoshi Ono]'s departure, though not yet official, would come at a time of deepening crisis for the U.S. unit, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., whose Firestone brand has been a force in the U.S. tire industry for about a century. Regulators and congressional investigators are probing Bridgestone/Firestone's handling of its massive recall of tires, allegedly linked to 101 deaths in the U.S. and more than 50 deaths overseas.  Mr. Ono, 63 years old, joined Bridgestone in 1959 as section manager/electrical engineer only a month after graduating from university in Japan. He moved to the U.S. unit in 1991. In 1993, he was named the unit's chief executive, succeeding Mr. [Yoichiro Kaizaki] in that post, and three years later was named chairman. During his tenure, the Firestone brand, severely damaged in the wake of an earlier recall of 14.5 million Firestone tires in 1978, was revitalized with expanded dealer outlets and a re-entry into Indy car racing.  Based on past practice at the company, it is considered most likely that the person who succeeds Mr. Ono will come from the parent company in Japan. However, one former Firestone executive believes the tire maker's dire situation may prompt the company to try something radically different, possibly promoting an American manager. The top U.S. executive currently at the U.S. unit is John Lampe, executive vice president, who is well-respected in the tire industry.
