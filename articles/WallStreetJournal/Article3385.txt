 With Sales Still So Weak, Retailers Are Banking On a Holiday Miracle   By By Rebecca Quick, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2000  Whether a blockbuster last weekend can save the entire holiday season, however, is still a long shot to some. "Just about everything that could go wrong this season has," says Dan Barry, senior retail analyst at Merrill Lynch. This week, Mr. Barry lowered his holiday sales growth estimates for stores open at least a year to 2.4% from 2.8% for the group of leading retailers he covers, which includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kmart Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. If he's right, it will be the slowest holiday sales growth since the recession in 1990, when shoppers spent just 2.6% more than the year before.  That's not preventing retailers from holding out hope, though. Wal-Mart has been quick to note this calendar year's similarities to 1995. In fact, the Bentonville, Ark., discounter even made a point of reminding analysts that it missed its sales forecasts the first three weeks in December 1995. But during the week that included Christmas, Wal-Mart's sales jumped 32%, a boost that helped the retailer catch up with its sales forecasts for the season. "The procrastination factor seems to get pushed back more each year," says Wal-Mart spokesman Tom Williams.  Certainly, some shoppers got a later start than usual this year and plan to finish up last-minute -- something retailers are counting on. Indeed, with two extra days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, plenty of shoppers felt like they had more time to put things off. Andrea Draths, for example, is usually done with her shopping by Thanksgiving, but on Monday, the 44-year-old administrative clerk still had several gifts to buy. "The weather was so warm for so long, I didn't think about it until it was a month away," explains Mrs. Draths, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn.
