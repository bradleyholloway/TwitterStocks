 Nasdaq Composite Index Decreases But Some Stock Groups Buck the Trend   By By Priscilla Ann Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1988  The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.48 to 343.71, a decline of more than 1%. Technology stocks were the big losers, with practically all the big computer, biotechnology and electronics issues tumbling in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which also skidded.  But certain large and small OTC stock groups continued strong, marking a return to a pattern prevailing in the big Nasdaq market four months ago. The gainers included oil-drilling stocks and trucking issues, along with banks, thrifts and electric and other utilities.  Before last October's crash, prices of stocks in OTC industry groups and mini-groups tended to move up or down together. Since then, analysts noticed that tendency gave way to OTC issues moving individually, as a result of earnings or other news, or simply because their prices were particularly depressed in the crash.
