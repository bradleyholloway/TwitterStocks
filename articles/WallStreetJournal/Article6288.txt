 Career Journal: Finance Chiefs Have More to Do And Are a Lot Harder to Recruit   By Maher, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2004  "As a CFO, you were always responsible for the integrity of the numbers, but Sarbanes-Oxley certainly raised the stakes," says Bob Dellinger, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Sprint Corp. "The price of mistakes and errors is certainly greater than it's ever been."  "Instead of being just a scorekeeper, to some respects you have to be a little more of an oracle of information," says Keith Hall, senior vice president and chief financial officer of LendingTree Inc., an online lending and realty-services company. "You're pointing out the ups and downs of the business to some people who may be a little more numerically challenged."  More companies are also eliminating the chief operating officer position after promoting a chief operating officer to CEO, a study by Crist Associates found last year. As a result, more pressure falls on the chief financial officer's shoulders. "What you get is this real strong partnering between a CEO and CFO," Mr. [Peter Crist] says. "Any good CFO today is much more intimately involved with the running of the business than ever before."
