 Cable & Wireless Pays a High Price For Japan Foothold   By By Peter Landers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1999  Cable & Wireless yesterday won a victory in an unusual bidding war over International Digital Communications Inc. when several major shareholders agreed to sell the British company their stake in IDC. After Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. dropped out of the bidding on Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp. and Itochu Corp. agreed to sell their shares to Cable & Wireless, ending a battle that had dragged on for several months.  NTT probably concluded it wasn't worth paying any more after Cable & Wireless's offer on June 1, which valued IDC at 69 billion yen ($579.9 million), analysts said. The British company already owns 17.7% of IDC and said it would pay 110,577 yen per share for the remaining 82.3%. Toyota and trading company Itochu, each of which owns 17.7% of IDC, said they will sell to Cable & Wireless. That gives the company a majority stake, and other shareholders have said they will follow Toyota's lead.
