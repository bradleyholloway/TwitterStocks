 U.S. Study Says Higher Calcium Intake Could Lower Chances of Hip Fractures   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1988  The report concludes the risk of broken hips in both men and women "might be reduced by even a moderate increase" in current U.S. recommended daily allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium for adults. The recommendation seems sure to revive a simmering medical debate over whether gulping extra calcium helps people ward off osteoporosis, a bone disease that is a leading cause of hip fractures in the elderly.  "Those are very exciting findings," said Dr. B. Lawrence Riggs, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The work by University of California-San Diego researchers "is going to be a very important study." Dr. Riggs advocates raising the recommended allowance to 1,000 milligrams a day -- the equivalent of three daily servings of dairy products, the main dietary source of calcium. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences currently is reviewing the calcium recommended allowance, he added.
