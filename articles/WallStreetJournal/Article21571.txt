 U.S. Car Makers Charge Japanese With Dumping --- Big 3 Say Wholesale Prices For Minivans Are Lower In U.S. Than in Japan   By By Paul Ingrassia and Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1991  After months of saber-rattling on the trade issue, the Big Three auto makers formally charged Japanese car companies -- mainly Toyota Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Co. -- with dumping minivans in the U.S.  The complaint, filed with both the U.S. Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission, says the wholesale price of the Japanese minivans -- the price charged to dealers -- is lower in the U.S. than in Japan. "Minivan dumping by Japanese producers is causing injury to the U.S. industry, consumers and workers," the Big Three said in a statement issued by their trade group, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.  But the Big Three are using a different pricing measure in their dumping petition. They charge that, for the Previa, Toyota is charging its U.S. dealers a wholesale price of between 5.4% and 30.5% less than it charges its dealers in Japan, depending on the version of the vehicle sold. These amounts are known as the "dumping margin." For Mazda's MPV minivan, the dumping margin allegedly ranges between 14.8% and 27%.
