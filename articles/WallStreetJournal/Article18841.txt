 UAW focuses on Ford talks for contract   By Suris, Oscar; Christian, Nichole M, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1996  The UAW has quietly chosen Ford Motor Co as the auto maker at which to focus its energies in negotiating a new national labor contract. In a departure from tradition, the UAW did not formally designate Ford its "target" company for a strike if a new contract is not reached before the current one expires on Sep 14, 1996, but insiders say Ford has emerged as the "lead company." Among the major contract issues is outsourcing of parts to nonunion suppliers.
