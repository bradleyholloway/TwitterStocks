 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Running Over a Railroad   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1986  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear an appeal by eight railroads of a particularly grievous application of the Railway Labor Act, a labor law that is unique in granting unions the right of secondary boycott. However the court decides, Congress should abolish both the boycott right and its own powers to inflict labor settlements on railroads.  This new test of the RLA results from a strike last March by a 65-member local of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees against the Maine Central Railroad. Invoking its secondary-boycott rights, the brotherhood also picketed Conrail and threatened to extend picketing nationwide. After two, 60-day cooling-off periods, Congress prescribed a settlement. The president signed the bill last week but at the same time demanded that Congress remove the right of secondary boycott.
