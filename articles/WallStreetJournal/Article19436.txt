 Fed Officials Express Willingness To Continue 0.25-Point Rate Cuts   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  That is the sense that comes from conversations with several top Fed policy makers attending the annual economic conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City here. The conference itself -- entitled Economic Policy for the Information Economy -- steered clear of any discussion of short-term Fed policy. But in comments during breaks, over meals and on walks through Grand Teton National Park, Fed officials expressed great uncertainty over the course of the economy and a willingness to keep prodding it until recovery is clearly under way.  Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed and host of the conference, cast a dissenting vote at the May policy meeting to protest the central bank's half-point rate cut. But in an interview at the conference, even Mr. Hoenig seemed to have no objection to the more cautious, quarter-point-at-a-time, approach that the Fed now seems to have adopted. He said such modest rate cuts may be justified both because of current uncertainty about the economy and because of the lack of any signs of accelerating inflation.
