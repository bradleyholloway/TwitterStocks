 Ford and GM Offer Fresh Incentives   By By Sholnn Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  In a sales program targeted to dealers, Ford is offering payments of $500 to $1,500 to meet certain sales objectives on the Ford F-150 pickup and the Ford Explorer, two of the nation's most popular vehicles. Dealers could pocket Ford's incentives. But they tend to use the money to lure consumers, often with deals that lower monthly payments.  Detroit's Big Three are sitting on big inventories of unsold cars and trucks. Ford had 94 days' supply of unsold pickups, minivans and SUVs at the end of April, and 70 days' supply of unsold cars. GM had 85 days' supply of unsold trucks and 79 days' worth of cars in stock. DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group had leaner inventories of 79 days' supply of trucks and 48 days of cars. Traditionally, the Big Three have aimed for 60 to 65 days' supply of stock at dealerships. But Japanese producers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have managed to gain market share despite inventories well below that level.
