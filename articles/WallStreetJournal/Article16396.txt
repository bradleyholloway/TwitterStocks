 A Global Journal Report: Citizens Financial to Buy Charter One   By Anita Raghavan in London, Dennis K. Berman in New York and Joseph Hallinan in Chicago, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2004  The deal will meld Citizens Financial, a Providence, R.I., bank that long has had a footprint in the New England and mid-Atlantic region, with Charter One, the nation's 33rd-largest bank that has operations concentrated along the Rust Belt. The merger will make Citizens one of the 10 largest U.S. commercial-bank holding companies, adding domestic heft to RBS, which is Europe's second largest bank by market capitalization behind HSBC Holdings PLC.  The move is the latest step by Royal Bank of Scotland to expand its reach in the U.S. financial-services market. Royal Bank has been buying assets in the U.S. through its Citizens Financial unit for nearly 15 years, making more than 23 acquisitions since 1990. The largest until now were the retail-banking assets of Mellon Financial Corp. which it purchased for $2.1 billion in 2001. More recently, the bank acquired Commonwealth Bancorp for $450 million and Roxborough Manayunk Bank for $136 million.  The Charter One deal also points to Royal Bank of Scotland's ambitions. The acquisition is five times bigger than any other deal the bank has ever done in the U.S. The deal also will bring the share of Royal Bank's profits that are generated in the U.S. to 25%.
