 Few Early Claims Made for 9/11 Victims; Change in Fund's Damages Rules Sought   By By Milo Geyelin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2002  Aviation lawyers say limits that Mr. [Kenneth R. Feinberg] has set on damages for claims such as pain and suffering fall far short of court awards in disaster cases. (All death victims would get $250,000, plus an additional $50,000 for a spouse and each dependent, under the rules.) Mr. Feinberg's upper limit of $2 million to $3 million to compensate victims for lost wages doesn't adequately reflect the high number of victims with seven-figure annual incomes, said Jim Kreindler, a New York aviation lawyer who is planning to meet with Mr. Feinberg this afternoon.  Families of lower-income victims also could see their awards eaten up by a provision requiring that death, pension and life-insurance benefits be deducted from any payout by the fund. Mr. Feinberg acknowledged that some families could receive nothing but said his office intends to provide a minimum of $250,000 in such cases. Mr. Kreindler said his firm is reluctant to sue but is weighing suing the fund on grounds that some people wouldn't be fairly compensated, as Congress intended, and that the liability limits Congress passed are unconstitutional.
