 EU Debate Goes To Last Moment On Turkey's Bid; Ministers Desire an End To Demands by Austria, Seen as Tied to Its Politics   By Champion, Marc, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2005  "Either it will show political maturity and become a global power, or it will end up a Christian club," Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said of the EU yesterday, in remarks reported by the Associated Press. Turkey's foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, said in a local newspaper interview that if the EU didn't "keep its word" on membership talks, partnership would be impossible.  The EU has been split on whether to admit Turkey, a mainly Muslim country that straddles East and West and has a largely poor, fast- growing population of almost 70 million. Admitting Turkey is unpopular with many of the bloc's 25 member nations, but most national leaders believe that to refuse Turkey even the chance to join would be a major strategic blunder, bolstering the argument of Islamists who say Islam and Christianity are in conflict.  "We're concerned about a so-called clash of civilizations," British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told British Broadcasting Corp. television yesterday. Britain currently holds the EU's rotating presidency and is pushing hard for the start of talks with Turkey. "We need to see Turkey in the European Union and not pushed the other way," Mr. Straw said.
