 There Was Much More To This Baseball Season Than McGwire and Sosa   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1998  Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs staged a duel for the Major League single-season home-run record that riveted the nation's attention like nothing before. Mr. McGwire's 70 home runs fractured the old mark of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961, and beat Mr. Sosa by four. Also, the Seattle Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. had 56 home runs and the San Diego Padres' Greg Vaughn had 50; in the preceding 56 years, the 50 mark had been matched or exceeded only 15 times.  The New York Yankees won 114 games to top by three the former American League record for victories in a season, although the old mark, held by the 1954 Cleveland Indians, was set over a 154-game campaign, not the current 162 games, and carried a higher winning percentage (asterisk, please). The Atlanta Braves won their divisional title for the seventh time in this decade, and for the fourth time in a row. The Chicago Cubs made the National League playoffs as a wildcard, something that by itself would have made the season remarkable.  Most Remarkable Inning -- The Chicago White Sox scored four runs without a hit in the 10th inning of a May 28 game against the Tigers in Detroit. Robin Ventura and Wil Cordero walked, and were sacrificed to second and third base by Magglio Ordonez. Greg Norton walked, loading the bases. Chad Kreuter walked, scoring Chris Snopek, who had run for Mr. Ventura. Ray Durham walked, scoring Mr. Cordero. Mr. Norton scored on a wild pitch, Mr. Kreuter going to third. Mike Caruso hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Mr. Kreuter. The runs made the difference in an 11-7 Sox win.
