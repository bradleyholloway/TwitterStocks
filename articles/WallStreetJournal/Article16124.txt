 Wall Street Firms Are Among New Year's First In Issuing Investment-Grade Corporate Debt   By By Richard A. Bravo and Tyler Lifton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2002  The securities were priced to yield 1.48 percentage points over Treasurys, less than the initial guidance of about 1.5 percentage points over Treasurys, but about in line with comparable issues in the market. Investors said that meant only a slight yield gain over comparable issues.  Lehman Brothers later sold a $1 billion, 10-year issue. The offering was priced to yield 6.696%, or 1.58 percentage points over Treasurys, and rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A by S&P, one notch lower than Goldman Sachs' rating. Lehman's underwriting unit led that deal.  The Federal Home Loan Bank System sold $3 billion through ABN Amro and Credit Suisse First Boston. The 4.125% notes due in 2005 yielded 4.218%, or 1.05 percentage points more than the two-year Treasury.Also, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development sold $3 billion via Goldman Sachs, Salomon Smith Barney and UBS Warburg. Its 4% notes due in 2005 yielded 0.93 percentage points over the two-year Treasury.
