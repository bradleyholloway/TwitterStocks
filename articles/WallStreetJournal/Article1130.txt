 On a Far Frontier   By Kaylan, Melik, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2007  There's good reason to be watchful. Other smaller states aside, Burma sits strategically between China and U.S.-ally India; both countries vie for influence and access, through the ruling military junta, to Burma's raw materials and energy supplies, while human- rights groups go hoarse itemizing the regime's atrocities against its own citizens.  With $5 billion to date in trade agreements -- and untold billions in loans and military aid to Burma -- the Chinese are way ahead of India in the influence race. They are building deepwater ports for their own naval use on Burma's western coast atop the Bay of Bengal, and gas pipelines through the interior directly to China. The former threatens India strategically, while the latter finally liberates China from shipping all its fuel supply past the strategic threat of Taiwan and the U.S. navy.  Meanwhile, Burma itself exports narcotics and methamphetamine in vast amounts, sends officers for military training to Moscow and Beijing, and last year announced an interest in North Korean nukes. The recent U.S.-sponsored United Nations resolution calling for democratic change in Burma was vetoed by Russia and China. Seeing this, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) declared its support for the Rangoon regime against internal "insurgents," and the state newspaper has carried reports of "U.S.-backed" terrorist bombs on its soil.
