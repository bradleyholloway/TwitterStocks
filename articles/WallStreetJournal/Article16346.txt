 The Secret of Putin's Success; Most Russians Prefer Tough Tactics to Post-Soviet Chaos, Crime   By White, Gregory L, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2003  Mr. [Vladimir Putin] says he knows the limits. When asked during a meeting with high-school students earlier this year what he would most like to do but can't, Mr. Putin answered, "The president can't break the Constitution. Sometimes I really want to."  When bomb blasts destroyed two apartment buildings in Moscow in September 1999, killing 223, Mr. Putin's tough response helped reassure the public. The brutal invasion of Chechnya that followed -- Mr. Putin blamed the Chechens for the bombings, although the link hasn't been proved in court -- earned condemnation in the West but was broadly supported by Russians, who felt so vulnerable after the Moscow bombings that many spent nights guarding entranceways and watching for suspicious activity around basements.  "The events in Russia in the early 1990s were a full-scale social and economic revolution," says Yegor Gaidar, Mr. [Boris Yeltsin]'s first prime minister and the architect of Russia's market reforms. "That's always a difficult period and sooner or later it is replaced by a period of post-revolutionary stabilization. . . . Putin came in on this wave."
