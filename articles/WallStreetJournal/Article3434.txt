 FDA Weighs Larger Ban on Blood Donors To Include All Who Spent Time in Europe   By By Jill Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2001  America's Blood Centers, a network of community blood centers that says it also holds about half the nation's blood supply, said it will support any FDA decision, though it is concerned about the impact a wider ban would have on supply. America's Blood Centers estimates that it would lose about 10% of its supply under a Europe-wide FDA ban. Both the Red Cross and America's Blood Centers said they are already planning to intensify donor recruitment in expectation of a wider FDA ban being approved.  A wider FDA ban, added to the American Red Cross's decision earlier this year to impose a similar Europe-wide donor ban to begin in September, could significantly affect the U.S. blood supply, blood-center officials say. It could also affect U.S. supplies of products made from blood, such as agents that help blood to clot and wounds to heal, an industry spokesman said. FDA advisers next month will also ponder how the agency might police the manufacture in Europe of blood products bound for the U.S. under a wider donor ban.
