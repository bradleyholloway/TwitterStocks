 Politics & Economics: European Judge's Legacy: Reining in the Regulators; Vesterdorf Retirement Means Business Loses An Ally on EU Court   By Jacoby, Mary, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  The often business-friendly court precedents Judge Vesterdorf helped set will outlast his departure. But business will lose an outspoken and influential critic of Europe's sometimes heavy regulatory hand. "It was quite clear from the very beginning that the commission had to shape up and do a better job," Judge [Vesterdorf] said in an interview ahead of his retirement on Sept. 17, referring to the EU's Brussels- based executive arm.  Judge Vesterdorf also has taken strong action against judges perceived to be antibusiness. In 2005 he removed the French judge overseeing Microsoft's appeal, Hubert Legal, after he derided the court's clerks as "ayatollahs of free enterprise" in a French legal journal. Judge Vesterdorf took personal control of the Microsoft case. He declined to comment on the episode.  Microsoft is the most complex and hard-fought case involving monopoly power to ever come before the EU judges. A 2004 ruling by the bloc's regulators found the U.S. software company illegally uses its near-monopoly in computer operating systems to stymie competitors. The commission is threatening more penalties in a dispute over the level of royalties Microsoft wants to charge competitors to license programming information designed to make the rivals' products work well with Microsoft's Windows.
