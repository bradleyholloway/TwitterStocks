 Korea's Roh Sees Booming Economy, Links to East Bloc ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1988  SEOUL, South Korea -- President Roh Tae Woo's first major policy speech since he took office revealed a buoyant optimism about South Korea's economy and a desire to intensify its dialogue with the once-reviled communist world.  In an address to the opposition-dominated National Assembly, Mr. Roh also promised to take the lead in the drive toward democratization, in pursuing a fairer distribution of the national wealth and in efforts to reunite with North Korea.  There was undisguised disappointment that Mr. Roh's government released only 52 political prisoners Monday, Korea's Foundation Day. The four major parties had called for the release of many more of the 500 South Koreans acknowledged by the Supreme Court to be in jail for politically related offenses.
