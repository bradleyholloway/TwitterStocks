 Labor independence   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1996  An editorial notes that on Jul 10, 1996, members of the US Senate will be counted on a fundamental issue of individual freedom: the right to work without paying union dues or fees as a condition of employment. The editorial says it is not likely that the effort to remove sections of the 60-year-old National Labor Relations Act that authorize forced-dues contracts will pass.
