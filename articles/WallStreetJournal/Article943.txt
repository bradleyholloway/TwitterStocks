 Inman Plans to Show Defense Industry Anything It Can Do, He Can Do Better   By By Marj Charlier, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1987  Adm. Bobby Inman, who announced last week his Westmark Systems Co. signed a definitive agreement to buy defense contractor Tracor Inc. for $694.4 million, is putting his money where his mouth is.  A critic of the defense industry and the government's defense procurement system, Mr. Inman is chairman of Westmark, which was formed at the end of last year to acquire defense contractors. Closely held Westmark, based in Austin, Texas, is funded by Mason Best Co., a Dallas merchant banker; a number of private investors, and some corporations.  In buying Tracor, Mr. Inman also found a company whose management agrees that defense contracting can be done better by private companies that escape the pressure of the stock market to produce short-term earnings. "Now this company shouldn't be bothered by the pressures of quarterly increases in earnings," said Tracor Chairman Frank McBee, who will remain chairman and chief executive officer of Tracor.
