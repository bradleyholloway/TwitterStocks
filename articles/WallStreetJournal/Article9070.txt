 Arrests Are Ordered For Russian Tycoons   By By Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  The charges against billionaire Boris Berezovsky and Alexander Smolensky, founder of the country's largest private retail bank, come as the Kremlin has stepped up a campaign to force the country's general prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, out of office. They represent the first attempt to purge a once-powerful group of business barons, the socalled oligarchs, who bankrolled President Boris Yeltsin's 1996 re-election campaign.  Mr. Berezovsky is suspected of stashing the hard currency earnings of Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, in a Swiss company, investigators told the Interfax news agency. A former first deputy general director of Aeroflot, Nikolai Glushkov, is wanted on the same charges. Mr. Smolensky has been charged with bank fraud.  Neither man is likely to be taken into custody soon. Mr. Berezovsky is in France; investigators believe that Mr. Smolensky is in Austria. A spokesman for Mr. Smolensky in Moscow said he had no information of an impending arrest. Russian investigators said Interpol, the international association of police forces, may help in the search for Mr. Smolensky, according to Interfax.
