 Wal-Mart, Abercrombie Decline Amid Disappointing Retail Sales   By By Shaheen Pasha, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 114.57, or 1.31%, to 8623.28; the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 19.60, or 1.37%, to 1410.75; and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index shed 11.02, or 1.2%, to 906.55.  The bears were out in full force. Salomon Smith Barney strategist Steven Wieting said he now expects earnings of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to rise only 7% next year, down from his prior 7.7% estimate.  S&P stood as a lone voice in the crowd, advising clients to raise their equity holdings to 65% from 60% by cutting their cash allocation to 20% from 25%. S&P said the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index stand to gain 8% more by the middle of next year and 15% by its end as the economy and profits improve.
