 House Bill to Aid Presidio's Revamping Is Reined in by Ways and Means Panel   By By John Connor, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1994  Legislation to create a novel entity to help revamp the Presidio military base in San Francisco was significantly reined in by the House Ways and Means Committee.  Some Ways and Means members said the latter vote effectively guts the Presidio initiative by quashing the backdoor financing method that had been central to the plan drafted by another House panel. But Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), a supporter of the initiative, said it's too early to reach that conclusion.  Under a bill approved recently by the House Natural Resources Committee, the Presidio Trust would be a special nonprofit public-benefit corporation established within the Interior Department to perform a myriad of tasks, chiefly financial in nature, as the Presidio converts from an Army base to an urban national park.
