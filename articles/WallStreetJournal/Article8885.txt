 Pay-Phone Operators Ring In Deregulated Era Today --- With Local-Call Tariffs Unfettered, Service Providers May See Windfalls   By By Barbara Martinez, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1997  For the first time nationwide, payphone providers will be able to charge whatever they want for a local call. And the pay-phone industry shortly will find out how much they will be paid for use of their phones even when consumers use 800 numbers or dial-around services.  Across the country, most pay phones charge 25 cents for a local call and have done so for more than a decade. But the Federal Communications Commission last year decided to "deregulate and detariff" pay-phone service nationally beginning today. States that have experimented with such deregulation have seen pay-phone rates jump to about 35 cents.  If most pay-phone operators -- made up mostly of regional Bell companies, a handful of publicly traded companies and thousands of small, closely held providers -- increase local rates to 35 cents from their average 25 cents, that translates into a 40% revenue boost.
