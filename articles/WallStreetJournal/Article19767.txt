 Bids & Offers   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2004  By 2000, after the Robert Miller Group played at several large jazz festivals and several of his classic-jazz releases sold well, "I got it all out of my system," he says. "It's like a left-brain, right- brain thing. Now I'm back to the rational side." Now 52, Mr. [Robert M. Miller] recently formed Miller Mathis & Co. to advise companies and institutional investors on restructurings.  So which business is straighter? "The music business is filled with liars, cheats, and thieves," he says. "And then there are the bad people."  DLJ's former co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions, 66-year- old Joel J. Cohen and 53-year-old Herald L. "Hal" Ritch, are leading the effort, along with a minority backer. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Ritch have already assembled a team of about 30 people, 25 of whom worked at the old DLJ and have recently put in time at the likes of Merrill Lynch & Co., Bear Stearns Cos., and UBS AG.
