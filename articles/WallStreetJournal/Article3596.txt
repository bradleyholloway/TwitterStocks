 View / Travel: Arte Hispanico   By By Hollis Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  For more than seven decades, the society has purchased historic and contemporary Spanish-colonial artworks and sponsored markets and competitions among living artists, fostering what has grown into a vibrant commercial market for traditional Spanish-colonial arts. Some 300 artists in New Mexico alone continue to make art like their ancestors did, and the price of a fine carved-and-painted wooden saint made by a leading contemporary artist can reach five figures. Many of the artists participate in the Art Society's annual Spanish Market, which drew about 70,000 colonial-art aficionados to Santa Fe's plaza earlier this summer.  While the Spanish-colonial period stretches from 1492 to the independence of its various territories, its artistic influence lives on around the world. Though Spanish-colonial artworks are in the collections of many major museums, the Santa Fe museum is uniquely focused on illustrating the cultural connections among people of Spanish descent, showing, for example, how Baroque influences in style and artistic method traveled first from Spain to Mexico and then to New Mexico, as evidenced by florid garments depicted on a 19th-century carving of a saint.
