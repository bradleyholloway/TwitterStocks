 Treasurys Give Up Early Gains to End Lower As Investors Wait to See Action on Interest Rates   By By Sonoko Setaishi and John Dooley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2000  The upward move in 10-year and 30year Treasurys "is not telling us very much about the economy [or] very much about the Fed," said Charles Van Vleet, who helps to manage close to $12 billion in global fixed income at Credit Suisse Asset Management and Warburg Pincus in New York. "It is telling us more about the buyback . . . and the supply-demand conditions of Treasurys."  Traders noted that yield spreads -- the margin between yields of corporate and Treasury issues -- had widened for some 30-year corporate bonds. Ford's outstanding issue was quoted early yesterday at a bid level of 1.96 percentage points above Treasurys, although that narrowed later to 1.89 percentage points above Treasury yields.  A $350 million 10-year class priced to yield 1.55 percentage points more than Treasurys, and a $350 million 30-year class priced to yield 1.75 percentage points more than Treasurys.
