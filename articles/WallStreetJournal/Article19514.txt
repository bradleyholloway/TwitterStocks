 Homestore.com Posts $1.11 Billion Net Loss For Fourth Quarter   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2002  Homestore's former chairman and chief executive, Stuart Wolff, resigned in January after the disclosure that advertising revenue for the period was overstated, and that it may have overstated ad revenue in 2000 as well. Restatements for 2000 were posted March 12. As with the accounting errors for 2000, most of the overstatement in 2001 came from barter deals in which Homestore swapped advertising space on its site in exchange for ads on another site.
