 Getting Going: Brokers and Indexing: A Love Story   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2005  Damning statistics like this have been kicking around for years. By the 1960s, we had the computer power, market data and analytical tools needed to study investors' performance -- and the results weren't pretty. It became abundantly clear that even professional stock pickers weren't beating the market.  More and more brokers and financial planners are eschewing commissions and instead charging fees, typically around 1% of a client's portfolio each year. That has freed up these advisers to sell pretty much any product, including no-load, low-cost index mutual funds. Before, they never would have recommended these funds, because they wouldn't have earned a commission. Meanwhile, even the commission-charging crowd is getting in on the act. Thanks to the introduction of ETFs, which trade just like any other stock, both full-service and discount brokers have an incentive to push the notion of indexing. Now, they can sell an ETF and get the same commission they get on any other stock.  Finally, there is the perennial problem of overconfidence. Even market junkies now readily admit that most folks don't beat the market. But they aren't ready to give up the game themselves. Bolstered by an unflinching belief in their own abilities, they are confident they can succeed where so many others have failed. But what about all the skeptics around them, snickering loudly? The market junkies are far too engrossed in the movie to notice.
