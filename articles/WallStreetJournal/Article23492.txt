 SmartMoney: Get Handle on School Debt   By Grant, Kelli B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  Thanks to higher interest rates, paying off that money has gotten a bit harder. The variable rates on some federally backed Stafford loans are currently 6.54% during the in-school and grace periods, and 7.14% during the loan's repayment period. And when they're reset July 1, rates will rise to 6.62% and 7.22%, respectively. It's a far cry from the variable interest rates on the Stafford loan in recent years, which dipped to a historic low of 2.77% in 2004.  Someone carrying $20,000 in Stafford loans -- $15,000 consolidated at 6.625% and one $5,000, 6.8% loan -- would pay a total of $7,458 over the life of the 10-year loans. That's $100 less than the total interest you'd pay by consolidating all the loans under a 10-year repayment schedule. Combining the fixed-rate and already-consolidated loans pushes the total rate to 6.67% -- increasing the interest paid on three-quarters of the loan balance.  -- Keep private loans separate. Federal Consolidation Loans, by definition, can include only federal student loans. So steer clear of lenders offering to consolidate both federal and private ones, says Brad Baldridge, a financial planner in Hales Corners, Wis. These hybrid loans won't be as low, and often don't carry repayment discounts.
