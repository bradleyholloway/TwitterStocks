 Architects' Index Forecasts Construction Spending   By Frangos, Alex, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  The AIA compared the historical survey results with the Commerce Department's numbers for the value of new construction put in place, the industry standard for construction spending. The AIA's discovery, published in October's journal of the National Association for Business Economics, found that changes in revenue at architecture firms showed up six to nine months later in actual construction.  "The relationship is intuitive once you think about it," says Kermit Baker, the AIA's chief economist. He says developers come to architects months in advance of calling in the bulldozers and cranes.  "It makes perfect sense," he says. "As architects get busy . . . there's going to be a corresponding tick up in demand for certain electronic products that go inside those four walls."
