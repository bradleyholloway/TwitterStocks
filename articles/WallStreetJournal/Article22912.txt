 Nike to Turn to the Supreme Court   By By Maureen Tkacik, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 2002  The Nike announcement came a day after the company said it was ending its contract with PT Doson factory in Indonesia, effectively laying off about 7,000 workers in the largest retreat Nike has made from the country. Both developments were watched closely by antisweatshop activists, who charge that Nike is pulling out of Indonesia in response to increased unionization in the nation.  Nike's decision is a blow for PT Doson, which makes only Nike shoes. The Nike spokesman said the U.S. company plans to offer those workers medical care, small loans, and continuing education in the event that the company cannot find a new contract to replace Nike's.  Jim Keady, a New Jersey-based antisweatshop activist who just returned from six weeks in Jakarta, said he suspected Nike was leaving Doson because of the strength of its unions. But while labor standards in Indonesia are what originally drew his criticism -- and, for that matter, Mr. [Marc Kasky]'s -- Mr. Keady said his worst fear is that Nike will pull out of the country altogether.
