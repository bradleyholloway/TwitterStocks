 Business and Finance [5]  The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1986  GENERAL MOTORS CUT car production further in an attempt to trim inventories without big sales incentives. The latest reductions indicate GM is serious about keeping output in line with sales. Though the U.S. auto industry posted higher sales for November, GM's sales declined.  New-home sales tumbled 9.6% in October to the second-lowest level this year. Many analysts expect the pace to hold steady or improve slightly through the middle of next year. Average home prices slipped 0.7% during the month, to $111,600.  Diamond Shamrock is expected to resist a $2 billion takeover proposal by T. Boone Pickens Jr. and his Mesa Limited Partnership. The oil and gas company likely will seek a friendly suitor or announce a big stock buyback, analysts said.
