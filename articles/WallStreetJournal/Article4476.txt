 Chiat/Day Weighs Buying Mojo MDA For $77 Million   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1989  Ad agency Chiat/Day Inc., long regarded as a creative "boutique" with offices only in North America, said it is in discussions to buy Australia's biggest agency, Mojo MDA Group Ltd., for $77 million.  Chiat/Day's purchase would immediately increase its billings, which it says are currently $700 million, to about $1 billion, and would place it among the country's 20 largest ad agencies. It also would give Chiat/Day the international reach it has been seeking, including offices in Australia, Hong Kong and London as well as seven affiliate offices in the Asia-Pacific area. In 1987, Chiat/Day, based in Venice, Calif., had billings of about $350 million and was the nation's 25th largest agency, according to Advertising Age.
