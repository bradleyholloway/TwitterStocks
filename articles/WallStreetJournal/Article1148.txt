 SK Seeks Split of Firm to Aid Transparency   By Ramstad, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2007  SK's decision fits with a broader trend in South Korea toward shedding insular practices that have made it easy for companies to cover up mistakes and mismanagement. Just last month, the country's financial regulators said large Korean companies would have to adopt international accounting standards by 2011.  Mr. [Chey Tae Won] has since hired more outside directors at SK and its affiliates, including those that aren't publicly traded, and has launched a public-relations campaign to tout SK's improvements. By unwinding its cross-holdings and shifting to a holding-company structure, SK could boost its market value as investors get a clearer picture of SK's assets and operations .  SK has considered switching to a holding-company structure for years, but a law approved by Korea's National Assembly last week would allow SK to retain a hand in SK Telecom without having to lift its stake in the unit to a previously required 30%.
