 Prosecutor Rejects Claims by Students Involving Denny's   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1997  SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A prosecutor rejected the claims of a group of Asian-American students who say they were denied seats at a Denny's restaurant, thrown out when they complained and then beaten in the parking lot as security guards watched.  Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said an investigation by his office found no evidence that the April 11 incident involved racial discrimination by Denny's employees or the security guards.  Instead, Mr. Fitzpatrick called the students' claims "orchestrated," and said they lied about what happened that night. Regardless, it is the second time in three years the restaurant has attracted national attention for allegations of racial discrimination.
