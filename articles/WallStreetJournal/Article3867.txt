 Field of Dreams? D.C. Politicians Mull Expos Deal   By Fatsis, Stefan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2004  By comparison, the proposed Washington stadium would be around 90% publicly funded. One point that's especially grating to local opponents: no upfront contribution from the team's owners is required. "The fact that MLB negotiated a deal that didn't have that appears to be a concession to them when it should be part of the process," says Ed Lazere, director the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, who has led groups opposing the deal.  The Expos saga has been a drag on baseball during an upswing. Industry executives say MLB's 30 teams posted collective operating profits of around $50 million last season. But the Expos have lost an estimated $70 million since MLB's other club owners bought the team in 2002 as part of an ownership swap involving three franchises.  Baseball rated high marks for negotiating with seven municipalities over two years to find the best deal. "Historically, the leagues and owners have been viewed as the bad guys who come in to hold up a community," says John A. Moag Jr., chief executive of Moag & Co., a sports-franchise consultant in Baltimore. In this case, baseball "played it totally straight. It said, 'This is what we're looking for. Who wants to do business with us?' "
