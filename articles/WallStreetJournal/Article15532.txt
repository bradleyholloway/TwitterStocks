 Tokyo OTC Market Rallies on Fee War --- Tiny Brokerage Firm Tweaks Big Boys by Slashing Charges   By By Robert Steiner, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1997  While the Tokyo Stock Exchange roils with worries about the effects of future financial deregulation, an obscure broker is giving Japan a taste of the real thing: He is unilaterally cutting his trading commissions and sparking a minirevolution in Japan's over-the-counter stock market.  The OTC market has boomed since late last week, when Michio Matsui, president of the tiny Matsui Securities Co., said he would slash his commissions by 50%. The Nikkei OTC index has jumped 6.5% to 1280.34 since Jan. 29, far outpacing the Nikkei 225, which has slipped 21 points to its close yesterday of 18314.33. Trading volumes at the OTC market have doubled in that time.  This rebellion in the OTC market steals a big jump on the go-slow plans of officialdom. Japan's Finance Ministry doesn't plan to begin deregulating commissions at Japan's major stock exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange, until sometime in the next few years. And regulators are still studying ways to ease into the change without unleashing a bloodbath like the one that hit brokers in Britain during London's Big Bang in 1986.
