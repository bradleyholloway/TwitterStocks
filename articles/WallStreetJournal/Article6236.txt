 Mutual Funds Under Fire: SEC Warns of Uncoordinated Inquiries; Donaldson Says States, In Seeking Political Gain, May Hinder Federal Case   By Burns, Judith, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2003  Speaking specifically on the mutual-fund abuses alleged by Mr. [Eliot Spitzer], Mr. [William Donaldson] said the problems appear to involve trading by hedge funds, which typically aren't registered with the SEC and don't undergo routine inspections. The SEC does oversee mutual funds, but Mr. Donaldson said the abuses alleged by Mr. Spitzer would be difficult to detect absent a tip-off.  Mr. Spitzer's announcement has prompted the SEC to conduct its own investigation. Mr. Donaldson said SEC examiners are now trying to determine whether the problems cited by Mr. Spitzer -- involving market-timing trades and late trading in mutual funds -- are isolated or widespread. If abuses are common, Mr. Donaldson promised the SEC will crack down quickly.
