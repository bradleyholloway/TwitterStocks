 Specialists and Shaky Financial Markets   By By Junius W. Peake, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1989  The "seismic" activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth. When things are quiet (low volatility), the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately. However, when powerful forces start shaking the market's structure, the more "earthquake-resistant" it is, the better its chance for survival.  That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity. And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks. In today's markets, specialists (on the New York Stock Exchange) and "upstairs" market makers (in the over-the-counter market) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process. When they halt trading, all market liquidity is gone. And when any component of the market -- cash, futures or options -- loses liquidity, the price discovery system (the way prices are determined) becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time.  Last Friday the 13th (as well as two years ago this week) the markets became unlinked. When that happened, "seismic" tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility. Lack of important, needed information can cause fear. Fear is the father of panic. Panic frequently results in irrational behavior. And in financial markets, irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe.
