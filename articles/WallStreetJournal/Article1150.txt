 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2007  The surge in leveraged buyouts has spawned a cottage industry aimed at figuring out which company might be the next big takeout candidate. Wall Street has been screening for low debt levels, hefty cash flows and the like to come up with lists of would-be LBO candidates. One reason shares of companies with smaller market capitalizations have done so well in recent years is that they're considered the most likely targets. Many LBO screens cut off companies whose market value is thought to be too high to make them buyout fodder.  "If you look at the shares of companies that screen as LBO candidates, they've outperformed massively," says Sanford C. Bernstein chief investment officer Vadim Zlotnikov. "The pursuit of LBO candidates has become ubiquitous. Every analyst, every strategist, if they don't have a list they certainly have an opinion."
