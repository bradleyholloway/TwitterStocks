 MarketWatch: What Happened to Retirement Bashes   By Gerencher, Kristen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2006  "That sense of still being a part of things, that continued linkage, was more common for women," he says.

"As the nature of the psychological contract between organizations and employees has changed . . . you really don't have an easy time figuring out what does it mean to do a retirement party," says Rocki- Lee DeWitt, dean of the University of Vermont School of Business in Burlington. "Do you do a retirement party for people who take early- retirement buyouts? Usually it's not a celebratory context because the performance of the firm is challenged. It's almost like a slap in the face for people who weren't eligible for early retirement to recognize the people getting to leave the place before it tanks."
