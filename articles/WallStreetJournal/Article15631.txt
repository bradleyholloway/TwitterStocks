 Chrysler Names Stallkamp to No. 2 Post --- Choice of an Heir Apparent To Eaton Is New Break With Chaotic Iacocca Era   By By Nichole M. Christian, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1997  AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp.'s board named 51-year-old Thomas T. Stallkamp as president, essentially anointing him heir apparent to Robert J. Eaton, the No. 3 auto maker's chairman and chief executive officer.  Chrysler laid the groundwork for yesterday's move last year, when then-President Robert A. Lutz, at the time nearing age 65, surrendered that title to Mr. Eaton and became vice chairman. The flamboyant Mr. Lutz, also a blunt-spoken executive who owns and flies military jet fighters, remains vice chairman, though Chrysler said yesterday that its other vice chairman, Thomas G. Denomme, 58, will retire on Dec. 31.  The selection of Mr. Stallkamp as Chrysler's No. 2 executive comes years before succession is likely to be an issue for the company, because Mr. Eaton is just 57 and hasn't signaled any plans for an early retirement. But clarifying the succession picture so early further underscores Chrysler's break with its chaotic past; five years ago, the board had to push Mr. Eaton's predecessor, Lee A. Iacocca, into retirement after recruiting Mr. Eaton from General Motors Corp.
