 Stock Prices Decline as Sharp Rise In Short-Term Rates Spurs Selling   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1987  A sharp rise in short-term interest rates added more gloom to an already nervous stock market, knocking share prices down in active trading yesterday.  Interest rates rose amid concern that the Federal Reserve Board was tightening monetary policy to combat fears of runaway inflation as the economy picks up strength. Thirty-year Treasury bond yields hit their highest levels since Dec. 5, 1985.  General Electric reported higher third-quarter earnings Wednesday and Ford Motor raised its quarterly dividend and announced a stock split yesterday, yet both stocks moved down with the rest of the market. Some traders were disturbed by investors' negative reaction to such news and they're worried that higher interest rates are beginning to take a toll on this stock market.
