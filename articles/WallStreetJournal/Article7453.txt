 Senate Remains Deadlocked On Debt Ceiling --- Republican Majority Fails In Bid to Curb Debate On Crucial Amendment   By By David Rogers and David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1985  The Senate remained deadlocked on the debt-ceiling bill as Republicans failed in an effort to limit debate on an administration-backed amendment to set statutory limits on federal deficits, aiming for a balanced budget by 1991.  Yesterday's session, the first Sunday meeting of the Senate in three years, had an unusually high attendance as 95 senators voted on the two roll calls. The five absentees, four Democrats and Republican John East of North Carolina, wouldn't have altered the outcome of the cloture vote because those opposing the motion already represented more than one-third of the full chamber.  Following the record deficits of recent years, the pending bill would raise the national debt ceiling to more than $2 trillion, and this landmark has provoked concern in both chambers. The Democratic-controlled House may act on a 15-day debt bill to buy time today, but there is a bipartisan consensus that the deficit issue must be faced before the $2 trillion barrier is breached.
