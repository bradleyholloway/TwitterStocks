 Personal Health (A Special Report): Health Cost; Serious Illness, Serious Bills: Seven questions to ask when deciding whether to buy special insurance for major health problems   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  Cancer policies do have one possible advantage: Someone with a prolonged illness due to cancer might get a bigger payout with a cancer policy than they would with a critical-illness policy of the same price, says Thom D'Epagnier, a vice president in Allstate's workplace division, which sells both cancer and critical-illness policies. A policy covering a cancer patient who is hospitalized for several months could pay out $50,000 or even $100,000. "The more severe a diagnosis, the more categories [of payments] that come into play," Mr. D'Epagnier says.  MetLife's critical-illness policies cover cancer. But a consumer who buys a critical-illness policy from Aflac Inc. may be surprised to learn that cancer is not covered. In addition, Aflac's critical- illness policies work more like traditional cancer policies -- they pay a small lump-sum benefit but mostly pay out based on the kinds of treatment received. To get cancer coverage through Aflac, you must buy a separate cancer policy, says Lance Osborne, vice president of field force development for the Columbus, Ga., insurer. "We believe that that policy should stand alone," Mr. Osborne says.  While most policies can be held until death, some policies phase out full benefits after a certain age. For instance, UnumProvident's critical-illness policy pays out 50% of its face value if the policyholder gets ill after age 70. Colonial Life's critical-illness policy cuts the benefit in half after age 75. Some critical-illness policies will pay the policyholder's beneficiaries the full benefit amount if the policyholder dies from one of the covered illnesses; others will not.
