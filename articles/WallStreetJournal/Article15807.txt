 Indonesian Vote Is Prelude to Politicking --- Future of President Habibie Will Hinge on Months Of Backroom Jockeying   By By Raphael Pura, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1999  On Monday, Indonesian voters will elect a new Parliament as Indonesia tries to move toward democracy after decades of authoritarian rule. They will choose among 48 parties, many of which aim to unseat controversial President B.J. Habibie, who inherited his job after popular unrest drove former President Suharto from office in May 1998.  Most independent polls pick opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle, or PDI-P, to win a plurality in the 500-seat legislature. The PDI-P's main rival is the Golongan Karya, or Golkar, Mr. Suharto's former political vehicle and now Mr. Habibie's main backer. The unofficial election result should be known a day or two after Monday's vote.  The tussle is expected to pit Ms. Megawati and her allies against Golkar and several religious-oriented Islamic parties that support the 62-year-old Mr. Habibie. Personalities and patronage are likely to outweigh ideology and issues. Ms. Megawati, 52, enjoys broad popularity, but Golkar has money and a network of cadres.
