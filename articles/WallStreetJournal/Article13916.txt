(It will be released this fall in a limited-edition set of vinyl records by SFS Media for $749, aimed at the audiophile market.) If in other repertoire the genial conductor does not always convey a discernible interpretation, his performances nonetheless possess the spontaneity and vitality of chamber-music making.
