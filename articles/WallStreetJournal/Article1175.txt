 A Russian 'Ring' Highlights Wagner's Timelessness...   By Scherer, Barrymore Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2007  Speaking with me by telephone from his Maryinsky office, he acknowledges that this is Russia's first complete Ring cycle -- certainly its first sung in German -- in almost a century, that is to say since before the Russian Revolution. "St. Petersburg was very clearly one of the most important Wagnerian cities at the end of 19th century and beginning of 20th century," he says. "Then, of course, there were two world wars, and both times Russia and Germany were on the different sides of the game." Neither the world wars nor the Cold War helped the Wagnerian cause in the Soviet Union. "Basically in the 1960s and '70s the only two [Wieland Wagner] operas you could hear at the Maryinsky -- and in all Russia -- were 'Lohengrin' and occasionally 'Fliegende Hollander,'" he says. "There were some other Wagner performances, but they were very, very rare."  Until the last 10 years, when Mr. [Valery Gergiev]'s Maryinsky productions of "Lohengrin," "Tristan," "Parsifal," "Hollander" and the "Ring" reawakened what Mr. Gergiev calls "interest and respect for Wagner operas in Russia," and made new Wagner productions "a regular factor of our life now," Russia's leading music conservatories were not even teaching voice students the distinctive Germanic style of singing Wagner," he observes. "And whatever was taught was taught in Russian." Today, especially after several critics at previous European tours of the Maryinsky "Ring" criticized the often unidiomatic singing of the Russian casts, Mr. Gergiev brought in what he calls "really prominent German coaches to ensure that subsequent performances would be solidly grounded in authentic Wagnerian style." Primary among these experts has been the veteran Bayreuth Festival coach Richard Trimborn.
