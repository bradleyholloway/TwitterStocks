 Merck Selects Outsider to Be Chairman, Chief --- Becton's Gilmartin to Start Thursday in Fast Move; Vagelos to Retire in Fall   By By Elyse Tanouye, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1994  Mr. Gilmartin, 53 years old, is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Becton Dickinson in Franklin Lakes, N.J., a maker of medical supplies and devices that is much smaller than Merck and has a far lower profile. In a startlingly rapid changeover, he will move to Merck Thursday as chief executive and president and will assume the chairmanship in November, when P. Roy Vagelos, retires. Mr. Gilmartin will succeed Dr. Vagelos in all three positions.  In selecting Mr. Gilmartin as the first outsider to lead the company, the Merck board passed over several senior Merck executives who were considered contenders for the top job. Although the company didn't identify internal candidates, securities analysts and others viewed Edward M. Scolnick, Merck's research chief, and Jerry T. Jackson, executive vice president, as the top contenders for the chairmanship.  Speculation that Merck would pick an outsider as its next head has swirled around the world's biggest drug maker ever since April, when Martin J. Wygod withdrew from consideration for the chief executive's spot. Mr. Wygod, who had been chairman of Medco Containment Services Inc. before it was acquired last year by Merck, was considered the leading candidate to succeed Dr. Vagelos. Mr. Wygod resigned from Merck last month. At that time, Dr. Vagelos said the board was considering a short list of outsiders as well as Merck executives.
