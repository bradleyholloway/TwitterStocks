 Gold's Rampage Eases Off   By Sykora, Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2007  "When the elephants move, they trample everything," said George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.  "It looks as if the dollar stabilization or slight comeback has given a reason for the market to take profits," said HSBC analyst Jim Steel, describing gold as "frothy the past couple of days."  NATURAL GAS: Futures rose more than 5% on concern that a storm near Florida's southern tip would disrupt U.S. energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. Meteorologists predicted the storm, 90 miles west of Key West, Fla., would strengthen into a subtropical depression or storm by today and make landfall in Texas late Friday or early Saturday. Front-month November natural gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up 38 cents, or 5.3%, to $7.427 per million British thermal unit.
