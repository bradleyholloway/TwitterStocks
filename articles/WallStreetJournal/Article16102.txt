 Link Between Baxter Device, Deaths Is Found   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2001  U.S. federal investigators are probing the deaths of 51 dialysis patients who used Baxter filters to see if they are linked to six models recalled world-wide last month, officials said.  Lisa Scheff, spokeswoman for Baxter, Deerfield, Ill., said the company expects the reported number of deaths to increase after health-care professionals hear about the recall. "We're going to investigate anything that could be possibly related," Ms. Scheff said. Baxter repeatedly has said it has found nothing to indicate the filters are at fault and that its recall was precautionary.  The Baxter recall applies to its Series A and Series AF dialyzers, which were made in Sweden by Althin Medical AB, a company Baxter acquired last year.
