 Societe General Plans War Chest For Acquisitions   By By Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1999  PARIS -- Societe Generale SA is setting aside 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) for acquisitions over the next two years as the French bank seeks to go it alone in the wake of its failed bid for Paribas SA.  Such a strategy, Mr. (Daniel) Bouton added, was adapted to a situation in which there are few merger opportunities in France and cross-border deals in banking are still difficult to carry off. "I don't exclude a cross-border merger, but it's rather complicated," Mr. Bouton said at a press conference. "Alliances or partnerships can create value for several years with a much lower execution risk than a merger."
