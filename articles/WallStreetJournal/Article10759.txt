 Mobil Is Said To Name Chief For Ward Unit --- Brennan Tapped for Post; Move Is Seen as First Step In Shedding Retail Firm   By By Frank E. James and Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1985  Mobil Corp. is said to be planning to shed its Montgomery Ward & Co. unit, and as the first step the company is bringing back a former Ward executive as president and chief executive officer of the ailing retail subsidiary.  Bernard F. Brennan, 46 years old, is currently president and chief executive of Household Merchandising Inc., a post he will hold until June 3, and a director of the company's parent, Household International Inc., Prospect Heights, Ill. Widely known as a turnaround specialist, Mr. Brennan was Ward executive vice president for merchandising until 1983 when he joined Household.  A decision to shed Ward has been expected since Mobil hired Goldman, Sachs & Co. in February to help it evaluate its businesses to determine areas in which the company isn't competitive. Ward has been the most obvious Mobil asset ripe for restructuring. Mobil paid $1.7 billion for the retailer in 1976 and, as of January, had funneled more than $609 million into the unit.
