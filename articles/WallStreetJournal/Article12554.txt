 Buying Your Next PC? Get the Most Memory, Not the Fastest Chip   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  By "mainstream user," I mean somebody doing the most common computing tasks -- word processing and other office-type applications, Web surfing, e-mail, calendar and address book, personal finance, simple home photo and video editing, rudimentary desktop publishing, digital music and basic games. This buyer's guide doesn't apply to hard-core gamers, or folks doing heavy-duty multimedia production work. They need the biggest, fastest PCs. You don't.  As usual, I'm focusing here on Windows desktop PCs. The Macintosh doesn't require a buyer's guide. There's only one Mac desktop aimed at consumers: the colorful iMac. It comes in only three versions, ranging from $999 to $1,499. The top model, the iMac DV Special Edition, is the best Macintosh I've ever used, period, and one of the best PCs ever.  -- Memory: This is the most important factor in computer performance. Get at least 128 megabytes, even if that means you have to add extra memory at the time of purchase. In the past, I've placed the minimum at 64 MB, and that will still get you by. But, especially given the popularity of digital music and photo and video editing, 128 MB is a much better target. Also, if you're considering a low-priced model, ask whether the video system shares the main memory instead of only using its own, dedicated memory. If the memory is shared, that means you'll have less main memory for general use, so you may want to add more.
