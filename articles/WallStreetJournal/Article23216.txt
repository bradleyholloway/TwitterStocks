 In Nod to Europe, Bush May Offer Incentives to Iran   By Carla Anne Robbins and Christopher Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2005  U.S. officials said Mr. [Bush] is expected to make the decision as soon as today, despite a new private warning from the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad that Iran is using money and political pressure to exert influence over Iraq's transitional government.  The U.S. also is expected to agree to allow the Europeans to sell Iran aircraft spare parts with U.S. components, according to U.S. and European officials.  Despite the expected White House concessions, the U.S. made no effort to tone down its public criticisms of Tehran's activities yesterday. At the Vienna board meeting of the IAEA, U.S. representative Jackie Sanders called the IAEA's report on Iran, a "startling list of Iranian attempts to hide and mislead and delay the work" of agency experts.
