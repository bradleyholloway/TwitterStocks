 It's Hip to Flip Houses in a Market This Hot --- Builders, Neighbors Fume As Investors Buy Homes, Then Wait and Sell High   By By Nancy D. Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2000  Michael Farrar, a Continental salesman, nabbed one of the first and best properties at Prairie Ridge at the Broadlands, agreeing to pay $225,200 for a ranch-style house on a plot backing the golf course. Warren Williams, a real-estate broker, signed a contract for a $215,415 home on another prime spot along the fairway. But Messrs. Farrar and Williams -- and about half the people who signed contracts that day in August 1998 -- had more in common than house-hunting success. None of them ever moved into the houses they bought.  But Continental's Prairie Ridge at the Broadlands is an example of real-estate speculation run amok. In the end, investors purchased about 40% of the homes in the subdivision, according to on-site salespeople, and the homebuilder found itself competing with investors for sales in later phases.  A growing number of home builders are instituting policies designed to curb flipping -- or at least make it harder for investors to delay closings or walk away if the market sours. Continental, for example, has changed its rules to require investors to make nonrefundable, earnest-money deposits of 10% of the purchase price instead of paying a flat $2,000 or $3,000 depending on the model.
