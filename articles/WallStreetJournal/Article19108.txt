 Misdirected E-Mail Offers a Glimpse Into Office Politics --- Lehman Analyst Sends File To Colleague, But Clients Get the Message Too   By By Ralph T. King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1998  Mr. Butler, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc., sent a message about a colleague last May to a Lehman investment banker. Their colleague, biotechnology analyst Matthew Murray, was being wooed by rival Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., Mr. (Anthony) Butler wrote, noting that Lehman didn't plan to counter the offer, that he would gladly assume Mr. Murray's duties, and that Mr. Murray "is making a mistake" and "forgot how much we at Lehman created and allowed him to accomplish."  But moments after the message went out, Mr. Butler discovered that instead of sending the sensitive memo upstairs to the investment banker, he had zapped it to 75 money-manager clients at mutual funds, insurance companies and banks across the country. Unable to retrieve it, a panicked Mr. Butler says he fired off a second message, telling recipients the first message was an error and to disregard it.
