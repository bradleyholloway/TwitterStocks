 Templeton, Harvard End Legal Dispute Over Two Funds   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  The quarrel heated up last year when Harvard Management, which runs the university's $18 billion endowment, called for the termination of [Templeton] as the investment adviser of the Templeton Dragon Fund and requested the merger of that fund with the Templeton China World Fund.  The dispute escalated when Templeton filed suit against Harvard in January, claiming it repeatedly violated a number of securities laws and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Harvard then countersued Templeton for breach of fiduciary duty.
