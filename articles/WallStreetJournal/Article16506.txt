 Intelligence Fable   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2005  The Robb-Silberman panel does the enormous service of exposing all of this as both false regarding Iraq, and dangerous if it colors the future. The problem in Iraq wasn't some rogue Pentagon intelligence operation that ran roughshod over the CIA and DIA. Far from it, the problem was a "climate of conformity" across the entire intelligence community that firmly believed that [Saddam Hussein] still had WMD. Instead of disagreement, there was almost no internal intelligence debate at all. Everybody believed Saddam had WMD.  Moreover, says the unanimous bipartisan report, "on the eve of war, the Intelligence Community failed to convey important information to policymakers." Remember the story that former Secretary of State Colin Powell has often told of preparing for his February 2003 U.N. speech by demanding that the CIA scrub its data so he could be absolutely credible? Well, says the report, "serious doubts" about one Iraq source (the infamous "Curveball") became known months earlier "within the Intelligence Community." But "these doubts never found their way to Secretary Powell, who was at that time attempting to strip questionable information from his speech."  This and other errors "stem from poor tradecraft and poor management" within the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community, the report adds. But "the Commission found no evidence of political pressure" to alter intelligence findings. "Analysts universally asserted that in no instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter their analytical judgments," the panelists unanimously say.
