 Politics & Economics: World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2006  "I'm without words to describe it," a Yukos spokeswoman said. Mr. [Vasily Aleksanian] was named executive vice president on March 31. Yukos, once Russia's biggest oil producer, has been crippled by billions of dollars in back-tax bills and has been put under external supervision before bankruptcy hearings June 27.  A consortium of Western banks sought to have Yukos declared bankrupt after it defaulted on nearly half of a $1 billion syndicated loan arranged three years ago by Societe Generale SA with Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC PLC. The bankruptcy hearings are likely to be the closing chapters on Yukos, which was built up by billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky to become Russia's leading oil company before his arrest and conviction and the company's dismantlement and nationalization.
