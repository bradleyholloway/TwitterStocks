 Currency Trading -- Forex View: Focus Is on a War, Decisions on Rates   By By Agnes T. Crane, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2003  During the recent Group of Seven meeting in Paris, Mr. [Wim Duisenberg] said the ECB "will not hesitate to act" if its outlook for inflation changes. He hinted it had changed since the euro zone is unlikely to reach its growth potential this year. Two weeks before, the official said any rate cut now would "drown in the sea of uncertainties." The last time Mr. Duisenberg sent this type of signal, the ECB slashed rates by half a percentage point.  Debate still remains, however, on the timing of ECB action, with some believing the central bank will wait to cut rates until April, when many expect greater certainty on the Iraq question. "Most people believe they are going to cut rates; it's just a matter of timing," said Greg Anderson, currency strategist at ABN Amro.  Another factor promising to confound the Ministry of Finance's efforts to keep the yen soft is the approach of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. ABN Amro's Mr. Anderson estimates that the dollar could bounce between 115 yen and 120 yen as the impact of yen repatriation offsets efforts to keep the currency weak. Japanese companies tend to convert revenues, profits and sometimes even other assets denominated in foreign currencies into yen to bolster their books before the fiscal year ends.
