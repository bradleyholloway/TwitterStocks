 Politics & Economics: Crisis Likely Weakens Israeli, Palestinian Leaders; More Infighting Could Lead To Political Power Vacuum That Favors Hard-Liners   By Leggett, Karby, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2006  "Israel now has a provisional government," said Akiva Eldar, a leading Israeli columnist, referring to a growing split in the ruling coalition government. Meanwhile, after Israel's arrest of dozens of Palestinian government ministers and lawmakers from the ruling Hamas organization, "the Palestinians have a crippled government that has become mostly symbolic," said Mahdi Abdel Hadi, a prominent Palestinian academic.  Underlining that, Mr. [Ehud Olmert] Monday ratcheted up his rhetoric, saying Israel wouldn't negotiate with Palestinian militants holding the soldier despite public opinion polls that suggest a majority of Israelis favored such a move. In Gaza, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ismail Haniya reiterated his government's position that negotiations and a prisoner exchange were the only way forward. Meantime, the Israel army continued preparations for a potentially wide-ranging operation inside Gaza's dense neighborhoods. Palestinian militants also dug in, preparing roadside bombs and issuing a call to arms among the population. Both sides say any confrontation will likely lead to many casualties.  For now, neither government is facing the risk of near-term elections. The fate of the Hamas government rests largely with President Mahmoud Abbas, who technically has the power to dissolve the current Palestinian government and call new elections. Mr. Abbas, who leads the former ruling party Fatah, has given no indication that he plans to do that. In Israel, Mr. Olmert's government can be brought down only by a no-confidence vote in Parliament, and analysts say the likelihood of that is now slim. Indeed, on both sides, the hostage crisis has also prompted calls for national unity, giving Mr. Olmert and Mr. Haniya short-term boosts.
