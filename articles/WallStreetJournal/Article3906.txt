 The Economy; CAPITAL: Workers' Wages Trail Growth in Economy   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2005  To those who argue that wages aren't rising because "today's businessmen are greedy . . . or Wal-Mart is cunning," Bradford DeLong, an economist -- and prolific blogger -- at the University of California at Berkeley replies that's nonsense. Something else is going on. "The link between wages and productivity depends on the fact that businessmen are greedy and cunning," he says. "You don't raise wages out of altruism; instead you expand your work force out of greed, and the expanding work force pushes wages up."  NOT EVERYONE'S WAGES are sinking. Demand for workers with the most skills and education remains strong, and their wages are climbing because they are still in short supply. Demand also appears strong for low-paid workers -- those who bathe the sick or wait on tables and whose jobs can't go offshore or be automated -- but there are so many willing low-skill workers that their wages don't rise. Globalization and technology, meanwhile, seem to be eroding demand and wages for many workers in the middle. But despite the headlines, that has been happening for some time, even during the glorious 1990s, so it is hard to believe that explains the whole recent mystery of wages.
