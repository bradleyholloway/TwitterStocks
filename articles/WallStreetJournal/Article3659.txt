 Futures & Options: Flower Power   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  RAILROAD TYCOON Henry Huntington began developing the Botanical Gardens in San Marino a century ago. Now, it spans nearly 150 acres, encompassing theme areas such as rose, desert, subtropical, Australian, Japanese and Zen gardens. The California Bonsai Society is holding its 46th-annual show this weekend, with more than 100 bonsai on hand. They range from miniature maples and elms to flowering plants such as bougainvillea. Open from noon to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday to Friday and from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekends. Admission is $10 for adults, $8.50 for seniors, $7 for students 12 to 18 and $4 for youths five to 11.  DURING THIS CELEBRATION of orchids, the New York Botanical Garden's Everett Children's Adventure Garden has an exhibition on vanilla. (Vanilla comes from the seed pod of the orchid plant Vanilla planifolia.) Visitors will learn how and where the vanilla orchid grows, see live vanilla orchids, taste vanilla-flavored products and experiment with vanilla beans. Open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. April through October and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. November through March. A ticket to all areas is $10 for adults, $7.50 for students and seniors and $4 for children two to 12.  THIS ANNUAL SHOW brims with tulips, hydrangeas, narcissus and azaleas. The conservatory is a legacy of Pittsburgh's steel age. It was founded by industrialist/philanthropist Henry Phipps, a friend and partner of the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. Its domes are silver and glass, like temples to nature. Open Tuesday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors and $4 for students.
