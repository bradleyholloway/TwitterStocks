 CSFB Receives Fine From NASD   By DeVine, Nora, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  NASD also fined CSFB $20,000 for "backing away," in connection with its alleged failure to execute 30 sell orders at a price at least as favorable as CSFB published quotation on the stock, as market makers are required to do under NASD and federal securities laws. NASD noted there were orders that day to buy more shares of MP3.com than CSFB had to sell. NASD said CSFB neither admitted nor denied NASD's findings. CSFB representatives weren't available to comment.
