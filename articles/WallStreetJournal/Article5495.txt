 Focus: Japan --- A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Steve Glain, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1997  Budget planners intend to keep a lid on defense spending, and that could mean fewer sales opportunities for U.S. defense contractors. The defense agency has been ordered by the government to keep expenditures flat at just under five trillion yen (about $45 billion) for the next three years. As a result, it is postponing the purchase of four aerial refueling tankers. And that is bad news for Boeing Co., which makes the airframes for the tankers.  Still, Japan's recent announcement that it would consider developing a system of ground-to-air missiles may hearten companies like Raytheon, maker of the Patriot missile. But U.S. arms brokers in Asia, say Tokyo, along with several other governments in the region, are looking at Israel's Arrow system and other Patriot rivals as possible alternatives.  IBM Japan Ltd., hoping that a planned recycling program will help beef up the market for used personal computers, begins recycling efforts before they are required. Japanese consumers can redeem used International Business Machines Corp. computers at select electronics stores for a store-credit based on the PC's current value. IBM will then upgrade the processors and hard disks, and ship the computers back to stores for potential resale at 100,000 yen (about $890) or more.
