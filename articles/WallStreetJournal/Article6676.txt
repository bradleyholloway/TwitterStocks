 Britain After Blair   The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  Never before had Labour won three straight general elections, yet many on the British left have never been comfortable with Mr. [Tony Blair]'s realignment of their party. For some, his moves toward the center were a betrayal of principles. His opponents in the party and British media have tried to reassure themselves by attributing recent election defeats to the unpopular Iraq war. That might soothe their consciences. But last week's poor showing in local contests -- four years after the Iraq invasion and with a Labour succession in sight -- could be read more as an indictment of the party's future prospects than of its past.  Yes, there have been press leaks. The Independent reported Tuesday that Mr. [Gordon Brown] plans to distinguish himself from Mr. Blair by "engaging" with Iran. But isn't that what Britain, as part of the so- far impotent EU-3, has been trying for some time? Consider how little we know about Mr. Brown's noneconomic policies compared to those of Nicolas Sarkozy, who had to argue his ideas before an engaged public to win the French presidency.  London will also remain Washington's most trusted interlocutor with the Old World. For all the anti-Americanism in the British press, Britain is still spiritually closer to the U.S. than Angela Merkel's Germany or Mr. Sarkozy's France. The popular branding in Britain of Mr. Blair as President Bush's "poodle" willfully misrepresents the bipartisan esteem for the special relationship in Washington.
