 Alcoa Cuts Prices 5% on Some Lines As Demand Lags   By By Mark Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1986  Aluminum Co. of America, reversing a two-month-old price increase, said it pared the list prices for common alloy sheet products 5%.  Other producers of aluminum sheet aren't scurrying to match Alcoa's price cut. Alcan Rolled Products Co., a Cleveland-based unit of Alcan Aluminium Corp., Montreal, said it is studying Alcoa's move. And Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, Va., the No. 2 aluminum producer, hasn't taken any action.  An Alcoa spokesman said the reductions, effective last Thursday, were made "to maintain market position and keep our distributors competitive." Alcoa, the No. 1 aluminum producer, sells common alloy sheet mainly to distributors. A typical grade of common alloy sheet will be priced at $1 a pound, down from $1.05 a pound.
