 Ricin Scare Disrupts Senate, Recalls Anthrax Case   By Gary Fields and Robert Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  The ricin "hasn't been associated with a particular envelope," Mr. [Bill Frist] said. He said the stack of letters had just been opened, and that investigators weren't sure at what point the powder was released. Tests on the room's air filters all came back negative, he said.  Ricin is easy to make, conceal and deploy, but difficult to turn into a weapon, experts said. Derived from castor beans, ricin can be used as an aerosol, injected or disseminated in food or water. The CDC considers it a Category B biochemical weapon, causing moderate rates of illness and lower mortality than Category A agents such as anthrax, botulism and smallpox. Because ricin isn't a biological agent, it wouldn't be killed by radiation, which now is supposed to be routine at postal facilities.  Dr. [Julie Gerberding] said that the purity and potency of the ricin found in Sen. Frist's office had yet to be determined, and that the medical community has "essentially no human experience with inhalation of ricin. We may not have a full picture of how this will evolve." That was a possible nod to criticism of the CDC during the anthrax attacks of 2001, when scientists failed to realize anthrax powder could escape from sealed envelopes until after postal workers began falling ill.
