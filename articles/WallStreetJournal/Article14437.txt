 Television Viewing Fell 1% Last Season, Nielson Reports --- Drop, First in Two Decades, Was Steepest in Evening; VCRs, New Meters Cited   By By Dennis Kneale, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1988  New figures from A.C. Nielsen & Co. show the average household watched television almost a half-hour less each week during the 1986-87 season, down from an average 50 hours and 16 minutes a week in the year-earlier period. The decline, about 1% overall to 49 hours and 48 minutes a week, was steepest in the all-important period of prime time or evening programming, when weekly viewing dropped almost 10% by one measure.  Television executives say they aren't alarmed. They blame a higher number of videocassette recorders in use, which often aren't counted; a natural peak in how long viewers can spend watching television; and the new "peoplemeter" ratings system that may lower the ratings for a program.
