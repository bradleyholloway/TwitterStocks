 Bristol-Myers Nears Resolution Of SEC's Probe Into Accounting   By Martinez, Barbara, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  Last Friday, the company announced the settlement of a major shareholder lawsuit for $300 million over the accounting issues. It was an unusual settlement in that the lawsuit had been dismissed with prejudice in April. The plaintiffs, led by institutional investors such as the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, won class-action status on behalf of any investor who bought Bristol-Myers stock from Oct. 19, 1999, to March 10, 2003. The plaintiffs alleged that investors were damaged by the "artificial inflation" of the company's stock price because of the revenue overstatements. The suit also accused the company of making false and misleading statements about prospects for the approval of cancer drug Erbitux.
