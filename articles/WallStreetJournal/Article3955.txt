 Making Sense of 'Dollar Stores'; Declining Sales and Competition From Big Retailers Lead Some To Think Growth Has Hit a Peak   By Hudson, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2005  Investors have mostly voted with their feet so far. Share prices of Fred's Inc. have swooned to $12.04 at yesterday's close on the Nasdaq Stock Market from around $30 in early 2004. The stock of 99 Cents Only Stores sunk to $10.11 a share on the New York Stock Exchange from the high $20s in the same span. Dollar Tree Stores Inc. closed at $22.97 yesterday on Nasdaq, down from the low $30s. Family Dollar Stores Inc. closed yesterday on the Big Board at $20.49 a share, down from the high $30s. Even the industry's largest and strongest company, Dollar General Corp., has seen its stock price, which closed yesterday at $18.77, mostly flat since early 2004.  The news isn't getting any better. Some dollar-store operators revised their earnings-per-share forecasts late last month for their current fiscal year. Dollar Tree, of Chesapeake, Va., lowered its forecast to $1.57 to $1.66 from $1.77 to $1.87. Fred's, of Memphis, Tenn., which offers pharmaceuticals as well as discount goods, lowered its forecast to 74 to 79 cents from 84 to 89 cents due to high gasoline prices and cuts in its home state's Medicaid program.  The industry's slowdown will force Dollar Tree's peers to follow its lead in the next two or three years, analysts say. "It doesn't make much sense for these companies to be growing as aggressively given the environment overall," said SunTrust's Mr. [Patrick McKeever]. He rates Fred's a "buy" because he thinks selling pharmaceuticals puts it in a better position than other dollar stores. He sees the share price of Fred's hitting $19 within the next year. Mr. McKeever is "neutral" on most of the other major players. He doesn't own the stocks, though his company has provided financial services to various dollar-store chains, including Fred's.
