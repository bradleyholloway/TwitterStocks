 Review / A Surfer's Guide to TV: The Old Ball and Chain   By By Barbara D. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2000  Over the past half-century, Julius Erving and dozens of other basketball stars known to millions have played on the courts of Harlem's Holcombe Rucker Memorial Park. But it is local streetball legends like Pee Wee Kirkland who are the soul of this documentary, narrated by Andre Braugher. The film, directed and produced by Kern and Kip Konwiser, who wrote it with Harold Sylvester, includes highlights from last summer's Entertainers Basketball Classic. It follows the fortunes of the defending champions, a team sponsored by Sean "Puffy" Combs's Bad Boy Records that the fans love to hate.  Recycling "Pinocchio" -- this time as a live-action musical told from Geppetto's perspective -- might sound like a blockheaded idea. But this "Wonderful World of Disney" presentation springs to life thanks to new words and music from Stephen Schwartz ("Godspell," "Pippin," "Pochahontas," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame") and an engaging cast to sing them. (Only "I Have No Strings" is borrowed from the classic 1940 cartoon.) As Geppetto, the toymaker who carved Pinocchio, Drew Carey makes up in down-to-earth charm what he lacks in high notes. A giddy Julia Louis-Dreyfus, as the Blue Fairy, sounds like she's failed some elocution lessons with the Queen of England, while Seth Adkins, as Pinocchio, is only slightly more wooden than the role requires. But it is Brent Spiner, as the puppetmaster Stromboli, and Rene Auberjonois, as Professor Buonragazzo, who steal the show both as singers and comic actors.
