 The Better Nightcap, Alas, Is Warm Milk Not a Hot Toddy   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1998  AFTER A HARD day of work, many people regularly treat themselves to a nightcap as a way to relax and get some sleep. Alcohol is the most common, self-prescribed sleep aid, says J. Christian Gillin, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Diego.  But it's a self-defeating strategy for the sleep-deprived. While a drink speeds the onset of sleep, its sedative effect evaporates in three to four hours, leaving you wakeful or tossing fitfully the rest of the night.  RESEARCH SHOWS that alcohol not only shortens the hours spent sleeping, it also disrupts patterns of sleep. Normally, the night is spent moving in cycles between deep or "slow-wave sleep," and active or rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when dreams occur. But with alcohol use, these cycles become altered.
