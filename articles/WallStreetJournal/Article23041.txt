 Family Finance: Public Schools Pile on Fees; Cash-Strapped Districts Charge Students To Play Sports, Join the Band; $60 for Drama Club   By Chaker, Anne Marie, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2003  Other districts are contemplating a similar approach. Michigan's East Lansing Public School District, which will begin charging a one- time participation fee of $100 for sports and performing arts, has received anonymous pledges of more than $25,000 from parents, to assist students who can't afford the fees. For families who come forward and say they can't afford the charges, "we don't go through a rigorous query," says Thomas Giblin, the superintendent. "If they say, 'We can't afford it,' we'll take care of it."  "The last thing we want is to have kids not participating," says William Korach, superintendent of the Lake Oswego School District. "This is really pushing the edges and we're not sure we've got it right." Depending on a family's financial need, he says, the district may waive fees or allow students to work them off in some way.
