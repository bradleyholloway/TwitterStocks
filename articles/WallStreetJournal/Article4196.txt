 Dollar Is Mixed As Selling Stalls Its Recent Gains   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1986  Analysts who use historical trading patterns to forecast exchange-rate movements asserted that the dollar will rise further in its current upturn. But eventually, analysts said, the dollar is expected to resume its long-term slump because of overall economic weakness in the U.S.  "Technically, the dollar shows some support. But the fundamentals are against the dollar," said Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago.  In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was off slightly from Monday's levels against the important West German and Japanese currencies. The U.S. currency eased to 2.0663 West German marks from 2.0745, and to 155.61 Japanese yen from 155.96. But it rose to 6.7530 French francs from 6.7300. And the British pound slipped to $1.4770 from $1.4832.
