 How `Green' Is Your Household? --- New Earth-Friendly Homes Are Right Next Door; Straw Bales and Used Tires   By By Nancy D. Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  May 22, 1998  John and Betsy Hall McKinney spared little expense on their 4,400-square-foot custom home in Telluride, Colo., completed in December. But it wasn't just the sauna and hot tub that pushed costs up to nearly $200 a square foot. Rather, it was environmental extras: solar systems for electricity and hot water; natural building materials such as straw-bale insulation, adobe floors and wool carpets. The house even has composting toilets that turn waste into fertilizer via a basement tank filled with wood chips and worms.  Dennis Weaver, the actor best known as TV's "McCloud," calls home a 10,000-square-foot "Earthship" in Ridgeway, Colo. The $1 million adobe structure, built into a hillside using 3,000 tires and 300,000 tin cans, relies on mountain breezes for cooling and sunlight for heat and electricity. Nonetheless, Mr. Weaver says he is plenty cozy in the Southwestern-style home, which features such niceties as a waterfall cascading in the entryway and a silk-oak tree growing in the great room, without the aid of a planter. Earthships, a trademark of Solar Survival Architecture in Taos, N.M., have been around for 25 years, but are constantly evolving, says firm owner Michael Reynolds. Once affordable only to the superrich, prices have dropped to about $80 a square foot, and Mr. Reynolds is working to make it available to the masses. The design also passes building codes in most municipalities, he says.
