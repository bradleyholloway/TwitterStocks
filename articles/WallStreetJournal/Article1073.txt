 Dollar Rises as Strong U.S. Data Spur Fresh View of Fed's Policy   By Azam, Ahmed, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  Late Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.2726 from $1.2792 late Thursday. The dollar was at 116.29 yen from 115.29 yen, while the euro was at 148.03 yen from 147.52 yen. The dollar was at 1.2425 Swiss francs from 1.2344 francs, while sterling was fetching $1.8907 from $1.8938.  Mr. [Michael Woolfolk] said this made any expectations that the Fed could be gearing up to start cutting interest rates by next year "premature," and said the "risk of further rate hikes later this year" will rest squarely on coming data.
