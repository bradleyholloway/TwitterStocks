 Why So Few Fans Are Asking for Pencils At Today's Ballparks --- Keeping Score Is a Dying Art In the Era of JumboTron; `The Captain of Your Aisle'   By By Jonathan Eig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  At one time, parents would teach scorekeeping so their children wouldn't get bored. But baseball today is designed for fans with short attention spans and big wallets. Many new ballparks have Ferris wheels, swimming pools, shopping malls, batting cages, playgrounds and restaurants, not to mention screaming JumboTron scoreboards the size of Rhode Island. Not only do the big scoreboards entertain fans with dance contests, trivia questions and cartoons, but they also offer up-to-date information on the game, making manual scorekeeping redundant for most fans. When a Ferris wheel at Detroit's Comerica Park malfunctioned last month, trapping 50 fans for more than two hours, the scorekeeping set gloated.  When the centerfielder catches a ball for an out, the scorer marks an 8. If he drops the ball, the scorer marks the error with E8. A typical double play is marked 6-4-3. K is for a strikeout when the batter swings, but it's a backwards K when he strikes out looking. A walk is BB, for base on balls. A single might look like this: --. A double like this: =. If a batter knocks a double to right field and drives in three runs, it might be marked this way: =/R3.  Lanny Frattare, a broadcaster with the Pirates, had his brother, an architect, help him design a special scorecard to accommodate his punctilious system, which includes two colors of ink and a pattern of nearly indecipherable dots. But it was Phil Rizzuto, the Hall of Fame Yankee shortstop and former broadcaster for the team, who came up with perhaps the most fitting scorecard notation for the modern era: WW, which means "wasn't watching."
