 Canada Might Beam Satellite Service Free Across Border --- CBC Suggests Sending News, Public Affairs and Films To U.S. Cable-TV Firms   By By Peggy Berkowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1986  The government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corp., or CBC, proposed penetrating the U.S. with a Canadian satellite service provided free to U.S. cable-TV companies.  CBC said the service would include Canadian news, public affairs, drama and children's programming produced by CBC, private-sector broadcasters, independent producers and the National Film Board of Canada.  Denis Harvey, vice president of CBC's English-language television network, warned in a telephone interview from Toronto that the proposal is still in "the very early thinking stages." Any such move would require Canadian, and possibly U.S., regulatory approval.
