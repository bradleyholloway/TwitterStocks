 Escape Snafus: Nuclear Disaster Drills At U.S. Power Plants Are a Comedy of Errors --- Soviet Accident at Chernobyl Is Now Rekindling Interest In Plans for Evacuations --- Odd Failures to Communicate   By By Bill Paul and David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 1986  The accident two weeks ago at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union underscored the problems and importance of evacuation procedures. The Soviets say they moved out more than 25,000 people in less than three hours, but the initial evacuation wasn't ordered until 36 hours after radiation started spewing into the air. As a result, hundreds and perhaps thousands of Soviet citizens living near the plant are presumed to have been exposed to dangerous and perhaps deadly radiation.  In the U.S., elaborate plans and procedures have been established at federal, state and local levels to avert such a catastrophe. Under current regulations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency conducts evacuation-plan drills at each nuclear power plant every two years. After a drill, the agency advises the utility and government officials of shortcomings. If there are serious deficiencies, a remedial drill must be held to fix them.  -- At the April 1985 evacuation drill for the Vermont Yankee plant near the New Hampshire and Massachusetts borders, Central Vermont Public Service Co. failed to inform state officials that it had upgraded the severity to a "general emergency," meaning that radioactivity was likely to spread. That delayed the states' notification of local officials by as much as an hour, federal observers say.
