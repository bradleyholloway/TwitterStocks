 Malaysian Air May Turn Profit by '07   By Elffie Chew and Hasan Jafri, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2006  In an interview, Chief Executive Idris Jala said moves to slash jobs, close unprofitable routes and introduce financial discipline may allow the airline to narrow losses sooner than expected under its three-year restructuring plan. In February, the airline forecast it would post a net profit of 50 million ringgit, or about $13.5 million, next year and 500 million ringgit in 2008.  Mr. Jala said his "focus will be on growth" in 2007 and the company will continue to pursue global airline alliances to fulfill its hub- and-spoke strategy. Malaysia Air has 23 code-share deals and is looking for partnerships in Africa, China, India and Europe.
