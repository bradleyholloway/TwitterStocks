 Crunch Time: These Parents Gambled Big Money Their Kids Really Were Geniuses   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2000  At first it was a relatively small amount, $15,000 to make one payroll, $20,000 to make the next. Then came an emotional all-day meeting around the kitchen table. Sam Gerace Sr. talked about how important it was when making investments to know the players. He said he knew of no two people who were smarter and harder-working. Then he outlined a way to, if need be, put $1.1 million into the company -- just about every penny he and his wife, Ann [Gerace], had. They would borrow against their retirement savings, their home, a securities account, even against their life insurance. If the company failed, they would be in financial ruin.  Their sons were uneasy about taking the money. But they thought they were on to something big. Their company, called BeFree Inc., was a pioneer in "performance-marketing" on the Internet, a way of billing clients only for sales generated by their ads. The brothers just needed time -- and cash -- to develop the technology and get some customers. They accepted their parents' offer.  "I knew if I didn't get a `yes' Sam and I needed to sit down and start mapping the end of the company," says Tom, now 29 years old. After an intimidating meeting at the company's Fifth Avenue headquarters, he got the nod. He was close to tears as he phoned Sam, now 36, at the office in Pittsburgh. Sam turned to the staff and yelled, "We got it!" They conferenced in their parents to break the news.
