 Stocks Fall On Tumble In Tokyo --- Drop in Japan, Slide In U.S. Home Sales Give Investors Jitters   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1991  A tumbling Tokyo stock market and a surprising drop in new U.S. home sales pressured stock prices sharply lower in Wednesday's skimpy, pre-holiday trading. Bond prices got a modest lift from the bad news and the dollar ended mixed.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 38.02 points to 2934.70 in light trading. Broader measures of stock prices were off sharply, too. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 4.14 to 373.33, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, a measure of small stock prices, fell 4.46 to 474.32.  Stock prices plunged from the opening bell following a 2.6% drop in Tokyo stock prices. Traders in Japan indicated that early selling accelerated as rumors of another possible brokerage firm scandal circulated. The volatility in the Tokyo market, which soared 3.5% Monday, is giving U.S. investors a case of the jitters. They worry that Japanese investors will pull back from the U.S. stock and bond markets to cover losses at home.
