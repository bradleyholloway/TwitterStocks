 Cloning Clamor Grows --- Nobel Winners Oppose a Ban, Frist Announces His Support As Senate Prepares for Debate   By By Laurie McGinley and Antonio Regalado, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2002  The stepped-up activity underscores the high stakes surrounding the issue. Except for a few renegade scientists, almost everyone involved in the cloning debate agrees that reproductive cloning -- cloning to create another human being -- should be banned. But the Nobel laureates and patient advocacy groups say that cloning of early-stage embryos in the laboratory is essential to develop custom-made embryonic stem cells that could be used one day to treat people with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.  A bill already passed by the House -- and sponsored in the Senate by Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, and [MARY LANDRIEU], an Alabama Democrat -- would ban all human cloning. It would also levy criminal penalties, including jail time, for any effort to use cloning technology to create children or to conduct laboratory research aimed at creating medically useful stem cells. It would ban the importation of cloned embryos or any product or medical treatment derived from them. A rival bill by Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts would ban only reproductive cloning, leaving scientists free to manipulate embryos in the laboratory.  Following scientists' success in cloning a growing number of species, most recently rabbits, many believe that human cloning is inevitable. But "based on what we know, I think it is highly unlikely that [Dr. [Severino Antinori]] has a cloned pregnancy," says Michael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology, in Worcester, Mass., which has been the leading proponent of embryo-cloning technology. Advanced Cell announced in November that it had acquired human eggs and had made initial attempts to produce cloned human embryos for stem cells.
