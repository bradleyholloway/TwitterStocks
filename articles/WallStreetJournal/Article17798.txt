 Television: Behind the 'Sacred Rage'   By By Robert Goldberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1988  Islam, the dominant faith in the Mideast, is the fastest-growing religion on earth, now numbering almost one-quarter of the world's population. "The Sword of Islam" (Jan. 12 at 9 p.m., on PBS; in New York, Jan. 13 at 10 p.m.) studies the religion by observing the violent fundamentalist wing currently on the rise. Six centuries after the Crusades, Moslem warriors are once again preparing for battle with the West.  Shot under the most dangerous of conditions, "The Sword of Islam" offers indepth views of the two radical groups gleaned from sitting in on their councils of war, interviewing their members, even witnessing a Hizbollah unit in action, as it storms an Israeli-occupied fort. It's no surprise that producer/director David Darlow and his British Granada TV team won the International Emmy for this documentary -- they deserved it for bravery alone.  But "The Sword of Islam" is not just gripping; it's also intelligent. First it chills the blood with glimpses of young, hotheaded Moslems ready to fight the Holy War, ready to die. ("Islam is a tree that drinks the blood of martyrs," intones one Jihad member. "Islam will take over the world.") Then, in clear, concise terms, it offers some explanations.
