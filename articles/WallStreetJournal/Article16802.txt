 Personal Measure: Scholars Link Success of Firms To Lives of CEOs; A Family Death Hurts, Studies Say, as Does Buying a Mansion   By Maremont, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2007  "I find it hard to imagine if I had a sick child that would be anybody's business," says Jerry W. Levin, chairman of Sharper Image Corp. and former CEO of Revlon Inc. "To assume that because something is going on in my personal life it's going to affect my business -- it's crazy. I wouldn't even ask those kinds of questions about my own employees, my own executives."  To Frederick E. "Shad" Rowe Jr., a money manager and head of an activist-investor group called the Investors for Director Accountability Foundation, the real-estate study "makes perfect sense." A CEO buys a huge house, "then he needs to hire a decorator, then a landscape architect," Mr. Rowe says. "You spend a lot of time and energy that you could be spending running the company."  Gerald M. Levin was chief executive of Time Warner Inc. in 1997 when his grown son was murdered. "Of course I went into a tailspin," he said. "I made . . . I won't call it a mistake. I returned to what for me was a narcotic, I returned to work. I worked 25 hours a day." He said he couldn't judge whether his performance was affected but notes that he felt drained of emotion, as though "nothing that happened could affect me anymore." Mr. Levin's grief didn't correlate with a drop in Time Warner's stock price, which greatly outperformed the broader market during the three years after his son's murder.
