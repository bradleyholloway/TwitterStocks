 Steel Companies Are Expected to Post Highest Quarterly Profits in a Decade   By By J. Ernest Beazley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1988  Citing hefty prices and strong demand, they estimated that the nation's six largest steelmakers earned at least that sum, compared with slightly better than break-even results a year earlier. Both periods include non-steel earnings and are adjusted for one-time items.  An early signal came yesterday when National Steel Corp., the nation's No. 6 steelmaker, reported that net income rose 6.5% to $19.6 million for the second quarter from $18.4 million a year earlier. National is a joint venture of National Intergroup Inc. of Pittsburgh and NKK Corp. of Japan.  Both No. 4 Inland Steel Industries Inc. and No. 5 Armco Inc. are expected to report even steeper profits this morning, while industry leaders USX Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. are scheduled to release their earnings next week.
