"I hope they realize they're discouraging manufacturing and high-tech companies from coming here," says Brian Peters, senior tax accountant for Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corp. in Greensboro.  The controversy comes just shortly after North Carolina, in a bid to fend off other states' increasingly aggressive corporate tax breaks, moved to sweeten its state tax incentives, lower the corporate income tax and repeal a state-collected intangibles tax on stocks and bonds.
