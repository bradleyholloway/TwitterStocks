 India Stocks Hit Another High; Some Analysts Predict a Market Pullback in Short Term   By Raghavendra Upadhyaya and Romit Guha, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2006  "The Indian stock market is having its own party, and there doesn't seem to be any correlation to other markets," said Jigar Shah, director at KR Choksey Shares & Securities. The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-stock Sensitive Index, or Sensex, is up nearly 24% for the year after a 42% rise last year.  Mr. [Arindam Bhattacharjee], who manages around $1 billion in assets in India, said valuations are "looking expensive" and risks from rising global- commodity prices and local interest rates are looming.  He says the longer-term growth story of one of the world's fastest growing economies is intact. Yet "the stock markets are not discounting any of the shorter-term risks, and there are risks to this market -- both from within India and exogenous," he said. These factors include rising global crude-oil and commodity prices and internal factors, including rising interest rates.
