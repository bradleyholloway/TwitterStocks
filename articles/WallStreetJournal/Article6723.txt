 Tweaking Titanium's Recipe; Firms, Pentagon Search for New Way to Make Metal as Demand Surges   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  Making titanium metal is complicated. The current method involves extracting titanium minerals from beach sands found in places such as Africa and Australia and separating the heavier, titanium- bearing sands from the lighter sands. Companies process the sand through a multistep method using chlorine, carbon and magnesium to make a hard, porous material called sponge. The sponge is then melted in furnaces to produce titanium ingots. The titanium ingot is forged into semifinished round or square products called billets, then made into titanium plates, sheets, bars or other products.  Timet is the largest U.S. titanium sponge producer at present with 12,600 metric tons of sponge-making capacity per year but could be surpassed by Allegheny Technologies Corp. of Pittsburgh, which plans to expand its sponge-making capacity next year to 21,000 metric tons, up from 5,900 this year. The other large titanium metal maker in the U.S., RTI International Inc. of Ohio, isn't a major producer of titanium sponge. Executives at Allegheny Technologies declined to comment. Executives at RTI International weren't available.  One smaller titanium producer says the new processes are generating a good deal of buzz but doubts the "titanium revolution" will take hold quickly. "I don't think it's the Holy Grail," said Frank Perryman, a partner in Houston, Pa., titanium producer Perryman Co. "It's in the right direction. There's not going to be one home run. There has never been a home run in any metal. It takes little baby steps."
