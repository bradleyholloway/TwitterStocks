 Small Business Link: Shopping Out IT Gets More Complex; Costs and Competency of In-House Operations Often Are the Deciding Factors for Small Companies   By Flandez, Raymund, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2007  "It's easy for any company to get into the mind-set to bring a person in [as a dedicated IT employee] and you put them to work at that," says Mr. [Doug Turpin], 36. But "Atlantic Bay is a mortgage banker. We're not a Web developer or a software developer."  Of course, cost also is a factor in determining what to shop out. "In a lot of cases," Mr. Turpin says, "outsourcing is budget determined."  When the company was updating its main loan-processing software back in 2005, a vendor handled training the company's sales staff. Mr. Turpin figured the vendor had a better handle on the application and how to teach it. But Atlantic Bay's salespeople told him that some of the more general training lessons were a waste of time when they didn't relate to what they do day-to-day.
