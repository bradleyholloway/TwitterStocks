 Exco to Acquire 80% of Broker For $79 Million --- Big Stake in RMJ Holdings Would Give British Firm Strong Presence in U.S.   By By Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1987  Exco International Inc. agreed to acquire 80% of New York-based RMJ Holdings Corp., one of the largest brokers of U.S. government and agency securities, for about $79 million.  Exco, a unit of British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC, is one of the world's biggest brokers of interbank and foreign-exchange deposits. Under the agreement, Bank of New York Co. would reduce its 50.1% holding in RMJ to 10%. RMJ senior officials who own 49.9% of the broker's equity would cut their holdings to 10%.  The agreement gives Exco the right to acquire the rest of RMJ over a six-year period, with that price based on RMJ's future earnings. The purchase, to be completed by May, also would include RMJ's mortgage-information unit and its 70% interest in a computer software concern that supplies specialist services to the financial community. RMJ already has a London office and last week received Japanese regulatory approval to open a Tokyo office.
