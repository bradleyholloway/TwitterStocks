 Bertelsmann AG Is Set to Acquire Columbia House   By Karnitschnig, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2005  The acquisition marks Bertelsmann's biggest strategic deal in the U.S. since it bought Random House in 1998, and its biggest purchase since it was obligated to acquire Zomba Records in 2002 under an option agreement with the owner. Buying Columbia House signals Bertelsmann's renewed commitment to old-line media businesses, including book clubs and printing presses, following an ill-fated attempt at diversification into new media under the company's former chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff.  For Bertelsmann, selling BMG Direct was never an attractive option. Bertelsmann grew up in the club business and remains the world's biggest club operator, with a total of 32 million members in 22 countries. After losing 150 million euros in 2002 (equivalent to $192.3 million today), Bertelsmann has spent the past three years restructuring its club division, Direct Group, and has made it a cornerstone of its international growth strategy. Many people are drawn to the clubs, Bertelsmann says, because the catalogs and product recommendations provide an easy way to navigate the worlds of music and books.  After just three years, Bertelsmann's Reading Circle had nearly one million members, providing the foundation for Bertelsmann to emerge over the next decades one of the world's dominant media companies. Mr. [Reinhard Mohn]'s second wife, Liz, who now represents the family's interests, started working at the company's German club in the 1950's as a secretary and met her future husband there.
