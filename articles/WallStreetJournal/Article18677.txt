 Dollar Again Mixed in Quiet Trading; U.S.-Japan Auto Talks Outcome Pending   By Miller, Rena S, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1995  Earlier, the dollar had been weakened by the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. leading indicators, which provided further evidence that the economy is heading for a "soft landing" this year, with growth moderating and inflation under control. That hurts the dollar because it suggests the Federal Reserve is unlikely to boost interest rates any time soon.  U.S. leading indicators fell 0.5% in March, the biggest drop in two years, and steeper than expectations of a 0.3% drop. In addition, U.S. factory orders fell 0.1% in March, compared with market expectations of a rise of 0.4%.  "Sentiment is forming in the market that the extreme selling pressure is dissipating with the G-7 [communique]," said Earl Johnson, foreign-exchange economist at the Bank of Montreal in Chicago. "People think the dollar is oversold, even though the Japan trade surplus, and U.S. budget and trade deficits are still there."
