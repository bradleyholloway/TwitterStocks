Read This -- And Go   By Parker-Pope, Tara, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2007  "He was so drawn and thin, I burst into tears," she says. "He's thinking I'm hormonal. But I told him, 'You're sick, and you won't go to the doctor.'"  Physician Harvey Simon, editor of the Harvard Men's Health Watch newsletter, says it's common for men to "blame" their wives when they finally do visit a doctor.

If I had been a single guy without someone deeply invested in my life, I'm not sure what would have happened. For lack of a better word, I was nagged into doing something."
