The panel found that most of the approximately 1,300 transactions by Mr. Dietrich for the customer's accounts were made on the basis of discretion verbally granted by the customer, and not in writing as required.  MISSOURI: Kurt A. Johnson, a former broker, of Lee's Summit, Mo., was suspended for two months without admitting or denying findings that he engaged in sales-practice misconduct in four customers' accounts including improperly exercising discretion in a customer's account, entering an unsuitable trade, and entering an unauthorized trade.  NEW JERSEY: Erwin Roberts, a former broker, of Dumont, N.J., was barred for one year without admitting or denying findings that he engaged in sales-practice misconduct in connection with his handling of a synagogue's account. The panel found, among other things, that Mr. Roberts engaged in discretionary trading without written authorization of the customer; made misstatements or omissions to the customer; caused unsuitable trades; caused the customer to pay an unnecessarily high price for purchases; and failed to follow the customer's instructions.
