 E-Business: Starting Gate   By By Lisa Bransten, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2001  Jeffrey Christian, chief executive of Christian & Timbers, says venture firms often give his company a chance to invest in their deals, so he decided to start the fund rather than scramble to gather money when such opportunities came along. William S. Trainor, manager of the fund, says he will invest only alongside what he considers top-tier venture firms and only in firms where Christian & Timbers feels it has brought in a top management team.  The funding is somewhat unusual because Crosspoint also led the previous round, but Seth Neiman, a managing partner of the venture firm, says he decided to re-up, not because eSilicon was having trouble raising money, but because Crosspoint wanted to make sure it held on to a big stake in the company. Tarrant Venture Partners, a venture fund sponsored by the partners of investment firm Texas Pacific Group, also invested in the round.  The company has secured $25 million in first-round funding from Polaris Venture Partners. Bob Metcalfe, best known as the father of the Ethernet -- the technology that connects office computers -- and a new venture partner at Polaris, is a Narad board member. Several movers and shakers in the networking community are among the private investors chipping in another $16.5 million in first-round funds, including Rubin Gruber, chairman of Sonus Networks, and Pradeep Sindhu, vice chairman and chief technology officer of Juniper Networks.
