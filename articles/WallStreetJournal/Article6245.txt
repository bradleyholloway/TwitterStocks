 Delta Readies Work-Rule Changes; Flight Attendants Affected; Carrier Sees $40 Million In Savings Annually   By Perez, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2003  The nation's No. 3 carrier said the changes will save the company about $40 million annually. The new rules include replacing a minimum base pay for flight attendants with an hourly wage rate and removing caps on how many hours attendants are allowed to work. Delta said the new rules will take effect next May and June. Because its flight attendants aren't represented by a union, Delta, unlike other big carriers, doesn't have to negotiate the changes. Delta said its flight attendants, depending on seniority and hours worked, make between $30,000 and $60,000 a year.  Joan Vincenz, Delta's director of in-flight service operations and planning, said the new rules were designed to ensure that those working 75 hours a month, the average for Delta flight attendants according to an internal survey, would earn the same as they do under the current rules. Instead of limiting flight attendants to working 85 to 90 hours a month, as under the current rules, workers won't have a cap, meaning they can work and earn as little or as much as they want. Any slight pay decrease is made up by greater flexibility and more control for workers, she said.
