 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): NIMBY   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 2, 1989  Since airlines were deregulated in 1978, passenger traffic has soared 65% while the number of major airports has stayed the same. If no new airports are built, or existing ones aren't used more rationally, by the year 2001 every day at an airport will seem like the day before Thanksgiving, when facilities take on the look of a commodity-trading floor.  At least seven key cities (Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, St. Louis and San Francisco) desperately need new airport capacity. Yet the only airports on the drawing board are in Denver and Austin, Texas. This month Denver voters overwhelmingly approved their new airport -- the world's largest -- despite fierce opposition. United and Continental Airlines, which control 85% of the traffic at the smaller Stapleton Airport, opposed the new facility -- largely because it meant the end of their duopoly.
