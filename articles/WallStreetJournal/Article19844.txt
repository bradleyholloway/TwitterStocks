 Overused Contacts Respond to Apologies, Rewards and Updates   By Lublin, Joann S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2005  Express gratitude for the contact's generous past support, perhaps with a handwritten note tucked inside a belated New Year's card. Make sure your next request better matches that individual's capabilities. "Don't ask people for something so out of their realm that they feel uncomfortable and unable to respond," Ms. [Susan RoAne] advises.  Three months ago, however, "she stopped taking my calls," Mr. [Joey Robertson] remembers. He left several voicemails. One of her associates finally told him, "She's just busy. She's not going to call you back." He suspected his excessive appeals for assistance wore out his welcome. But the 38-year-old resident of Pfafftown, N.C., hesitated to volunteer ways that he might assist the HR official. "I don't have a whole lot to offer," Mr. Robertson said in early December. He failed to realize that even unemployed job seekers have valuable expertise and connections.  On the other hand, Ms. [Kate Wendleton] responds rapidly to a jobless manager who sometimes e-mails her three times a week. While working for a big insurance broker, he "got us a really important relationship there," she says. "If you aren't giving back more than you're getting from networking, then you're a baby in the job-search process."
