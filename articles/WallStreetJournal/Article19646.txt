 Brazil Sees Gold in Remnants of Mines   By By Gerald Jeffris, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2003  The country's central bank said it has decided to melt down thousands of receptacles used by migrant gold prospectors at the deactivated Serra Pelada gold fields in northern Brazil in the 1980s to complement the country's budget.  Mr. [Joao Fleury] said the gold will yield about six million reals (about $2 million), which will go straight to the country's foreign reserves. The remaining material will yield about 23 million reals, which will be directed to the federal treasury.  The country's Urban Development Ministry, responsible for serving major cities that are home to more than 50 million inhabitants, got only 300 million reals this year. The Ministry of the Interior, responsible for integrating infrastructure in more than 8.5 million square kilometers (5.3 million miles) of national territory, was left with a budget of 188 million reals.
