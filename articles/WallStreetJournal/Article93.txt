 BASF Posts Rise In 2nd Quarter Pretax Earnings   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1989  BASF AG's second-quarter pretax operating profit jumped 31% to 1.29 billion marks ($660 million) from 985 million marks a year earlier on retreating raw-material prices and improving results from its petroleum and agro-chemical divisions.  The world's largest chemical group appeared to be leading the pace in a West German chemical industry that continues to prosper from uninterrupted global economic expansion and currency-related advantages in foreign markets.  BASF's results were up 42% from 905 million marks in the first quarter. The result brought BASF's first-half operating profit to 2.19 billion marks, up 28% from 1.71 billion marks a year earlier.
