 U.S.-Japan Talks on Beef, Citrus Quotas Collapse; New GATT Request Is Planned   By By Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1988  The breakdown in negotiations means the U.S. will renew a request for an independent panel to hear the dispute under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based body regulating global trade. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the request would go before GATT this morning in Geneva.  Japan blocked the initial request to form such a panel in April, insisting that the issue be settled through bilateral discussions. U.S. trade officials had no assurance last night that Japan wouldn't block a new request, which it could do under a GATT tradition of decisions by consensus. If GATT does review the complaint, it could take up to six months to reach a decision.  The impasse on the beef and citrus question is a major setback for trade relations between the two countries. Previously, Japan and the U.S. have been able to finesse most disputes, including a disagreement over access to the Japanese public-works market for U.S. construction firms. Although the countries have turned to GATT on some issues, the beef and citrus question is by far the most serious.
