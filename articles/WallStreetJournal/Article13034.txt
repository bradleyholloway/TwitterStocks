 The Asbestos Blob, Cont.   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2004  Like everyone except the trial bar and Tom Daschle, we'd like nothing more than to contain the insanity that has become the asbestos tort blob. More than 100,000 new asbestos claims were filed in 2003 -- the most in a single year. 100,000! Some 70 companies have already been pushed into bankruptcy from such claims, and the truly sick aren't getting compensation because the courts are clogged, and because settlement money is funneled to trial lawyers and to the 90% of plaintiffs who aren't ill and may never be.  So much for good intentions: Fund designers dramatically underestimated black-lung claims and by 1981 -- a scant three years later -- Congress had already voted to double the size of the tax. Even then, the fund couldn't keep up and today it is more than $8 billion in debt. The excise tax no longer covers even the interest on the fund's debt. (One harbinger of the asbestos mess to come: Unions are already objecting that the latest offer of a $114 billion trust fund isn't large enough.)
