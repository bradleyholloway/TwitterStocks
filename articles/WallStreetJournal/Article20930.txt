 Letters to the Editor: Irving Kristol, the Neocon Rambo   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1986  Irving Kristol ("Coping With an 'Evil Empire,'" editorial page, Dec. 17) is the Rambo of the so-called intellectual neoconservative community. Mr. Kristol defines totalitarianism as a regime that denies the existence of God, comparing it with authoritarianism, which, in allowing some worship, somehow becomes more benign and acceptable to us. In a word, that is nonsense. His reasoning makes Hitler, who never banned Christianity, a mere authoritarian who these days could be embraced. Do I miss your point, Mr. Kristol, or are you also saying that Khomeini, Arafat or Qadhafi (all practicing Moslems); Botha (a staunch Protestant); Stroessner (who allows the Catholic Church to function); or Kahane (who would not deny Judaism in any regime he ran) are leaders we can live with?
