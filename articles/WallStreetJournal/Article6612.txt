 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2006  Bush said the apparent bomb test threatens the world's "peace and security" and requires an "immediate response" by the U.N., which Washington wants to approve sanctions including boarding of ships traveling to or from the Communist hermit kingdom. But it was unclear if China and Russia will assent. Moscow, while detecting no radiation rise on its shared border, had "no doubts" about Pyongyang's claim of a successful test, but South Korea scientists said the blast was so small the bomb may have just partly detonated, or it was only a giant conventional explosion. One certainty is the diplomatic path taken so far has failed.  Iraqi gunmen killed the Sunni vice president's brother. The U.S. military said four troops died. A bomb left 10 dead in a Baghdad Shiite area and 11 Iraqi police were kidnapped from a nearby checkpoint. The head cook was arrested in the apparent poisoning of 400 police, mainly Shiites, Sunday. Kurdistan's push for oil independence is trouble for Iraq.
