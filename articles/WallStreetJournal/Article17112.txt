 U.S. News: Back in the Job Hunt, With New Hope   By Tuna, Cari; Needleman, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2010  The increase in the labor force, which grew for the third straight month in March, comes after it shed nearly two million people between May and December of 2009, as stiff competition for jobs during the economic slump led many laid-off workers to quit looking for employment. Returnees could include, for example, those who had retired or taken time off to raise children, in addition to people who quit searching for work, said Tom Nardone, assistant commissioner for current employment analysis at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
