 Moving the Market: To Swap or Not? A City Weighs Deal; Rice Plays Down Criticism Of Interest-Rate Exchange, But Some Say It Is Too Risky   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2005  Eugene Brown, a Durham council member who plans to vote against proceeding with the swap, says, "New revelations that some of Rice's instruments aren't performing the way they expected should send a signal to my colleagues that, yes indeed, this is a rather risky, speculative scheme and we shouldn't do it."  Durham County -- the county encompassing Durham city and others -- entered into a Rice swap last July. The county received a half-year payment on March 15 of $204,000 -- less than the $600,000 in "expected savings" [J. Donald Rice Jr.] projected, says George Quick, the county's finance director. "We just hope that when the market changes -- that we'll make up some of the difference," Mr. Quick says. He adds that doing the swap was "better than had we done nothing."
