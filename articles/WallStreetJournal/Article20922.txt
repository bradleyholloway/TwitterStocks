 Money Launderer Is Sentenced to Fine Totaling $6,495,000   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1986  A federal judge sentenced a convicted money launderer to pay a $6,495,000 fine -- believed to be the largest fine ever levied against an individual in U.S. courts.  Ramon Milian-Rodriguez, a Cuban-born U.S. citizen, also was sentenced in U.S. District Court to 35 years in prison.  Judge William H. Stafford meted out the sentence after telling Mr. Milian-Rodriguez that "your background, up to a point, was almost the American dream . . . and then you turned that American dream into a kind of nightmare."
