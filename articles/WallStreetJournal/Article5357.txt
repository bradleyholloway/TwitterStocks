 SEC won't move to regulate raters of bonds, chairman tells congress   By Gasparino, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1996  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr said in a letter responding to John D. Dingell, a ranking member of the House Commerce Committee, that the SEC has no plans to regulate the bond-rating business. Dingell had suggested the SEC consider regulatory oversight of bond-rating houses after learning of the recently begun inquiry by the Justice Department Antitrust Division into Moody's Investors Service Inc's use of so-called imsolicited ratings to win credit-rating assignments in the municipal-bond and certain other markets.
