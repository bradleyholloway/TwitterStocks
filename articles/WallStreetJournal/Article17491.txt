 U.S. Dollar Mixed; Gold Rises 80 Cents --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1985  The U.S. dollar was mixed yesterday, rising against the British pound and the West German mark, but weakening against other currencies.  Foreign-exchange traders said they were somewhat baffled by the dollar's relative strength, considering the recent accumulation of dour U.S. economic news that led many of them on Friday to predict a sharp dollar decline this week. "It seems the market wants still more bad news before it acts," said Jeff Brummette, a corporate assistant secretary of Irving Trust Co., New York.
