 Personal Finance (A Special Report): Identifying the Issue --- Awaiting the Windfall -- For those counting on a large inheritance, remember: That future money requires a lot of planning; Now   By By Lynn Asinof, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 9, 1994  That's a tough question, investment advisers say, because how and when the money will change hands are largely unknown, and lots of variables will affect the eventual size of the inheritance. Dad may remarry, spend a big chunk on medical care or give most of it to charities. And with more people living in good health into their 90s, the "children" may not come into their inheritances until they're in their 60s or 70s -- probably too late to put the money toward buying a family house or paying for their own children's college education.  So why not just assume you're getting nothing? Indeed, many financial advisers say that unless you have a legacy tucked into a trust fund with your name on it, you should draft your long-term financial plans as if you will inherit nothing.  He and other advisers say future heirs sell themselves short if they ignore a likely inheritance while nurturing their own nest eggs. Still, Mr. Altfest is careful to tone down expectations. For planning purposes, he says, you should lop off 20% of the current value of the estate you expect to inherit, and assume you won't get the money until Dad is 93 and Mom is 98.
