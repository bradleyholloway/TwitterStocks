 Capital Focus -- Report From Sacramento: Election Reforms Spark Early Senate Campaigning   By By Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  True, it's a full 19 months until the general election. And nearly a year from the March 7, 2000, primary. Yet already a fight has broken out between two Republicans over that seat. Bernie Richter, the former GOP assemblyman from Chico, has already slammed his opponent, Assemblyman Thomas "Rico" Oller (R., San Andreas), by saying Mr. Oller is "unable to tell the truth." Mr. Oller, meanwhile, has attacked Mr. Richter's Assembly record, calling it "erratic, unpredictable, reckless and flippant."  Mr. Richter, 67 years old, claims he's already logged an amazing 14 months on the campaign trail across the 25,000-square-mile district. And Mr. Oller, 40, says he was forced to jump into the race months sooner than he would have liked.
