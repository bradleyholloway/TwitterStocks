 Publishing: Crown tries 'hand sell' for a hard sell   By Cox, Meg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1993  Publishers' use of a marketing strategy known as "hand selling," in which publishers make personal pitches to bookstores, is discussed. Crown Publishers Inc used hand selling to promote one of its new books, "A Rock and a Hard Place," by Anthony Godby Johnson, a 15-year-old boy who was sexually and physically abused by his natural parents and who apparently contracted AIDS after being raped by a family friend.
