 Counties Look to Impose New Fee on Construction   By By Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1997  In the next few weeks, Collier County commissioners are expected to approve a charge -- called an interim service fee -- on all new construction. Lee County is also considering the fee, as are the school boards in Lee and Collier counties and a major city, Naples. That could result in unexpected bills for thousands of property owners. And many people aren't happy at that prospect.  More than a dozen cities statewide -- including Orlando and Miami -- collect the fees. But Collier's approval would mark a first for Florida counties. Interest in the fees among counties and school boards is growing primarily because their preferred solution to the tax shortfall -- partial-year assessments -- has repeatedly failed in the state Legislature. And it's the state's counties and school boards that are encountering much of the new construction and where the impact of such fees is potentially the greatest.  Apart from the fairness issue, millions of dollars in new revenue are at stake for local governments -- money that's deemed critical to meet increasing service demands amid cuts in state and federal funding and the public's intolerance for higher taxes. A study by the Florida Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations estimated that $80 million went uncollected in partial taxes in 1993 for cities, counties and school boards statewide. Together, Collier and Lee counties project an extra $2.6 million from the fees annually.
