 Issuers of Munis In California Are Focus of Probe --- SEC Is Considering Action Against 11 Localities Concerning Disclosure   By By John Connor, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1996  California entities acknowledging receipt of SEC Wells notices include the small town of Ione and Nevada County, both of which experienced bond defaults. In these and several other related cases, the bonds were underwritten by First California Capital Markets Group Inc., a San Francisco firm. The SEC was urged to look into such First California transactions in 1994 by California's then-treasurer, Kathleen Brown, who suggested in a letter to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt that a number of "questionable transactions may warrant SEC attention." People familiar with the matter say the SEC is in fact looking at First California. The firm's chairman, H. Michael Richardson, was unavailable to comment. Ione and Nevada County denied any wrongdoing in their responses to the SEC's Wells notices, which give potential defendants a chance to tell the SEC why they think they shouldn't be sued for violating federal securities laws.
