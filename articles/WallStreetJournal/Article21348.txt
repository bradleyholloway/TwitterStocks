 House Panel Clears Measure Boosting CFTC   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1989  The House Agriculture Committee approved legislation that would tighten federal oversight of the nation's futures industry and curb trading abuses.  The bill is designed to toughen federal standards for detecting trading violations in the pits, including those uncovered by the government's huge investigation of the Chicago futures markets. It would make the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a permanent agency that doesn't require reauthorization every five years, and would boost CFTC funding to $40 million in fiscal 1990 and $44.5 million in fiscal 1991 from its current $34.7 million.  The key plank in the bipartisan bill would ban dual trading in any futures contract with an average daily volume of 7,000 contracts or more until futures exchanges develop the surveillance capability to detect trading abuses. The practice of dual trading involves futures brokers' trading for themselves as well as their customers. An abuse of particular concern to lawmakers is a form of "front-running" in which brokers execute their own trades ahead of customer orders.
