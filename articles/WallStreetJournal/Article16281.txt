 The SARS Outbreak: WHO Calls for China SARS Review --- Alarm Grows as Number Of Health-Care Workers Infected Continues to Rise   By By Peter Wonacott and Leslie Chang in Beijing and Karen Richardson in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  China has now reported 4,125 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome -- up 164 cases yesterday alone. The number of SARS victims among medical staff has created tremendous strain on the health-care system. In Beijing, 18% of all SARS patients are health-care workers. In nearby Tianjin, health-care workers account for 45% of SARS patients.  To the relief of doctors, 12 patients who readmitted themselves to hospitals last week have been determined not to have relapsed with SARS but have other illnesses, according to initial chest X-ray and blood tests. "We are happy to see that most, if not all, were readmitted for other symptoms and conditions," Margaret Chan, director of health, said at a news conference, adding that eight of the patients have been sent home again for convalescence. While some showed SARS-related symptoms such as fever, others exhibited symptoms related to previous or other ailments, such as swelling in one patient with a history of deep-vein thrombosis.  Taiwan announced 14 new probable SARS cases yesterday, bringing the total to 116. An additional 184 people have been listed as suspected cases, according to Wang Je-chau, a spokesman for the Department of Health. Eight people have died from SARS in Taiwan, and about 5,000 people are quarantined at home.
