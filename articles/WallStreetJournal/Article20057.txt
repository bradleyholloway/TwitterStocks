 Ask Encore / Focus on Retirement   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2006  AS WE MENTIONED last month, "529" college-savings accounts are a great tool, with earnings and withdrawals exempt from federal taxes when you use them for higher education. Many 529 plans let account owners sock away as much as $250,000 per beneficiary, because it's the ballpark amount that today's preschoolers may wind up paying for college and graduate school, says Joseph Hurley, author of "The Best Way to Save for College: A Complete Guide to 529 Plans."  You can contribute as much as $12,000 a year per child without incurring gift taxes, or you can contribute up to $60,000 up front. Together, you and your wife could contribute $120,000 to your 529 accounts 11 times over without touching your lifetime gift-tax exemption of $1 million apiece. If you wish to exceed the $120,000 limit per child, then you start dipping into the gift-tax exemption. In your case, you could go ahead and invest an additional $130,000 per child. But doing so would eat up $1.43 million of your combined $2 million exemption.
