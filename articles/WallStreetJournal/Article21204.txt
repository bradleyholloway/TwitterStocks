 Business World: Herman Miller's Secrets of Corporate Creativity   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1988  "Good design sells" is an article of faith at Herman Miller Inc. It has been making good money with good design for years. Among other distinctions, its 1956 Eames lounge chair is exhibited in New York's Museum of Modern Art. It is the top-ranked furniture maker on Fortune's list of "most-admired" corporations.  Or you might try this passage: "One way to think about work is to ask how poets and philosophers would lead corporations. At Herman Miller, our poets and philosophers have mostly been designers -- George Nelson, Charles Eames, Robert Propst, Bill Stumpf."  Aside from their philosophical contributions, designers such as these have created the products that have made Herman Miller rich and famous. The famous cup-shaped, molded glass-fiber Eames chair, created with World War II radome technology, has sold more than five million copies world-wide. Mr. Stumpf has just created "Ethospace" interiors, a versatile system of work spaces for offices.
