 Laidlaw Waste Violated Rules On Competition   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1992  The Canadian Competition Tribunal ruled that Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd. attempted to stifle competition in the garbage collection business in parts of Vancouver Island and it ordered the company to desist from various anti-competitive practices.  Laidlaw Waste Systems, a subsidiary of Laidlaw Inc., Burlington, Ontario., is one of the three major garbage collection companies in North America. The others are Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., Houston, and Waste Management Inc., Oak Brook, Ill.  The tribunal found that Laidlaw, after aggressively buying out local competitors, controlled more than 87% of the business market in the three areas. Each acquisition agreement contained a broadly drafted clause prohibiting the vendor from competing with Laidlaw within a wide geographical area for many years, it said.
