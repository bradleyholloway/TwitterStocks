 Tradable Bond-Index Funds Considered   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2000  Mr. [Lee Kranefuss] is confident that Barclays can overcome the structural and regulatory hurdles necessary to introduce tradable bond-index funds in the U.S. The products could be offered in about a year "if all goes well," said Mr. Kranefuss, adding that he eventually expects ETFs representing different parts of the bond market including government, government-agency and corporate bonds. "There's great demand for a fixed-income" exchange-traded mutual fund, he said.  Gus Fleites, director of exchange-traded products at State Street Corp.'s asset-management unit, another ETF sponsor, said the firm has looked at bond ETFs, but isn't working on any currently. Because many bonds aren't heavily traded, they can be difficult to price during the day, a major hitch in structuring a tradable fund, he said. Some bond ETFs also might track their underlying indexes less reliably because the indexes include thousands of corporate and municipal bonds. Also, because bonds have a given life span before they mature, the portfolio would need to be updated constantly, offsetting some of the tax advantages that stock-index ETFs offer.
