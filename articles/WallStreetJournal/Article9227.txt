The San Diego medical-sciences company posted a second-quarter loss that was significantly narrower than analysts had been expecting. But analysts said they will be reducing their revenue projections for the company as a result of Nanogen shifting its market focus. They said the company plans to lease the instruments it develops, as opposed to expectations that the company would sell them outright.
