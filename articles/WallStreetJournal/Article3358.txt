 Iran Minister Says 10 Jews to Be Retried --- Case Has Impeded a Thaw Between U.S., Tehran; Islamists vs. Reformists   By By Hugh Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  A Tehran appeals court is expected today to order a retrial of 10 Iranian Jews who were convicted in a controversial case on charges of cooperation with Israel, a New York human-rights lawyer said yesterday after a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi. The case has complicated a prospective thaw in relations between Iran and the U.S.  The trial of the Jews of Shiraz was started by a radical faction of Iran's Islamic conservatives, who are struggling for control of the country against reformists led by President Mohammad Khatami and Foreign Minister Kharazi. Mr. [Scott Horton] and Mr. [Irwin Cotler] believe the trial was also aimed at upsetting Mr. Khatami's attempts to pave the way to normal relations with the U.S., which have been cut since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.
