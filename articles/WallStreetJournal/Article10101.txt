 Drug Ads Don't Tempt Europe   By Loftus, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2007  Some European physicians aren't crazy about the idea of their patients seeing a beaver and Abraham Lincoln peddle a drug as they do in U.S. television ads for Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.'s Rozerem insomnia treatment. Echoing the concerns of U.S. doctors when TV ads began to proliferate in the 1990s, their European counterparts fear the ads would encourage patients to demand prescriptions that aren't medically appropriate.  Some Europeans feel otherwise, favoring a removal of the ban as long as ads provide balanced information about a drug's risks and benefits. "There's no reason why consumers shouldn't be informed about new developments in prescription drugs," said Martin Ryan, a graduate economics student in Dublin. "It could be better for consumers to be aware of possible choices."  The Institute of Medicine, which advises the U.S. government on health matters, last year recommended a moratorium on DTC advertising for two years after a drug's market launch, to allow time to gain more scientific certainty about a new drug's risks and benefits. Although, the proposal wasn't included in recent legislation that gave the FDA more teeth in other areas of drug regulation, the idea hasn't gone away. Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards recently proposed a similar moratorium.
