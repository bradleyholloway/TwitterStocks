 Amex Board Votes To End All Curbs On Classes of Stock   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1986  The American Stock Exchange said its board voted to remove all restrictions against listing companies with two classes of voting stock.  The exchange said the move comes in response to an absence of restrictions by the National Association of Securities Dealers' over-the-counter market and the decision by the New York Stock Exchange to change its criteria regarding shareholder voting rights.
