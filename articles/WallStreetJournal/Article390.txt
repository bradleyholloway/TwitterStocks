 Summer Olympics: Missed a Medal? Call Your Lawyer   By Kahn, Gabriel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2004  "Speed is everything," Mr. Benz says. "We prepare for this and drill for this. This is our go-time."  The event's ground jury docked the Germans 12 points. The Germans immediately appealed to the equestrian federation, which reversed the jury. The U.S. riders were preparing for the next event when they realized that the results had changed. Jim Wolf, the U.S. team leader, immediately called the USOC. "I think this stinks," he said.  After a hearing, the CAS agreed with Mr. Benz and reinstated the 12- point penalty, thereby yanking the Germans out of medal contention. France claimed gold, Britain silver, and the U.S. bronze. "We have to accept this decision, but we're not happy about it," says Reinhard Wendt, a German team official.
