 Music: Buddy Holly's Still-Living Legacy   By Mazor, Barry, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2009  Holly's early, increasingly R&B-influenced country duets with Bob Montgomery; the garage tape in which Buddy and a fledgling version of his band the Crickets rip into mid-1950s rock 'n' roll standards; and the celebrated apartment tape demos recorded at home in New York just before his death, including the originals of such gems as Learning the Game and Crying, Waiting, Hoping.
