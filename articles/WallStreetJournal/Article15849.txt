 Quarterly Loss Was Narrower At Micron Tech   By By David P. Hamilton, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1999  Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, said its net loss in the quarter ended Sept. 2 narrowed to $17.4 million, or seven cents a share, from a net loss of $93.3 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected Micron to post a loss of 18 cents a share.  Micron said that average selling prices of memory chips fell approximately 40% in the year ended Sept. 2, a decline that followed sharp drops of 60% and 75% in the two preceding years. In late August and early September, however, Micron said average prices increased significantly, although it warned that such increases might not be sustainable.
