 Love & Money: Heading Home: Now What Do I Do?   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2004  I wasn't expecting it so soon. Still, as regular readers of this column might recall, I've written in the past of Amy selflessly following my career. I've often said that whenever the opportunity arose to advance her career, I would crate up my life and follow her home, likely marking the last move we'll ever make.  I won't pretend that change of this magnitude isn't difficult. As any trailing spouse knows, it's agonizing to leave behind friends and colleagues and a job you love. Moreover, when you're the one not in charge of the change, but instead being pushed along by it, you feel rudderless. I thought I was familiar with that feeling, because I've imposed it on Amy so many times. But I realize now that I never had a clue.  Because my choice ultimately bears upon my family, I've included Amy in my deliberations. If there's one thing I've learned leading Amy all over the country for my job, it's to talk early and often about each other's concerns and expectations so that emotions aren't bottled up, only to explode once you alight in some new city.
