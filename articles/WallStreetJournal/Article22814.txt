 A New Voice for America   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2001  Change can't come soon enough. It's worse than bad luck that VOA found itself at this critical juncture without a leader. The position of VOA director, like so many other Administration appointments, fell into the black hole of backlogs after last year's endless election. Rudderless except for a gaggle of bureaucrats, VOA has stumbled several times since September 11; for instance, by broadcasting interviews with the leader of an Egyptian terrorist organization and with members of a small radical group in Indonesia without informing listeners of their background or providing context for their bellicose remarks.  The worst gaffe was VOA's decision last week to air parts of an interview with the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar. The State Department tried to block the broadcast, arguing that it wasn't America's job to give air time to the host of Osama bin Laden. But VOA went ahead -- claiming that it was its journalistic duty to offer Afghans and other listeners balanced points of view. Well, nothing Omar said to Afghans was news; they hear his rants every day on the radio and TV he controls. And far from convincing Afghans of the wondrous nature of America's free press, VOA just sent them a confusing mixed message: Does the U.S. want us to rise up and oppose this guy, or not?
