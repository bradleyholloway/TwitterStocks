 OK, Boss, Now Tell Me More on Pensions   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2005  Evaluating the safety of your pension usually means gauging the financial health of your company and industry today and in the years ahead. Companies generally are bound to pay their retirees' accrued benefits unless they file for bankruptcy protection or can prove to the PBGC that they can't stay in business unless they terminate their pension obligations. For more information, go to www.dol.gov/ebsa/Publications online and scroll down to "Protect Your Pension: A Quick Reference Guide."  Besides pension security, there are other reasons to consider a lump sum, says Martin James, a certified public accountant in Mooresville, Ind. Retirees gain more flexibility in investing and have a nest egg to draw on to pay medical bills or leave money to heirs. Moreover, most pensions aren't adjusted for inflation, so after 30 years that monthly check "won't be nearly as valuable."  There are real risks to taking a lump sum, says Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Investing a lump sum requires self-discipline and investment prowess that most Americans simply don't have. "The biggest risk that most people face in this day and age is outliving their money," Mr. Salisbury says. "We're not disciplined savers."
