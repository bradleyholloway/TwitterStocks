 Business Technology: In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., maker of Panasonic plasma-screen TV sets, plans to fend off LCD TV sets' advance through a combination of efforts. It said it is working on improving luminous efficiency, which would lower power consumption, and was cutting production costs with single-scan technology, which uses one chip instead of two to drive the display. Last year, four times as many LCD TV sets as plasma TV sets were sold, research firm iSuppli says.
