 Film: Deep Thought's a Bad Source for Aerobic Editor   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1985  "Perfect" showcases two of Hollywood's hot talents, John Travolta and Jamie Lee Curtis. The movie's most interesting performance, however, comes from novice actor Jann Wenner. Mr. Wenner plays Mark Roth, the callous, shallow editor of the rock celebrity magazine Rolling Stone. The chubby, baby-faced Mr. Wenner is perfect for his role in "Perfect" because he plays himself. He founded Rolling Stone in 1967.  Is Mr. Wenner sorry now that he's seen himself on screen as the cynical Roth, the kind of editor who orders a story rewritten because it doesn't fit pictures and headlines prepared in advance? I asked Mr. Wenner about this, and he sounded surprised: "Sorry? It's fun to get all this attention."  Mr. Wenner hasn't exactly been resting in oblivion until now. He was the prototype for a Doonesbury character and was recently featured on the cover of New York magazine. But apparently his appetite for fame, even notoriety, is insatiable. Besides, he claims to like the way he and his magazine are portrayed in "Perfect": "I'm proud of the movie. Plotwise you're dealing with hyper-reality, but the attitude is very good and very accurate, closer to the reality of what magazine journalism is about, much more faithful than any movie I've seen about the press in a long time.
