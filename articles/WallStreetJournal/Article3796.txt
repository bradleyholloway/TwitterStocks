 Oil, Rates and Iraq Keep Stock Indexes On Road to Nowhere   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  Only 1.21 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the fifth-lightest day of the year. Nasdaq trading, at 1.5 billion shares, was the year's sixth-sleepiest. In fact, five of this year's six slowest Nasdaq days have come since the middle of last week.  Crude-oil futures fell 58 cents to $40.92, but remained near Monday's record of $41.55, calming no one's nerves.  "There is so much anxiety in this marketplace about external issues that you see this light volume," said Jay Suskind, head trader at brokerage house Ryan Beck in Florham Park, N.J. "People don't know whether to buy or sell, so you are seeing little of either."
