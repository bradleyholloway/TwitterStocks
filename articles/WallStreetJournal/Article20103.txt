 MarketWatch: Car-Incentive Strategies   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  GM introduced new truck and SUV designs in October; eventually those new models will come with some deals. "The first few months after a redesign enters the U.S. market, we typically see very strong sales without the need for much in incentive spending," Mr. [Jesse Toprak] says. After a few months, "the auto maker needs to go after the mass market," he adds. "We're getting there."  Foreign makers don't usually offer the big cash giveaways that stateside car makers do. "The bulk of the incentives for BMW and other European auto makers tends to be leasing subsidies. You never really hear 'cash back' from BMW or Mercedes-Benz," says Mr. Toprak.  "But if you like a decent combination of choice of vehicles along with relatively high levels of incentives . ..then late summer tends to be the best time. August, September," he says. "That doesn't mean you can't get as good a deal earlier in the year. It just depends on how much homework you do."
