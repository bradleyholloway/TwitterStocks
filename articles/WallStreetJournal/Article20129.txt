 Forex View: Dollar to Face Pressure; Euro May Get Lift As Rate Cut Seen At ECB's Meeting   By Molinski, Dan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2007  The dollar, after hitting a low against the euro in late April, has recovered on improved U.S. data that have reduced the odds of Fed rate cuts this year.  There will be a steady stream of U.S. data for currency investors this week. Highlights include durable-goods and factory orders set for today, which economists are expecting to do well, in line with improved datan on manufacturing and industrial production data. The Institute for Supply Management's services-sector report is expected tomorrow, unit labor costs are due Wednesday, consumer credit is set for Thursday and trade data are due Friday.  U.S. data will play second fiddle this week to the ECB's Wednesday policy meeting. Investors expect the ECB will lift its key lending rate to 4% from 3.75%.
