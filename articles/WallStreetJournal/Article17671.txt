 Underwriting the New Architecture by the Thames   By By Manuela Hoelterhoff, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1986  The underwriters of Lloyd's recently moved into a new building by Richard Rogers that looks like a habitat for the wondrous, spacey worms of "Dune." The building's exterior is a glistening maze of air-conditioning ducts, heating pipes, stuck-on bathroom pods and exterior elevators. You would have to be very jaded indeed to call it boring.  A long stone's throw away, at the Royal Academy, there is more excitement. In this venerable institution, which hasn't had a major architecture exhibition in 40 years, a Lilliputian Lloyd's is spinning slowly in a vitrine surrounded by the most recent projects of Norman Foster, James Stirling and Mr. Rogers. Posters proclaim the British trio's sweeping vision with three huge, menacing pencils dwarfing London.  The RA does not speak with such force or clarity -- the three architects in its show have had their carbuncular moments expurgated for the occasion. The RA gospel of diversity might also have been more forceful had it evangelized for a broader sampling of British architects currently making positive contributions to the inner cities of the realm. Then again, touting Messrs. Rogers, Stirling and Foster has its logic, given their international reputation and the RA's intention to burnish it further. Mr. Foster recently completed a high-tech bank in Hong Kong that is a marvel of engineering and expense ($700 million and counting). Mr. Stirling transformed a lethal site along a Stuttgart highway into a major art museum.
