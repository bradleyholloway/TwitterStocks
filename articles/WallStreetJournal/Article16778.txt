 Gold May Still Be a Shelter Despite Last Month's Drop   By Thomas, Lisa Yuriko, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  "Risk is the topic of the month, as credit spreads are widening and volatility in bond and equity markets are increasing," said Peter Dixon of Commerzbank in London. "If financial assets start to lose their shine, gold could gain because it's seen as the store of wealth."  It is, however, gold's traditional role as an "insurance policy" that has set off the recent decline. "Gold is a source of liquidity" and will be sold in order to meet margin calls in other asset sectors, said Frank Holmes, chief executive of U.S. Global Investors Inc.
