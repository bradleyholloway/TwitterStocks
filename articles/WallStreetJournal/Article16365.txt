 Deals & Deal Makers -- IPO Outlook: The Price, Right? Some IPO Issuers Open Up a Bit   By Hennessey, Raymond, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2004  Over the past few years, nearly every company to file for an initial public offering of stock has left off the number of shares it planned to sell in its deal, as well as the expected price range of the IPO, when it makes its initial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead, they file an estimated amount of proceeds they expect to raise in the deal, solely to help estimate how much in fees the company has to pay to the SEC to hold the IPO.  It has been a vexing issue for IPO analysts and investors. When IPO candidates file to go public without price terms, there's no way to gauge a company's potential valuation, nor do investors accurately know what stakes private-equity investors have in the company prior to the offering. While the initial filing does provide most of the other information that's ultimately in the final prospectus, such as historical financial results, executive compensation and risk factors, none of that information can be viewed through the lens of valuation.  It's not that bankers don't know how much they plan to raise from a given IPO at the time they file the deal. On the contrary, underwriters know precisely where they would like to price a deal, because the expected final price is a critical part of the marketing pitch to secure the banking business from the issuing company in the first place, said Bruce Foerster, head of capital markets of South Beach Capital in Miami.
