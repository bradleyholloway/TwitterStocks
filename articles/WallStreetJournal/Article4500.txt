 Health: Pesticide Risk From Apples: Who's Right?   By By Barbara Rosewicz, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1989  An environmental group warns that preschoolers can face as much as 910 times the acceptable cancer risk from eating chemically treated apple products. The group gets its findings aired on CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" program. And it enlists actress Meryl Streep to appear on the "Today" and "Donahue" shows to talk up the risks of pesticides on apples and other fruits and vegetables.  Apple growers immediately protest. They say a person would have to eat 28,000 pounds of apples a day for 70 years to equal the dose of chemicals that causes cancer in laboratory rats. Makers of applesauce and apple juice say they check for the specific cancer-causing agent, and hardly ever find it.  So how much of a threat is there from apples and the pesticide daminozide? A consensus on the issue is unlikely. Scientific studies raise legitimate concern that a substance known as UDMH, which is produced as daminozide breaks down, can cause cancer. But the truth about the degree of risk probably lies somewhere between the numbers cited on both sides.
