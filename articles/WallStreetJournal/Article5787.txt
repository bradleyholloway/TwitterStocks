 Art & Money   By By Daniel Costello, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1999  Met officials insist the sponsor did not have undue influence; past shows have focused on -- and been sponsored by -- individual designers, while Mr. Hilfiger is sharing the spotlight with other rock fashion designers. Mr. Hilfinger did "help with the exhibit" but "the Met did not cede curatorial control," says Harold Holzer, a museum spokesman, adding that Costume Institute exhibits are chosen each year by its curatorial staff. A spokesperson for Mr. Hilfiger insists the Met controlled the show.  But art world insiders, and representatives of other rock-n-rollers, are crying foul. "It was Tommy's show," says Darlene Lutz, Madonna's art curator. She says the Hilfiger connection went too far. She got an early viewing of "Rock Style"" last Saturday when it was being installed and was surprised to see Hilfiger employees giving a tour to press and V.I.P.s. Tipped off that Madonna's famous 1990 Jean-Paul Gaultier bustier was slated to be displayed next to clothes worn by the Britney Spears, another pop star outfitted by Mr. Hilfiger, Ms. Lutz told a Hilfiger representative that she would remove Madonna's loaned items "in a shopping bag" if that was not rectified. Ms. Spears' costume is now missing and Madonna's costume is right next to Tina Turner's mini-dress. Central billing in the show goes to Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger; Mr. Hilfiger served as corporate sponsor of the recent Rolling Stones "Bridges to Babylon" tour.
