 Another Head Rolls in French Revolution --- Suez Chief Is Latest Victim of Shareholder Activism   By By Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1995  France's wave of shareholder activism claimed a new victim as Cie. de Suez Chairman Gerard Worms resigned in a bid to break the deadlock paralyzing the sprawling holding company.  Mr. Worms thus joins a growing list of prominent French businessmen forced from their jobs in recent weeks by a far-reaching shift in the country's business mores. "The incestuous French system has clearly reached its limits," says Francois Morin, an economics professor at the University of Toulouse.  Just last month, Marc Fournier, the chairman of holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte, was ousted in a swift coup when his main shareholder, Cie. Financiere de Paribas, said it no longer trusted him and teamed up with other shareholders to fire the entire board. Before that, Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel-Alsthom SA, the huge telecommunications, transport and energy group, was forced to resign after being indicted on charges of abuse of corporate funds, contributing to a yearlong plunge in Alcatel's share price. And the chairmen of oil giant Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and auto maker Renault SA were heckled by shareholders' at their annual assemblies. "Now, we notice it when a shareholders' assembly goes well," quips Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen SA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars.
