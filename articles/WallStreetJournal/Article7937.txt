 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Selwyn Feinstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1989  Bloomingdale's in New York says it doesn't need as many extra hands this year because a new commission system -- 4% to 10% of sales -- prompts regulars to work harder. Buffums in Long Beach, Calif., relies on its regulars because it can't find good temporary help. "The work ethic and motivation seem to be missing," it says. Marshalls in Andover, Mass., waits until Thanksgiving to set its hiring plans. Until then, regulars will be asked to do more.  But many retailers press on with holiday hiring. J.C. Penney Co., seeking to add 1,100 workers in the Dallas area alone, carries its help-wanted message in monthly billings to customers. Fedco Inc. in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., plans to boost its staff 15%, the same as in recent years, by recruiting at schools and job fairs. Pier 1 Imports in Dallas expects Christmas employment to swell to 12,000 from 8,500 now.  Of the 74% that don't offer any basic training, however, most don't see any reason to get involved. Nearly half insist they don't hire people who require remedial help. Many beg off by saying they don't have the expertise, it's too expensive or it's somebody else's job. Only a few have tried it and found it didn't work. The findings, says the society, suggest most firms don't see "the basic skills crisis" as their problem yet.
