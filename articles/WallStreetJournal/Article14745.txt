 The Charismatic Path to South African Brotherhood   By Barron, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1990  Nelson Mandela's visit to the U.S. reminded us just how far away from racial reconciliation South Africa remains. In fact, each uncertain step the South African government takes seems only to heighten tension.  Meanwhile, the grass-roots work is being done by a group of Christians without international recognition: South African charismatics. The idea of charismatics having a serious socio-political impact may sound strange to American ears. In this country, charismatic and Pentecostal forms of Christianity have been more associated with emotional worship and speaking in tongues -- and, more recently, with lavish life styles and theme parks.  But in South Africa the results of this enthusiastic form of religious experience have been far different. Not that South Africa's charismatics started out to be political. However, in the South African context, just the act of building large churches where blacks and whites mingle harmoniously is a political statement. And that is exactly what the charismatics have done.
