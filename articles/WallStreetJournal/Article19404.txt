 On Sports: Twin Killing?   By By Stefan Fatsis, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  What isn't clear is whether saying goodbye to some combination of the Twins, Florida Marlins, Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Montreal Expos -- baseball's weakest links -- is a genuine business consideration, a bargaining chip for coming contract talks with the players' union or a new way to bludgeon municipalities into erecting stadiums. You can believe it or not, but MLB officials say they are examining which clubs to buy out, how much to pay and how to disperse players. "Is it an option?" MLB Commissioner Bud Selig says. "It really is."  Still, it's hard to imagine the Twin Cities among the cuttees. Professional baseball has been played in Minneapolis-St. Paul for 117 years, and the Twins won riveting World Series in 1987 and 1991. The Metrodome is so dreary it's hard to blame fans for having stayed away when the team slashed payroll and foundered. But when the Twins do well, they come; the club has had almost as many 20,000-plus gates this spring (eight) as all of last year (11).  If the Twins keep winning, pennant fever might turn the politicians toward a new stadium. If they don't and the ballpark bid dies, ownership may be right to take a face- and money-saving buyout -- if baseball is bold enough to offer one. "If you're [Carl Pohlad] and they dangle $200 million in front of you," reasons infielder Denny Hocking, the Twins' union rep, "you're not going to look like a bad guy."
