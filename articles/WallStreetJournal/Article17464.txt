 Managers Remain Bullish on Eurobonds Linked to Dollars --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1985  European portfolio managers remain bullish on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds despite last week's concerted effort by central banks to sap the dollar's strength.  The authorities' action did inject a note of caution into the Eurobond markets and triggered some profit-taking, but "the fundamental approach to the U.S. by foreigners is unbroken," says Jan Donker, fixed-income portfolio manager for Robeco, the Rotterdam-based investment trust.  Intervention is the only reason for "the current bout of selling" dollars, concurs Rainer Kahrmann, managing director of investment management at European Banking Co. in London. Mr. Kahrmann doesn't think central banks "have the stamina" to prevent the dollar from ultimately stabilizing and going "back to where it was."
