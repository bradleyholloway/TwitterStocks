 Plots & Ploys   By By Peter Grant, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2000  HOW LOFTY are Silicon Valley rents? A few years ago it may have seemed odd for a white shoe law firm like Weil Gotschal & Manges to move its Silicon Valley office from Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park 12 miles away to Redwood Shores. After all, Sand Hill has long been one of Silicon Valley's main drags for venture capital firms and service companies.  That's a bargain compared with the to-the-moon rents on Sand Hill Road. Brokers report that demand from New Economy businesses have propelled some rents above $150 a square foot. "It was a question of getting space at a reasonable price," says Weil Gotschal director of operations John Neary.  Weil Gotschal officials say they're not worried they'll lose prestige by moving off Sand Hill Road, where the firm opened its office in 1991. They note that Silicon Valley has been spreading both north and south as rents have climbed into outer space. "When you first start out, you want to be in the right place," Mr. Neary says. "Now that we're established and successful, it doesn't make that much difference."
