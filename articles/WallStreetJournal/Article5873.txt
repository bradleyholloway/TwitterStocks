 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Francine L. Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2000  Philip Gott, project manager of a Standard & Poor's study of auto makers and parts suppliers, says a 42-volt electrical system should be adopted quickly to help reduce emissions and allow car makers to install more gadgets -- like electrically de-iced windshields. The current 14-volt standard has prevailed in part because the industry hasn't found a way to standardize components in a new system, Mr. Gott says.  About 80% of HMOs and pharmacy-benefit managers offer three-tier co-pay plans, up from 52% in 1998, according to Scott-Levin, a Newtown, Pa., market research firm. For the first tier of generic drugs, consumers were found to have co-pays (or what they have to pay before the insurance kicks in) as high as $15. The second-tier co-pays for brand-name drugs went as high as $25, while co-pays were as high as $50 for third-tier drugs, which ordinarily would not have been covered at all.  BRIEFS: Abraham Lincoln's size-14 ankle boots and Warren Harding's Victorian-era spats will be in shoe seller Johnston & Murphy's display of handcrafted presidential shoes at the Democratic National Convention. . . . Among the festivities at the annual garlic and herb festival scheduled for Sept. 2 in Wilmington, Vt., is "garlic golf."
