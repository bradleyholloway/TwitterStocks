 Ashland Oil Proposes Stock Buyback, Other Steps to Enhance Value of Shares   By By Seth H. Lubove, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1986  Ashland Oil Inc. announced a series of moves -- including the buyback of as much as 23% of its common stock -- aimed at enhancing the value of its stock.  The new steps, which also include the formation of an employee stock ownership plan and the possible sale of assets, came amid charges by the company that the Belzbergs may have misrepresented themselves in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday. In the SEC disclosure, the Belzbergs said they would sell their stock back to the company only on the condition that Ashland "provide value to all shareholders" through, among other things, the stock buyback plan.  A source close to the Belzbergs who asked not to be identified said that Ashland's charge was "just an absolute out-and-out lie." The source added: "The terms of what they were going to do for everyone else were laid out in advance and promised to us. They went a little beyond what we asked for, but the terms were an integral part of the deal" in which Ashland was to buy back the Belzbergs' shares.
