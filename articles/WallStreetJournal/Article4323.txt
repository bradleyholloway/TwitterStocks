 Tokheim to Post Rise In Its 3rd-Period Net, Less Than Expected   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1987  FORT WAYNE, Ind. -- Tokheim Corp. said it expects to report that fiscal third-quarter earnings fell below analysts' projections, but were "significantly" higher than year-earlier net income of $400,000, or six cents a share.  The company, which makes systems to move and measure liquids, said earnings for the quarter ended Aug. 31 were hurt by delays associated with its new line of fuel dispensers.
