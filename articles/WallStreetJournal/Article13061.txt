 Morgan Stanley Is Focus of Trial On Gender Bias   By Kate Kelly and Colleen DeBaise, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2004  Among them: Katherine Romanelli, who the EEOC says endured workplace striptease shows and breast-shaped birthday cakes as a Morgan Stanley trader. If she is called, the EEOC adds, Ms. Romanelli will testify that women had to work longer hours to prove themselves and that men with resumes similar to hers routinely were promoted over her, including some she had trained. The EEOC lawyer representing Ms. Romanelli says her client didn't want to comment. The Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to discuss potential testimony.  The Morgan Stanley case began with an EEOC gender-bias complaint involving a former institutional-equities employee, Allison Schieffelin, who accused her bosses of refusing to promote her because of her gender and of sexist comments and conduct, including men-only golf games and strip-club outings for clients. Ms. Schieffelin and the EEOC contend she was fired in retaliation for her complaints in 2000. Morgan Stanley says she was terminated after a heated disagreement with her boss, another woman, for being "verbally abusive and insubordinate."  A Morgan Stanley executive said in a deposition that employees were told not to entertain at strip clubs. At a meeting of the institutional-equity division's managing directors in early 1998, a top executive, Vikram Pandit, "reinforced the fact that client events that involved strip clubs were inappropriate and should not take place," Bruce Cohen, a Morgan Stanley human-resources official, testified. It is unclear from court records whether male Morgan Stanley employees continued entertaining at strip clubs.
