 Trump Settles Lawsuit by U.S. For $750,000   By By James C. Hyatt, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1988  Investor Donald J. Trump said he agreed to settle for $750,000 a government civil suit alleging violation of federal takeover restrictions for unreported purchases of stock options in 1986.  The government had taken the position that purchase of options required a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and the Federal Trade Commission had asked the Justice Department to file the suit.  Mr. Trump said, "I firmly believe that I was in full compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting requirements. The most respected lawyers in the business looked at the exemption for options and advised me that when the government says options are exempt, it means options are exempt." He said Bear, Stearns & Co. "also gave me the same assurance. I assume Bear Stearns will reimburse me for this expense."
