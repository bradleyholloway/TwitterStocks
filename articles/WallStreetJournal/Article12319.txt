 First Computer Test Is Approved For Initial Pap-Smear Screening   By By Rochelle Sharpe, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1998  The Food and Drug Administration yesterday approved the first automated device for initial testing of Pap-smear slides. Until now, computers have been used only to rescreen Pap smears that were evaluated first by a human technician. Each year, about 60 million Papsmear tests are conducted to identify potentially cancerous abnormalities.  The machine will categorize all the Pap-smear slides according to what it finds. Scientists estimate that 25% of all Pap tests are negative, and those slides don't need to be examined by a technician. The remaining 75% will be studied by a cytotechnologist, who will refer all obvious abnormalities to a specialist. Suspicious Pap-smear slides that aren't sent for referral will be studied again in the lab.
