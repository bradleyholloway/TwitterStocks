 Off the Beaten Track / Providence   By Schechner, Sam, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2006  Where to eat: For decades, Providence's biggest attraction has been its adventurous cuisine -- from the classic Italian-American restaurants on Federal Hill to the upscale trattoria fare of Al Forno (577 South Main St., Tel. 401-273-9760, www.alforno.com), which is still widely regarded by locals as the city's best restaurant. But there are other favorites, too, including the XO Steak House (125 North Main St., Tel. 401-273-9090, www.xocafe.com) and the New England-European fusion of New Rivers (7 Steeple St., Tel. 401-751- 0350, www.newriversrestaurant.com). Meanwhile, the west side of the city is experiencing a culinary renaissance. Tucked near a music- supply shop and a bridal boutique, the tiny Nick's On Broadway looks like a greasy spoon, but its dinner menu includes nouvelle cuisine specialties like pine nut-crusted Atlantic salmon (259 Broadway, Tel. 401-421-0286).
