 On Sports: Old Masters   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2000  AUGUSTA, Ga. -- The death of Gene Sarazen last year, at age 97, reduced golf's most-famous threesome to a twosome, but the group's remaining members, Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, carried on here at about eight o'clock yesterday morning, hitting their ceremonial tee shots down the first fairway at the Augusta National Golf Club to begin another Masters Tournament.  I stood in the dew to watch them and can report that both men performed their task admirably. Mr. Nelson is 88 years old and has had a hip replaced, but put his shot down the left side of the fairway, about 130 yards out. Mr. Snead is four months Mr. Nelson's junior, so it was fitting that his drive, down the right side, was longer, by about 30 yards.  They've been saying that about Mr. Snead's shots longer than about those of any other man. A few may have played the humbling game better than the jaunty, straw-hatted fellow from Hot Springs, Va., for various periods, but no one played it as well for as long. When God decided what He wanted a golf swing to look like, he sent Sam Snead down to show us. He's kept him at it for all these years so as many people as possible could get a look.
