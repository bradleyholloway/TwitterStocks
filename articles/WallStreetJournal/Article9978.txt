 Palestinian Shares Mirror Woes; Some Investors See Upside After Instability Pummels Key Index   By Toth, Sara, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2006  Mr. [Hasan Abu-Libdeh] hopes to attract investors like Mr. [Hawamdeh]. "We are an emerging market and there is huge room for growth here," says Mr. Abu-Libdeh, an American-trained statistician who was cabinet director of former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei. "People are just waiting" for an end to the aid boycott imposed by the international community, he says. The boycott was imposed after militant Islamic group Hamas won a parliamentary majority in Jan. 26 elections.  Money poured in from Palestinians abroad as well as from Persian Gulf states looking to invest oil profits in new markets, local economists say. HSBC Holdings became a custodian to handle transactions from overseas, a role it still has. Ordinary Palestinians also discovered the market, many becoming brokers for their friends. "Everybody was very happy and the stock market went crazy," says Mr. Abu-Libdeh.  Arie Arnon, an economics professor at Israel's Ben Gurion University of the Negev, says that in an area with so much poverty and a barely functioning government that isn't recognized by the Western world, "it's hard to believe the stock exchange will survive."
