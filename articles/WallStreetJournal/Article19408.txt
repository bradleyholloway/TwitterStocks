 Boom Town: Hollywood Chief Sees a Way Out of Dot-Com Fog --- Barry Diller Says the Future Is All About Synergies, And He's Looking at Some   By By Kara Swisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2001  Mr. [Barry Diller] says he still thinks his aborted Lycos deal was a good idea because it focused on online transactional models. That has been his main strategy with other online properties, including controlling stakes in several companies: ticketing giant Ticketmaster, Hotel Reservations Network, the online arm of Home Shopping Network, e-tailing enabler Styleclick.com, the Match.com personal ad business and the local CitySearch Web guides. (USA's other, more powerful parts include cable channels such as USA Network and Sci-Fi and other television-production arms, as well as Home Shopping Network and a massive customer-service and commerce fulfillment organization.)  Still, many have long wondered whether Mr. Diller can get those online parts ticking with enough power. "He lacks a single unifying center to pull it all together, or give him enough heavy-duty distribution or marketing power to jump-start what he has," notes one major online executive, who declined to be identified, echoing a typical criticism of Mr. Diller's online forays. "For someone with the large ambitions of Barry, it still feels very small."  One of the possible deals, say sources, would be for Mr. Diller to use his interactive and customer-service infrastructure to take over the online shopping area that's now part of the Microsoft Network, such as its Expedia travel service and Carpoint auto-buying site. Another, more intriguing idea being bandied about by some involves Mr. Diller combining USA with Yahoo, the most troubled of the large online companies. Mr. Diller is close to Yahoo's key players. And one of his own major investors, Vivendi Universal SA, recently struck a music-licensing deal with Yahoo and is eager for more such alliances for its other entertainment offerings.
