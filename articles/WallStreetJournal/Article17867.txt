 House Votes To Impeach Florida Judge --- Hastings Faces Senate Trial On Conspiracy Charges He Beat in 1983 Ruling   By By Jill Abramson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1988  A solemn House of Representatives voted to impeach federal District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida for high crimes and misdemeanors.  The House approved 17 articles of impeachment against Judge Hastings by an overwhelming 413-3 vote. He now faces trial in the Senate, the last step in the complex and rarely invoked process. If convicted by a two-thirds majority, he will be removed from the bench, becoming the sixth federal judge in U.S. history to be unseated by the Senate.  The central charge against Judge Hastings is that he conspired with Washington attorney William Borders to obtain a $150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge, in return for leniency. Mr. Borders was convicted for his role in the alleged scheme in March 1982. Judge Hastings was acquitted the following December.
