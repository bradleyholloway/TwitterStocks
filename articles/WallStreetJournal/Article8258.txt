 International Business Machines   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1992  On Jul 6, 1992, IBM Corp settled a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by Bernard C. Duse Jr, an employee fired by IBM eight years ago. Duse charged that IBM denied him a promotion because he was black and then the company responded to his allegations by getting a female employee to falsely accuse him of sexual harassment, which ultimately led to his dismissal in 1984. Both sides were barred from disclosing the terms of the settlement.
