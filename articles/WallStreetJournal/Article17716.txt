 An Appraisal: Corporate Earnings Supply Something to Cheer About   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1987  Among the biggest -- and most richly rewarded -- recent earnings surprises was Ford Motor's booming $5.37 a share earned in the March quarter, when most Wall Street analysts were expecting less than $4 a share. Between last Tuesday, the day before Ford released the figures, and Friday's close, its stock price leaped 16 1/4, or nearly 20%, to 98.  Even some companies with earnings declines in the quarter, such as International Business Machines, provided a pleasant surprise. Big Blue's per-share earnings fell 21.2% to $1.30 in the period, but some analysts had expected only $1 a share.  According to Merrill Lynch analysts, S&P earnings should rise 20% this year, the largest annual increase since 1976 corporate profits soared 24% above their 1975 level. The economists at the firm project consecutive earnings advances in the next 11 quarters, too, in the longest advance since the 4 1/2-year string of consecutive quarterly earnings rises in the last half of the 1970s. Morgan Stanley is estimating a 22% gain in S&P 500 companies' profits this year.
