 Law-Enforcement Agencies in U.S., U.K. Vie for Credit in Bank of New York Case   By By David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1999  The Bank of New York case isn't even close to being finished, but already law-enforcement agencies involved are fighting over who broke the case and whether it was mishandled in its early stages.  The main target of the finger-pointing has been the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is being accused privately by United Kingdom law-enforcement authorities and some officials at the U.S. State Department of moving too slowly on the case after London brought it to the bureau's attention. British authorities also are upset about the small number of FBI agents dedicated to the case, people familiar with the matter say.
