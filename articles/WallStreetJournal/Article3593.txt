 Leading the News: Tyco Shareholders Plan Proxy Fight To Oust Directors   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2002  British businessman Michael Ashcroft, a Tyco director, already is promoting a plan that would have nine of Tyco's 11 board members step down by the annual meeting -- leaving only those appointed after the departure of former Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski in June. (The two are Mr. [Edward D. Breen] and former DuPont Co. CEO John A. Krol, who came on board after Mr. Breen joined Tyco this month.) Mr. Kozlowski has pleaded not guilty to charges of tax evasion.  Mr. [Ralph Whitworth] said he and representatives of four other institutional stockholders, owners of about 16% of Tyco's roughly two billion shares outstanding, lobbied Mr. Breen to replace the old regime's board members during a New York meeting on his first day as Tyco CEO. Mr. Whitworth said he subsequently alerted Mr. Breen about the possible proxy fight and suggested several potential board candidates. Among them: Jerome York, a former Chrysler Corp. finance chief who is chairman and CEO of MicroWarehouse Inc. Mr. York couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.  Other forces may make the proxy fight unnecessary. Tyco has been reeling since the indictment of Mr. Kozlowski. Subsequent disclosures of financial dealings between some board members and the company and lavish perks for Tyco executives also have soured investors on the company. Tyco shares rose 85 cents to $15.35 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but well below its 52-week high of $60.09.
