 Hollywood Journal: And Now for Something Completely Disgusting --- Studios Seek Higher Grosses By Making Films Grosser; Jim Carrey Drops Pants   By By Tom King, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2000  In the upcoming flick "Road Trip," a frisky grandpa sporting a certain enlarged appendage inadvertently knocks over a porcelain figurine. In "Me, Myself & Irene," the latest from "There's Something About Mary" creators Peter and Bobby Farrelly, Jim Carrey drops his drawers and prepares to defecate on his neighbor's lawn. People who've seen the film say it makes "Mary" look like "The Sound of Music."  Profits can be huge because these films are usually made with budgets as low as their sense of humor. For example, if it hits big, "Road Trip," produced by DreamWorks SKG and Montecito Picture Co., could potentially chart profits that approach those of DreamWorks' expected blockbuster "Gladiator," which opens today. The reason: "Road Trip" cost just under $16 million to produce, a fraction of the $100 million cost of "Gladiator."  "Crudeness done properly sometimes makes us laugh," says Ivan Reitman, who along with former MCA movie-studio chief Tom Pollock serves as executive producer of "Road Trip." "But if you go overboard, the audience gets turned off." Mr. Reitman says the movie, which is about four hormone-charged college guys taking a cross-country trip, works because it gets the audience "emotionally involved." Among its "emotionally involving" scenes: One boy loses his virginity to an overweight woman; another solves the gang's financial crisis by making a sale at a sperm bank.
