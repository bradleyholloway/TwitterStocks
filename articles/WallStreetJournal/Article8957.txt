 Sony Names Stringer Studio Chairman In Move to Let Calley Focus on Films   By By John Lippman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1998  CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Sony Corp. of America President Howard Stringer will take on the additional title of chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., a move designed to allow the head of the entertainment unit to spend more time developing and making movies.  Both companies are units of Japan's Sony Corp., and Mr. Stringer, 56 years old, has been the consumer electronic giant's designated strategist in the U.S. He will now assume many of the technology duties previously held by John Calley, 67, who was promoted yesterday to chief executive of the entertainment unit.  Additionally, Robert J. Wynne, 55, who had been co-president of Sony Pictures, got the additional title of chief operating officer, and also assumed some of Mr. Calley's duties. Despite the fact that many of his duties have now been assumed by two other executives, Mr. Calley said he welcomes the opportunity to more narrowly focus his job. The chief executive position at Sony Pictures had been vacant since Peter Guber was ousted as head of the studio in 1994.
