 Kodak's Loss Narrows As Spending, Costs Drop   By Bulkeley, William M, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2007  Matthew Troy, an analyst with Citigroup, noted that last week some investors bought Kodak when there was speculation of a leveraged buyout, and he said they might have decided to sell when nothing more developed and Kodak nixed a big dividend. Mr. Troy said Kodak is "a second-half and 2008 story," and the first quarter results don't change that outlook.  Sales in Kodak's digital consumer group, including digital cameras, printers and retail printing as well as its online Kodak Gallery, fell 14% to $778 million in the quarter. The drop reflected Kodak's decision in the second quarter last year to stop making very low-end digital cameras and a decline in printing of snapshots. Kodak's loss from consumer digital narrowed to $114 million, reflecting reduced overhead costs.
