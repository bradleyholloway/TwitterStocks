 Mideast Summit Is Dire Triage --- Meeting of Albright With Arafat, Barak Aims to Halt Killing   By By Neil King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  The events have sparked predictable recriminations by both sides. Mr. [Ehud Barak] accused Mr. [Yasser Arafat] yesterday of inciting the violence. Meantime, the Palestinian leader demanded an investigation into alleged abuses by Israeli security forces; adding fuel to those allegations was the acknowledgement yesterday by a senior Israeli army commander that a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who died in his father's arms last week -- as television cameras looked on -- was killed by Israeli fire.  The visit by Mr. [Ariel Sharon] last week to the site known by Jews as the Temple Mount was widely seen as a provocative statement about who should control the holy city of Jerusalem, a key sticking point in the long-running peace talks. But the rage it sparked among Palestinians and Arab-Israelis is fueled as well by grim economic prospects and frustration over how little has changed despite years of international diplomacy aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
