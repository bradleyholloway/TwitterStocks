 Kerry Amplifies His Iraq Criticism   By Murray, Shailagh, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2004  Mr. Bush accused Mr. Kerry of "new contradictions of his old positions on Iraq." The president is expected to defend his administration's Iraq record in a speech this morning in New York before the United Nations General Assembly. The president also is expected to stress U.S. initiatives to curb the spread of AIDS and combat poverty abroad.  Mr. Kerry seized on the president's recent acknowledgment of a "miscalculation of what the conditions would be" in postwar Iraq. "This is one of the greatest understatements in recent American history," Mr. Kerry said. "His were not the equivalent of accounting errors. They were colossal failures in judgment."  "Is he really saying to Americans that if we had known there were no imminent threat, no weapons of mass destruction, no ties to al Qaeda, the United States should have invaded Iraq?" Mr. Kerry said. "My answer is resoundingly no."
