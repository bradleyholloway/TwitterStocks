 Boggs Named Chief At De Havilland To Sell Company   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1985  The Canadian government named William Boggs chairman and chief executive officer of de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. and asked him to prepare the eventual sale of the government-owned aircraft maker.  Sinclair Stevens, Canada's minister of industry who announced Mr. Boggs's appointment, said the new de Havilland chief executive will try to strengthen the company to "increase its attractiveness" to potential buyers. De Havilland, which is based in Toronto, produces commuter and transport aircraft.  Mr. Stevens said the government would welcome proposals from foreign concerns for the two aircraft companies. But Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said recently that "there are no groups or great numbers of companies or corporations, either Canadian or foreign, lining up to buy" de Havilland and Canadair. Government sources, however, said they have received numerous inquiries.
