 McDonald's, Faced With Competition On Prices, Plans Program of Discounts   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1989  OAK BROOK, Ill. -- McDonald's Corp., which generally opposes discounting, plans to offer more bargains amid a barrage of 99-cent specials from fast-food competitors.  "We're turning up the flame" with a variety of plans, McDonald's marketing chief Paul Schrage told the analysts. But he said the discounting would be disguised so customers didn't come in simply because Mcdonald's was offering cheap food. Rather than marking down menu prices, the chain would offer coupons giving patrons a discount on certain items -- hopefully on their next visit.  McDonald's looks on discounting as it does dirty tables: It erodes brand loyalty, hurts the bottom line and adds little to the company's long-term prosperity. But lately discounters led by competitor PepsiCo Inc.'s three chains -- Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken -- have chomped into McDonald's customer counts.
