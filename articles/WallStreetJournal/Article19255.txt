 Glaxo, SmithKline Add 12 Executives To Merged Lineup   By By Stephen D. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2000  Analysts said that at least so far, competition for jobs seems free from the rancor that infected the earlier merger plan. When the latest nuptials were unveiled in mid-January, the companies said Glaxo's powerful chairman, Sir Richard Sykes, would inherit a somewhat reduced role as nonexecutive chairman at the new, combined Glaxo SmithKline. At the same time, five top executive appointments were made, with SmithKline's Jean-Pierre Garnier landing the post of chief executive, and Tadataka Yamada research director. Glaxo's John Coombe was named chief financial officer, Robert Ingram chief operating officer, and James Niedel chief science and technology officer.
