 Jordan's Puts Imax in Its Furniture Picture --- `Shoppertainment' Pioneer Pushes Envelope With Theater in Midst of Product Displays   By By Manjari Raman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2002  [Jordan]'s was a pioneer in using entertainment, free snacks and other attractions to create traffic for retail furniture outlets. The formula -- Jordan's calls it "shoppertainment" -- has helped make Jordan's four stores among the most productive in retailing, with $950 in sales per square foot versus the furniture sector's median of $254, according to industry publication Furniture Today. In 1999, the success story caught the sharp eye of Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought Jordan's to add to its far-flung assets.  Jordan's Imax screen is half the size of a football field and features 12,000-watt digital sound. Moviegoers wear large, yellow-rimmed goggles -- and sit in seats that vibrate. "If there's an avalanche on screen, you feel it," says Nicholas J. Yates, Jordan's Imax director.  The Tatelmans won't say precisely what they spent to build the theater, but similarly outfitted Imaxes go for $4 million to $8 million. While there are two other Imax theaters in nearby Boston, the Tatelmans say there is plenty of room in town for another Imax. They have lined up a past Imax blockbuster, "Everest," plus Disney's revamped animated classic "Fantasia/2000" and other fare.
