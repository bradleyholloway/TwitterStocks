 Morgenstern on Film -- Review: Pow! Bam! 'Watchmen' Batters Public --- 'Everlasting Moments' puts tale of young photographer in exquisite focus   By Morgenstern, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2009  The story starts with the brutal murder of a brutish antihero called "The Comedian," then quickly turns into a paranoid thriller as a crazed vigilante, Rorschach, searches for the killer and uncovers an apocalyptic plot. Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl (don't blame Mr. Wilson, who actually does some acting); Malin Akerman's statuesque Silk Spectre ("Omigod," she chirps during that interlude, "we're on Mars!"); Matthew Goode's supersmart Ozymandias (he gets smart-alecky lines like "I'm not a comic-book villain") and Billy Crudup's godlike Dr. Manhattan (the only one who possesses true superpowers, and the only one displayed in slightly abstracted frontal nudity, though who cares because he's detached from humanity).
