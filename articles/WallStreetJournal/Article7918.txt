 S&L law's language on capital rules has left officials split on what it says   By Thomas, Paulette, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1989  Disagreement among banking experts regarding the capital requirements legislated by the House and Senate as a part of the savings and loan "bailout law" has the thrift industry in a virtual standstill. The intent of the new law was to link capital requirements to lending risk. Confusion lies with the "core capital" or "leveraged ratio" required. Because of differing interpretations of banking terms, some believe this standard should equal three percent of assets, while others read a five or six percent requirement. Meanwhile, although the law encourages mergers between banks and thrifts, few buyers will move in that direction until the law has been clarified.
