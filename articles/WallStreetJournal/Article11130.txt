 Hydro-Quebec Issues Report on Blackout In Quebec in April   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1988  Hydro-Quebec said a massive power failure in Quebec on April 18 was caused in part by a "loose contact" in a piece of equipment at the utility's operations center in Montreal.  In a report on the blackout, which lasted as long as eight hours in parts of the province, the provincially owned utility said the power failure originated at the Arnaud substation in northeastern Quebec, which was hit by a severe snowstorm.
