 Taxing Net Commerce: Devil Is in the Details --- One Problem: Where Does A Sale Take Place?   By By Thomas E. Weber, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1996  Some cities already have moved to tax Internet access itself, stirring ire among consumers and businesses. Meanwhile, accountants and tax officials across the country are struggling with the question of how to apply sales taxes to goods and services sold on-line. And national governments fret about the potential for international tax evasion on the borderless Internet.  One of the most sweeping, yet unseen, taxes could emerge out of a confrontation taking shape in Washington. The Baby Bells, which now charge line-access fees to long-distance companies (adding up to about 45 cents for every dollar of a long-distance call), want to slap similar fees on Internet-access companies. The Internet industry, needless to say, is opposed to this charge, which some have dubbed a "modem tax." The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates such charges, is reviewing the situation.  "The city suddenly decided it would interpret the ordinance to include us," says Bill Ward, president of Front Range Internet Inc., which sells connections to the Internet through dial-up and dedicated phone lines in Fort Collins. Now Front Range must collect a 3% sales tax from its customers, on top of the $20 monthly fee it charges for basic Internet access. But competitors based outside the city aren't collecting the tax, potentially giving them a price advantage.
