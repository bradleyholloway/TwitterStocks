 CD Roundup: Soul With a Foreign Accent   By Johnson, Martin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  Si*Se was started in 2000 by two New Yorkers, DJ/vocalist Carol C. and DJ/producer U.F. Low. They shared eclectic musical tastes and a special passion for soul, electronica, Latin and Arabic music. Their blend quickly proved popular, and their self-titled 2001 recording received solid reviews, particularly for their cover of Oran "Juice" Jones's 1986 hit, "The Rain." Although that disc was appealing in parts, the disparate elements -- flamenco guitar, dance music beats, Arabic singing, Latin-tinged string work, and classic soul song stylings -- didn't always mesh well.  In the mid-'90s, Morcheeba, a trio from London, released two of the most beautifully restrained, soulful discs of the decade -- "Who Can You Trust" and "Big Calm" (both Sire) -- then lost their way. Looking for a new sound, they tried disco and sounded cheesy and derivative, then doubled back to their older sound, which no longer sounded like a good fit. With their latest disc, they have arrived at a more workable fusion: It's a soulful spin on a mix of '60s psychedelic rock and classic Burt Bacharach-sounding pop. Daisey Martey replaces vocalist Skye Edwards in the group, and she delivers the lyrics with just enough sly wit to maintain the group's personality. Although they are presenting a new sound, it plays to all their old strengths -- the songs, particularly "Everybody Loves a Loser" and "Daylight Robbery," feature sturdy melodies.
