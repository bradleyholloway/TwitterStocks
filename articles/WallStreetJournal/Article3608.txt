 Small-Stock Focus: Reverse Stock Splits Find Favor, Despite Pitfalls   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2002  So far this year, 114 Nasdaq Stock Market issues have conducted reverse splits, topping the 109 total for all of 2001. On the New York Stock Exchange, where listing requirements lean toward larger-capitalization, nontech stocks, 10 companies had completed reverse stock splits through the end of September, on pace to meet or exceed last year's total of 14. The average reverse split is a 1-for-10 move, up from the 1-for-7 average last year.  In fact, some stocks could have avoided their current dilemma if they hadn't been so aggressive about splitting their stocks in the past, a move that lowers share prices. For example small-cap Commerce One, which recently completed a 1-for-10 reverse split, would currently be trading for about $20 if it hadn't engaged in two stock splits during the height of the stock-market boom. The same is true for Broadvision, which conducted a 1-for-9 reverse split, but whose shares would be at $13.50 if the company hadn't previously conducted two stock splits.  Tires were the day's worst performers, continuing to lose traction over concerns about poor auto demand. Cooper Tire & Rubber (NYSE) lost 4.9%, or 65 cents, to 12.65 and a 3.5%, or 30 cent, drop to 8.37 was marked by Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NYSE), now a small-cap stock according to this column's definition of having a market capitalization below $1.5 billion.
