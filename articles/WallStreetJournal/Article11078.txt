 Merger maneuvers   By Bailey, Jeff, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1988  Large banks are increasingly facing the threat of hostile takeovers if their stock prices fall too low.

First Chicago Corp. is considering breaking itself up and selling its various components in order to avoid a hostile takeover, although this policy is opposed by many within the bank.
