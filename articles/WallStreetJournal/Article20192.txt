 EuroLinks Daily View: Reuters Deal Increases Thomson's Exposure Online edition  By Connolly, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2007  Information provider Thomson Corp.'s acquisition of Reuters Group PLC will increase Thomson's exposure to the financial markets, with about 60% of the combined company's revenue coming from the sale of financial information, up from 30% of Thomson's revenue now. But the widespread effects of the credit crisis through Europe and the U.S. could take a toll on Reuters's results.  As [Read Aaron O. Patrick] reports, Reuters's earnings were rising strongly when it accepted Thomson's offer, but Reuters Chief Executive Tom Glocer sounded a warning last month, saying sales in the next two years could be hit by market turbulence. If the Reuters business goes into a downturn, Thomson's share price would likely suffer. Reuters was hurt badly by the last U.S. recession, when revenue fell 17% to GBP 3.24 billion in 2003 from GBP 3.89 billion in 2001.  PUTIN NO SHOW: After United Russia's smashing victory in Russia's national parliamentary elections Sunday, President Vladimir Putin didn't even bother to show up at the party's campaign headquarters to congratulate his comrades, writes Michael McFaul in a commentary on our opinion pages. In some capacity, he writes, United Russia will remain an instrument of Mr. Putin's political power, but the organization is unlikely to assume the normal party functions of drafting legislation, debating national issues or serving constituents. The weakening of these three political institutions, he says, follows a strategy of deinstitutionalization that Putin has implemented since the very beginning of his presidency.
