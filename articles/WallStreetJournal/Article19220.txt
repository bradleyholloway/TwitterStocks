 Vince Gill: Proof That Nice Guys Last   By By Earle Hitchner, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1999  No other country performer has won more Grammys (13) or Country Music Association awards (18) than Vince Gill. Yet the 42-year-old singer professes he has no idea why Barbra Streisand called him to record "If You Ever Leave Me," a stunning new duet that has already become the highest-charted country song she's ever released.  The musical turf traversed by Vince Gill over the years runs wide. Born in Norman, Okla., and raised in Oklahoma City, he began as a rock-'n'-roller in high school. One of the bands Gill played in, Mountain Smoke, combined bluegrass, Western swing, country, pop and rock. Their most bizarre concert was opening for the tongue-flapping metal band Kiss at Oklahoma City's Civic Center. "The audience had their faces painted, and they wanted the music loud and hard, and we had none of that to offer," Gill recalled. "They were throwing beers and anything they could get their hands on."  Unfazed by that fiasco, Gill moved after high school to Kentucky, where he played in two bluegrass bands, Bluegrass Alliance and Boone Creek, and a country swing band, Lazy River. In 1976, fiddler Byron Berline invited Gill to sing lead and play guitar for his progressive bluegrass band Sundance in Los Angeles. The time Gill spent there was exhilarating. "I saw Bonnie Raitt and guitarists like Lee Ritenour, Larry Carlton, George Benson and Robben Ford. The music was on fire in L.A. back then."
