 Calculated Offer: Why AT&T Wants To Fight for NCR Despite Rejected Bid --- Target Is Big Enough to Bring Critical Mass in Computers And Shares Strategic Goals --- Other Ventures Have Failed   By By John J. Keller, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1990  From a plodding, conservative company whose stock was recommended for widows and orphans, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has turned into an aggressive predator. The telecommunications giant, in making a hostile bid for NCR Corp., is betting $6.03 billion against NCR's disdain and a dismal history of mergers in the computer industry.  The bid marks AT&T's confession of failure in its own computer business, which it would essentially hand over to a merged NCR to keep or scrap as NCR executives see fit. AT&T computer losses, which the company once predicted would end last year, now are projected to stretch through 1991. It had become increasingly clear, AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen said yesterday, that computer operations "weren't going to reach critical mass in time to be a significant player."  From a marketing standpoint, analysts say that capturing NCR would at last promote the U.S. phone giant from the bush leagues in the European computer industry. NCR is one of the longest-established U.S. companies in Europe, having begun selling cash registers in Liverpool, England, in 1885. Today, it is the Continent's ninth-largest computer vendor, according to International Data Corp., a market-research firm. In Europe, NCR claims to be the market leader in supplying automated bank-teller machines and check-processing equipment.
