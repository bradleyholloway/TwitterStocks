 Nashville Businesses Urge INS to Open Tenn. Field Office   By By Will Pinkston, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2000  A decade ago, the Memphis and Nashville metro areas each had around one million people, according to the Census Bureau, but by 1998 Nashville had pulled ahead with an estimated 1.15 million people, compared with 1.09 million for Memphis. Nashville's immigrant population may be over 85,000, half of them believed to be Hispanics, according to local estimates. There are similar estimates in Memphis, but until new census data are available, there are no reliable numbers to persuade the INS to open a new office. An INS spokesman says he isn't aware of plans for one.
