 Moving On: Accused but Not Convicted: Removing The Blemish After Being Tied to Scandal   By By Jeffrey Zaslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  At Pennsylvania State University, accounting professor Steven Huddart teaches students about Joseph Jett, a bond trader who in 1994 denied accusations that he generated phony profits of $350 million. Never charged criminally, Mr. Jett now runs a hedge fund.  "His story is a good parable for business life today," says Prof. Huddart. Studying the case, students differ on whether Mr. Jett abused the system or was a scapegoat for a shoddy corporate culture. (Mr. Jett didn't return calls seeking comment.)  Laurie Malone, who was a sales director for Enron Energy Services, often traveled for work. Her toddler son would point to planes and say, "Mommy go Enron!" After the scandal broke, she agreed to go on local TV in her hometown of Cincinnati to talk about the company's collapse. But now, when people recognize her and call her "the Enron lady," she cringes. "There are people who characterize everyone at Enron as being of a certain ilk," she says.
