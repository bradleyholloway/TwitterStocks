 Productivity Increased 2.7% In 3rd Quarter --- Labor Costs Barely Budged, A Sign That Inflationary Pressures Were Muted   By By Christopher Georges, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1994  Productivity rose in the third quarter, while inflationary pressures remained mild.  The Labor Department reported that productivity of non-farm businesses, or output per hour of work, rose at a 2.7% annual rate from July through September. The increase marks a turnaround from the second quarter, when productivity dropped at a 2.1% rate.  But the third-quarter improvement included a barely perceptible 0.1% annual rate of increase in unit labor costs. Because labor represents about two-thirds of the cost of a product, the report suggested inflationary pressures remained muted last summer.
