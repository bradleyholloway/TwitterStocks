 Leading the News: Tenet Stock Drops Amid Scrutiny Of Raid, High Medicare Payments   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2002  After failing to inform investors of the raid until the day after it took place, Mr. [Jeffrey Barbakow] Friday sought to reassure Tenet shareholders in a 2 1/2-hour conference call. He said there isn't any reason to believe the raid is "anything other than an isolated instance" involving two physicians who are accused of wrongdoing at a single hospital. He also promised to disclose more data this week to convince skeptics that there isn't anything improper about Tenet's success at getting so-called outlier payments from Medicare. Outlier payments are designed to defray losses suffered by hospitals whose patients' care exceeds fixed reimbursements.  The unanswered questions are disturbing and could signal more trouble ahead for the Santa Barbara, Calif., company. In recent earnings reports, Tenet has crowed about the success of its strategy to build up its specialized cardiology, neurology and orthopedic services. Those services would seem to generate the high outlier payments that Tenet receives from Medicare. But when asked for data to show the financial strength of those services, or to discuss the number of patients whose cases have resulted in such payments, Tenet hasn't thus far responded.  People are suddenly listening more closely to Tenet's critics, and taking them more seriously. Recently, the company has come under fire from labor unions and a consumer activist who has claimed that Tenet bilks patients who don't have insurance coverage. Tenet nurses, who plan to strike today in San Francisco, have also complained about Mr. Barbakow's compensation, which this year included $111 million from the exercise of stock options.
