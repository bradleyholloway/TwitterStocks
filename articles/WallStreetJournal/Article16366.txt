 Domino Effect: The Unintended Results Of Telling Off Customer-Service Staff   By Shellenbarger, Sue, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2004  The woman's name was Jane, and she began by "ranting and raving" over some charges on her credit card, says Ms. [Erin Calabrese], then a telephone customer-service representative in Tampa, Fla., for a financial-services concern. "Your g- d- company, who do you think you are?" Jane shrieked. Ms. Calabrese tried to offer a refund. But Jane wouldn't listen and called Ms. Calabrese an idiot. Sweating after nearly 10 minutes of this, her voice cracking, Ms. Calabrese handed the phone to her supervisor and left the room.  The damage didn't end there. Ms. Calabrese took her stress straight home with her that night -- and started a fight with her roommate. A passing remark over an unpaid bill drew Ms. Calabrese into "an all-out battle." After the abuse at work, Ms. Calabrese says, the remark "was adding insult to injury. I just blew up."  She was trained to stay calm and faced a supervisor's reprimand if she didn't. "Sometimes you'd finish a call and you'd want to smash somebody's face," she says. "I had no escape, no way of releasing" the tension. She took up smoking and often went to the restroom to cry. After work, she often spent hours doing yoga and drinking "lots of calming tea."
