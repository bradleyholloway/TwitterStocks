 Official Payments and KVH Industries Tumble; Russell 2000 and Nasdaq Post Modest Declines   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2000  Small-capitalization and Nasdaq stocks fell moderately, with the small-cap market, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, posting slimmer declines than the overall Nasdaq market.  The small-cap and Nasdaq markets were weighed down by the weakness of technology stocks, which have come under renewed pressure following the sharp gains posted Monday and Tuesday. Nasdaq's large-cap technology stocks fell more sharply than smaller tech issues.  CompuCom Systems plunged 31/32, or 23%, to 3 9/32 after the Dallas computer and network-services company said its first-quarter loss will be wider than analysts had been expecting. The company said it now expects it will post an operating loss of 15 to 18 cents a share, compared with analysts' projections of a one-cent loss. The company also said it expects to take charges of six to eight cents in the quarter.
