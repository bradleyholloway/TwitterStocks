 The Assault on Iraq: Hotels See Few Cancellations Due to Travelers' War Concerns   By By Christina Binkley and Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  Tourism to Puerto Rico continued this week. "It's been business as usual," said Ramon Sanchez, deputy executive director of the government-owned Puerto Rico Tourism Agency. Marriott International Inc., Washington D.C., said it saw a "small uptick" in cancellations for the next week or two, but no change for long-term bookings. Hilton Hotels Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., said it saw a few small groups cancel meetings.  Dallas-based Wyndham International Inc., by contrast, said that it had so far seen less than 10 group cancellations systemwide, and all of them had rebooked for April or May. Some hotels near military bases were seeing strong bookings from reservists and their families. Ajay Patel, general manager and owner of a Days Inn in Norfolk, Va., said that his hotel was running at over 90% occupancy. However, he said, "it's a struggle" to be profitable since military rates are so low. The Days Inn chain of hotels is owned by Cendant Corp. of New York.
