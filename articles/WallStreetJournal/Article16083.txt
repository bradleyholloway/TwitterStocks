 Workspaces   By By Nancy D. Holt, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2001  What you see: Tropical plants. Despite the palm and passionflower, Mr. Raap's office is a long way from paradise. But in a corner of a metal warehouse, set on a 1,300-acre flood plain that once housed the city dump, he's working on it. Since moving his company here in 1985, Mr. Raap has led a campaign to restore the area to its agricultural roots, with display gardens, organic farms and a municipal composting facility. Now, he surrounds himself with blueprints for the future, including drawings for an "eco-park" that will link businesses that use each other's output to minimize waste. In a modest room filled with used office furniture and porch chairs, Mr. Raap's own digs are decidedly utilitarian.
