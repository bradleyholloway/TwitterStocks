 Golf (A Special Report); Off-Course Correction: High-tech driving ranges are luring golfers -- and forcing courses to adapt   By Haughney, Christine, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2006  "There are some gadgets out there that are junk," says Marjorie Jones, an instructor at Chelsea Piers. "Sometimes people lose sight of the human factor." Ms. Jones doesn't like some of the equipment that golfers strap themselves into that supposedly guides them through an ideal golf swing. "To me the golf swing is like a dance," she says. "Some of these gadgets that you find don't help that. I think they freeze people up and they get too robot-like and are not able to perform this fluid motion which is the correct golf swing."  Ms. Jones also says people who focus too much on using technology to hone their swing sometimes neglect other aspects of the game, like putting, and lose sight of the recreational value of being out on a golf course. "The game isn't just the golf swing," she says. "People don't focus on how you get the ball in the hole." She adds: "The game is being outside on a wonderful, beautiful place with trees and grass."  "Almost every course that we've built since 2002, we've really spent a lot of time making sure that the driving range replicates the playing experience," says Quentin Lutz, marketing vice president at Arthur Hills/Steve Forrest & Associates, a firm of golf-course architects in Toledo, Ohio. "The top-tier architects are focusing on it more because the client is asking for it."
