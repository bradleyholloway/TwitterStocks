 Looking Back at Berlin   By By Jeffrey Herf, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1998  Peter Gay has written a number of important works on European intellectual and cultural history, including a history of the Enlightenment, a five-volume study of the bourgeois experience, essays on Weimar culture and a biography of Freud. None deals primarily with the history of Nazism. The trauma of the Nazi years assumes center stage in "My German Question" (Yale University Press, 208 pages, $22.50), Mr. Gay's eloquent memoir of his Berlin youth in the 1930s, his family's escape and his ambivalence toward Germany and the Germans after 1945.  "My German Question" tells a story of how the Froehlich family responded to Nazi anti-Jewish persecution in the 1930s. (The family later changed its name to Gay, an English translation of froehlich.) It is also "an unapologetic apology" for German Jewry in the face of criticisms of its supposed blindness to the Nazi danger; a story of how Mr. Gay reacted to an increasingly hostile environment; and a spirited defense of the Enlightenment-bred secularism in which he was raised.  As Germany turned against the Enlightenment, Mr. Gay's parents did not waver in their fidelity to it, thus presumably planting the seeds of Mr. Gay's major study of the subject 30 years later. Mr. Gay's father stressed "the incurable hypocrisy and unmitigated absurdity of all religion." Thus, "whatever our pious fellow-pariahs might say, we could not make ourselves believe what we did not believe, though it might have been comforting at the time."
