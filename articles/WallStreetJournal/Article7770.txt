 Productivity Was Up Sharply In First Quarter --- U.S. Agency Places Increase At a 3.6% Annual Rate, Up From 0.9% Estimate   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1988  Non-farm productivity climbed at a revised 3.6% annual rate in the first quarter, much more than the previously reported 0.9% preliminary estimate, the Labor Department said.  The first-quarter productivity surge marked a strong rebound from a 1% annual rate of decline in 1987's fourth quarter. Rises in productivity, the measure of output for each hour worked, generally had been narrowing recently; the increase for all of 1987 was 0.8%, the smallest gain in five years. The quarterly statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations.  The latest productivity figures followed, and in fact were partly based on, a recent Commerce Department report showing unexpected economic vigor, the Labor Department economist said. In that report, the Commerce Department raised its estimate of first-quarter economic growth to a brisk 3.9% annual rate from the 2.3% rise the agency reported in April. It cited, among other factors, robust exports and a smaller rise in imports than previously believed.
