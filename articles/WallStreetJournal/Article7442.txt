 Lloyd's Profit Plunged 62% During '82 Year --- Insurance Exchange's Loss On Underwriting Was Record $257.7 Million   By By Craig Forman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1985  Lloyd's of London said profit for the 1982 accounting year slumped 62% from the previous year, as the insurance market posted its sharpest underwriting loss in its 300-year history.  Lloyd's overall profit fell to $78.1 million from $208.2 million a year earlier. The market's underwriting loss widened to a record $257.7 million from $59.6 million a year earlier. Lloyd's officials said the underwriting loss stemmed mostly from liability policies in the U.S., including fire and property damage policies. Premium income rose 28%, to nearly $4 billion from $3.1 billion.  Peter Miller, Lloyd's chairman, said that Lloyd's underwriters were taking steps to limit their exposure to certain damage claims, especially American general liability policies. Some Lloyd's underwriters are trying to restrict their liability on a policy to a specific amount. Some also are trying to set limits on the period during which valid claims can be filed. "We aren't blackmailing America, we're just saying there are limits," said Mr. Miller.
