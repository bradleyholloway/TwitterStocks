 After 200 Years, School Choice Loses in Maine   By By Richard W. Garnett, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1999  Does the First Amendment require discrimination against religion? Maine's highest court just said yes, and announced that the state may not provide students at religious schools the same tuition assistance it grants to students in public schools and secular private schools.  The court's 6-1 decision in (Cynthia) Bagley v. Raymond is already being hailed by voucher opponents as a vindication of the strict separation of church and state. It isn't. The ruling conflicts squarely with basic constitutional principles and provides the U.S. Supreme Court with an excellent opportunity to reaffirm that the Constitution requires neutrality, not hostility, toward religion. The Wisconsin Supreme Court last year rejected the constitutional theory endorsed in Bagley, and upheld a school-choice program in Milwaukee. It's now up to the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the issue.  School choice is new to many states, but not to Maine. Maine has been committed to providing educational choices to its children and their parents for more than 200 years. Until recently, Maine's "tuitioning" program paid for students who lived in areas without public schools to attend the school of their choice -- public or private, religious or secular. Under this creative program, all children in Maine -- religious or not, in cities or small towns -- had the same, basic right to a publicly funded education.
