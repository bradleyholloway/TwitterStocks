 When It's Looking Like a Dog's Life, Novartis May Help --- FDA Clears Antidepressant For Canines Who Suffer From Separation Anxiety   By By Elyse Tanouye, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1999  That may be the new diagnosis pet owners will get when they bring their neurotic dogs to see veterinarians, who will soon be able to prescribe an antidepressant for old Fido. Novartis AG's U.S. animal-health unit received Food and Drug Administration approval late last month to sell a meat-flavored antidepressant pill for dogs suffering from "separation anxiety." It's one of a number of drugs companies are developing to treat behavioral problems in pets.  The drug, dubbed Clomicalm in its veterinary-use form, is an old antidepressant called Anafranil, which has long been used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans. Veterinarians have prescribed the human drug for dogs, but by conducting clinical trials and receiving FDA approval, Switzerland's Novartis can now directly promote the drug to veterinarians and pet owners for use in dogs.
