The position is one in a long line of marketing gimmicks and branding promotions rolled out at Starwood in the two years since Chief Executive Steve Heyer arrived from the Coca Cola Co. Led by Chief Marketing Officer Javier Benito -- who worked with Mr. Heyer at Coke -- Starwood has sought to distinguish each of its hotel brands including Sheraton, Westin, St. Regis, W and Four Points, while adding new ones to the mix.
