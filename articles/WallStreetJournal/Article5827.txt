 Troubled Offering Is Warning Signal To Europe's Major Stock Exchanges   By By John Carreyrou, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2000  The troubled initial public offering of World Online International NV is a wake-up call for Europe's major stock exchanges: In their rush to get a piece of the New Economy action, they have so lowered their listing standards in recent months that their vetting methods are beginning to lose credibility.  With World Online shares down 55% from their March 17 launch price, Dutch stock-market operator Amsterdam Exchanges is coming under fire for its handling of the Internet-service provider's IPO. Investors charge that the exchange approved an opaque and misleading IPO prospectus, made no effort to ensure that it was widely available, and failed to thoroughly enforce rules meant to prevent insider selling soon after the offering.  The Dutch stock-market regulator has launched an inquiry into the World Online IPO and is forcing Amsterdam Exchanges to review its listing procedures. Specifically, it is looking at whether Amsterdam Exchanges should broaden its insider-selling lockup rules to cover all major investors in a company and at how the exchange can make prospectuses more accessible. Amsterdam Exchanges responds that it hopes soon to begin posting IPO prospectuses on its Web site in English.
