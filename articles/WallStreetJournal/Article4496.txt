 ...While Many Pros Don Dunce Caps   By By Stanley W. Angrist, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1989  In 1983, the Los Angeles investor started a pair of trading contests to see how investors, both professionals and savvy amateurs, could produce when their own funds were on the line. They could risk their money in any or all of five investing categories: stocks, options buying, option selling, futures and mutual-fund switching.  Mr. Frederick has been a longtime practitioner of nondiversification. In 1949, he received an inheritance of a few tens of thousands of dollars. With that, he started buying stock in Tampax Corp. and taking it to the bank and borrowing money against it to buy more. He sold the stock in 1972 after it had split 14 times, returning him several tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Frederick said he enters Mr. Zadeh's championships for the glory of winning. "I have been lucky all my life," he said.  In the first contest Mr. Frederick entered, in the summer of 1987, he decided the stock market was overpriced and started buying stock-index put options. A put option gives its owner the right to sell the underlying stock index at a specified price up to a certain date; such an option increases in value in a declining market. Of Mr. Frederick's puts, some of those purchased for $100 were sold for $8,000 in the days following the October 1987 stock market crash. His account was up 1,734% during that contest.
