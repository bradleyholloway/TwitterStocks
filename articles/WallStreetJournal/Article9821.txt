 A Commodity Boom Gets Stuck in the Harbor   By Barta, Patrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2005  Australia's export performance amid a global commodity boom "is appalling," says John Edwards, an economist at HSBC in Sydney. The government "can and should bear some of the responsibility for those [infrastructure] investments," he says.  A government-backed study released in early June concluded that Australia's infrastructure crisis was exaggerated but also found a bigger problem was imminent if more projects aren't developed soon. The report stopped short of advocating major government spending, calling instead for fewer regulatory burdens for private developers. Some are stepping up: International mining firms BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are spending more than $850 million to increase rail and other mining capacity in northwestern Australia, for example.  Says Shane Stephan, a vice president at Macarthur Coal Ltd. in Brisbane, "You're not going to put significant money into the ground until you've got certainty of when you will have port capacity."
