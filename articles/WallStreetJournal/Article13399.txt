 Seeking the Market's Takeover Treasures   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  "Buying a stock because it's a potential takeover target is tricky business," says Peter Andersen, a portfolio manager at Dreman Value Management in Boston, which manages about $22 billion. "You can win big if you're right," but there are a lot of stocks that seem like natural targets that never receive offers.  When private-equity firms buy a company, they usually pay for the deal by adding debt to the target. So firms with impressive "free cash flow," or money left after paying expenses, sometimes become attractive takeover targets. That's why Mr. [Jack Ablin] likes health-care companies such as Humana (HUM) and McKesson (MCK) and steelmaker U.S. Steel (X).  Firms that own real estate or other assets that are not being fully utilized sometimes receive takeover offers. That's because assets sometimes can be sold by an acquirer or better utilized. Mr. Andersen says that "in looking for targets, I try to pick companies that are pretty obvious as to how they would [trim debt] by selling off assets for a premium."
