 Auto Makers Cover All the Bases for 1989 --- Power, Comfort And Gadgetry Are Emphasized   By By Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1988  Nowhere is the effort to create a distinctive niche more evident than in minivans, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. market. That segment will grow more crowded in 1989 with at least four new entries: GM's Pontiac Trans Sport and Chevrolet Lumina APV, Nissan Motor Co.'s Axxess and Mazda Motor Corp.'s MPV. (APV stands for all-purpose vehicle; MPV, for multi-purpose vehicle.)  The GM products aren't actually 1989 models; they will be called 1990s when they come out next year. But they are an important part of GM's strategy to win back family-car buyers who have defected to Chrysler's popular Voyager and Caravan minivans and to Ford's best-selling Taurus and Sable cars.  With a sharply slanting nose and plastic body, the front-wheel-drive APV and Trans Sport are the first GM minivans designed mainly for car buyers, even though they, like all other minivans, are technically trucks. GM's current rear-drive Astro and GMC Safari minivans, in contrast, were originally developed for commercial use. Some GM officials, in fact, refer to APV and Trans Sport as "second-generation" minivans to emphasize the difference.
