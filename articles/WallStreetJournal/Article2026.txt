 Banks Lose Fondness for Affinity Cards --- Narrow Niches Tend to Prove Less Lucrative   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1989  Banks, finance companies and thrifts are learning belatedly that "affinity" cards -- credit cards tailored to certain groups of consumers -- aren't the successes they hoped for. The pace of new cards coming out has slowed, some issuers have expressed discouragement and a few, including Chemical Bank, have even abandoned the concept.  Affinity cards were supposed to help answer a big problem: the saturation of the U.S. credit-card market. With consumers holding an average three credit cards each, card issuers needed new ways to find and attract customers. Through affinity programs, issuers tapped into groups of potential customers by teaming up with charities, nonprofit groups, sports teams, airlines and other organizations.  The plan was simple: Banks seek the imprimatur and the mailing list of these groups, which in exchange typically get part of the annual fee for each new cardholder, some of the fee charged on purchases made with the card and a portion of the interest that consumers pay. For banks, part of the appeal is the ability to target certain groups, such as doctors, who are good credit risks. Today, three or four years after affinity cards began appearing, some 3,000 specialty-card groups exist, each with its own distinctive-looking card.
