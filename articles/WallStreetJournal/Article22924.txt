 Woe, Canada   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2002  Canadians do somewhat better when it comes to actual results -- 10th in the percentage of life expectancy without disability, seventh in death by preventable causes, and sixth in breast cancer mortality -- but partly because they can come to the U.S. for services that would be unavailable or dangerously delayed at home. The median Canadian wait from initial referral for an MRI was seven months in 2001 -- a long time to wait for what has become a basic diagnostic tool of modern medical care.  We don't note all of this to gloat over the misfortunes of our neighbors to the north. Our point is that many American politicians and lobbies (such as Families USA) continue to push the U.S. toward the same Canadian socialist model, albeit in salami-slice stages. Witness the Senate's failure to add a drug benefit to Medicare this year, mainly because Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy insisted that it be provided through the Health Care Financing Administration, arguably the worst bureaucracy in the world.
