 BNP Paribas Profit Increases 14%   By Larner, Digby, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2005  BNP Paribas's earnings were also helped by a continuing reduction in risk costs. Most French banks have raised results in consecutive quarters in the past year by cutting back on loan-loss provisions. BNP Paribas said it set aside 105 million euros of new provisions in the quarter, compared with 118 million euros a year earlier.  BNP Paribas's corporate-investment bank accounted for a significant portion of both top-line and bottom-line gains. Revenue at the division leapt 27% to 1.69 billion euros from 1.33 billion euros a year earlier, supported mainly by earnings from its advisory and capital-markets business. The division's pretax-profit contribution to earnings was up 33% at 764 million euros from a year earlier.
