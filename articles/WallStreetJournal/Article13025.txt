 Rock-Star Wannabe Finds Fame Making Music for Kids   By Bounds, Gwendolyn, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2004  Today, the 41-year-old musician is more successful than ever. Known simply as "mr. [Ray Yodlowsky]," Mr. [Hans Christian Andersen] has sold about 25,000 compact discs in the past three years featuring music from his children's album, "Start Dreaming." His songs, ranging from "Swish!" to "Boo-boos Go Away," are a hybrid of kid-empowerment messages cloaked in a rock sensibility that parents welcome as a break from Barney. Mr. Andersen's own dinosaur tune, "I'd Be a Dinosaur," is played in a minor key with a shuffle inspired by Doors classic "People Are Strange." Moms say they don't mind Mr. Andersen's good looks or sultry style, either.  "I would say that the biggest challenge is transferring the popularity of the music realm into the visual realm," says David Bittler, spokesman for the Nickelodeon cable network. "On our channel, kids are center stage, not adults." Still, the popularity of "Captain Kangaroo," which ran on CBS for about 30 years, and PBS's "Electric Company" in the 1970s show that kids will watch programs aimed at them that feature adults. If mr. Ray "has got this following, it all comes down to talent, timing and chance," Mr. Bittler says. To boost his odds, Mr. Andersen's DVD is structured like a mock mr. Ray show.  Diana Chaney, a former money manager, hired Mr. Andersen for her husband's upcoming 50th birthday, where the musician will play a combination of kids' and adult-oriented songs. "Most kids' music drives me crazy," she says. "But he's cool. Edgy." David Stamberg, 40, recently purchased a Meat Loaf DVD shot when Mr. Andersen was touring with the band. "Let's be clear," Mr. Stamberg says. "I like Meat Loaf, but I bought it for mr. Ray."
