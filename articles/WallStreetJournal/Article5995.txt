 Elan, Biogen to Reveal Promising Treatment For Multiple Sclerosis   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2001  In Phase II clinical tests conducted by Elan, a group of patients injected with Antegren once a month for half a year showed "virtually no new lesions being formed," better results than were found with a control group of patients who weren't given the drug, said Mr. [John Groom]. The side effects of the drug were minor, he added. Antegren eventually could be sold as a combination therapy mixed with Avonex, a drug developed by Biogen, Cambridge, Mass.
