 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Some (Investing) Books for the Beach   By Kansas, Dave, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2006  "The Intelligent Investor Revised Edition," by Benjamin Graham and Jason Zweig. (Collins Business Essentials). Mr. Graham is famous for his book "Security Analysis," considered the bible of value investing. This book takes a more main-street approach and provides excellent pointers on how to approach investing. Warren Buffett is among the many Mr. Graham admirers in the investment firmament. Mr. Zweig, a Money Magazine writer, updates this classic with modern examples that outline Mr. Graham's still-salient points.  "Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk," by Peter Bernstein (Wiley). Not strictly about economics, it provides an excellent history about risk and its vital role in markets, tracking it back to the mathematicians who first grappled with the notion of risk. This book is highly regarded on Wall Street. Mr. Bernstein's "The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession" would appeal to goldbugs. But if you can read only one book, "Against the Gods" is the one.  "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything," by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner (HarperCollins). This clever book applies economic thinking to find cheating among sumo wrestlers, test flimflammery by teachers and explanations for the surprising drop in crime rates during the past 15 years. Written in an accessible way, "Freakonomics" shows how economics isn't just the plaything of wonky tweed-jacketed professors. Full disclosure: Mr. Levitt and I went to high school together.
