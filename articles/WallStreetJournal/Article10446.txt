 Pakistan Urges On Taliban --- U.S. Officials, Afghan Militants Say Spy Agents Tell Radicals to Keep Fighting   By Barnes, Julian E; Rosenberg, Matthew; Habib Khan Totakhil, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2010  Members of Pakistan's spy agency are pressing Taliban field commanders to fight the U.S. and its allies in Afghanistan, some U.S. officials and Afghan militants say, a development that undercuts a key element of the Pentagon's strategy for ending the war. After the September 2001 terrorist attacks, Islamabad officially broke with the movement and sided with the U.S. U.S. officials have said since then that some ISI elements maintained links to the Taliban and other Islamist extremist groups to guarantee Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan after an eventual American withdrawal.
