 Devry's Institutes Misled Students, Lawsuit Claims   By By Larry M. Greenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1996  The lawsuit seeks 300 million Canadian dollars (US$219 million) in damages and an additional C$100 million in punitive damages from Devry, which teaches courses in computers, electronics and business at 14 Devry Institute of Technology campuses in the U.S. and Canada.  The figure for direct damages is based upon estimates of an average cost of C$20,000 for each of 15,000 Ontario students who have attended Devry in the last six years, according to J. Douglas Barnett, a lawyer representing the initial plaintiff, Tasos Mouhteros, a former Devry student in Toronto. Mr. Mouhteros and five other students filed a similar complaint with Canada's Bureau of Competition Policy earlier this year, seeking an official investigation of Devry's marketing practices.
