 Stocks Rise in London And Decline in Tokyo --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1986  Share prices rose in London yesterday, aided by a poll that showed the Conservative Party ahead of the opposition and by continued strong demand for British Gas PLC shares.  Trading was buoyed by the release of a survey, conducted for a British television station, that showed support for the ruling Conservatives at 41% of those polled, in contrast to 35% for Labor. It was the Conservatives' best showing in recent polls. A British general election is expected to be called next year.
