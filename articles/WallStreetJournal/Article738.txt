 Tainted Tylenol Found in 2 More Bottles In New York; Nationwide Alert Issued   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1986  WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Two more bottles of tainted Tylenol were found yesterday in Westchester County, N.Y., where a woman died Saturday after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules that contained cyanide.  FDA Commissioner Frank Young urged consumers to "completely avoid Tylenol capsules of all lot numbers and strengths until further notice." He suggested that all Tylenol capsules be removed from medicine cabinets.  At least one of the bottles identified yesterday as containing tainted Tylenol apparently had been properly sealed, according to a spokesman for Andrew J. O'Rourke, the Westchester County executive. FDA inspectors late yesterday said tests on one bottle taken from a store in the area uncovered cyanide in five capsules. That bottle was from a different batch than the one involved in the cyanide-poisoning death Saturday of Diane Elsroth, 23 years old.
