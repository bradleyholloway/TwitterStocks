 American Air Moves To Increase Legroom In Its Business Class   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  American will give business travelers about 10 to 12 more inches of legroom; to do so, the company will remove one row of business-class seats on 88 aircraft, as much as 20% of capacity in that class. "It's a competitive move because other carriers have done it," said spokesman Mark Kienzle, who cited similar steps at Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and British Airways. "It keeps passengers and also gives them a reason to fly American."
