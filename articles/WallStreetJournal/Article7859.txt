 Ex-Stein Roe Partner Enters Plea in U.S. Case   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1989  A former partner of Stein Roe & Farnham, a Chicago investment adviser, pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct a U.S. investigation of how Teamsters pension fund money was managed.  The plea by John Giura, who resigned from Stein Roe in 1985, caps a sweeping investigation by federal regulators into the operation of the Utica, N.Y., Teamsters Pension and Welfare Funds.  Mr. Giura entered his plea in federal court in Syracuse, N.Y. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and fines totaling $500,000. The 56-year-old Mr. Giura, of Oak Park, Ill., couldn't be reached to comment.
