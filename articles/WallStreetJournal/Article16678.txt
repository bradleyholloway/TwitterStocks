 Taking Stock: What's Ahead For Investors   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2006  "Until six weeks ago everyone was wallowing in despair, and every data point seemed to be pointing lower," says Robert Morris, chief investment officer at the Jersey City, N.J., fund-management group Lord Abbett. "Now we've got this stealth rally going on. It just confirms in my mind that the market has a chance of closing strong this year."  The reason is housing. "Housing has never been so important to the economy," he says. "Housing-related bonds have become the single biggest part of the bond market. Housing is very important for consumer spending. And pretty much all measures of the housing market are in recession territory, down 10% or 20% from their peaks."  "I am in the camp that retail gasoline prices and oil prices in general are likely to recede unless there is some geopolitical eruption," says Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management in New York. "That will make people feel a little bit better about the consumer but worse" about stocks linked to oil and other raw materials, he says.
