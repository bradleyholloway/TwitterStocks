 The Buzz -- MarketWatch Weekend Investor: How a Bear Paws at Mr. Coffee   By Greenberg, Herb, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  Mr. [Jim Chanos] doesn't buy the explanation. With [Jarden]'s stock down 22% since reporting earnings less than two weeks ago, he figures his concerns about Jarden are finally coming home to roost. That is quite a different story from a little more than two years ago, when I first wrote about similar concerns Mr. Chanos had with Jarden. At the time, its stock had been rising and Mr. [Ian Ashken] was quick to tell me that Mr. Chanos had been "crucified" for shorting his stock. He further said, "I have no sympathy for him." My guess is that this time it is Mr. Chanos who has no sympathy for Jarden.  Trying to get a handle on whether that has been the case, Mr. Chanos says he contacted Richard Heckmann, the former chief executive of K2 and now a director of Jarden, who in the 1980s was a stockbroker to Mr. Chanos's firm. According to Mr. Chanos, Mr. Heckmann suggested that Mr. Chanos meet with Messrs. [Franklin] and Ashken. Mr. Heckmann told me via email that he didn't recall suggesting that a meeting be set up. "I forwarded Jim's obviously biased email to Jarden, believing that he did not understand K2's business and left it up to Jarden to communicate with him," Mr. Heckmann says.
