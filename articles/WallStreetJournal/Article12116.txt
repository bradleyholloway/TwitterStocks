 Copper Prices Plunge on Supply Fears And Options-Related Selling by Dealers   By By Fred Vogelstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1996  Copper-futures prices plunged, surrendering their gains of late last week. A report from an international copper study group sparked fears that the long-anticipated flood of copper supplies was finally kicking in.  Copper futures for December delivery fell 5.40 cents to 89 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Copper futures had been nearly 97 cents a pound, a three-month high, earlier this week fueled by a run-up in excess of five cents last Friday.  Indeed, Fred Demler, an analyst at ED&F Man, said he expects today's stockpile report from the London Metal Exchange to show significant increases in copper stockpiles, an indication that demand for copper is slackening.
