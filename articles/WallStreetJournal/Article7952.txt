 Pearson's Barlow Gets Responsibility For Most Divisions   By By Barbara Toman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1989  The move, which takes effect Jan. 1, will make the 59-year-old Mr. Barlow responsible for most of the conglomerate's subsidiaries. He currently is chief executive officer of Pearson's Financial Times newspaper, and an executive director of the parent company, which also has interests in publishing, fine china, oil and banking.  Lord Blakenham, 51, will remain chairman and chief executive officer of Pearson. The company's three other executive directors will continue reporting directly to him. "We are keeping the same five-man team together, but reallocating responsibilities," Lord Blakenham said in a telephone interview yesterday.
