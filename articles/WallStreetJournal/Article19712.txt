 LEISURE & ARTS -- In the Fray: Please, Just Shut Up and Dance   By Greskovic, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2003  In no instance were the word offerings especially illuminating. Some preposterously touted the dances they were aiming to explicate. Winning the booby prize for doggerel were the notes by Dana Caspersen, Mr. [William Forsythe]'s wife and a Ballett Frankfurt dancer. Her dense and dopey paragraphs accompanied each of the four Forsythe works and claimed things like: "'The Room as it Was' begins in the bell space created by this bright focus." "'Duo' is a clock composed of two women." About the male quartet in "N.N.N.N." one read that "the men enter into a complex, intense inscription." "One Flat Thing, reproduced," she noted, ends with the dancers' "bodies howling in a voracious, detailed storm."  The title of Ms. [Marshall]'s "Sleeping Beauty" suggested dance- historic resonance and fairy-tale psychology, but, in spite of the sensual presentation of its central figure, a languidly riveting Kristin Hollinsworth, her inconclusive dance failed to reveal "the miracles" the choreographer's words mentioned. Cloud Gate's "Moon Water" came accompanied by descriptions of "flowers in a mirror" and "moon on the water." Yet, however prettily such images were suggested by artfully mirrored and lighted surfaces and slicks of actual water on the stage, the 70-minute work to canned Bach remained far more poetic in its prose than in its choreography.
