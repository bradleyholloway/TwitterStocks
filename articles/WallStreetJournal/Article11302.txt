 Antitrust Aides Pledge to Raise Scrutiny Level   By By Paul M. Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1989  In speeches at an antitrust conference in Cambridge, Mass., however, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission stopped short of broadly rejecting existing antitrust enforcement policies or promising sharply stepped-up government intervention in corporate transactions.  Janet Steiger, in her first public statement since taking over the FTC post in August, expressed deep concern about the "prominent view" that "federal antitrust has retreated to the point of near invisibility." She further acknowledged that "the FTC's efforts to confront these accusations have not been entirely successful." And in regulating major corporate mergers, she said, "I do not close the door on the possibility that the FTC may have been overly cautious in its case selection efforts."
