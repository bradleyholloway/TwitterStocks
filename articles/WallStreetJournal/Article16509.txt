 Patent No.6,004,596: Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich   By Sara Schaefer Munoz, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2005  "People think it is amusing to talk about patents on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but it is a patent that never should have been issued," laments Adam Jaffe, professor of economics at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., and a co-author of a book on the U.S. patent system. "This is a technology -- if you can call it that -- that has been around in many forms for many years."  It wasn't long before [Smucker] was defending its turf. In 2001, the jam maker ordered the small grocer and caterer, Albie's Foods Inc. of Gaylord, Mich., to stop selling its own crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Smucker alleged that Albie's was infringing its patent. Albie's fired back in federal court, trying to get the Smucker patent invalidated.  Smucker disagrees. The attorneys' brief says that "this smashed edge is the antithesis of the surface-to-surface seal" formed in its own process. The brief uses sandwich diagrams in an attempt to demonstrate that, unlike pie crusts or ravioli, the sandwiches are made without "commingling the two bread slices into an amorphous homogenous mass." Instead, the slices remain "separately visible about the periphery of the sandwich."
