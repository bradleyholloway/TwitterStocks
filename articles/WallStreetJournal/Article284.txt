 How Banks Make the Most of Bounced Checks   By By Rick Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1999  He was even more unhappy when he examined a detailed printout of his account activity. Seven checks had all arrived on the same day, and First Security had processed them starting with the biggest one, for $938.25. Next came a check for $30 -- which sent Mr. (Jim) Menke's balance into the red by $21.29. As the bank processed the next five checks, each for less than $12, the bounced-check fees piled up.  Mr. Menke is one of a growing number of customers outraged over a common but little-noticed tactic many banks use to boost their bottom lines: high-to-low check processing. When several checks are drawn on the same account in a given day, these banks process the biggest one first, raising the odds that some will bounce. The result can be multiple bounced-check fees.  Two months after walking out of the bank with the printout (for which he was charged $1), Mr. Menke filed a lawsuit in state district court in Albuquerque against First Security Bank of New Mexico, a unit of First Security Corp. of Salt Lake City. His suit accuses the bank of "unfairly imposing unreasonable and excessive fees." In addition, banks have adopted the high-to-low check processing without adequately notifying customers, Mr. Menke and other plaintiffs say.
