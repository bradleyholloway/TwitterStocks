 Prudential Unit's Surging Fund in Asia Underscores Region's Appealing Growth   By By Steven E. Levingston, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 1991  Since 1986, Prudential Insurance Co. of America has funneled $250 million to its Asian-Pacific investment and merchant-banking arm. Recently, the Newark, N.J., parent announced it is doubling its commitment to $500 million.  By all accounts, Prudential Asia is one of the leading figures in the region's emerging direct-investment -- or venture capital -- industry. In five years, the firm has acquired stakes in 36 Asian-Pacific businesses. It has built a broad regional network with offices in six countries. Despite rough going in Taiwan, returns on investments -- which are confidential -- apparently have pleased the home office enough to merit the new cash.  With its $500 million commitment, Prudential Insurance underscores the growing appeal of direct investment as a way to participate in Asia's rapidly expanding economies. "Asia is without doubt the fastest-growing segment world-wide of the venture-capital industry," says Lewis Rutherford, publisher of the Asian Venture Capital Journal.
