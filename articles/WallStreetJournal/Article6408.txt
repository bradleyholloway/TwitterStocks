 Coors's Net Rises, Molson's Falls as Merger Closes   By Lawton, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2005  "Our first order of business is to focus on our core markets, investing for growth on our leading brands," said W. Leo Kiely III, chief executive of Molson Coors. He said the company's No. 1 near-term goal is "to rejuvenate growth for Coors Light in the U.S."  Coors said it shipped 5.31 million barrels of beer and other beverages to the U.S., Canada and other markets in its Americas segment in the fourth quarter, up 4.3% from 5.09 million last year. U.S. sales to wholesalers increased 4.2% from a year earlier, and wholesaler sales to retailers increased 0.8%. Coors's sales boost in the U.S. was driven partially by easy comparisons with 2003, when computer problems hurt the brewer's ability to get its beer to market.
