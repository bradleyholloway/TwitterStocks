 A Special News Report About Life On the Job -- and Trends Taking Shape There   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1998  A survey of 900 human-resources officials at big companies found 70% saying they handled at least one sexual-harassment complaint in 1997. That finding by Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman, a New York-based employment-law firm, was down 24% from a 1995 poll. Fully 62% of the 1997 employers trained supervisors to deter harassment, nearly double the 1995 total.  Kathy Bedrosian, communications manager at Cognex Corp., a Natick, Mass., computer-systems maker, keeps five work-organizing lists going. But William Friedlander, chairman of Bartlett & Co., a Cincinnati investment-management firm, says he used to lose spreadsheets and trip reservations in paper piles and do long searches half a dozen times a day. He called on Stephanie Denton, a local professional organizer, to help him create a "file map" showing what was in which file.  Daniel Segal, president of Waterfront Entertainment Group, a Cincinnati theater and TV producer, paid Ms. Denton $500 each for about eight half-day sessions. She helped him toss lots of mail upon arrival and purge many files, stuffed in 55 boxes in his office. Using a desk as "an unregulated storage area" ensures losing things, says a Harvard University Business School newsletter. Stephanie Winston, New York consultant, advises following a "TRAF" policy-Throw, Refer, Act or File.
