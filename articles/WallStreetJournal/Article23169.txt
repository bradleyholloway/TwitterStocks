 Investment Dartboard   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2004  Martha Stewart may be going to jail, but her company isn't. That's the theory of Michelle Mategko, a former lobbyist who now stays home to care for her autistic child in Duluth, Minn. "She's obviously a fantastic businessperson," says Ms. Mategko, a Minneapolis Star Tribune reader. "And she's picked great people around her, so the company will do well whether she's involved or not."  It's been a tough year for Nashua, N.H., "e-learning" software firm SkillSoft. "They have been seesawing," admits Denver Post reader Gwen Hanley. But she's encouraged by the company's overseas growth prospects and believes it can stage a recovery. Ms. Hanley was recently laid off after 16 years as a hospital administrative worker in Denver.
