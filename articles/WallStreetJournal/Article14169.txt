 Arbitragers Are Enjoying Themselves Now, But It May Be a Little Early to Tally Gains   By By Dean Rotbart, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1985  These three deals have created more profits and stronger feelings of invincibility among takeover speculators than any group of transactions since Texaco agreed to acquire Getty and Chevron agreed to buy Gulf early in 1984. Boasts one New York-based arbitrager: "Last week was the best year I've ever had."  Like food stocks now, oil stocks were all the rage then, and money poured into such other hot targets as Amerada Hess, Louisiana Land & Exploration, Pennzoil, Phillips Petroleum, Superior, Sun and Unocal. Some of those stocks, of course, turned out to be good speculations, but most retreated when the rumors ebbed. Professionals and less-speculative investors alike lived to regret their greed.  Even some of the announced takeovers or management-led buyouts went bust in 1984, while others tied up speculators' funds for too long to make good investments. When Coastal Corp. offered $68 a share for a controlling interest in Houston Natural Gas in January 1984, speculators gobbled up Houston Natural stock at 53 to 58 a share. But when the two companies signed a peace pact in February, Houston Natural's stock collapsed to 43 1/4, taking many successful Getty investors down with it.
