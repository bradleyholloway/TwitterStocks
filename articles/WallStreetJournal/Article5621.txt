 DuPont Sees A Lower Profit For 2nd Period   By By Susan Warren, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  Calling DuPont Co.'s second-quarter performance "totally unacceptable," Charles Holliday, DuPont's chief executive officer, said the chemical giant's quarterly earnings will be as much as 15% lower than the year-earlier period, and well below Wall Street expectations.  The company blamed the shortfall on a range of problems, including bad weather that depressed sales of agricultural chemicals, unusually low oil prices that hurt its Conoco Inc. unit, weak demand from Asia and the General Motors Corp. strike, which cut demand for textiles and plastics used in automobiles.  DuPont's announcement shocked analysts, who were still betting, on average, that DuPont's earnings would rise over the year-earlier quarter. "We knew someone was going to miss the quarter because the business environment is so tough out there, but we're surprised it was DuPont," said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Les Ravitz.
