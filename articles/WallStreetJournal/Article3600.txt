 Tyco Ex-CEO's Ex To Post $10 Million For His Bail Bond   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  Last January, Tyco disclosed that Mr. [Frank E. Walsh Jr.] got a $10 million cash payment, along with an additional $10 million donation to a charity of which he is a trustee, for helping Tyco acquire CIT Group Inc., a deal that quickly turned sour. Tyco has claimed that Mr. Walsh failed to get board permission for the payment, as required by the company's bylaws.  Yesterday, Mr. [John Moscow] also indicated there was a possibility of additional charges being brought against Mark Belnick, Tyco's former general counsel, who was indicted for failing to disclose $14 million in relocation loans. All three former Tyco executives have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Mr. Belnick, had requested that his trial begin in January. "We don't yet know what the status" of the Belnick case "will be in January," Mr. Moscow said. Judge [Michael Obus] declined to set a trial date for any of the three defendants.
