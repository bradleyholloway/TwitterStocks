 Letters to the Editor: Freedom of Speech on Campus   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1988  Your March 14 editorial "Dartmouth's Vexations" hit home. In late January, we hosted representatives from the Sandinista government and the Nicaraguan resistance on back-to-back nights (the Sandinistas refused to share the podium with any representative of the Contras). While the Sandinista, Julio Icaza (then-deputy permanent representative to the U.N.), was able to deliver his speech without incident, the following night the Contra, Alfredo Cesar, was nearly silenced by what has been called the "rent-a-mob" forces in Cambridge.  While we were able, after removing 26 protesters, to hear Mr. Cesar, the fracas certainly had a chilling effect on future efforts to bring people of controversy and note from the right/conservative viewpoint to the forum. Although we were successful with Mr. Cesar, the prospect of once again encountering the expense, criticism and scrutiny is a frustrating one, and it may be at a price many are increasingly unwilling to pay.  Four years ago we invited several former secretaries of state to Tufts to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. We have an excellent policy on controversial speakers, and the university is very experienced in dealing with noisy situations. We guaranteed our participants that we would handle all groups with discipline and security. I cannot speak for Mr. Haig, but at the last moment Henry Kissinger pulled out. I assume that Mr. Haig also withdrew at the last moment, because he did not appear at the forum.
