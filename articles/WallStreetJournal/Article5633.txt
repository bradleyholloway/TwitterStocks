 McDonald's Is Proclaiming Itself A Thai Patriot Amid Asian Crisis   By By Pichayaporn Utumporn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  Since July 17, McDonald's restaurants in Thailand have been using a mat that states: "Thai products bring millions of baht into Thailand." The mat cites specific examples -- 50 million baht ($1.2 million) of chicken wings exported to Hong Kong in 1997 and 1998; 500 million baht of shrimp exported to McDonald's in Europe last year; more than 100 million baht in exported Ronald McDonald statues and chairs in 1997.  "We want to tell our customers that, as opposed to what they may think, we export more than we import," says Dej Bulsuk, managing director and 51%-owner of McThai, a joint venture with U.S.-based McDonald's. Mr. Dej says many Thais are concerned that, by eating at a McDonald's, they are in effect shipping their cash out of the country, or otherwise contributing to Thailand's economic slump. "We want to tell them that it's not true."  However, the mats leave the impression that McDonald's is the exporter in question. "Every product of McThai meets export quality. . . . We bring enormous money into Thailand every year," the mat reads. It also says, "We `McDonald's Thailand' are proud to be creating jobs and earning foreign money for our country."
