The decision was made Wednesday, at a meeting that included Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah. Mr. McCain agreed to postpone for at least two weeks a scheduled March 12 Commerce Committee meeting to formally consider tobacco legislation. In the meantime, his committee will hold at least two more hearings on the legislation.
