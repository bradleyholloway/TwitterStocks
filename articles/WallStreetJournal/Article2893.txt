 German Leader's Shift on Tax Cut Divides Coalition   By By Matt Marshall, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1996  A rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government, the result of a major about-face by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party on next year's tax package.  On Friday, Mr. Kohl's party broke an eight-month promise to cut taxes next year by refusing to lower an income-tax surcharge used to pay for the costs of reunification. Also over the weekend, a key Christian Democrat leader in Parliament spoke in favor of raising the sales tax by one percentage point. Both moves have caused conflict with Mr. Kohl's small coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party.
