 Schwab Reduces Its Trading Fees Following Rivals   By Ceron, Gaston F, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2004  Coming soon after Schwab's earlier price cut, and also as rival Web brokers have been lowering prices, Schwab's latest move underscores the competitiveness of the online-brokerage industry. Even after a string of mergers in recent years has pared down the number of large players, the industry remains under pressure from its value-conscious customers to keep prices low.  "It is a very competitive environment, and price counts more than ever," says Andy Gill, Schwab senior vice president. "Lower-cost trades are very important, particularly for active traders." He says Schwab's decision to change pricing so soon after its earlier cuts was made because the earlier changes were well-received by customers. The lower prices are helping bring business to Schwab, he says.
