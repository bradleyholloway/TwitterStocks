 MarketWatch: How to Buy ETF's (If You Must)   By Farrell, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2005  William Bernstein, a money manager, neurologist and author of "The Efficient Asset Allocator," used to think ETFs were interchangeable with mutual funds. Then he compared the two indexing giants: Barclays Global Investors iShares ETFs versus Vanguard's index mutual funds. His conclusion: Even without considering commissions, "in all seven cases where a direct head-to-head comparison can be made, the Vanguard funds outperform the iShares [and] in some cases, it isn't even close."
