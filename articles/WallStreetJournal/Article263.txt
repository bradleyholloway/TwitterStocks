 Heard in New England: Hadco's Reliability May Help It Weather a Price Storm From Asia   By By John Hechinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1998  Even worse, Hadco can't shake off a nagging question: Will the Asian currency crisis short-circuit its business? Fearing that offshore competitors will drive down prices, investors have punished the company's shares, which now sell for about $50 a piece, down from their 52-week high of $75.63 in July.  But some analysts say the company's stock, which started to pick up over the past month, is due for a sharp upturn. Their reasoning: Despite the overall market's lofty heights, Hadco shares remain cheap, considering the company's strong growth prospects.  To be sure, Hadco's stock is volatile, and the company has had to work hard to keep costs down amid growing pricing pressure. Meanwhile, its second-largest customer is Cabletron Systems of Rochester, N.H., which announced an order shortfall last year. Analysts estimate that Cabletron represents about 7% of Hadco's sales. So, that could hurt Hadco's earnings. Last week, Hadco offered analysts some reassurance it could offset a decline in Cabletron business. The company reported earnings for its fiscal first quarter, ended Jan. 31, that beat analysts' expectations by three cents a share, according to First Call.
