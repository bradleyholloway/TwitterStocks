 Letters to the Editor: The Perils of ERM   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 1990  George Melloan paints a distorted picture of the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (Global View, op-ed page, July 16). This mechanism makes many European currencies artificially strong by tying them to the deutsche mark. But Mr. Melloan states, "Strong currencies have certainly done no harm to the industries of France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria." As evidence, he cites their impressive economic growth rates. He then argues that Britain, which has remained outside the ERM, has no compelling reason not to join: "If having a strong currency did none of these countries any harm, what exactly is England's problem?"
