 Sugar Prices Rise Despite Russian Auction Delay   By By Marvin G. Perez, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2000  Despite news that Russia, the world's largest importer, was postponing an auction to grant licenses for sugar-import quotas until early December, the market survived an early selloff from speculators. Traders remained bullish that importers in Moscow will go ahead with buying plans.  Russian officials originally said they planned to hold the auction Monday for import quotas totaling 3.6 million metric tons of raw sugar at low tariffs. Sugar imported under the quota would face a tariff of 5% of its customs value; any imported outside the quota would face a 30% tariff.  Ann Prendergast, analyst at Refco Inc. in New York, said the market's performance was to be expected after the October contract's expiration Friday took pressure off prices. Echoing the market consensus that Russian companies will continue buying despite quota uncertainty, she recalled that Moscow importers also bought a lot of sugar at this time a year ago.
