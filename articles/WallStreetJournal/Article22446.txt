 Nike Says It Plans to Slash $100 Million On Spending for Star Endorsements   By By Bill Richards, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1998  Philip Knight, chairman of the sneaker giant, said Nike will follow the rest of the athletic-shoe industry and cut back on endorsement spending. Nike officials said the company's $500 million budget for sports marketing for the 1999 fiscal year, which includes endorsement contracts with everyone from Michael Jordan to the Brazilian national soccer team, would shrink by about $100 million, with that cash being earmarked for advertising instead.  To date, Nike has been a conspicuous holdout as the rest of the sneaker and athletic-apparel industry trimmed celebrity spending. Reebok International Ltd., for example, dropped about 700 athletes off its endorsement list this year, including superstars such as Shaquille O'Neal. Others have sharply cut prices they are paying for endorsements.  In the past, Mr. Knight has said there were no plans to cut back. As recently as last week, Andrew Mooney, Nike's vice president of global brand management, told analysts the company was "totally committed" to continuing to line up team and individual sports-star endorsements.
