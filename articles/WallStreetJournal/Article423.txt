 Disclosures to Increase on '529' College Plans [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2006  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board agreed to strengthen, but not drastically change, the rules regarding the sale of "529" college- savings plans.  "We've pumped it up by saying you have to talk about tax and other kinds of benefits [of home state plans], and those benefits should be something you consider," said Christopher Taylor, executive director of the MSRB, which develops rules regulating securities, including 529 plans.
