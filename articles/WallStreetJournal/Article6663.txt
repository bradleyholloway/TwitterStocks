 He's Back; Newt Gingrich left Congress in disgrace but now he ponders a Presidential run; Rallying the right   By Kronholz, June, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2007  Mr. [Newt Gingrich], 63 years old, says in an interview that he has no campaign staff, isn't raising any campaign money and is "consciously not showing up at any presidential cattle calls" like debates, forums or photo ops. He may not even want the job, he adds. "The Oval Office isn't big enough" to do everything that needs doing, he told the CPAC audience, which responded with whoops of encouragement.But he's keeping his options open. He keeps up a heavy speaking schedule -- nine speeches last week alone, including California and Alabama -- and occasionally pops into Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire.  Gingrich volunteers wear T-shirts proclaiming "Countdown to September 27," the possible trigger date for his campaign. If the other candidates have picked up his ideas and have launched what he calls a civil dialogue by then "there will be no reason for me to have to run," he says. And if not: "Then we'll seriously take a look."  Given his name recognition -- crowds greet him with chants of "Newt, Newt, Newt" -- Mr. Gingrich could "get by on fumes," says a former staffer. That's important because the compressed 2008 primary calendar will force candidates to buy television time in lots of states simultaneously, rather than depend on the results of one primary carrying their names into the next.
