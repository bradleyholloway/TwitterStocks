 Letters to the Editor: In Defense of Animal Rights   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1987  First, it begs all the questions raised, not only by animal-liberation partisans but also by respected philosophers and scientists about whether science is ethically neutral, whether science should be subject to some control with regard to its ethical implications, and whether the advancement of research at all costs is a legitimate a priori. These questions have been part of the debate by scientists, intellectuals, politicians and part of the public at least since the development of the atomic bomb. The insinuation that they reflect a mentality that favors quack cures or are taken seriously because of the public's belief in astrology and the efficacy of pyramids is nothing but smear tactics.  Mr. Kennedy also leaps over the large and growing philosophical literature that argues on strictly rational grounds for the rights of nature, both animate and inanimate. And it also avoids the questions raised, not only by activists but also by scientists, about the legitimacy of research involving the torture of animals. There are genuine issues here, about which animal-rights partisans and scientists themselves are in disagreement.
