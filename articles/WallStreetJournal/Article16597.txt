 U.S. Networks Try Crafting Their Own Spanish-Style Soaps   By Barnes, Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2006  Nina Tassler, president of entertainment at CBS, a division of CBS Corp., says that young, upscale women might be drawn to telenovela story lines, which traditionally try to strike a balance between drama, comedy and romance-novel kitsch. "There's escapism in these shows, there's fantasy, there's wish fulfillment," Ms. Tassler says. "Those are all elements that are really in vogue right now."  Meantime, there's more interest in soapy material in general. "Desperate Housewives" routinely ranks as the No. 1 or No. 2 program on television, while Disney's SoapNet, which airs reruns of 1980s hits such as "Dallas" along with daytime fare such as "All My Children," is one of the fastest-growing cable networks.  Media buyers, while applauding networks for taking risks, say that advertisers are likely to take a wait-and-see attitude. "The networks have not been able to grow their business over the last few seasons so this is the latest thing they're trying," says Elena Marroquin, vice president of strategy at Starcom MediaVest's Tapestry, a Chicago ad- buying firm that specializes in multicultural programming. "Whether it works will depend on the quality."
