 SEC Probes Andersen for Conflict of Interest --- Waste Management Consulting Case Is Focus of Agency   By By Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2000  Since then, the SEC and some of the nation's biggest accounting firms have locked horns over the potential conflicts of interest that have arisen as revenue from consulting has dramatically run ahead of audit fees for the nation's biggest accounting firms. To the SEC, the desire of accounting firms to keep the consulting fees flowing threatens auditor independence by possibly prompting the accountants to overlook worrisome and too-aggressive bookkeeping practices. In June, the SEC proposed rules to significantly limit consulting services that auditors can offer corporate clients.  The inquiry is in preliminary stages and the SEC has alleged no wrongdoing; an SEC spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Pinnacle auditors, said: "Our independence with respect to Pinnacle has never been impaired. All of the services provided to Pinnacle were appropriate and allowable under existing SEC standards." Pinnacle's Mr. Day added: "We're no criminals here. There are no accounting issues. We've done our accounting appropriately."  In Pinnacle's case, the SEC is looking at whether Pinnacle can justify how it valued the Motorola assets, as well as how it tallied acquisition-related expenses, according to a person with knowledge of the probe. According to an SEC filing, Pinnacle recorded the unit's current assets at $271.7 million. The SEC also is examining Pinnacle's $28 million in acquisition expenses: such things as legal, consulting and accounting fees, the person familiar with the probe said. If some of the figures of that type are on the high side, they could work to increase earnings going forward, accounting experts said.
