 European Stock Issuance May Contract This Year After Unusual Slowness in the Second Quarter   By By Silvia Ascarelli, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2001  That could leave business for 2001 as a whole just as slow as it was in the first half of the year. Overall stock issuance, including stock-linked deals, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa totaled $74.1 billion in the first six months of the year, off from the bumper $141.5 billion in the first six months of 2000, Dealogic said. IPOs totaled $19.5 billion, down from $49.2 billion in the first half of last year. In both cases, the declines are even steeper than those in the U.S.  The second quarter is usually one of the busiest times for stock issuance because most companies' full-year results for the prior year by then have been published. But this year was hurt by investors' focus on the state of the U.S. economy, and growing signs that European expansion is rapidly slowing. Even so, defensive offerings, such as Norwegian oil and gas group Statoil ASA, failed to overly enthuse investors. Instead, a rare success was Spanish retailer Inditex SA, parent company of fashion retailer Zara. Adding to the gloom, investors were burned by profit warnings from United Kingdom recruitment specialist Michael Page PLC and Dutch office supplier Buhrmann NV, both of which had sold shares in March.  In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average slipped 1.5%, or 188.39, to 12629.02. Some blue-chip technology firms fell to some of their lowest levels of the year. Sony set a new intraday year low of 7,780 yen and ended down 2.3% at 7,800 yen. Shares declined on a local report, later confirmed, that the telecom concern KDDI is recalling 560,000 mobile-phone batteries produced by Sony because of a manufacturing glitch. Hitachi dropped 1.1% to 1,185 yen after a company official said he expects a larger fiscal half group operating loss in its electronic-device segment. Matsushita closed down 2.1% at 1,867 yen, also a year low for the issue. But Honda Motor extended its winning streak to five straight sessions, ending up 1.4% at 5,700 yen.
