Under a plan filed with a Colorado bankruptcy court last March, the company's preferred shareholders were to get 2.1% of the common shares of the reorganized company, Kaiser Holdings Inc. Kaiser said the modifications were submitted in response to objections by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. Representatives of preferred shareholders and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. couldn't be reached for comment.
