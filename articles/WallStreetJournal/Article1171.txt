 Notebaert to Retire, Leaving Qwest At a Crossroads   By Amol Sharma and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2007  Frank P. Popoff, lead director on Qwest's board, said Mr. [Dick Notebaert] wasn't forced out. "He's put in five good years for us," Mr. Popoff said. "He's met all the expectations we had."  Despite Qwest's makeover in recent years, Mr. Notebaert was careful not to declare victory. "It's nice to be almost normal," he said in a recent interview. "But you don't want to ever exhale. It's always important to have some angst when you get up in the morning."  If belt tightening was the first phase of Qwest's turnaround, the second phase will be much trickier, as cable operators like Comcast plow onto Qwest's turf in places like Denver, Seattle and Portland, Ore. Both companies offer a "triple play" of phone, Internet and video services for around $100 a month. Comcast's footprint already overlaps with 55% of Qwest's households, says Donna Jaegers, a telecom analyst with Janco Partners. Qwest "is at a crossroads right now," she says. "They are really facing an increasing amount of competition."
