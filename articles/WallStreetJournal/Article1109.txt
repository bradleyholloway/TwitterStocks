 Sniffing Out Spoiled Meat   By Johannes, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2006  The company says it works by smelling "amines," or gases made by bacteria as they decompose uncooked meat. The higher the level of amines, the more bacteria present. The company says a red light on the device shines when the bacteria count is more than 10 million organisms per gram -- a commonly used scientific standard for spoilage. If the light is green, the meat is fresh. Yellow means the meat is still good -- but consume it soon.  Spoiled meat with a high bacteria count is unpleasant, but not generally dangerous, says James Dickson, a food microbiologist at Iowa State University. "What's making you sick is the harmful bacteria -- the salmonella and the E. coli and the rest of those -- and if they are not present you're not going to be sick," says Dr. Dickson. But it takes only a tiny amount of bad bacteria to become sick from eating it. As few as 10 E. coli organisms or a few thousand salmonella could make someone violently ill, says Dr. Dickson.
