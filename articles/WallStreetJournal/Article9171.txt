 Nissan Teams With Renault and Banks On a Bailout Plan for Its Truck Unit   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2000  The plan, which was anticipated, calls for Nissan Diesel's banks -- Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Asahi Bank Ltd. and Yasuda Trust & Banking Co. -- to set up a credit line for the debt-laden truck maker. Nissan Diesel is expected to issue convertible bonds amounting to about five billion yen ($46.7 million) to raise cash.  Although the size of the credit line was not disclosed publicly, a Nissan official said it likely would be worth 200 billion yen. Earlier, Nissan and Renault considered injecting as much as 10 billion yen into Nissan Diesel, but later decided the company's immediate needs could be met with a convertible-bond issue of half that size. Nissan Diesel, long recognized as one of the biggest burdens weighing on Nissan, is saddled with more than 500 billion yen in interest-bearing debt.
