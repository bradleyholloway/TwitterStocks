 Gary Lynch, SEC's Enforcement Chief, Will Join Davis Polk as Partner in Fall   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1989  Gary Lynch, the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement director, will join the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell as a partner in September.  Mr. Lynch's decision to join Davis Polk's litigation department in the firm's New York office was seen as a major coup for Davis Polk. Most large law firms in New York and Washington that practice in the securities field sought to talk to Mr. Lynch, but the 38-year-old Mr. Lynch ended up in discussions with only a few. His decision to join Davis Polk "marks the end of the most intense bidding war for a government official since Clark Clifford," said Edward Herlihy, a former SEC enforcement chief who is now a partner at the New York firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. "It's a real coup for Davis Polk because it's unbelievable how much demand there was for him."
