 Holders Wield Little Clout in Latin Deal --- Management Likely to Win At Top Argentine Bank; Minority Activism Fails   By By Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2000  The management group at Argentina's largest bank, Banco de Galicia & Buenos Aires SA, is likely to win majority control and proceed with an important restructuring in a deal that also shows some of the weaknesses of shareholder activism in emerging markets.  Yesterday, Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano SA, which owns around 10% of the Argentine bank, said it would exchange its shares, a move that nearly ensures management "is likely to win the majority it needs to go ahead" with the offer, said Jason Mollin, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson LLC. Banco de Galicia officials declined to comment. The exchange also will allow Banco de Galicia to convert to a holding company and expand its presence in financial services, a move many analysts applaud.
