 Letters to the Editor: A Matter of Civil Rights, Not Guilt   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1994  What has kept Ricardo Cisneros from returning to Venezuela has more to do with civil rights and lack of due process than an admission of guilt. Ricardo performed no differently than several other Venezuelans, and non-Venezuelans, when facing an indefinite preventive incarceration (in your words) in "one of the most awful prison systems." These persons, caught in a situation similar to Ricardo's, faced a system that presumes the accused of being guilty before proven innocent. Venezuela's constitutional guarantees and civil rights are currently suspended, as you are aware. Ricardo is eager to return to prove his innocence; he is not out of the country by choice but rather by default.
