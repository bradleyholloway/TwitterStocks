 Florida Looks Less Likely to Hold Special Session to Name Electors   By By John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2000  GOP state senators in Florida hope the rulings will push [Al Gore] to consider withdrawing soon, making any special session of the Legislature unnecessary. "There's a better chance of Gore pulling out," said Sen. Tom Lee, a close ally of Senate President John McKay, who would make the call for a special session, along with the House speaker, Tom Feeney.  Mr. Feeney, who has pushed for a quick session to stake out the Legislature's position on the electors, added that he felt vindicated by both the U.S. Supreme Court ruling and a separate decision by Judge N. Sanders Sauls. Mr. Feeney didn't directly address the question of when, or whether, a special session is still needed. The Legislature plans to file a friend-of-the-court brief for the appeals before the Florida Supreme Court -- something lawmakers complain the state high court wouldn't let them do previously.
