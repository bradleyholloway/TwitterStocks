 U.S. to Unveil Policy on Issuing Internet Names   By By Rebecca Quick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1998  The Clinton administration is preparing to release, perhaps as early as today, a long-awaited policy laying out who is in charge of the decentralized and factious Internet. But according to people familiar with the report, the government dodges many of the thorniest issues and thrusts them back on the industry itself.  The much-debated government policy is intended to resolve the issue of how Internet names, such as "www.ibm.com," are doled out . The Internet is running out of desirable ".com" names, and many alternatives for new naming schemes have been proposed. Companies have been jostling for the right to register these new names -- and charge a fee to do it.  But the report, overseen by White House adviser Ira Magaziner, doesn't lay out any specifics on new names or name registries. Instead, it calls for the creation of a nonprofit group, representing various Internet interests, to resolve these issues. The report doesn't specify who will be on that crucial panel, which will assume the power of doling out real estate in cyberspace. That is likely to set off a scramble among nations, businesses and Internet gurus jockeying for influence.
