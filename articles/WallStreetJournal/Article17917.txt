 On West Bank, the Crucial Factor Is Hate --- Israeli Kibbutz, Arab Town Share Land, Violent Past   By By Geraldine Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1989  The Arab village of Beit Omar and the Jewish kibbutz of Kfar Etzion across the valley are linked by fields; the vineyards of one are laced between the vegetable trellises of the other like the fingers of interlocked hands.  The two communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank are also linked by history -- much of it violent. In Israel's 1948 war of independence, Arab soldiers, some from Beit Omar, obliterated the kibbutz, killing many of the Jews after they had surrendered. In Beit Omar, in the early months of the year-old Palestinian uprising, three young men were shot to death by Israeli soldiers.  Any solution for Israel's occupied territories involves dozens of communities like these -- locked together on the land but divided by years of bloodshed and bitterness. When Israelis talk of offering Palestinians autonomy, the Arabs of Beit Omar shake their heads in disgust. What good is autonomy, they ask, under an Israeli government that encourages new Jewish settlements that compete for soil, water and markets for produce? And when Palestinians in Beit Omar raise their flag from the village mosque's minaret, Jews in the rebuilt kibbutz see it and shudder, saying they will never relinquish their land to a Palestinian state run by the people who killed their forebears.
