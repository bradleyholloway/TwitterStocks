 BAA Nears Acceptance of Ferrovial's Higher Bid; Deal for Airports Operator Is Valued at $19 Billion; Goldman May Play Spoiler   By Singer, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2006  Ferrovial's group includes Caisse de Depot & Placement du Quebec of Canada and GIC Special Investments Pte. of Singapore. The consortium first approached BAA in February with an offer of 810 pence ($15.26) a share, but BAA turned it down.  The consortium subsequently launched a hostile bid, taking its offer straight to shareholders, and last month increased the bid to 900 pence a share from 810 pence a share. That was also rejected by BAA, which said at the time the bid "does not begin to reflect BAA's true value."  Seeking a friendly deal, Ferrovial and its partners tried to reach an agreement with BAA over this past weekend with a slightly sweetened bid. The group added 15 pence to its 900 pence-per-share bid -- equivalent to the dividend the company is due to pay soon -- but the advances didn't get off the ground.
