 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2004  SESAME WORKSHOP is involved in negotiations to develop a 24-hour cable network dedicated to preschool children. An article on yesterday's Marketplace page incorrectly referred to the nonprofit organization as Sesame Street Workshop. Also, the Noggin cable network has the right to Sesame Workshop programs until the fall 2005, not later this year as reported in the article. In addition, shows "SpongeBob Squarepants" and "Rugrats" regularly appear on the Nickelodeon channel. A chart accompanying the article incorrectly said they appear as part of Nick Jr. programming.
