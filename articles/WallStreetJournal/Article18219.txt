 Corporate Lobbyists Worry That Thomas Won't Back Business on Supreme Court   By By Paul M. Barrett and Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1991  Civil rights groups, in contrast, have a lengthy paper trail to examine. But they still face a difficult decision of how -- or whether -- to oppose the nominee. Mr. Thomas, a judge on the federal appeals court here and before that chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Reagan administration, has attacked the very underpinnings of contemporary anti-discrimination policy. He has even criticized some aspects of the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision, in which the Supreme Court ordered an end to school segregation.  For most nominees, questioning the Brown decision would immediately ignite a firestorm of opposition from a broad coalition of civil rights groups. But because Mr. Thomas is black, grew up in poverty and segregation, and may be more palatable to liberals than other potential nominees, that opposition hasn't materialized. And without unified opposition, Judge Thomas almost certainly will be confirmed handily by the Senate, as he was only 15 months ago for the appeals court seat, civil rights lawyers said.  Civil rights groups remained muted in their reaction. "We aren't predisposed one way or the other," said Kerry Scanlon, assistant counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The advocacy group, which is reviewing Mr. Thomas's record before taking a position, will judge him "just as we would if he were white," Mr. Scanlon added. Other activists said there definitely would be vocal opposition to Judge Thomas from within the civil rights-civil liberties coalition, but they weren't sure how widespread it would be.
