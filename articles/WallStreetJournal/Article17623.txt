 River Oaks Industries, Arizona Home Builder Decide Against Merger   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1986  Richard Day, senior vice president, finance, of Coventry said his company, a Phoenix, Ariz.-based home builder, found that the transaction "wasn't going to be mutually beneficial." Mr. Day said the decision was made partly because of problems at River Oak's unprofitable River Oak Homes unit and also because of River Oaks's "cash flow difficulties." River Oaks officials weren't available for further comment.
