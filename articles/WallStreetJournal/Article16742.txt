 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  Alltel is stepping up efforts to sell itself. The nation's fifth- largest wireless operator by subscribers has made overtures in recent weeks to AT&T, which has been willing to entertain the possibility, though it remains skeptical. Potential buyers could be put off by Alltel's market price, which stood at nearly $22 billion on Friday.  Scania's board may announce as early as this week the nomination of the CEO of VW, the truck maker's largest shareholder, as its next chairman.
