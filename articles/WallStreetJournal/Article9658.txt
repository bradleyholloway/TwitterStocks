 SmartMoney: Chemicals See Upswing   By Laise, Eleanor, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2004  Not all companies in the sector will join the party. Natural-gas prices, which make up 70% of production costs for some chemicals, have risen sharply. While commodity chemical producers have become adept at passing on higher raw-materials costs to their customers, others won't be so lucky. More-specialized chemical companies -- the middlemen that turn basic chemicals into things like insulation and eyeglass lenses -- will see their profit margins squeezed. Thanks to consolidation in the retail industry, the Wal-Marts of the world won't accept the hand- me-down price increases.  Georgia Gulf (GGC, $27) is a major producer of PVC, which is used in everything from pipe fittings to computer keyboards. This is the tightest market in the chemical industry, says Damian Howard, a Caterpillar Investment Management analyst. The stock trades at just 11 times 2004 earnings and 0.6 times sales, thanks to Georgia Gulf's greater exposure to natural-gas costs. But the company's strong position in the PVC market should counteract that risk.
