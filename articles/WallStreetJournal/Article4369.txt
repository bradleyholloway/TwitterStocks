 Canada Trade Pact Gets Mixed Review In Congress Debut   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1988  Members of the House Ways and Means Committee's trade subcommittee repeatedly praised Treasury Secretary James Baker and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter for negotiating the complex agreement, and none declared outright opposition. But frequent questions about the effect on specific industries, and the fact that the hearing room was packed with lobbyists, indicated that selling the pact to Congress won't be a simple task.  In his testimony, Mr. Yeutter declared "it would be a terrible mistake to evaluate this agreement on the basis of its impact on particular firms, industries and states." He and Mr. Baker conceded that the pact wouldn't resolve every U.S.-Canadian trade issue, and they tried to draw attention to what they asserted were the agreement's long-range benefits for the U.S. economy and for world trade.
