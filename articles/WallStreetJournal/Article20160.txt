 World Bank Corruption   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  The India controversy began with a 2005 report by the bank's Institutional Integrity unit into pharmaceutical drug procurement as part of the bank's Reproductive and Child Health I Project (or RCH I). The 16-page report has never been made public. But we've seen a copy, and it's a stunner that readers can find in full on OpinionJournal.com.  The report cites "substantial losses" into the tens of millions of dollars or more, as well as evidence of corruption risk at other health care projects in India "representing over US$2 billion in Bank funding." It concludes that the findings are "sufficiently grave" to merit sanctions against specific individuals and companies.  The good news is that Mr. [Paul Wolfowitz] was able to ensure that the bank's anti-corruption unit continued its "detailed implementation review" of the India project. This second report is due in weeks, and this is the one that some bank officials are trying to discredit, as Bret Stephens describes nearby. We haven't seen this report, but we're told a draft highlights corruption running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
