 Entertainment + Technology (A Special Report): Where the Money Is --- Virtual Center: A British Company Looks to Lead the Way In a New Form of Arcade Entertainment   By By Janet Guyon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1994  Virtuality Group PLC, the arcade-machine company he founded in 1987, is creating "a whole new medium of communication," says the 33-year-old managing director. In the not-too-distant future, he says, people miles apart will play tennis, golf and perhaps Virtuality Boxing together on global information highways.  If Dr. Waldern -- he has a Ph.D. in computer science -- has his way, Virtuality will be in the center of this communications and entertainment revolution. The company is already the world's biggest seller of "virtual reality" arcade games, which use sophisticated computer power with video-image headsets and joysticks to bring video games to a new level of interactivity.  A year after its founding, Virtuality, then called W Industries, won the British Technology Group's "best new business" award. In January, Tim Sainsbury, the British minister of industry, was interested enough in the company to spend 20 minutes chatting with Dr. Waldern at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International arcade-game show, where Virtuality unveiled its second-generation game machines. (The minister declined to play.)
