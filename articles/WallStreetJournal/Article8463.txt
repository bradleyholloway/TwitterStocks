 Power Industry's `Wheeling' Gets New Opposition --- Activists Join Utility Fight Against Manufacturers Roving for Discounts   By By Dave Kansas, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1994  A group of environmental and consumer advocates is expected to announce today their opposition to the electric-power industry's evolution toward letting big customers buy power wherever they choose -- a policy known as "retail wheeling."  If adopted on a widespread basis, most utilities argue, wheeling would wreck their planning and sabotage construction of new generating capacity by making local demand impossible to project. One dismal scenario envisions a high-cost utility steadily losing large customers and being forced to raise local rates to cover fixed costs for existing plants and facilities.  Already, power generation is largely deregulated, with more than half of new power capacity being built by nonutility companies. In addition, wholesale competition for power among utilities and municipalities exists within states. But retail wheeling would open the floodgates to nationwide pricing competition.
