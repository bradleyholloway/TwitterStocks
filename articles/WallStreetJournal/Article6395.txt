 Apex Fights Back From Nadir; Pioneer of Ultra-Low-Priced Electronics Battles Main Partner   By Ramstad, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2005  [Changhong] also disclosed that Apex's chairman and co-founder, David Ji, has been under house arrest in China since late October, when he was visiting the country for a business trip expected to take seven to 10 days. Changhong later said it might try to acquire Apex but, under questioning from securities regulators, on Friday issued a statement saying it has "no plans yet to take over Apex."  Even so, the low-price strategy worked for a while for Apex. In November 2001, it trailed only Sony Corp. in U.S. DVD-player sales, with models that started at $90. Then, on the day after Thanksgiving that year, the giant discounters Wal-Mart and Kmart Holding Inc. offered Apex DVD players for just $69.99. Wal-Mart sold more than one million units that day. That same month, Mr. Ji sealed a deal he believed would drive the company's next stage of growth: a contract with Changhong to build millions of TVs that Apex would sell in the U.S. using the same ultra-low-price strategy.  Apex and Changhong were soon quarreling over shipments and payments, according to court filings. And, according to Mr. Brothers, Apex never made money by selling TVs. "We used it to gain market share and further expose the Apex brand," he said.
