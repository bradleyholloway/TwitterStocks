 Profits Face Headwinds   By Vigna, Paul; Shipman, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2011  "The big decline in the jobless rate to 9.4% from 9.8% was due to a third consecutive decrease in the labor force, again not a sign that people are seeing their job prospects increase," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. Sectors that produced hot gains in 2010 such as financial, energy and materials sectors should cool off this year, while last year's relative underperformers such as consumer staples and health-care are forecast to lead in 2011, according to earnings forecasts compiled by Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group.
