 Letters to the Editor: Affirmative Action Is the Law   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1997  Clint Bolick, in his Oct. 27 Rule of Law column "A Vote for Lee Is a Vote for Preferences," has taken another swipe at Bill Lann Lee, the president's nominee to head the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, and, not surprisingly, at me.  Confirming Bill Lee has nothing to do with "preferences." It has to do with whether the smooth and orderly enforcement of the civil rights law will get the attention and support it deserves from the Senate. Defending affirmative action -- done the right way -- is a small part of the job for which Mr. Lee is nominated, but an important one, not because affirmative action is popular, but because it is the law.
