 Calpine's Power Play Shorts Out; California Electricity Generator Spent Heavily on Plant Capacity, But So Far, Demand Isn't There   By Smith, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2005  Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., has spent more than $27 billion assembling a giant portfolio of 93 power plants to churn out electricity to help utilities trying to meet rising demand. So when air conditioners went on full blast during last month's heat wave in Southern California, one of Calpine's new plants near Bakersfield stepped up to help meet the need for electricity.  The Bakersfield plant, and another near San Jose also put into service this summer, were built by Calpine "on spec" at a combined cost of $1 billion, meaning no utilities had pledged to buy their power. The plants mostly are being snubbed by California's big utilities; Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. have crafted new long-term power solicitations that essentially exclude Calpine's new plants from competing for the business.  That latest shift made things hard for Calpine. For example, the company aimed to build a plant for PacifiCorp near Salt Lake City on an abandoned steel-mill site. But even after the bid was won, there were sticking points, says Jim Macias, Calpine's executive vice president for development. "It became crystal clear they didn't really want to do a deal," says Mr. Macias. Finally, PacifiCorp terminated discussions, at a cost to Calpine of $8 million. Calpine later learned PacifiCorp had arranged for another firm to build a plant for it on the same site. A PacifiCorp spokesman says the notion Calpine's project was hijacked is "a false claim by a disgruntled bidder."
