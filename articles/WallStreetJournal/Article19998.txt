 Can We Talk? Lehman Hopes So; Brokerage Firm's Plan to Call Clients Directly to Discuss Stocks Has the Street Paying Attention   By Craig, Susanne, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2006  Regulators also are paying attention, wanting to ensure that the analysts don't use information gleaned from clients to benefit their own in-house trading positions, according to people familiar with the matter. The analysts sit on a sales-trading desk where traders sometimes take positions to facilitate client trades, as opposed to an in-house, or "proprietary" trading desk, which is run more like an internal hedge fund, taking big bets with the firm's capital but not having access to client information.  "Given that the desk analysts in equities do not publish research, they are subject to the regulations and guidelines that apply to sales and trading personnel," a Lehman spokeswoman said. One of the firm's goals "is to manage the group's day-to-day operations, including management of any actual or perceived conflicts," she said.  There are 15 people on Lehman's desk-analyst team, including three former stock analysts, notably Ann Gillin Lefever, once a highly regarded consumer-products stock analyst who runs the team. Lehman says its decision to move analysts to the trading desk is aimed at bolstering the advice it is giving to its best trading clients and firm traders, which mainly facilitate client trades but also take positions for the firm.
