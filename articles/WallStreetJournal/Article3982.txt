 Trends (A Special Report): Delivery Services; 'One Throat to Choke'   By Brooks, Rick, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2005  The rival delivery giants disagree on how far to take the one- company-fits-all strategy. As a result of about 30 acquisitions since going public in 1999, UPS says it can do everything from running warehouses for its customers to lending them the money they need for their own expansion. FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf Jr. told analysts and investors last month that "you've got to really think" before "you put all your eggs in one basket."  DHL is struggling in the U.S., where it has an estimated market share of just 7%. But lately it has shown signs of a rebound. "We've made great progress on stabilizing the basic business, probably even a little faster than we hoped," John Mullen, a joint chief executive of DHL Express, said in August, claiming the company's on-time performance is "consistently" equal to that of FedEx and UPS.  DHL seems to be recovering from a series of missteps that set back its progress in the U.S. market. After plans were announced in 2004 to spend $1.2 billion to build or upgrade DHL shipment-sorting facilities and make other improvements to its delivery network throughout the U.S., it looked like the carrier would inch closer in the rearview mirrors of UPS and FedEx, which have a combined 80% share of their home market. But then came potholes big enough to swallow a yellow DHL delivery van.
