 ThyssenKrupp Is Preparing for Potential Sale of Big Automotive Unit   By Singer, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2006  A sale of ThyssenKrupp Automotive AG, likely to bring in about 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion), would raise cash for Germany's biggest steelmaker as it waits to see if it can buy Dofasco Inc. of Canada for $4.6 billion amid a broad shakeout of the steel industry. The German company has agreed to buy Dofasco from Mittal Steel Co. if Mittal's hostile takeover of rival Arcelor SA is successful. A spokesman for ThyssenKrupp in Dusseldorf declined to comment.  A sale would come as several parts suppliers in the U.S., such as Dana Corp. and Delphi Corp., have fallen on hard times. Four big automotive-supply companies have filed for bankruptcy-court protection in recent months under pressure from U.S. auto makers and rising raw- materials prices. The latest was Dana, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday.
