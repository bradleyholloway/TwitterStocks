 Comverse Faces U.S. Criminal Probe; Options-Granting Practices Draw Increasing Scrutiny; Subpoena Covers '95 to '06   By Charles Forelle and James Bandler, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2006  Kobi Alexander, Comverse's founder, was the recipient of a number of such option grants during his tenure as chief executive of the telecommunications-software vendor. Earlier this week, Mr. Alexander and two other top Comverse officials resigned. Seven grants to Mr. Alexander between 1994 and 2001 preceded double-digit run-ups in the company's share price over the next 20 trading days. The pattern raises the question of whether the grants were approved at a different time but backdated to take advantage of the stock movement.  Neither Mr. Alexander nor his lawyer could be reached. A Comverse spokesman didn't return a call seeking comment. Comverse was one of a half-dozen companies whose past options-granting practices were questioned in a March article in The Wall Street Journal.
