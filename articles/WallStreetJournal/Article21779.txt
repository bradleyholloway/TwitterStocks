 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Scott R. Schmedel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1993  Many charities do these things now for donors; for some charities, the measures would add paperwork. Yet Bob Smucker of Independent Sector says he doesn't expect charities to oppose them. That is because the measures are linked to something charities desire -- revival of a provision to let donors who are subject to the alternative minimum tax deduct the full market value of gifts of property that appreciates, such as art.  Clinton's proposal to remove the income ceiling from the Medicare tax has special meaning for nonqualified deferred-pay plans -- voluntary bonus-deferral and supplemental retirement plans that don't qualify for all the tax breaks available to rank-and-file retirement plans. In 1993, employees must pay the 1.45% Medicare tax on wages up to $135,000; employers match the taxes. But the proposal would tax all wages for Medicare, starting next year.  Furthermore, says James Connors, tax counsel at Merrill Lynch, Medicare taxes on nonqualified deferred pay are due when it is earned, not when it is received (unlike income taxes). So the proposal would make executives pay substantial current Medicare taxes on income they hadn't seen yet. And if income-tax rates are raised, Connors notes, that will make executives want to defer more income until a time when their effective tax rate is lower.
