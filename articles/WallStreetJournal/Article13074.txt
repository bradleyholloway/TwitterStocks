 Ted Turner -- Yes, That Ted Turner -- Attacks Big Media   By Angwin, Julia, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2004  Mr. Turner's broadside is yet another deterioration of his already strained relationship with Time Warner. Last month, for instance, Mr. Turner criticized Time Warner's tentative bid for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., saying the company is "about to pay $5 billion for the not-so- good half of it." Time Warner's board, and presumably Mr. Turner, had approved Time Warner's pursuit of MGM.  While Mr. Turner's article didn't discuss Time Warner specifically, an original draft of the piece did -- and was quite critical. That changed after Mr. Turner submitted a draft to the company for review before it ran. "He did remove parts of the draft that directly attacked or were overtly negative about the company," a person familiar with the situation said.  Mr. Turner owned 37.9 million shares as of June 22, according to FactSet Research Systems Inc., down from a peak of 155 million shares in March 2001. His stake is worth roughly $600 million. That's 10% of its value in 2001; the drop is a result of Mr. Turner's stock sales, along with the decline in the Time Warner share price.
