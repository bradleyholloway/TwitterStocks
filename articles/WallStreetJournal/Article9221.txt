 Privatization Effort Of Ontario Premier Comes Under Fire --- Outbreak of E. coli in Water Causes Voters to Question Province's Spending Policy   By By Elena Cherney, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2000  WALKERTON, Ontario -- Few politicians in North America have embraced privatization of government services as eagerly as Ontario Premier Mike Harris. But now, the leader of Canada's most populous province faces the worst crisis of his career -- because of privatization.  Mr. Harris now says the reporting regulations will be tightened. But the political damage has been done. An Angus Reid Group Inc. poll for the Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto indicates that 28% of Ontarians blame Mr. Harris's privatization policies for the outbreak. A recent Ekos Research Associates poll for the Toronto Star newspaper indicates that 32% of Ontario voters place "significant trust" in the premier, down sharply from 42% right before the contamination incident.  The public's loss of faith in safe access to a basic necessity could end Mr. Harris's career, says Sid Noel, professor of political science at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. Faced with the crisis, Mr. Harris "doesn't seem to know what to do," he says. At the University of Toronto, political science professor David Cameron adds, "In the public perception, this is an example of [Mr. Harris's cost-cutting] approach going too far."
