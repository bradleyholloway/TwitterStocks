 Bank Building Gets Third Acquisition Bid; Value Is $24.7 Million   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1986  Bank Building, which designs buildings for financial institutions, said the proposal calls for it to issue enough new shares to a J.L. Mason unit to give J.L. Mason a 58.2% stake in Bank Building. Within 60 days of the stock issue, J.L. Mason would make a tender offer for the remaining shares at $14.50 a share. The proposal calls for J.L. Mason to receive an option to buy 19.2% of Bank Building for $14.50 a share, a lockup provision designed to discourage other bidders.
