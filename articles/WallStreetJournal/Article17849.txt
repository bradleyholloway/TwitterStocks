 AT&T Seeks to Lift Its Service Charges On Some Phone Calls   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1988  In a Federal Communications Commission filing seeking the agency's approval, required for the increases, AT&T proposed to raise service charges for out-of-state collect calls, third-party billing, and coin calls from a pay phone. The company said the current service charge on 99% of these calls is $1.55. But the charges are lower on calls that travel 22 miles or less; $1.10 for calls from 11 to 22 miles, and 75 cents for 10 miles or less.
