 P&G Expects to Name Successor Soon For Advertising Chief Killed in Accident   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1987  Procter & Gamble Co. officials, still shocked by the accidental weekend death of advertising chief Robert V. Goldstein, are expected to move relatively soon to replace one of the most influential executives in the advertising industry.  Mr. Goldstein's successor as P&G's advertising vice president will oversee the largest corporate advertising budget in the world, estimated to be about $1.4 billion annually. Reflecting Mr. Goldstein's clout was his role in helping lead the industry's current battle against Florida's controversial advertising sales tax. And during last year's spate of megamergers in the domestic advertising industry, he made clear P&G's misgivings about the combinations by moving some P&G accounts away from the merged agencies.  "He had tremendous impact on the industry," said Edward Wax, president of Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, the advertising giant. "He was larger than life and I don't mean that to sound cliche."
