 Japan's Policies Are Expansionary   By By Michael M. Hutchinson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1987  Going beyond recent protectionist trade measures, the U.S. is now calling for Japan to adopt more expansionary financial policies to help reduce the huge and prolonged U.S. trade imbalance. The claim is that "austere" financial policies in Japan have slowed the growth of U.S exports. The facts are quite different, however. Japan is following expansionary policies.  The basic argument against Japan is simple: Japan for domestic reasons is presumed to have adopted policies that keep domestic purchases of goods and services (aggregate demand) at a low level. Part of these purchases are imports, including goods and services supplied by U.S. firms. Slow growth of U.S. exports is therefore alleged to be in large part attributable to restrictive Japanese policies. A reversal of these policies toward expansion, monetary expansion in particular, would presumably help ease the U.S. trade problem.  In recent years, domestic demand adjusted for inflation grew at a faster rate in Japan than in either Europe or the U.S. Over 1985 and 1986, it grew an average 4% in Japan. The major European countries and the U.S., in contrast, both averaged only about 3% real demand growth over the same period. Moreover, forecasts by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicate that this year, Japan's aggregate demand growth of about 3.5% will be on a par with Europe's, and will exceed that of the U.S. by a full percentage point. Japan hardly fits the picture of a stagnating economy whose financial policies discourage imports and have indirectly caused sluggish U.S. growth.
