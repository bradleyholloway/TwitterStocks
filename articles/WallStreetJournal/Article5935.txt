 Decline and Fall: Britain Feels Pressure As Public Services Continue to Decay --- Caught Between Capitalism And Socialism, Hospitals, Trains and Schools Suffer --- Mr. Blanchflower Can Poach   By By Marc Champion, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  Including both state and private expenditure, Britain spends $1,209 per capita on health care, compared with $3,070 in the U.S. and $1,860 in France. The ratio of doctors to population in Britain is about half that in Germany, France or the U.S. So it isn't surprising that Britain's NHS -- created in a wave of generosity after World War II to ensure proper care for everyone -- can't cope with the public's rising expectations.  Britain's school-enrollment levels for ages 16 to 19 are the lowest in the European Union, at 69.5%, compared with 88% in France and Germany. A 1999 study found that one in five British adults can't count their change. Britain's adult literacy levels rank among the worst for developed nations (the U.S. is only a few notches higher). As Mr. [Tony Blair] launched a $2.19 billion adult-literacy program last week, he said, "In the future, there will be nothing more important."  Taking advantage of the pay gap, Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., recently poached C. Neil Macrae, a 37-year-old experimental psychologist from Bristol University who has won awards from neurological societies in the U.S. and Europe. "I'm going to take as many people as I can find, and I'm going to treble their standards of living," says David Blanchflower, the associate dean at Dartmouth who hired Mr. Macrae and is himself a Briton. "It's a disaster what's happening to Britain's universities, and the government just doesn't get it; they don't seem to care," Mr. Blanchflower says.
