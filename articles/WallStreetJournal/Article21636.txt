 Steel Industry May Post Losses For 4th Quarter --- Period Began Optimistically, But Order Cancellations, Recession Hurt Firms   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1992  John Tumazos of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. recently lowered his fourth-quarter estimate for USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group to no per-share earnings from earlier estimates of 75 cents a share. He said the company is selling more semifinished, lower-profit products to make up for falling demand for high-margin steel tubes for the oil field and sheets for car makers. In 1990, U.S. Steel earned $1.03 a share.  Still, nearly all major steelmakers -- except U.S. Steel and National Steel Corp. -- could show a loss for the quarter, many as a result of huge year-end charges and continuing modernization costs. Bethlehem Steel Corp. could show a loss of about 90 cents a share on an operating basis in the quarter, largely because of an estimated $25 million in outage costs at its two major operations, estimates Charles Bradford of UBS Securities Inc. In 1990, Bethlehem had a loss of $6.91 a share after a $550 million restructuring charge.
