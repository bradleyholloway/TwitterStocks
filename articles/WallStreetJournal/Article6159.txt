 Staple Stocks Are Top Picks in Korea   By By Sarah McBride, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2003  "Many of these [consumer staples] stocks are just plain cheap, in our view," UBS Warburg strategists said in a recent report. UBS recommends Hite Brewery, mid-tier cosmetics maker Pacific Corp., and Korea Tobacco & Ginseng, calling all three "too unpopular to ignore."  Korea Tobacco & Ginseng: Stocks were in something of a free-fall in the first days of 2003, after investors got their dividend payments and started selling. That stopped when foreign investors started reacting to news the company had won a $196 million order to supply cigarettes to the United Arab Emirates, double the order the same UAE company placed the year before. The company is trading at 7.5 times estimated 2003 earnings, with strong cash flow and a dividend yield of 8.4%.  In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average finished down 0.1%, or 10 points, at 8500. Yamaha Motor fell 0.9% to close at 980 yen, despite the company's bullish announcement that it expects its motorcycle sales to surge 21% in 2003. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ended down 2.6% at 332,000 yen but off a low of 325,000 yen, after the Nikkei reported that GE Capital, Cerberus and Germany's Hypovereins Bank will join forces in an effort to counter the Japanese bank's bid for a controlling stake in Aozora Bank.
