 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Driver's Seat -- Jaguar XKR: One Cool Cat That Could Use a Diet   By Sabatini, Jeff, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2007  The 2007 Jaguar XK has been on sale in the U.S. for just over a year, and its success -- at least by Jaguar's standards -- is undeniable. Writers for car-enthusiast magazines have adored the sleek coupe, while, more importantly, civilians who encounter the new XK on the road tend to swivel their heads and stare, if not precipitate near-collisions in their attempts to gain better vantage. Jaguar dealers in the U.S. have been moving roughly 415 of the cars each month, making the XK Jaguar's best-selling model so far this year.  While this may sound like good news, if you're a Ford shareholder, nothing could be further from the truth. Jaguar's struggling corporate parent never intended that a $75,000-plus sports car should be outselling the lower-priced and supposedly higher-volume sedans that make up the rest of Jaguar's lineup. Take a look at that miserable trio, however, and it's easy to see why their sales are moribund. The big XJ sedan is a nice enough car, but its traditional styling has effectively masked the technological and performance improvements that accompanied an expensive 2004 redesign. The S-Type and X-Type are even older models, and more to the point, neither has ever offered a compelling or even competitive sales pitch to prospective buyers.  While the XK's roughly 5,000 sales per annum in the U.S. represent not even a drop in Ford's leaky bucket, it's significant that a sports car is now topping the charts at Jaguar. For years, the various powers-that-be at Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., have been mucking about, trying (and failing) to figure out what this once- revered British brand should or could mean here in the nifty 50. The answer should be plainly obvious: Jaguar once built the world's most beautiful sports cars, and that must again serve it as a raison d'etre.
