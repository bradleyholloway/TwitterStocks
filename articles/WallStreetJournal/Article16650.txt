 Junk Bonds Ride Steady Economy To Stay on Top   By Sullivan, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2006  "There's been a pattern of numbers that ebb and flow" on a month-to- month basis, said Margaret Patel, portfolio manager at Pioneer High Yield Fund, with some $6.5 billion in assets. "The economy is very strong," she said.  Some people spend "an inordinate amount of time worrying about where high-yield spreads are," said Greg Hopper, who manages $300 million in high-yield assets, including the Julius Baer Global High Yield Fund. Risk premiums become an issue only when the economy is on the verge of recession, or if there is a financial crisis, he said.
