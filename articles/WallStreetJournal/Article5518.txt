 Water Utilities In Tennessee To Pool Efforts   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1997  A group of small-town utilities in a fast-growing Tennessee mountaintop enclave has formed an alliance aimed at easing mounting water-supply problems.  Six independent water districts in Cumberland County, Tenn., have signed a letter committing to work together to find a spot for a regional reservoir that would serve the county's 42,000 residents. And last month, the Nashville district office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pledged to make the project a top funding priority in the fiscal year starting in October.  In Tennessee, state officials in 1994 identified three areas that could face water-supply pinches early in the next century: southern middle Tennessee, the mountainous areas of east Tennessee and the Cumberland Plateau. All lack easy access to the state's largest rivers and lakes.
