 Executives on Trial: Trial to Resume for Ex-Officers At Tyco as Another Suit Is Filed   By Nick Baker and Beth Demain Reigber, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2003  When Tyco bought U.S. Surgical, Messrs. [Jeffrey B. Sciallo] and [Joseph Scherpf] were granted 415,818 and 559,708 Tyco options, respectively, in exchange for their U.S. Surgical options. This exchange was negotiated as part of Tyco's acquisition of U.S. Surgical.  Along with Tyco, former CEO Mr. [L. Dennis Kozlowski] and ex-finance chief Mr. [Mark Swartz] are listed as defendants in the lawsuit. So are Frank Walsh, who sat on Tyco's board at the time of the U.S. Surgical purchase five years ago, and Mark Belnick, Tyco's former general counsel.  When the accounting issues became public in the summer of 2002, Tyco's stock plummeted, leaving Mr. Sciallo's and Mr. Scherpf's options worthless at their October 2002 expiration. The suit says they asked Tyco to extend the expiration date but that Tyco declined.
