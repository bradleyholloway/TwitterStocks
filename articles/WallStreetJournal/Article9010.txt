 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / NORTHWEST --- Heard in the Northwest: Eyeing a Ride on Alaska Air? Some Enthusiasts Are Already Boarding   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1998  Alaska Airlines spent the first half of 1998 on the ascent. But with Wall Street's restlessness and fears that a slowing economy will pinch air travel, the Seattle carrier's shares have lost substantial altitude in recent months.  Peter Jacobs, who follows Alaska Air for Seattle brokerage firm Ragen MacKenzie, is equally bullish. Mr. Jacobs upgraded the stock last week to "accumulate" from "hold." He says the shares "are compelling" at current quotes.  Indeed, the market values the carrier at less than 6.8 times trailing 12 months' earnings, and just 6.3 times the highest 1999 profit projections. More important, says Mr. [Robert] Gillam, "earnings are growing substantially faster than that." (Many on the Street contend that a company's price-earnings ratio should approximate its earnings growth one-for-one, although in the airline sector some leeway is built in because the industry is so cyclical and, often, volatile.)
