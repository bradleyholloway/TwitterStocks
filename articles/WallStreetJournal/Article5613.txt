 U.S. v. Microsoft: Neuter Microsoft? Does the World Need More Unix?   By By Paul Kedrosky, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1998  If the U.S. Justice Department is protecting consumers from Microsoft, who will protect consumers from the Justice Department? Former Justice Department lawyer Geraldine Alexis remarked recently: "I'm not sure in the Microsoft case that we have a government examining what the impact of all this is on consumers. I think they're listening too intently to competitors' complaints."  Robert Bork, now a Microsoft foe, put the case against Justice best two decades ago. In his 1978 book, "The Antitrust Paradox," he pointed out that Congress created the Sherman Antitrust Act as a "consumer welfare prescription." Given this, it is incumbent on Microsoft opponents to make it clear how hunting the software giant serves consumer welfare. To do that, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) need to spend less time lending a sympathetic ear to the likes of Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and more time answering this basic question: What would the software world look like without Microsoft?  For both the larger issues on which Microsoft is being hounded, software integration and operating-system ownership, there are useful examples that could be used to replace some of the rhetoric. Take, for example, the case of NetManage. Most people probably don't know the name, but back in 1992 NetManage was one of the first companies to produce a set of software libraries (called a TCP/IP kernel) that allowed Windows-based computers to understand Internet communications protocols. The company grew quickly -- until 1995, when Microsoft introduced Windows 95, which included its own TCP/IP kernel, whereupon NetManage sank like a stone.
