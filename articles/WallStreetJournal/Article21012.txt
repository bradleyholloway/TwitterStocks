 Letters to the Editor: Fiat's Statement on Libyan Interest   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1986  On Sept. 23, Fiat succeeded in buying out Libya's interest in the company. Two days later the Journal published an editorial that contained several incorrect statements about the event.  The editorial, resurrecting decade-old rumors, charged that Libya owned its interest in Fiat because "(Fiat chairman) Agnelli, Col. Gadhafi and Soviet representatives met in the Kremlin" and made a three-way deal involving Libyan petro-dollars, Fiat stock, and a tractor factory to be built by Fiat in the Soviet Union.
