 IRS Gets Tough on 'Rollover' Time Limits   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  More recently, though, says Ed Slott, an IRA consultant in Rockville Centre, N.Y., Uncle Sam has been denying requests for extensions.That's because investors, according to Mr. Slott, are using withdrawals for a variety of purposes and can't prove that "a true intent to do a rollover" existed in the first place. He offers some examples:  Retirement home. A person pulled money from his IRA to buy a retirement home. He assumed that sales of other properties he owned would allow him to replace the IRA funds. When those sales didn't materialize, he applied for a loan -- but 60 days passed before the loan was approved. The IRS denied his request for a waiver to complete the rollover, saying the funds had been used solely as a "short-term, interest-free loan."
