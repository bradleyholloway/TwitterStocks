 Oil Prices Surge to New Highs, Despite Saudi Production Pledge   By Chip Cummins and Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2004  Iraq's oil minister said the U.S.-led occupation in Baghdad agreed to release the funds from Iraqi oil-revenue coffers. About half of the money has been received and is earmarked for natural-gas infrastructure and refinery repairs, Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum said on the sidelines of an energy conference here. The other half, which the ministry expects to receive in coming days, will go toward reviving older wells and improving pumping infrastructure in the country's central and southern oil fields, Mr. Bahr al-Uloum said.  Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is increasing production and putting new oil fields on line this autumn to meet surging demand. In a dramatic series of statements in recent days, the kingdom -- the only major producer with significant spare capacity has called on fellow members in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost the cartel's production ceiling.  But some OPEC ministers gathered here for an energy conference had predicted this weekend that the Saudi signals would fail to lower prices. Some members vocally opposed the move, including Venezuela, which blamed high oil prices on U.S. policy in Iraq and the Middle East.
