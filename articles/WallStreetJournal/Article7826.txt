 Home Sellers Profit by Banding Together And Selling to Commercial Developers   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1988  In growing numbers, homeowners are signing pacts with each other to sell entire subdivisions at a shot. The owners are getting prices more than twice the individual appraisals on their homes by selling to commercial developers. Such joint ventures -- called assemblages -- allow homeowners to profit when encroaching office-building complexes and shopping centers threaten their life styles and the values of their homes.  As a result, Ms. Kneip and some of her neighbors have hired a commercial real-estate broker to help them make a group sale. So far, 20 of the 42 homeowners in the subdivision have joined the effort. And, if they find a buyer, they stand to profit handsomely. According to Dennis J. Hiffman, the group's broker, their homes would typically be worth about $100,000 if sold to residential buyers; for commercial use, he says, they are likely to fetch three times that amount if everyone in the subdivision signs on to sell out.  Those kinds of rewards aren't unusual. The 46 homeowners in Chicago's Ernie Pyle subdivision recently sold their 17-acre tract to developers for $16 million. The amounts homeowners received ranged from $300,000 to $500,000, or about five times their homes' individual market values, according to William Thorsness, attorney for the Ernie Pyle residents.
