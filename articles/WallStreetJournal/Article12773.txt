 Optimism Over Increasing Factory Orders Is Tempered by Service-Sector Contraction   By By Jon E. Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  Separately, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders rose by 1.2% in December, the second increase in three months. While orders are showing clear signs of stabilizing, they haven't reached their pre-Sept. 11 levels. In December, manufacturing orders rose to a seasonally adjusted level of $322.2 billion, still down from $332.4 billion in August.  Manufacturing's December performance was largely in line with expectations on Wall Street, in part because the government already had reported last week that orders for durable goods -- from airplanes to washing machines to computers -- rose by 1.7% in December. Durable goods are a large component of overall manufacturing orders.  The factory-orders report also underscored just how aggressively American companies slashed inventories in the final months of 2001. Factory inventories fell in December by 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted level of $449 billion. It was the lowest level since February 1998. The year-over-year decline was 7.4%, the largest 12-month drop in at least a decade.
