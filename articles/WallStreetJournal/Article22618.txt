 Traders Brush Aside Reports Of Efforts to Increase Production   By By Steve Liesman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2000  Meeting in London, oil ministers from Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela said definitively that they would seek a production increase when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets March 27 in Vienna. But the ministers said they haven't decided on the amount or timing of an increase, an indication they may be more interested in maintaining a hard-won unity among exporters and nurturing regional alliances than responding quickly to the pain in oil-consuming countries. "We have yet to decide by when and how much," Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Naimi said after the meeting.  Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped eight cents a barrel to $31.69 yesterday, with only a limited amount of profit-taking following Wednesday's sharp $1.34-a-barrel gain. But after the ministers' comments, traders actually bid up the price and at one point it topped $32 a barrel before backing off. Prices have nearly tripled in the past year after OPEC and several non-OPEC nations, including Mexico and Norway, reduced world supplies by about five million barrels a day, or about 6.5%. Meanwhile, demand is expected to grow by more than one million barrels a day this year.
