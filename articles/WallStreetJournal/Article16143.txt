 Gubernatorial Candidates Sidestep Debate Over Taxes --- Skittish Contenders Maintain There Are Better Solutions for States' Budget Shortfalls   By By Will Pinkston, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2002  Former Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen, the leading Democrat, preaches tighter management. "If we want to remain a low-tax state," he says, "we're going to have to have some discipline." U.S. Rep. Van Hilleary, the top Republican candidate, shrugs off an estimated $350 million state budget gap as a "short-term revenue problem," insisting it can be repaired with revised spending and the economy's eventual return to health.  In Oregon, term-limited Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber has chided gubernatorial candidates for remaining silent on the state's budget problems as he attempts to raise excise taxes and rescind a personal-income tax cut. Outgoing Kansas Republican Gov. Bill Graves is pushing a quarter-cent sales-tax increase and a sizable cigarette-tax increase even as most contenders vying to replace him decline to support his plan.  In addition to their common strategy of avoiding tax talk, Messrs. Bredesen and Hilleary are targeting the same area as ripest for cuts: TennCare. Now costing the state $1.83 billion annually -- about one-quarter of the budget -- the eight-year-old Medicaid-alternative health-care program covers about 1.4 million patients, including 550,000 who wouldn't be eligible for health coverage under traditional state and federal Medicaid rules.
