 Yukos Proposes Revamp to Avert Court Liquidation   By Fitzgerald, Patrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2006  Under the plan, Yukos subsidiaries would cancel about $13.7 billion in intercompany claims against the parent company. About $300 million from the recent $1.5 billion sale of Yukos's stake in a Lithuanian refinery to Polish oil refiner PKN Orlen SA will go to creditors. Any unpaid claims remaining by March 15, 2008, would be paid from Yukos's operating revenue.  Yukos's decision to offer a debt-for-equity deal with Kremlin-backed Rosneft is the latest in a cat-and-mouse game between Yukos and the Russian government. Yukos was forced into bankruptcy proceedings in Russia because of a deal struck between the government and a group of Western banks that had lent the oil company $485 million. However, Rosneft has since bought the $485 million loan from the banks.
