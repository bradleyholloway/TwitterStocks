 Curagen, Savient, Netflix Drop   By Cordeiro, Anjali, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2005  Energy-related stocks were among the day's big decliners as crude- oil prices tumbled. Parker Drilling (NYSE) fell 13 cents, or 1.7%, to 7.75, Core Laboratories (NYSE) dropped 76 cents, or 2.6%, to 28.05, and Input/Output (NYSE) lost 11 cents, or 1.5%, to 7.19.  Some apparel retailers rose, following the direction of large- cap Abercrombie & Fitch, which was upgraded to "outperform" from "peer perform" by Bear Stearns, partly because of intermediate and long-term growth prospects. Among small stocks, Children's Place added 80 cents, or 2.1%, to 38.83, and Dress Barn gained 34 cents, or 1.4%, to 25.26.
