 Why Sweat the Small Stuff?   By Pozen, Robert C, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2006  The SEC has adopted two different requirements for internal controls. First, it has defined "internal control structure and procedures . . . for financial reporting" under Section 404 to include more items of information with more details than those ordinarily included in the financial reports of public companies. In the commission's view, internal controls must provide reasonable assurance not only that material information in the company's financial statements is accurate, but also "that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the company." By unlinking "internal controls" from "financial reporting" in Section 404, the SEC encourages management and auditors to scrutinize detailed procedures for controlling ordinary expenditures -- e.g., reimbursing travel expenses and handling petty cash -- even in cases where they are clearly immaterial to the company's financial reports.  Second, the SEC requires management to assess a public company's "disclosure controls" -- defined as "controls and other procedures . . . designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports it files" with the commission "is recorded, processed, summarized and reported" in a timely manner. This rule on "disclosure controls" is very confusing since it overlaps with the rule on "internal controls." The SEC should end this confusion by combining both into one rule on "internal controls" over "financial reporting," which would cover the accuracy and timeliness of "material" information submitted by public companies in their financial reports to the commission.
