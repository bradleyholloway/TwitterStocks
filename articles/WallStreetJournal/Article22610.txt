 Fashion's New Frontier: Racy Lingerie for the Larger-Size Woman --- Lane Bryant, With Inspiration From Victoria's Secret, Adds Gauzy Chemises, Teddies   By By Rebecca Quick, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2000  Over the past two years, Lane Bryant has turned its focus from comfortable, baggy styles to the body-hugging fashions so popular in smaller sizes. It has hired a team of fashion designers from outside the big-size arena. And it has carefully groomed a hip image, touting full-figured celebrity spokesmodels such as former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith and Camryn Manheim of ABC's "The Practice."  Now, Lane Bryant is staking claim to a new frontier of large-size fashion: sexy lingerie.  This week, the chain kicked off a campaign to introduce its new undergarment line with a racy fashion show that borrowed heavily from Victoria's Secret, also owned by Limited. The show -- complete with the unabashed logo "Big Girls Take Back the Night" -- touted big models in gauzy chemises and thong underwear strutting down the runway to thumping club music.
