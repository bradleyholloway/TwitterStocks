 Gear Up for the Market's Climb (Or Fall)   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2005  While stocks aren't especially expensive, given continued low interest rates, they aren't exactly cheap. The Standard & Poor's 500- stock index trades at a price-earnings multiple of about 16 times this year's expected earnings, a figure that is toward the high end of the historical range. At the same time, oil prices remain stubbornly high, and worries remain about how well debt-laden U.S. consumers will hold up. Indeed, a jump in oil prices on Friday helped pull down the market.  Meanwhile, the utility business is consolidating, highlighted by the recently announced deal by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to buy U.S. utility PacifiCorp for more than $5 billion. There remain large regulatory obstacles to deals in the business, so a wave of mergers is unlikely in the near term. But searching for utilities that might be acquired down the road, yet still are attractive if a deal doesn't materialize, could be a savvy move.  Shares of media mogul Barry Diller's Interactive also have been in the doghouse in the past year, but analysts are starting to raise their earnings and revenue projections a bit. A move later this year to split the company's travel assets, like Expedia, with its online- commerce businesses, such as Ask Jeeves, could boost shares, some say. "The upcoming spin-off should create some net positives" by making a company with 42 varied businesses easier to evaluate, argues Anthony Noto, a Goldman Sachs analyst.
