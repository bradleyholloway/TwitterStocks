 MarketWatch: What's For Sale to Battle Identity Theft   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2006  LifeLock in Chandler, Ariz., says it prevents a lot of identity theft with its $10-a-month service ($110 if you prepay for a year) placing "fraud alerts" on people's files at the major credit-reporting firms. If, say, someone applies for credit for a big-screen TV, the alert prods the retailer to call the person to verify identity.  Such a service "certainly would reduce your risk of identity theft," says Chris Hoofnagle in San Francisco, senior counsel with the Electronic Privacy Information Center. But "whether it's worth $120 a year is debatable, because it's very easy to file a fraud alert. [Consumers can] just call up. It's all automated." The Federal Trade Commission's www.consumer.gov/idtheft/ has more information. (Click "steps to take" in the first paragraph.)  "The whole field is so red-hot," says James Hudson, president of Amcrin Corp. in West Linn, Ore., which operates a network for sharing fraud information among financial firms, retailers and law enforcement agencies. "Eventually, it'll all consolidate into a few firms that'll probably offer all these services. Wait to see which ones shake out and are still around a year from now."
