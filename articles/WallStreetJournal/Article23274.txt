 Fed Sees Bond Market Hampering Its Steps to Keep Inflation in Check   By Ip, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2005  Low bond yields "are telling the Fed their job isn't done and they have to keep going," said Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and now an analyst at forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers. Mr. Meyer thinks the Fed eventually will raise its short-term rate to 4% from today's 3.25%, if bond yields rise significantly. If long-term rates don't rise, the Fed will have to raise short-term rates above 4.5%, he said.  For months, Fed officials have debated the reasons long-term rates have declined. In February, Chairman Alan Greenspan labeled it a "conundrum." In a speech last week, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Janet Yellen said the debate "boils down to whether the [drop] is due to various 'special factors' operating independently of the current business cycle, or instead augurs bad economic news on the horizon."  In the past month, other key Fed policy makers have come to view special factors as the likelier explanation for low long-term rates than economic weakness. Many factors influence bond yields: expected inflation, which erodes an investor's purchasing power; the world-wide supply and demand for credit; what economists call a "term premium," the extra yield that investors demand for the many risks of lending money over a longer term, including fluctuations in economic growth and inflation; and Fed actions.
