 A Harvard Education   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2002  It was no great surprise, then, that Mr. [Lawrence H. Summers] should find himself in trouble with members of the Afro-American Studies Department. It all began when department colleagues rallied 'round Professor Cornel West. They were outraged by reports that Mr. Summers had subjected Mr. West to insulting criticism during the course of a private meeting last October -- a charge Mr. Summers has emphatically denied. Mr. West, who recorded a rap album while on medical leave from the university, nonetheless left the meeting highly affronted -- reportedly by the president's suggestion that he undertake a serious scholarly work and by a certain implied criticism about grade inflation in the course he taught.  This was what led, supposedly, to the flurry of threats that Mr. West and other Black Studies scholars might leave Harvard for Princeton. And it brought -- like political clockwork -- the Reverend Jesse Jackson racing to Cambridge last week to express alarm that the president of Harvard lacked commitment to affirmative action.  Harvard's president had clearly wandered off the reservation, especially with warnings about grade inflation -- an undeniable scandal at Harvard, where one out of two grades now given is an A- or an A -- and his lack of explicit support for affirmative action. Clearly the time was ripe for big scenes, outrage fests and public threats about leaving Harvard, all intended to instruct the new president that he was not there to do anything so rash as to reaffirm traditional academic standards or think for himself.
