 Mobile Companies Face Text Backlash   By Faucon, Benoit, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2003  "French consumers are overpaying 400 million euros to mobile operators every year on [text messages], which means billions of euros are overcharged on a European basis," said Julien Dourgnon, a researcher at UFC-Que Choisir.  Italian consumer group Codacons said it asked the Italian Antitrust Authority to investigate whether Italy's three carriers -- Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile SpA and Wind Infostrada SpA -- have formed a cartel on text messaging. All three denied being part of a cartel.  A Telecom Italia Mobile official said most users don't pay the standard 15-European-cent rate, as most messages are sent by young customers who sign up for promotional rates -- such as the current "Christmas card" offer of 600 messages for 7 euros, less than 10% of the standard rate. Vodafone Italy said pricing was determined by marketing choices.
