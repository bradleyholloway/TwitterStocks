 Microsoft Could Hit Bumps In Low-Cost Windows Rollout; Computer Makers' Delay Hurts Firm's Plan to Move Into Developing Countries   By Buckman, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2004  "It's a significant step forward that Microsoft is even addressing this market," says Dion Wiggins, a Hong Kong-based analyst with research firm Gartner Inc. who has studied the new Windows XP Starter Edition. But he says Microsoft "is only reaching a fraction of their potential [users] because of the way they're going about this."  Gartner's Mr. Wiggins says Starter Edition, at least in its current form, may not be a big hit in developing countries and could prove too limiting for many families buying their first PC. That's partly because the software allows users to open only three applications at a time, restricting the number of tasks people can perform and hindering activities such as instant messaging. The software also offers very limited word-processing capability, no out-of-the-box Internet access and a screen resolution that won't support many newer computer games, Mr. Wiggins noted in a recent report.
