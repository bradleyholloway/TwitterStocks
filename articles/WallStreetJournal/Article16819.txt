 Shake-Up at Citigroup: Citigroup's Focus on Japan May Become Less Clear; Departing Chief Prince Put Nation at the Center Of Expansion Strategy   By Morse, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  Citigroup now hopes to buy the rest of Nikko Cordial in a stock swap it expects to close in January. The deal calls for Citigroup to give Nikko Cordial shareholders 1,700 yen ($14.81) in Citigroup shares for each share of Nikko Cordial they own. If Citigroup's stock price falls below $26, Nikko Cordial has the right to cancel the deal.  While it seems unlikely the deal will be canceled, Citigroup's plans in Japan are designed with the assumption that Nikko Cordial will be a wholly owned subsidiary. Citigroup is considering integrating some of Nikko Cordial's operations with its own, a process that will be much easier if Citigroup owns all of Nikko Cordial.
