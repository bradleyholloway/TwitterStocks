 How 8 Airports Bucked Trend In Late Arrivals   By Conkey, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2007  Four are in California -- San Diego, Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco -- apparently benefiting from unusually dry conditions this year in the Golden State. Houston's rain-battered George Bush Intercontinental has also seen a modest uptick in timely landings, as has the world's busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. (The other two: Las Vegas and Chicago's Midway.)  Earlier this year, the airport built a strip of pavement connecting runway 26R to the terminal area by wrapping around the end of 26L. Planes taking off from 26L now soar over jets winding along this new strip, dubbed Taxiway Victor. The new route requires planes landing on the first runway to traverse a longer path, but it has increased the airport's efficiency because planes on the two runways no longer interfere with each other.  For many other airports, congestion and delays may continue unless demand for air travel slows. The FAA is hoping to redesign New York's airspace, which accounts for one-third of all U.S. commercial airline activity, to free up additional routes. But even if the airspace gets more flexible, problems on the ground loom as a major hurdle. There are no new runways planned at New York's three major airports, and no room for more anyway.
