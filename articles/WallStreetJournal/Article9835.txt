 Standing Firm In the Markets After a Disaster   By Stewart, James B, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2005  It isn't easy to write an investing column when the suffering of millions fills our TV screens. I read the business press with a certain dismay in the days after the scope of the damage mounted. I'm glad I wasn't a trader expected to comb the news for profit opportunities, such as shorting auto stocks on the theory that high gas prices will put a stake into the heart of already-faltering SUV sales; or buying long-term Treasurys on the theory that the Federal Reserve will now abandon its campaign to raise short-term interest rates; or snapping up shares in heavy-equipment manufacturers likely to cash in on the massive reconstruction needed along the Gulf Coast.  Of course, this is how markets are supposed to work, rapidly deploying capital where it is most needed. We're lucky that we have an economy that is so responsive and flexible. It's just that I didn't feel like trying to make money from someone else's catastrophe. And so I did nothing at all in my own portfolio.  I'm sure economists and philosophers could debate that issue at length, but as investors, we're free to invest -- or not invest -- for whatever reasons we want. Buying in the week after Sept. 11 had the virtues of helping provide liquidity for those eager to sell and sending a message to terrorists that the economy wasn't going to be crippled. As it turned out, it was also a very good investment.
