 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2003; Commodities Markets Surge Again; As World-Wide Demand Grows, Gold Crosses $400, While Natural Gas Soars   By McKay, Peter A, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 2004  The continuing growth of the American economy also should boost commodity prices for the foreseeable future, said James Glassman, senior U.S. economist for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. "Industrial activity all around the world is taking off," Mr. Glassman said. "Personally, I'm cheered by it. I don't really see inflation as a worry -- yet."  Meanwhile, U.S. inventories are running low, according to the Energy Information Administration, the Department of Energy's statistics arm. Through mid-December, EIA reported stockpiles of crude were at 272.8 million barrels, more than 9% below the five-year average and close to the 270 million-barrel level that is often considered a sign of unusually low inventories. "I don't want to make it sound like it's a cliff you fall off, but it certainly is an indicator of tightness," said EIA Administrator Guy Caruso.  Jeffrey Christian, managing director of the New York-based research firm CPM Group, doesn't expect a dip back to those levels, but he notes that spikes in gold investment demand usually last only a year or two. "I won't necessarily say it's going to end tomorrow, but there's no guarantee it's going to run too much further, either," Mr. Christian said.
