 OPEC's Influence on Prices Depends On Production Discipline, Quota Action   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  Petroleum prices are up some 50% this year largely as a result of OPEC's production accord of November. How OPEC resolves the new issues could help determine whether prices stay there, rise or retreat, oil ministers and industry officials agree.  The first test will be how well OPEC maintains production discipline during the second quarter. During the first quarter, excess output beyond its first-half ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day was absorbed by higher-than-expected demand.  But demand in the second quarter is usually seasonally weak. As a result, the ability of the market to absorb much additional oil from OPEC without a break in prices will be diminished. Mindful of this, several leading OPEC members are putting new pressure on such chronic quota cheaters as the United Arab Emirates.
