 Mission Creeps   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2004  Americans United is selective in its opposition to government funding of religious expression. The group filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the 1998 case of National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, in which it unsuccessfully urged the Supreme Court to overturn a law imposing "decency and respect" restrictions on NEA grantees. Among the NEA-funded works that had prompted Congress to impose the regulations was Andres Serrano's notorious photograph "Piss Christ," which depicted a crucifix submerged in the photographer's urine.
