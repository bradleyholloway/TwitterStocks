 Two 'Cold-Fusion' Scientists Still Insist New Data Will Confirm Their Claims   By By Richard L. Hudson and Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1989  The two scientists, B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton, England, said their new report will demonstrate in much more detail than previously that their simple laboratory fusion device produced more energy as heat than it consumed electrically.  The researchers, who have avoided contact with reporters for several weeks, were interviewed by telephone at Mr. Fleischmann's home near Salisbury, England, where they've secluded themselves to finish writing their scientific paper. Other than to say that their paper confirms their earlier work and rebuts their critics, the pair declined to say where or when the paper will be published or to hint at its contents. Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann said several weeks ago they expected to have data from new experiments by July and to publish the data perhaps as early as August.  The University of Utah and General Electric Co. announced a collaboration under which GE is assigning four of its scientists to work with Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann. And Johnson Matthey PLC, the big British precious-metals producer, said it is considering broadening its collaboration with the two "cold-fusion" scientists.
