 Steelmakers, Unions Pressure Bush on Tariffs   By By Robert Guy Matthews, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2002  Fearing that the recent tariffs on foreign steel could lose much of their impact, U.S. steelmakers and unions are stepping up pressure on the Bush administration to resist granting hundreds of tariff exemptions to foreign steel companies, whose countries are threatening to spark a retaliatory trade war.  Grant Aldonas, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for international trade, insists exemptions won't undermine the tariffs. The tariffs, announced by President Bush in March, consist of surcharges of 8% to 30% on a wide variety of imported steel. The moves raised an immediate outcry, especially in Europe and Japan, and with both sides stepping up lobbying pressure, the steel row could escalate. Yesterday, the European Union, which has been vehemently opposed to the U.S. steel tariffs, offered a tempting salvo to the Bush administration: Give our steelmakers enough exemptions, and we will nix our plan to tax $360 million of incoming U.S. goods.
