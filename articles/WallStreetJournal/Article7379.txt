 European Report: American Express Finds It Chilly In Sweden; Belfast as Tourist Mecca   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1985  More than 200 Swedish hotels, restaurants and shops made good yesterday on their threat not to renew contracts to honor American Express cards. The Hotel and Restaurant Association is objecting to the U.S. company's policy of offering better commissions to affiliates doing the most business. Other credit-card concerns operating in Sweden offer all affiliates the same commission rates.  Jan Ling, head of the Stockholm restaurant Operakaelleran, who has stayed on the sidelines, says pressure is growing in the industry association for an all-out boycott of American Express. He says he doesn't see how major hotels and restaurants can survive without accepting the cards.  U.S. visitors, spurred by the strong dollar, are leading the boom, their numbers rising 19% last year after a 30% increase in 1983. Packages for travelers yearning to renew their family roots are a big draw. Some 20 million Americans trace their families to Northern Ireland. The tourist board has created a "Heritage Trail" highlighting sites with U.S. connections, such as the newly restored homesteads once owned by the ancestors of former presidents Jackson and Grant.
