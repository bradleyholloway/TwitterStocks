 The Next Tax Cut   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2002  Expanding tax-free retirement accounts will help those who've watched their security blankets, um, fray and will enlarge the amount of saving that is sheltered from taxes. Raising the limit on capital losses will reduce tax bites overall and restore some symmetry to the treatment between capital gains and losses. And eliminating the double taxation of dividends will encourage companies to start paying them again -- thereby freeing retained earnings to be reinvested by its rightful owners, the shareholders. It will also begin to integrate corporate and personal income taxes, a step toward larger tax reform.  The final argument for such tax cuts is moral. Double taxation of any kind, as currently on dividends, is fundamentally unfair. Allowing only $3,000 a year in deductions for capital losses is also unfair when the government gets to tax every capital gain. Americans seem to understand instinctively the moral case against onerous taxation, and it is the reason so many Democrats voted to repeal the estate tax (albeit until 2010).
