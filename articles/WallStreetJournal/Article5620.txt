 Tax Measure Aids Investors, Home Sellers   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  One significant provision will cut by a third the length of time an investor must hold a stock, bond or other investment to qualify for the most-favorable capital-gains tax rate. Another will effectively wipe out most or all taxes for many people who make a profit on selling a home they have owned for fewer than two years.  Other provisions will mean significant changes in the way some people interact with the IRS. Separated or divorced taxpayers will find it easier to avoid getting hit by tax debts run up by a spouse or ex-spouse. Taxpayers in general will have more defenses against overzealous IRS agents. The new legislation "is going to make a lot of taxpayers breathe a sigh of relief," says Martin Nissenbaum, national director of personal income-tax planning at Ernst & Young in New York.  CAPITAL GAINS. The bill reduces the capital-gains holding period, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, eliminating a complex timing requirement introduced by the 1997 tax law. As a result, investors will no longer be required to hold stocks, bonds and certain other types of investments for more than 18 months to pay taxes on their profits at the most favorable rates. The new holding period will now be more than 12 months, as it was before last year's tax law.
