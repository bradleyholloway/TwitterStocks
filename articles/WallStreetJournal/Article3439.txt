 German Tire Maker Continental Reinvents Itself for the Future   By By Tim Aeppel, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2001  In 1998, Continental bought a German brake company called Teves from ITT Industries Inc. Last month, it bought a 60% stake in DaimlerChrysler AG's Temic auto-electronics business, with rights to buy the rest of the business later. Some analysts think Continental will do more shopping.  Mr. [Stephan Kessel] confirmed that Continental is looking at Sachs, an auto-part division of Siemens AG that makes auto parts such as shock absorbers and which is currently for sale. He declined to elaborate. "It might not even be necessary to do further acquisitions," said Mr. Kessel.
