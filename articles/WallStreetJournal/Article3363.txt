 The Gallery: Renaissance Man of the East --- Collector, Calligrapher, Ceramist And More, Hon'Ami Koetsu Was a Nexus of Exquisite Arts   By By Matthew Gurewitsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2000  There are paintings by Tawaraya Sotatsu (on papers washed in gold or imprinted in pulverized mica, the work of craftsmen who were masters in their own right), to which Koetsu added the finishing touch of calligraphy, sometimes so subtle as to seem all but camouflaged. There is lacquerware carried out according to his inventive designs, incorporating into that unabashedly luxurious medium the bluish hue of "base" lead, a Koetsu innovation. There are playscripts of his beloved Noh drama. We learn, too, of his mastery of the tea ceremony.  The second simulation allows us to pick up a replica of a priceless Koetsu tea bowl, tilt it this way and that and even look "through" it with virtual X-ray vision, appreciating how finely and evenly the master worked the clay while preserving a beautifully homespun exterior. The glaze of the bowl itself, on view in the next room, seems a spray of foam washed over dark stone. The beauty Koetsu and his circle capture with such painstaking art is of a type that in nature vanishes in a heartbeat.  This apparently effortless delicacy did not come naturally. Koetsu was born into a world of civil war, trained by his father in the honored profession of polishing and appraising swords. He lived to see his native Kyoto -- at that time Japan's only major city -- arise and flourish as a center of commerce and culture. How much he and his collaborators loved the fleeting pageant of creation is everywhere apparent in this show; so is their acceptance of its insubstantiality. In a nice paradox, their literary tastes were thoroughly conservative; in Koetsu's day, the poems he copied were already hundreds of years old. The painting, however, is often radical, as when Sotatsu added extra drops of water to blur the outlines.
