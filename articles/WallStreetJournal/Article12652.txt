 Halifax Group Agrees to Buy Equitable Life, Sought by GE   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2001  The announcement came despite a GBP 1.2 billion proposal Friday from GE Capital, the financial-services unit of General Electric Co. of the U.S., which an Equitable spokesman said wasn't a firm offer. GE Capital declined to comment on whether it would challenge Halifax's acquisition. But both Halifax and Equitable dismissed the prospect that GE could scuttle their deal, which they described as final.  Halifax said it would unconditionally pay GBP 250 million and a further GBP 250 million if certain sales and profit targets from Equitable Life are met in 2003 and 2004. Halifax said Equitable has GBP 34 billion of managed funds, which would double Halifax's Clerical Medical unit's funds under management.
