 SHOP TALK: Well, at Least One Of Them Is Right   By By Charles F. McCoy, Robert Guenther and Michael Cieply, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1987  As co-underwriter of the 50-million-share public offering of Continental stock last fall, Prudential-Bache told investors that Continental, which the government bailed out in 1984, was poised to rise from the ashes. It suggested a price of up to $6.25 a share.  Now Pru-Bache is singing a different tune. In a recent report, its top banking analysts pronounced Continental stock "overvalued" at its current trading range of about $5.75. They advised short-term investors to sell. "We think the stock's rich by about a point," says Anthony Polini, one of the analysts.  Some smart money did cash out of Continental quickly: Pru-Bache, for example, got about $1.2 million by selling its portion of the offered shares. A Pru-Bache spokeswoman won't comment on the difference of opinion between its salesmen and its analysts. But another Pru-Bache employee calls the matter "embarrassing" and says some people "caught a lot of heat."
