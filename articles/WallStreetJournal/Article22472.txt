 Accounting Rulemakers Drop Proposal Covering Options Plans at Subsidiaries   By By Elizabeth MacDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1998  Today, many parent companies offer employees of their subsidiaries options to buy the stock of the parent company. Under the accounting proposal, which the Financial Accounting Standards Board has set aside for now, subsidiaries would have had to charge to quarterly earnings the fair market value of those options in their separate financial statements.  The FASB's decision caused huge sighs of relief at companies like General Motors Corp. Such GM subsidiaries as General Motors Acceptance Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. would have had to take tens of millions of dollars in annual earnings charges for options their employees get in GM. "We opposed (accounting change) because it would have forced companies to apply different accounting principles between a parent and its subsidiaries," said GM spokesman Jim Finn. "You would have seen a footnote in the parent's financials, while the subsidiaries' earnings would have been bogged down," he added.
