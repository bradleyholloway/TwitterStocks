 Unemployment Level in March Dropped to 5.6% --- Fall From 5.7% Puts Rate At Lowest Since 1979; Increase in Jobs Posted   By By Rose Gutfeld, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1988  The March unemployment report, showing a drop in the jobless rate to 5.6% and a healthy rise in jobs, suggests the economy posted a moderate gain in the first quarter.  The report provides particularly good news for Republican candidates, as it's the firmest indication to date that a recession isn't imminent in this election year. In fact, most analysts expect economic growth to pick up somewhat in the second quarter, with consumer confidence recovered from the impact of the stock market crash and export growth continuing. On the other hand, interest rates in the financial markets have been pushed up recently by fears of inflation, and this report isn't likely to offer any reassurance on that score.  Some other signs were less clear, however. "This report is definitely a plus for the economy," said Robert Wescott, vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "But it's a bit quirky." The job growth was uneven; manufacturing employment actually fell by 1,000 after a 17,000-job rise the month before. The average factory workweek was down to 40.9 hours from 41, with overtime unchanged at 3.7 hours. Overall, weekly hours fell to 34.6 from 34.8.
