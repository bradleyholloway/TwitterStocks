 Love & Money: I Now Pronounce You...Business Partners   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2006  The result is that while we've been partners for half of our lives, this is unfamiliar ground for both of us. I thought that I knew everything there was to know about my wife, and that we'd interact in business just as we do in everyday situations. But instead, we're like newlyweds, uncertain of what to expect and learning to navigate money and relationship issues from a whole new perspective. When it comes to relationships, I've discovered, you don't really know your partner until you get down to business.  Compounding the problem is that as life partners, we're used to our different personalities. We've come to accept them. As business partners, we aren't quite there yet. [Amy] is quintessential Type A -- so meticulously organized, she'll make a list of tasks, complete one not on that list, then add it to the list after she's done.  "I'm not trying to be domineering," she later told me when I interviewed her for this column. "It's just that I have a business to run, and I'm not laissez-faire about it. We're accountable to each other for our success, and I want to make sure it is a success. If that means I take the reins because that's not your style, then that's what I'm going to do. I'm not like that in our home life because there's a difference between home and business. But what we're doing is a business. So what you're seeing is me switching between those two roles."
