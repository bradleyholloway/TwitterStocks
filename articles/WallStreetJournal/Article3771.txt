 Crews May Be Able To Rescue the Hubble With Little Safety Risk   By Begley, Sharon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2004  That argument isn't washing in the tightknit community of former astronauts. "Give me a break," says one who is now in academia. "You're not going to launch the shuttle again unless you think you've fixed the problem that took out Columbia, so that one [requiring safe haven] won't happen again. What will get you next time is a problem that keeps you from reaching ISS at all. That makes a mission to Hubble no riskier than one to the ISS."  "If we don't attach a booster during a shuttle mission, we'll have to do it robotically, and we don't know how," especially if Hubble's gyros have failed and it is spinning wildly, says another former astronaut turned academic.  The new telescopes will not observe in the many wavelengths (especially ultraviolet) that Hubble does, and so will lack its breadth. It's hard to top Hubble's record of discovery, from helping to find a mysterious "dark energy" speeding up the universe's expansion to spying the raw materials for planets around stars. And with the spectrograph and camera the shuttle was supposed to deliver in mid-2006, "Hubble's best years were going to be ahead of it," says Dr. [Steven Beckwith].
