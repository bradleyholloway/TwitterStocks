 Country Music That Doesn't Glitter but Is Honky-Tonk Gold   By Hentoff, Nat, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2006  His two albums so far -- "Call Me Lonesome" and "Here With You Tonight" -- have done well on independent stations that report to the Americana (AMA) and the Freedom Americana Roots (FAR) charts. There's still a U.S. audience for country music without glitter. And although Mr. [Dave Insley] hasn't toured Europe since 1988, his sets make the Top 10 on the Euro Americana chart. With pride, he tells me, "we're on about 50 different radio stations, and I even get fan mail and autograph requests from Italy, Germany, England and Spain."  Of the other songs he wrote for "Here With You Tonight," Mr. Insley told me: "By the time I had recorded them, the words had all taken on new meanings for me." As his life changes, the songs he writes as a form of memoir tell him more about where he's been and what he's learned. "I try," he adds, "to use specific details or examples to convey universally understood themes. That helps the audience understand that the artist's feelings are real. When you hear the pain in [Hank Williams Jr.]'s voice, you don't even have to speak English to get the drift." (So too with [Jimmie Rodgers] in Africa.)  From Mr. Insley's "Open Road": "Time sure flies when you know you're leaving, and it moves real slow after you've gone. My heart knows what to hold onto, an open road and an old love song." And on that road, "Here With You Tonight" made its debut as No. 1, in July, on the Freedom American Roots chart.
