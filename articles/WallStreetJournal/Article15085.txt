 Capital journal: Clinton facing basic questions on Bosnian crisis   By Seib, Gerald F, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1993  Gerald F. Seib says President Clinton must soon admit that the US does have national interests in Bosnia, and that America's goal is to stop a slaughter, not solve all the Balkan's problems. Seib answers three basic questions: Why should we care about Bosnia, what's our goal and how can the U.S. and its allies enforce a peace agreement?
