 SEC Decides Not to Ban Controversial Plan Of CBOE Calling for Order-Flow Payments   By By Steven M. Sears, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2000  The SEC had until Friday to rule on the payment-for-order-flow plan that was filed this summer by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The CBOE's plan involves taxing its member specialists and dealers 40 cents for nearly every options contract they trade in order to build a war chest that could be used by the specialists to buy orders. The plan was designed to help its specialists compete with better-capitalized specialists at rival exchanges. Specialist firms had been buying orders from brokerage houses in the CBOE's most active options listings, only to execute those orders at competing exchanges.
