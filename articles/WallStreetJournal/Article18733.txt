 Tax report: Mutual-fund investors   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1995  Investors thinking about buying mutual-fund shares should be careful because stock-market mutual funds typically distribute income and capital gains to shareholders around the end of each year, usually December. If one invests shortly before such a payout, 1995 taxes generally will be owed on the entire distribution unless the shares were bought for a tax-deferred retirement account.
