 Home Stretch: At a Mortgage Lender, Rapid Rise, Faster Fall; Wall Street Fueled Growth at New Century; A Party-Hard Culture   By James R. Hagerty, Ruth Simon, Michael Corkery and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2007  Wall Street firms such as Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns also compete with subprime lenders by offering their own mortgage loans via brokers. On an online forum for mortgage brokers last week, Christopher Logan, an account executive for Morgan Stanley's recently acquired Saxon Mortgage subprime-lending arm, said his company is still eager to lend as others bow out. "With Morgan Stanley as our parent, we have the stability & strength -- which is what it takes to survive in today's subprime!" Mr. Logan wrote.  At an investor conference on Nov. 28, New Century's co-founder and chief executive, Mr. [Brad Morrice], said that despite the subprime area's problems, New Century was "well-positioned to compete and continue to profitably grow market share." Patti Dodge, an executive vice president, added that the company would continue to enjoy adequate liquidity thanks to "strong relationships with . . . Wall Street lenders."  "I just wanted to be able to eat and sleep in my house and have a roof over my head," says Ms. [Gertrude Robertson], who continues to work even though she will soon turn 90. "Every day at midnight when I go to sleep, I think maybe when I wake in the morning, they'll tell me to get out."
