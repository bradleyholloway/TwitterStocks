 Fees Questioned In U.S. Sales Of Arms to Cairo --- Report Cites Commissions Paid by American Firms Under Foreign-Aid Plan   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1993  Defense Department audits cited in a government report show a pattern of questionable commissions paid by American companies selling military equipment to Egypt under the U.S.-financed foreign-aid program.  Prepared by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, the report draws heavily on previously unpublicized data collected by the Defense Contracting Audit Agency. And its release comes as the Justice Department is stepping up its own investigation of the aid program, including payments between U.S. companies and an Egyptian concern, Unitra, which has close ties to the Cairo government.  Yesterday, New York-based Loral Corp. said it recently turned over records to the Justice Department that were related to a $227 million missile contract with Egypt. Defense auditors found that Loral had paid more than $1 million in commissions to Unitra, which has also represented such major contractors as General Electric Co. and a unit of Lockheed Corp., according to the GAO report.
