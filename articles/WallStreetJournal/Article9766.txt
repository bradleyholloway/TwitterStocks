 'A Slap in the Face to Every Veteran'   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2005  On behalf of the veterans of this nation I resent the implication by David Chu, the Pentagon's undersecretary for personnel and readiness, that veterans are nothing more than greedy pigs feeding off the government trough ("Balancing Act: As Benefits for Veterans Climb, Military Spending Feels Squeeze," page one, Jan. 25). His remarks that veterans' pay and benefits are "hurtful" and are "taking away from the nation's ability to defend itself" are a slap in the face to every veteran who took the oath to uphold and defend the Constitution against all enemies.  Unlike Dr. Chu's statements to the contrary, military retirees' retirement and health benefits aren't paid for at the expense of the active force military requirements. Rather, they are funded from the Treasury under altogether different programs than military readiness.
