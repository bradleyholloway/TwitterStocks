 Irrelevant, Not Irreverent   By By Toby Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2002  Earlier this year I was approached by an intermediary to see if I'd be interested in editing Punch. Did I think its fortunes could be turned around? The problem, as I saw it, was that it was too closely associated with Mr. [Mohamed Al Fayed], who billed himself as "the philosopher behind Punch" on the masthead. In addition to writing a weekly column called "The Thoughts of Chairman Mo," he used the magazine to try and keep alive his theory that the Princess of Wales and his son Dodi were assassinated by the Duke of Edinburgh. Unfortunately for Punch's reputation, this wasn't intended to be funny.  In recent years, Punch was overshadowed by Private Eye, the British humor magazine founded in 1961. Next to the scurrilous bi-weekly, Punch looked tired and washed-up -- it played Sonny Liston to Private Eye's Muhammad Ali. When Kurt Andersen and Graydon Carter founded Spy magazine in 1985, they sought advice from the editors of Private Eye, not Punch. By the late '80s, three editors came and went in quick succession, failing to arrest the plummeting circulation.
