 New surveys needed for world's airports   By Carey, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1996  Advanced airport surveys using the satellite-based Global Positioning System developed by the Defense Dept are giving more accurate readings that don't necessarily jibe with aeronautical charts now in use. The disparities aren't a cause for concern, but, within a few years, aircraft are going to navigate by using the GPS. Ultimately, navigation by GPS will be cheaper, and allow planes to fly closer together and land in poor visibility.
