 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- details: When Heaters Go Haute   By McMullen, Troy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2005  The purchase? A $65 space heater Mr. [Sal Melendrez] bought for its "designer element." Asks the 31-year old, "Why should I buy a heater that looks like it was from 10 years ago?"  With homeowners worrying how to trim heating costs this winter, space-heater manufacturers are chasing a new customer: Design mavens who want form -- and function -- in their heaters. Italian appliance maker De'Longhi has added two new retro models that retail for $40 to $80 and feature vintage-style controls and chrome detailing. Lasko has introduced 11 new models this year, including a black ceramic digital heater with wood-grain accents that goes for $59. The latest heater from Bionaire, which features two 30-inch-tall columns that look like miniature condo towers, sells for $99 and comes with its own remote.
