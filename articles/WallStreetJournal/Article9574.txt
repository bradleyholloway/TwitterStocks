 A Global Journal Report: Slump in Bonds Could Hamper Any Recovery; With Investors Turning to Stocks And Away from Treasurys, Yields Rise, Curbing Mortgage Lending   By Aaron Lucchetti in New York, Jason Singer in Tokyo and Michael R. Sesit in Paris, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2003  "Because [the Japanese] are big buyers of Treasurys, when they sell, they primarily sell U.S. bonds," says John Butler, chief market strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London. That also helps to explain why U.S. bonds have taken a bigger hit than their European counterparts.  Indeed, some bond-fund managers have been shifting out of Treasurys for weeks. Lee Thomas, a managing director at bond-fund company Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in a recently released letter to investors that the time had come to "sell bonds." Unless investors expected the U.S. to drop into a Japan-like swoon, "you cannot rationalize long-maturity bond yields where they are today," wrote Mr. Thomas, who also co-manages the Pimco Asset-Allocation Fund.  "The bull market for European bonds isn't over yet," says David Brown, chief European economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. in London. He predicts that 10-year Bund yields could fall to 3.5%. But, he says, "as soon as we see recovery in the U.S., that will be the death knell for bonds."
