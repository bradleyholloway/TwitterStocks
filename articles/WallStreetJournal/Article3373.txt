 By the Numbers: By the Grace of God   By By Allen Barra, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  That's wrong for two reasons. First, the Yankees hit better against lefties (.291) than against righties (.272). Second, both pitchers will start in Yankee Stadium, where they will be opposed by lefty Andy Pettitte, 8-4 in post-season ball, and Roger Clemens. Is Mr. Clemens' last start, a one-hitter against Seattle last week, an indication that he has shaken off the post-season shakes? If it is, the Mets have no match for him -- not even Mr. [Mike Hampton]. In any event, the Yankees' third and fourth starters, righthanders Orlando "El Duque" Hernandez and Denny Neagle, are at least a match for anyone the Mets will throw at them at Shea.  How did these teams get here? The Yankees, playing in a pitiful division, stumbled, then crawled, then collapsed into the playoffs, losing 13 of their last 16, failing even to clinch their division with a victory. The AL's best team, the White Sox, had their starting rotation decimated by injury. The Indians, who beat the Yankees in three out of four in New York in the season's last two weeks, failed to make the playoffs on the last day of the season. The Oakland A's, locked in a tight race for the Western crown with the Seattle Mariners, used their ace, Tim Hudson, on the last day of the regular season. That allowed the Yankees to set their pitching rotation, while the A's couldn't, giving Mr. Hudson just one start in the series against the Yankees.
