 Bailout Completed, First City Bancorp. Now Presents Huge Challenge to Abboud   By By Leonard Apcar, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1988  A. Robert Abboud had to move mountains to complete the bailout of First City Bancorp. of Texas. But that was nothing compared with the challenge he faces in convincing borrowers and customers that the bank's troubles are behind it. And Mr. Abboud knows it.  To hear Mr. Abboud tell it, he and First City are about to make the comeback of a lifetime. The 58-year-old banker, who was fired as chairman and chief executive of First Chicago Corp. after a bitter clash with the board, clearly is relishing the chance to get back in the game. Sounding like the Vince Lombardi of banking, Mr. Abboud is telling everyone that First City must return to "basic blocking and tackling" -- aggressive marketing, sound underwriting and prudent risk-taking -- if First City is ever to compete in the big leagues of banking again.
