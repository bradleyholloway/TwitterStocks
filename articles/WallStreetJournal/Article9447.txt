 Digital-Video Recorders Spur Suits --- ReplayTV Users Want To Skip Over Commercials And Share Programming   By By Nick Wingfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2002  The Motion Picture Association of America, the trade group for the movie and television industries, issued a statement calling the lawsuit "nothing more than a publicity stunt," adding the complaint mischaracterizes the nature of the industry's case against SonicBlue and ReplayTV. "We have never indicated any desire or intent to bring legal action against individual consumers for use of this device," the association said. "SonicBlue and ReplayTV were aware that they were stepping over the line of legality when they made and marketed this device. Any complaint that consumers may have is with SonicBlue and Replay."
