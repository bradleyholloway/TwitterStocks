 Internet Technology Tests AT&T's Bid For TV Subscribers   By Grant, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  It isn't clear how serious the problems are because AT&T and Microsoft executives won't discuss them. An AT&T spokesman attempted to play down the situation, calling it "a little fine tuning." A Microsoft spokesman said the technology was "on track."  Fast channel-changing is important because AT&T wants to distinguish itself from cable by eliminating the lag time in most cable systems. But this has required adding servers to the network -- adding to operating costs. It also puts high demands on the network when there is lots of channel changing, like at the end of the Super Bowl. An executive working at one AT&T vendor says the stress on the network has led to picture degradation, or pixilation, problems. A Microsoft executive disagrees that the stress caused picture problems; an AT&T executive says pixilation issues were solved months ago.  AT&T's slow rollout of IPTV has analysts speculating that the company may have to shift its TV strategy. One suggestion is that AT&T focus more on its Homezone service, which combines satellite TV with on-demand movies and other programs from the Internet. AT&T may decide to take a shortcut and simply buy its own satellite-TV operator.
