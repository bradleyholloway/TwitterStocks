 Ninja Turtle Man Has a New Concept He Thinks Will Sell --- It All Involves Cattle Cowpokes In Wild West High Jinks; Will It Pass the Kid Test?   By By Udayan Gupta, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1992  Mark Freedman, promoter of the improbable but wildly successful Turtles, is betting that kids will lap up the "C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa," with their flared nostrils, six-guns and Stetsons. He is counting especially on Moo Montana, the toughest cuss of them all.  "A champion among bulls, Moo Montana is the steadfast leader of the C.O.W.-Boys and Marshal of Moo Mesa," says the promotional verbiage on the package containing the plastic toy version of the trigger-happy critter. "Straight-shootin', courageous and quick on his hooves, Moo Montana battles the bad guys and makes the West a safer place to graze." (C.O.W., is an acronym for Code of the West.)  As Mr. Freedman sees it, cows and even cowboys are woefully underexploited in the multimedia world of animated characters. Accordingly, Mr. Freedman has laid careful plans to storm public attention with his Moo Mesa gang. The assault is further along than most people realize.
