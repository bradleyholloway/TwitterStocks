 Gaylord Held Talks to Buy BASS Inc.   By Jaffe, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1996  In recent years, Gaylord and BASS have forged a close relationship. BASS's TV show, "The BassMasters," is seen weekly by more than one million viewers on Gaylord Entertainment's Nashville Network. Gaylord is a prime sponsor of the BassMasters Classic, billed as the World Series of fishing, and other BASS events. And the two companies have talked about building a fishing museum in Nashville.  As the list of cities has narrowed, economic-development officials have been scrambling to put together incentive packages to land the company. Officials in Daytona Beach tried to bolster their $32.5 million incentive offer by assembling a crowd of more than 500 avid fishermen to greet BASS officials at the local airport. Working with the local newspaper, they flooded BASS's Montgomery headquarters with thousands of postcards bearing the message "We want BASS."  Court documents show that the lawsuit is hindering a possible deal with Gaylord. In January, lawyers for Mr. [Ray Scott] filed an emergency motion in the case alleging that attorneys for the two plaintiffs had "done everything possible to interfere with or destroy various prospective business opportunities for BASS Inc." The motion goes on to refer to Gaylord as "a prospective purchaser" of BASS.
