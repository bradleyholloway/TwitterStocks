 Oneok Strikes Back At Southern Union In Contempt Filing   By By J.C. Conklin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1999  Oneok, a Tulsa, Okla., natural-gas utility, said it asked a federal judge in Tulsa to find Southern Union in violation of a preliminary injunction that was intended to prevent Southern Union from influencing a shareholder vote on the planned merger between Oneok and Southwest Gas Corp. of Las Vegas.  The heart of Oneok's contempt motion is a suit Southern Union filed two weeks ago in Phoenix federal court charging that Southwest, Oneok and an Arizona regulator conspired to ensure that Oneok would win a takeover battle for Southwest Gas. Oneok contends that on July 19, Southern Union distributed its complaint through a public-relations firm to news media with the intent to influence shareholders.
