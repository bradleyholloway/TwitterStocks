 Sheep in Wolf's Clothing   By By Christopher Buckley, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  I was 15 minutes late for my appointment with Naomi Wolf, the feminist author I'm paying thousands each month to advise me on how to be an alpha male. I knew her time was tight, for after our session she was off to see Al Gore. Naturally, I apologized.  "Much better," she said. "That's what people today are looking for: a take-charge father figure dressed like an NPR listener. By the way, that tie you're wearing, it's all wrong."  "I want you to take up hunting," she said. "You need to start killing things. Nothing too big or furry. Birds will do. Buy the scariest-looking gun on the market, the kind teenagers use to threaten their teachers. Bring it with you to board and stockholder meetings. It will convey the message that you're the leader of the pack and that you'll splatter the walls with their brains if they don't do your bidding."
