 Scientists Produce Blood Cells From Stem Cells   By By Antonio Regalado, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  Reporting today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Wisconsin scientists describe how they incubated embryonic stem cells alongside bone-marrow cells from laboratory mice for several weeks. The mouse cells provided chemical cues that encouraged a small percentage of human stem cells to grow into blood-system cells, including white and red blood cells.  He said scientists have yet to prove that blood-system cells created in the laboratory are useful in treating disease, such as restoring the damaged immune system of a leukemia patient who has received radiation treatment. Dr. [Norman N. Iscove] said such transplants haven't succeeded in experiments on mice, despite years of effort, because the lab-grown cells fail to thrive. However, he held out the possibility that human stem cells could behave differently.
