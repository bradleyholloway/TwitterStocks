 Compact, Affordable Picture Phones May Revive Once-Heralded Technology   By By Mark Zieman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1985  These picture phones aren't the moving-picture types -- promoted by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. as long ago as the 1964 World's Fair -- which still aren't catching on with individual or corporate customers.  Rather, they allow a person to send single, freeze-frame, black-and-white and color images from one monitor to another over regular telephone lines. Several small entrepreneurial companies are trying to make picture phones portable and inexpensive enough for widespread use in corporations, small businesses and, perhaps eventually, homes. And they may be joined in the market by such giants as International Business Machines Corp., which is testing a picture phone that attaches to one of its personal computers.  A picture phone designed by Photophone Inc., San Antonio, Texas, resembles a personal computer with a camera attached by a moveable arm. By focusing the camera on a person or document and pressing a button, the user can send the picture to another unit in eight to 30 seconds. The existing phone plugs into the back of the machine; voice communication is interrupted when the picture is sent. Pictures can be stored for recall later, but prints of the pictures cannot be made.
