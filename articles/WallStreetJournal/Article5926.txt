 White House Wants Some Budget Items To Be Treated as One-Time Expenses   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  Trying to make room for President Bush's tax cuts and spending priorities, the White House wants to write off billions of dollars in pork-barrel projects as one-year expenditures -- not to be repeated by this or future Congresses.  Whatever the cut, that is money that can be redirected to pay for the president's education program or the tax cut -- all without having to eliminate any of the original pork-barrel projects. Critics complain it is an alchemist's brew because Congress is bound to appropriate money for new projects in ensuing years. No one is more annoyed than the House and Senate Appropriations committees.  "It assumes that one-year expenditures will not be replaced by new one-year expenditures, which is not a good read of this Congress," said James Dyer, the Republican staff director for the House Appropriations panel.
