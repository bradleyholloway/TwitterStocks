 Clinton's fiscal '97 budget reflects major shift toward ending deficits and 'big government'   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1996  President Clinton's fiscal 1997 budget, sent to Congress on Feb 5, 1996, marks a radical change from the one announced a year earlier, in that it makes official the concessions won by Republicans. It accepts the need to have a balanced budget by 2002, calls for slower growth of spending on Medicare and Medicaid and trims other government programs sharply. However, Republicans have already rejected its spending and tax cut numbers, so it is dead on arrival in Congress.
