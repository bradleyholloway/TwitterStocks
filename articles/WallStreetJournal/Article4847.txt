 Chrysler Aims New-Issue Sale at Institutions   By Stertz, Bradley A, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1992  Chrysler Corp is trying to raise at least $400 million by quietly selling convertible preferred shares to institutional investors. The private placement is rumored to affect at least eight million preferred shares at $50 each. Such shares could eventually convert into 22 million common shares, resulting in dilution for common-stock holders of as much as 7-8%. The preferred shares are expected to carry a 9.25% to 9.75% dividend rate.
