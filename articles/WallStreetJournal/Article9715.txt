 Grey Global Bids Could Reach $1.3 Billion As Showdown Nears; Suitors for New York Firm Are Likely to Include WPP, U.S. Private-Equity Team   By Erin White and Brian Steinberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2004  The selection of the winner lies with Grey's long-serving chairman, Edward Meyer, 77 years old, who who holds voting control over Grey. "He's going to do what he's going to do," says Jerry Green, a Grey shareholder who operates Union Securities of Kansas City, Mo. "He kind of keeps his own counsel."  For WPP, Grey gives it added bulk and access to Grey's relationship with treasured client Procter & Gamble, one of the world's biggest advertising spenders. Ad executives initially thought a conflict between big WPP client Unilever and P&G might be a hurdle to a WPP acquisition of Grey. But WPP is expected to aim to avoid this conflict by keeping Grey's ad agency as a separate, stand-alone operation -- as opposed to merging it with another WPP agency.  For Havas, Grey represents what could be its last chance to vault itself into the advertising big leagues without eventually falling prey to an acquirer itself. Grey would give Havas added heft to compete against larger rivals such as Omnicom Group Inc. and WPP. Grey's MediaCom media-buying unit in particular would give a crucial boost to Havas's small media-buying unit, MPG.
