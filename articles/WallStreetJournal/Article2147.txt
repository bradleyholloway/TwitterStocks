 Interco and Its Banks and Bondholders Tentatively Agree on Debt Restructuring   By By Francine Schwadel and George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1990  Bondholders are understood to have pressed for board representation as a condition of restructuring Interco's $1.9 billion in debt because they believe the company's problems stem from actions taken by the current board. In late 1988, the board approved an ill-fated recapitalization that fended off the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C., but left the St. Louis furniture and shoe company staggering under a heavy debt load.  The company and the bondholders are expected to agree in the next week or so on a new slate of directors. Wilbur Ross, a Rothschild Inc. managing director who is advising bondholders, said the group anticipates that Interco chairman and chief executive officer Richard Loynd will remain in those posts.  The agreement nevertheless appears to be a victory for bondholders, who agreed to swap their so-called "junk" securities for 95% of Interco's common stock. In May, Interco proposed giving the bondholders an 81% stake in the company and making no changes in the board.
