 The Americas: Mercosur, Not the Peso, Makes Argentina Uncompetitive   By By Pablo E. Guidotti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 2001  Like most customs unions, Mercosur has a common external tariff to protect the union, while tariffs and non-tariff barriers within the union are very low or zero. This encourages trade within the union but discourages commercial activity between members and the rest of the world. Nevertheless, internal Mercosur trade displayed healthy growth in the mid- and late-1990s and the union was considered a success until February 1999 when Brazil devalued the real. As the Brazilian currency dropped and the Argentine peso remained stable against the U.S. dollar, Argentine exports began to suffer. This opened a debate on the extent to which the exchange rate of any one Mercosur member could be left floating freely without damaging other members.  Argentine policy makers are now reaching the conclusion that fluctuations of the Brazilian real impose an unmanageable burden on Mercosur economies. Yet while it is true that the diving real has hampered Argentine producers who export to Brazil, it is puzzling that Argentine producers exporting to non-Mercosur markets have proved able to effectively manage the risks associated with fluctuations among the major currencies. Those currencies, as noted, are no more volatile. Remember that because of the peso peg to the dollar, Argentina's currency fluctuates de facto against the euro and the yen. And despite a significant strengthening in the dollar against the European currencies and the yen in 1996-97, exports to non-Mercosur markets continued to be healthy. At that time there were shifts in the regional destinations for exports bound for non-Mercosur markets but there was no significant deterioration in total non-Mercosur exports.
