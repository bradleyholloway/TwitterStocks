 Venezuelan Beer Moguls Fight To Control Peruvian Monopoly --- Cisneros, Polar and Bavaria Pursue Backus & Johnston And a Rare Healthy Market   By By Marc Lifsher, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2002  The struggle pits Gustavo Cisneros of the Cisneros Group against Lorenzo Mendoza, chief executive of Empresas Polar. A third suitor, Colombia's Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, led by billionaire Julio Mario Santo Domingo, also recently purchased a significant minority stake in the Peruvian beer maker, Backus & Johnston SAA. Cisneros says it has a 22% interest in Backus; Polar says it holds about 22%; Bavaria says it has 24.5%.  For now, Polar and Cisneros must share seats on Backus's board of directors, along with Bavaria and Peruvian stockholders. Polar recently accused Cisneros of colluding with Bavaria to evade Peruvian securities laws that require a holder of more than 25% of a company's stock to tender a public offering for all the company's shares before seeking a boost in ownership.
