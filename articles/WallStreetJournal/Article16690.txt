 Jobs Knew Apple Manipulated Some Option Grants   By Charles Forelle, James Bandler and Nick Wingfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2006  Apple's own probe found that Mr. Jobs, the company's chief executive, wasn't aware of the accounting implications of the manipulated options, and that there was "no misconduct" by him or any other member of current management. But the conclusions suggest that Mr. Jobs, who is one of the country's most-revered technology icons and widely considered Apple's creative nucleus and the embodiment of its brand, could face further scrutiny.  Apple didn't name the former executives whose actions it cited, but it said that director Fred Anderson, an ex-executive who served as finance chief during the time of the backdated grants, resigned from Apple's board. Mr. Anderson informed Apple's board of his resignation on Saturday night by email, a person familiar with the matter said.  It isn't clear which 15 grants Apple's outside lawyers deemed to be troublesome. But in several cases between 1997 and 2001, Apple executives received grants dated just ahead of sharp increases in the company's share price. One grant, dated Jan. 17, 2001, went to Mr. Anderson and three other top officers, but not Mr. Jobs. Apple's shares leapt the next day, rising a total of 29% by the end of the month. The four executives later exercised many of those options for total profits of more than $100 million.
