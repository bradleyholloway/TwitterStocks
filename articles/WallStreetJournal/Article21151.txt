 Sawyer's Election Likely to Spark Chicago Brawl That Could Spell Headache for Democratic Party   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1987  Mr. Sawyer, a black alderman popular with enemies of the late Mayor Harold Washington, was named mayor by a mostly white coalition of his colleagues at 4:01 a.m. CST yesterday after one of the wildest days this politically raucous city has seen in years.  But Mr. Sawyer's election seems likely to plunge the city and especially its black community into 16 months of warfare that could weaken Democrats here and nationally, and make the infighting that gave Chicago its "Beirut" label seem mild. Mr. Sawyer was bitterly opposed by black activists, who fear he will yield power to the white-run, patronage-rich Democratic machine Mr. Washington had beaten. Twenty-three of the 29 aldermen who voted for Mr. Sawyer are remnants of the old machine. Some Democrats fear the fighting among Mr. Sawyer's supporters and critics could even trigger the election of a Republican when the overwhelmingly Democratic city next goes to the polls to vote for a mayor in April 1989.  Though Mr. Sawyer is black and was part of Mr. Washington's coalition -- he was the first black alderman to endorse Mayor Washington in the 1983 race -- he isn't considered an idealist by his colleagues. The 54-year-old former city worker -- who couldn't be reached for comment yesterday -- was first elected in 1971 as part of the Daley machine, and his ties with its survivors are strong. His opponents charge that he was a behind-the-scenes critic of his popular predecessor. Moreover, he has numerous relatives on the city payroll, to the dismay of those who backed Mayor Washington's efforts to reduce patronage jobs.
