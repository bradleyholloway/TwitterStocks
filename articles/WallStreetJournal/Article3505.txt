 Will Hollywood, Diller Spell Harm For French Film?   By By John Carreyrou, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2001  As Vivendi increasingly shifts its attention to Hollywood, French filmmakers worry that Canal Plus's commitment to less-profitable French movies will wane. "French cinema is in great danger because Canal Plus is a very important partner," says Mr. [Constantin Costa-Gavras], who has also directed a few Hollywood movies, including "Missing" starring Jack Lemmon.  Mr. [Pierre Lescure]'s diminished role within Vivendi is itself another concern for French filmmakers, who fear that Vivendi's management is becoming too Americanized. Mr. [Barry Diller] now will head Vivendi Universal Entertainment, stripping Mr. Lescure of part of his clout as head of Vivendi's TV and film division.  Mr. Lescure played down talk of his demotion at yesterday's news conference, noting that he remained co-chief operating officer and board member of Vivendi -- two titles that Mr. Diller doesn't have -- and that Mr. Diller would have to attend the monthly meetings he will co-chair. "If tomorrow I have a disagreement with Barry Diller, we'll go to [Jean-Marie Messier] and Messier will arbitrate," he said.
