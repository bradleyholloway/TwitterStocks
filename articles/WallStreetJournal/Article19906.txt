 The Roots of America   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2005  Being the son of immigrants who came here with no assets or social support, I believe the article didn't capture the essence of immigrant families and what makes them succeed. The immigrants themselves sacrificed much to get to the U.S. In contrast to natives, they appreciate every opportunity they have in this country that doesn't exist in their native land. It may be the ability to obtain a job, any job. It may also be that they are paid a decent wage. In some circumstances it may be the unique experience of speaking freely without fear of imprisonment.
