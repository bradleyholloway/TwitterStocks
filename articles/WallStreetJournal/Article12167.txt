 Stopgap Dentistry: An Unapproved Use For Krazy Glue --- In a Pinch, People Will Try All Sorts of Crazy Things To Restore a Toothy Smile   By By Patricia Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1997  Just hours before he was to leave on a trip to New York, Frank Locante was in front of the mirror trying to blow-dry his teeth.  Actually, just one tooth, the one he broke eating popcorn the night before. He decided to mend it with Dentemp, an over-the-counter product his dentist, in a late-night phone consultation, recommended as a stopgap. It takes just minutes to apply to a dry tooth, which is where the blow-dryer comes in. "I finally wedged it in," says Mr. Locante, who lives in a Pittsburgh suburb. "Surprisingly, it worked."  Dr. Price abhors self-dentistry. "Unless you're on a mountaintop somewhere and your cell phone doesn't work," he sees no excuse for not contacting a dentist, though he has had some ill-timed dental calamities of his own. Once, he bit into a fork and broke porcelain off a capped tooth. He "wedged" it on to temporarily keep it in place. "I didn't use Duco Cement," he emphasizes. Dr. Price admits, however, that some home remedies work pretty well: for instance, biting on a moist tea bag to control bleeding after a tooth is pulled.
