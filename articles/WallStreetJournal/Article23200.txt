 Gonzales to Face Prisoner-Policy Questions; Senators Plan to Address Attorney General Nominee's Role in Shaping Detainee Guidelines   By Bravin, Jess, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2005  In a Jan. 25, 2002, draft memo, Mr. [Alberto R. Gonzales] advised the president that the war on terrorism "renders obsolete" the Geneva Conventions' prohibition of coercive interrogations. Just two weeks later, Mr. [Bush] adopted much of Mr. Gonzales's legal position, asserting in a Feb. 7 directive that he held the power to "suspend" the Geneva Conventions and that suspected terrorists "are not legally entitled" to humane treatment. The president deemed it unnecessary to suspend the treaty by deciding that al Qaeda and Taliban fighters weren't covered by it and directed, "as a matter of policy," prisoners were to be treated "humanely."  Mr. Gonzales has dismissed claims that legal reasoning in high- level, confidential memorandums contributed to abuse in the field, and administration officials often cite the president's direction that prisoners be treated humanely. Such issues as the president's authority to order torture or suspend the application of treaties and federal laws provided only a "broad legal framework" from which the president "ultimately adopted more narrowly tailored policies," Mr. Gonzales said at a June news conference.  Mr. Gonzales's supporters say that he was willing to rethink tough legal questions after Sept. 11. "He was the recipient of some advice which basically was meant to mark out the outer boundaries on those questions but which didn't purport to answer any of the questions as a policy matter," said Bradford Berenson, who was an associate White House counsel under Mr. Gonzales. "The prevailing attitude throughout the entire administration in the weeks and months after 9/11 was to be as aggressive and creative as possible in meeting the challenge posed by al Qaeda and other terrorist groups."
