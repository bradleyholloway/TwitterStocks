 FTC Teams With Six States, Canada on Fraud Initiative   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2002  The FTC joined officials in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington state and Wyoming, as well as in Alberta and British Columbia, in making the sweep against online schemes. The FTC, along with the states and provincial authorities, also sent more than 500 letters warning people in those jurisdictions about sending deceptive spam that it is illegal.  "Spam that makes false representations about things that matter are illegal," said Eileen Harrington, the FTC's associate director of marketing practices.
