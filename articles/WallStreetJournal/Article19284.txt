 Bowstreet Brings Speed to Web-Site Customizing   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  Bowstreet makes software tools to help develop Web sites that are customized for each user. It relies on an increasingly popular Internet technology called XML, or extensible markup language. Using Bowstreet's software, Web site iProperty.com Inc., for example, lets realtors create a Web page for each prospective home buyer. Without leaving the page, the buyer can check mortgage rates or today's weather using other sites that are linked in by iProperty.  Customers say the level of customization permitted by Bowstreet's product, called Business Web Factory, goes far beyond that offered by Yahoo! Inc. and other Web portals. Moreover, Bowstreet makes customization affordable for smaller organizations. "We'd need an army of programmers to do that for every realtor," says Robin King, a spokeswoman for iProperty, of Bloomington, Ind.  XML, the software language of Web Factory, is sometimes called "HTML on steroids." That's a reference to hypertext markup language, the lingua franca of the Web. XML goes beyond HTML, because instead of just defining how text and pictures will be displayed on a screen, it defines what type of things they are -- prices, say, or weights or algorithms. As a result, XML can automate actions and link Web pages in ways that would require new coding by programmers using traditional technology.
