 P&G Will Crest Again   By By Charles L. Decker, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  Procter & Gamble blundered big time this week -- but then Wall Street blundered in turn by ignoring P&G's solid fundamentals.  P&G has a long history of distancing itself from Wall Street. In fact, the company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in the early 1900s when it announced, "It is the opinion of the directors that the best interests of the Company will be best served by not giving out published statements. The earnings of the past year were in excess of the 12% dividend on the stock. If you apply in person at the office of the company, you will be given more information if you desire."  For starters, P&G invests heavily in the pursuit of innovation -- its research-and-development budget is more than $1 billion. It has 7,000 scientists working in 17 research centers around the world. Major breakthroughs have sustained its long-term growth. P&G invented the synthetic heavy-duty detergent and rode Tide through the '50s; it invented fluoride toothpaste and grew with Crest through the '60s; new paper-making technology resulted in the success of Pampers starting in the '70s. Then it acquired Richardson-Vicks, reformulated Pantene with a shampoo-and-conditioner formula and made it a global megabrand in the '80s and '90s. The fat substitute Olestra was the next hoped-for breakthrough product, but it hasn't worked out. Yet.
