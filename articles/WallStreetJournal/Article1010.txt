 Barron's Insight: Goodyear's Got Traction Despite Accelerating Costs   By Tan, Kopin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2006  Since a loss of $1.2 billion in 2002, Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) of Akron, Ohio, has overhauled its business and steadily improved its earnings. But the shares of North America's largest tire manufacturer recently took a hit when Goodyear warned investors of a steeper-than- expected 13% jump in fourth-quarter raw-material costs. This Thursday, Goodyear is expected to post fourth-quarter operating income merely on par with the year-earlier $238 million; analysts had been expecting more. Result: Goodyear shares recently have been mired around $15.  Some investors worry about Goodyear's hefty $5.5 billion of debt. But the company last year refinanced the bulk of its loans to extend their maturities to 2010 and beyond. Looming large, too, are contract negotiations with its labor union, which are scheduled for July. Goodyear, like other companies linked to the auto industry, faces mounting costs to fund retiree benefits. But its pension costs are by no means unmanageable.
