 Redstones Hope Daughter Knows Best on Theaters   By Karnitschnig, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2006  "I'm convinced that I'm right, but I'd like to be wrong," Mr. Redstone says. "The fact that I'm her father doesn't mean that I have to agree with her, and the fact that she's my daughter doesn't mean she has to agree with me," he says.  Business isn't Ms. Redstone's only consideration. One of the reasons she is so intent on keeping the theaters is that she wants to preserve her family's theater tradition. Mr. Redstone's father, Michael Redstone, founded the company in the 1930s, starting with a drive-in theater in Valley Stream on New York's Long Island. As a memorial to her grandfather, Ms. Redstone plans to name National Amusements' new headquarters, due for completion in 2008, "Legacy Place." The new headquarters, like the current one, will be built on the site of the company's drive-in here. "It's a wonderful tribute to the company he started that will live on forever," she says.  Her father is somewhat less sentimental. "I'm hoping [Shari Redstone] will look into the future as well as the past," he says. "It's very hard, even for a very smart woman like Shari, when you've married your life to one business to switch over to another."
