 World-Wide [5]  The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1989  As many as 70,000 people marched through the southern city urging the government to ease its hard-line Communist policies, witnesses said. A massive number of police were deployed, but violence wasn't reported. In East Berlin, a pro-democracy vigil was held, and protests also were reported in Dresden and Halle. The demonstrations followed weekend clashes in six East German cities. Many of the hundreds arrested reportedly have been sentenced to jail terms of as long as six months.  Lutheran Church leaders issued an appeal in East Berlin calling on the government to approve broad democratic changes and to refrain from force.  Delegates to a special party congress in Budapest chose the 66-year-old ex-Communist Party leader to head the new Western-style Socialist Party's collective presidency. The new party, which voted over the weekend to disband the Communist Party and recreate itself as a party of social democrats, also approved a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the East bloc nation and to abandon the Marxist-Leninist orientation of its predecessor. It also expressed its commitment to a free-market economy.
