 Hewlett-Packard Suit Alleges Xerox Violates Printer-Supplies Trademarks   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1997  Hewlett-Packard Co., facing a potent competitor in one of its most lucrative product lines, is suing Xerox Corp. for trademark infringement on printer-toner cartridges.  H-P, of Palo Alto, Calif., filed its suit on Friday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, less than two weeks after Xerox made a splashy entrance into the office laser-printer and printer-supplies market that H-P currently dominates.  Xerox, of Stamford, Conn., is selling laser-printer toner-replacement cartridges that are compatible with H-P's printers, but at prices 10% to 20% lower than H-P's. In its suit, H-P asserts that the packages for the products contain 23 H-P trademarks, "which might mislead customers into thinking that H-P has endorsed the product or has an affiliation with Xerox," according to an H-P statement.
