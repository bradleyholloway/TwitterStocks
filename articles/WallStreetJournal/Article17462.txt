 Valium's Producer Gets Case of Jitters As Patent Expires --- Hoffman-La Roche Asks FDA to Delay Approval Of Drug's Generic Rivals   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1985  The drug's U.S. patent expired last week. That opened the way for the Food and Drug Administration to approve what would be the first generic versions of Valium in this country since the prescription tranquilizer became available 22 years ago. Generic drugs are generally cheaper than their brand-name counterparts. Generic copies of Valium, the first of which may be approved this year, are expected to cut deeply into Valium sales, which last year were $270 million. The drug is by far Roche's best-selling product.  Late last month, the company moved aggressively in an attempt to delay FDA approval of rival versions of diazepam, the drug's generic name. The company filed a five-volume petition with the agency arguing that generic copies already sold in some foreign countries are inferior to Valium. The Valium patent lapsed in some countries several years ago.
