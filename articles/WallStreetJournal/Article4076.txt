 Middle South Unit Gets Rate Increase For Nuclear Plant   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1985  LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- The Arkansas Public Service Commission approved an $81 million rate increase for a unit of financially troubled Middle South Utilities Inc., moving the utility another step closer to resolving the financial crisis over its Grand Gulf nuclear power plant.  The rate increase was one-third of the $246 million that the unit, Arkansas Power & Light Co., sought for the plant's first year of operation, but it will allow the unit to meet its 36% share of debt payments and other obligations for the $3.5 billion generating station. Without a rate increase, the company said the unit's ability to meet those payments was in jeopardy.
