 Letters to the Editor: Why Bash Bruce? He Speaks for Millions   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2002  As someone who has been listening to Bruce Springsteen since I first heard the opening drum roll of "Born to Run" in 1975, and as someone who was lucky enough to have escaped physically unscathed from the 85th floor of One World Trade Center last Sept. 11, I feel entitled to respond to Mark Gauvreau Judge's cloying, nasty critique of Bruce, his music (including his new album "The Rising"), his fans and everything he represents ("The Cult of Bruce," Taste page, Weekend Journal, Aug. 23).  Mr. Judge's assessment of Mr. Springsteen is a monument to faulty assumptions and an ill-tempered character bashing. Mr. Springsteen has earned a lot of money; therefore, Mr. Springsteen is a phony for wearing the same kind of clothes he has always worn? One would not want to look deeply for logic in that mini-syllogism. Mr. Springsteen has given voice to "the toady, the sycophant, the lapdog journalist, the tin-eared bore?" I would suggest Mr. Judge is the type of journalist who sits in the lap of elitist culture snobs who agree that anything not meeting their lofty standards be dismissed. As for the "tin ear," let readers decide whose ear is metallic.
