 Television (A Special Report): Where the Money Goes --- Studio Tours: An inside look at four of the biggest players In TV production and distribution   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 9, 1994  The Goliath of television programming, Warner Bros. is the crown jewel of parent Time Warner Inc., whose other operations include the second-largest cable-TV operator in the nation, and pay-TV leader Home Box Office. The New York-based parent also holds stakes in Turner Broadcasting System Inc. (which owns Cable News Network). Time Warner recently entered talks with General Electric Co. about buying all or part of NBC, even as Warner has been pursuing the launch of a new broadcast network next year, the WB Network, with television-station owner Tribune Co. of Chicago.  Indeed, Warner productions range from the highbrow Hallmark Hall of Fame TV film of Willa Cather's "O Pioneers!" to the decidedly lowbrow dating show "Love Connection." Warner makes one of the most expensive one-hour shows on television, ABC's "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," which costs more than $1 million an episode. For about half as much, it produced "Dark Justice," a one-hour action drama it made last year for a CBS "Crime Time After Prime Time" late-night slot. It also makes the syndicated talk shows "Jenny Jones" and "The Jane Whitney Show."  Warner was among the first studios to plunge into the TV-series business in the 1950s, when comedy was king on the small screen; its early programs included "Cheyenne" and "Maverick." Warner's biggest growth came with its 1989 acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures Inc. Lorimar had thrived in the 1980s with the nighttime soaps "Dallas," "Knots Landing" and "Falcon Crest." But the appetite for such shows withered, and they are virtually impossible to syndicate. Still, Mr. Meyer says, "they'd be an incredible basis for beginning a cable network like the Soap Network or the Romance Network."
