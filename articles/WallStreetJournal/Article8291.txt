 Suitors Sweeten Offers to Buy Continental Air --- Maxxam Takes On a Partner, Air Canada Adds Debt In New Round of Bids   By By Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1992  Maxxam Inc. enhanced its offer by raising the purchase price to $400 million from $350 million and adding Aerovias de Mexico S.A. de C.V. as its partner in the investment. Air Canada and two Fort Worth, Texas, investors increased their joint offer to $425 million.  In response to this informal auction, the Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. unit set a Nov. 2 deadline to receive firm written bids and said it would submit the winning bid to the bankruptcy court Nov. 9.  In its revised bid, Maxxam confirmed that its investment group now includes Aerovias de Mexico, known as Aeromexico, and a Mexican investment group that includes some of the Mexican company's stockholders. At $130 million, the equity portion of their combined bid is greatly strengthened compared with Maxxam's stand-alone offer, because Aeromexico is adding about $100 million in cash to the transaction. Maxxam apparently has increased its equity portion to about $30 million from $25 million.
