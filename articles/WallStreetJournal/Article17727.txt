 As '88 Candidates Target Baby Boom Voters, Pundits Can't Tell Them Apart From Elders   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  Since the 1984 election, political consultants and theorists have argued that the 76 million Americans born in the Baby Boom years were the key to the 1988 election. Victory in next year's election, according to this orthodoxy, could be won by harnessing the energy and support of the Baby Boomers -- reluctant voters, perhaps, but ready to respond to a distant trumpet.  Now that several of the 1988 presidential aspirants have embraced this theory and tailored their campaigns to it -- Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware used the word "generation" 11 times in a single speech here the other day -- there is growing skepticism of the value of a generational appeal. There are real doubts that the Baby Boomers are much different politically from their parents or their younger brothers and sisters.  For four years, as he has prepared for the presidential campaign that he will formally launch next week, Mr. Biden has pitched much of his appeal to Baby Boom voters. The 44-year-old senator, himself just a little senior to the Baby Boomers, spoke in his address here at Harvard University of "the America of my generation" and made a series of references to President Kennedy, whom he called "the president of my youth" and a man who "understood the generational passage of power."
