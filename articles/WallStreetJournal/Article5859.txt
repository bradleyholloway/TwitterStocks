 Museum Seeks To Develop Digital Guide --- Online Device Will Connect To Database Containing Information on Exhibits   By By Jennifer L. Rewick WSJ.com, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2000  The museum (www.ammi.org) is working with San Francisco Web shop Organic Inc. to build e-Docent, the museum's wireless content-delivery system. E-Docent will connect patrons to a central database containing information about many of the museum's 85,000 artifacts -- pieces of film-making equipment, fan memorabilia and other cinema curios. A prototype is expected in November.  The interactive tour likely will work like this: Patrons receive a one- to two-pound flat computer known as a PC tablet -- about the size of a videotape -- to carry through the galleries. When visitors approach an exhibit, such as a glass-encased wall covered with fan magazines from the 1940s, they will use the device to call up additional text, still shots and audio, such as photographs of the inside pages, along with stories about the actors, their films and the photographers who snapped their pictures.  Moving Image hopes it has better luck with e-Docent. There are significant hurdles. The application platform's design will make it compatible with standard portable devices, such as e-books and handheld computers running the Palm operating system. It likely will be at least another year before wireless technology lets visitors use their own hand-helds, said Robert Fabricant, director of Organic's wireless research-and-development lab.
