 Tommy Hilfiger Reports 78% Jump In 2nd-Period Net   By By Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1998  "In the six years we've been a public company we have beat Wall Street's estimates in every quarter," said Joel Horowitz, Hilfiger's chief executive. As for this quarter, he gave partial credit to Pepe Jeans and Tommy Hilfiger Canada, former licensees Hilfiger purchased last May. "The leverage we got from merging the two companies happened much quicker than the Street anticipated," he said. Hilfiger also had strong demand in the quarter for its women's sportswear and men's jeans.
