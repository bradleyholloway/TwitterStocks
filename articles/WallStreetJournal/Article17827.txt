 Manager's Journal: Gentlemen's Agreements and Breaking Faith   By By Harvey Gittler, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1988  Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 it is illegal to discriminate in employment because of religion, race, sex, age or national origin. Cases involving discrimination based on age and sex have filled the courts; there have been fewer cases involving racial discrimination, even fewer involving religious discrimination.  While age and sex discrimination can be excused as past cultural practices that have to be and are being reversed, charges of religious discrimination -- where old-fashioned "gentlemen's agreements" were involved -- are considered an assault against individual and company integrity and moral values; they are thus denied with righteous indignation. Such charges would be answered with: "Some of our best employees . . ."  Cases involving religious discrimination have centered on four issues: Sabbath observance, religious dress (head coverings), mandatory union membership and religious harassment (anti-Semitism). Except for religious harassment, these cases have generally been involved with "religious accommodation," not discrimination, per se.
