 Bearing Burdens: Mexicans Feel Pinch Of Austerity Measures But Are Stoic About It --- Workers' Government Ties Have Pacifying Effects That May be Temporary --- Losing War With Inflation?   By By Neil Ulman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1985  Is there a solution to the economic crisis that has brought such stringencies to Mr. Ocampo and to many of his 78 million fellow Mexicans? "Just work," says Mr. Ocampo.  Among leaders in the Mexican government and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the present peace is all to the credit of President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado and to the unity the PRI is said to generate throughout the population. The traditionally flexible coalition includes business, labor, farm workers and a rapidly expanding bureaucracy. "We think our stability lies in the strong institutions which the revolution and the party have created," says Manuel Alonso Munoz, the president's spokesman and political adviser.  In order to drive a truck for hire in the state of Jalisco, you must have commercial license plates issued by the PRI-controlled state government, explains Mr. Martinez. To get those plates, you must join the union. The union has 25 members (and 50 people on the waiting list to join). The state leader of the union is a PRI congressman, and the national leader is a PRI senator. Of course, nothing in the union bylaws says that one must be a PRI member in order to belong. It just happens that way, says Mr. Martinez.
