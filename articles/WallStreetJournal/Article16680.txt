 As Nurses Strike, Hospitals Pay Big For Replacements   By Maher, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2006  Given the shortage of nurses nationwide -- a report released in December by the American Hospital Association said U.S. hospitals needed roughly 118,000 nurses to fill vacant positions -- those companies are trying to woo nurses with special bonuses and wages that are far above the average. In addition to hiring out-of-state nurses as replacements, staffing companies try to lure nurses at nearby hospitals with high pay and bonuses to cross picket lines during their vacations.  Nurses say the main draw to working as replacements during strikes is money. "What the strike is about on both sides is the money," said Rachel Johnson, a 37-year-old critical-care nurse from Mississippi who is working as a replacement at Robert Wood Johnson. "We come in and make more money -- quick money, actually." On a Web site devoted to nurses who work strikes, one nurse said she had earned $5,000, with overtime, in the first week at Robert Wood Johnson.  Unions strongly oppose the use of replacement nurses because they weaken union bargaining clout. Some nurses also are outraged at the high pay of replacement nurses, said Jeanne Clark, a staff nurse at Robert Wood Johnson and a union official with the United Steelworkers. "They are getting much higher rates than anyone at Robert Wood ever saw," she said of replacements there. She said average pay for nurses at the hospital is closer to $37 an hour.
