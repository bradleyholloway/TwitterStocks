 First Executive's Alchemy Refines $700 Million of Junk   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1989  First Executive gave the six companies about $756 million of junk bonds, plus some cash, and got back $771 million of bonds issued by the six companies. To a large extent, the companies will use the very same junk bonds First Executive jettisoned to generate the cash to pay principal and interest on the new bonds.  Mr. Belth says he's convinced that the transaction was a maneuver to lessen First Executive's reserve obligation. Doug Marcian, executive vice president of First Executive, says the purpose was to make it easier for First Executive to sell off pieces of its junk-bond holdings when it wants to.  The six companies -- Amethyst Finance Co., Courtleigh Finance Co., Crystal Financial Corp., Maple Finance Inc., Olive Funding Corp. and Pearl Finance Co.have a lot in common. According to California officials, the six all were incorporated Dec. 9, 1988. They have the same address, 9777 Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills (which was First Executive's address until 1984). And they have have the same chief executive officer, James O. Cox III, a former consultant to Executive Life, First Executive's main subsidiary. Mr. Cox is also the sole director of each company.
