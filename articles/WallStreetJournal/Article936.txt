 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau [1]  By Compiled by Rich Jaroslovsky, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1987  The executive director of Iowa's GOP says she got no reaction at all to the address and "had to solicit comments." But Reagan's low-key talk, combined with his and Congress's vacations, should help cool the issue. While questions will resurface at next month's press conference and after Walsh's likely indictments, other issues -- Bork, arms control, Central America -- will absorb more public attention by then.  Reagan aides think Bork is a sure-win issue, even in the unlikely event he is rejected; the Democrats look clumsy, while Reagan can energize his conservative base. Likewise, they view arms control as no-lose politically. House Majority Leader Foley complains that Reagan goes "into a clinch" on Central America by saying he is for the Contras and for peace at the same time.  Reagan hopes for a Thanksgiving summit with Gorbachev, but the thinning ranks of administration hard-liners worry that the White House is growing too eager to get it. They say the U.S. must be especially tough at the tail end of arms talks. But their pleas are weakened by the absence of departed Pentagon aide Perle and the impending exit of negotiator Adelman.
