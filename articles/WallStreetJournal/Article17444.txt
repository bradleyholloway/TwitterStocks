 Belgian Duracells Pose Trade Issue For White House --- Reagan to Decide if Imports Of Batteries by 3rd Parties Infringe Parent's Rights   By By Art Pine, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1985  The issue has come to light because the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar has made Belgian-made Duracells a bargain here.

The Belgian-made batteries are sold here through third and fourth parties, rather than exported by the European subsidiary.
