 Powell's Big FCC Defeat Brings Mixed News for Bells --- Ambush of Bush's Chairman Is Victory for AT&T, WorldCom; Local Carriers Fear Market Loss   By By Yochi J. Dreazen and Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  The vote is a victory for companies such as AT&T Corp. and WorldCom Inc., which have taken a growing portion of the Bells' local phone business by relying on the wholesale rates. The Bells, on the other hand, having spent millions of dollars lobbying state officials to raise the wholesale rates and federal officials to eliminate them, said they were disappointed by the defeat of Mr. [MICHAEL POWELL]'s proposal.  Some FCC officials said Mr. Powell misplayed his hand by failing to keep close tabs on Mr. [Kevin Martin] and the agency's two Democrats as the commissioners began reviewing Mr. Powell's proposal last month. The officials said they were surprised by Mr. Powell's approach given that his relationship with Mr. Martin had deteriorated sharply in recent months.  Still, the insurrection took Mr. Powell by surprise. At the FCC's wireline competition bureau, staffers circulated a draft of the proposed changes to the wholesale rules in late January, but by early February they still hadn't received substantive feedback from Mr. Martin and the two Democrats. Mr. Powell assumed the three men might want changes but were likely to support the item, according to people familiar with his thinking.
