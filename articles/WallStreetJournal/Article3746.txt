 Tip of the Week: Get Bumped, Get a Bonus   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2003  Airlines are known to overbook flights to offset the number of no- show passengers. So they often seek volunteers to take later flights, especially near the holidays. The Transportation Department requires that airlines compensate bumped passengers. The rules officially apply only if the flight leaves from the U.S. and if the carrier can't find a way to get you to your destination within an hour of your scheduled arrival.
