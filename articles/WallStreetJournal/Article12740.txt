 Telecommuters Learn To Put Bosses at Ease And Get Promoted, Too   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2001  A former EDS boss helped Ms. [Eileen Luhta McFarlane] land her latest promotion. Eleanor Stryker sent Mr. Walker an unsolicited recommendation for Ms. McFarlane without her knowledge. "I just wanted him to know that while she was in our organization, [telecommuting] never presented a problem," the business-development manager recalls.  MS. STRYKER, who oversaw Ms. McFarlane between 1997 and 1999, recollects her frequent updates and eagerness to accept additional tasks. "Not everyone does [networking] as well as Eileen does," she says.  Strong networking skills are especially crucial for telecommuters in a complex and constantly changing company like EDS. Ms. McFarlane maintains ties with EDS staffers outside her area through visits, calls, e-mail and Christmas cards. "I hear about potential opportunities within their teams or maybe others that they've heard about," she continues. "So as people move about the company, I stay in the loop."
