 Executives on Trial: Outside Lawyer For Tyco Testifies In Belnick Trial   By Bray, Chad, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2004  "I never got to the point of concluding whether these things violated generally accepted accounting practices, [were] material or had significant impact on Tyco's results," Mr. [William R. McLucas] said. "What I was telling [Mark A. Belnick] in this e-mail was the practice was worrisome." Mr. McLucas is a prosecution witness in Mr. Belnick's grand larceny trial in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  Mr. McLucas testified he and other members of his team of forensic accountants and attorneys were concerned that there appeared to be a reliance on reserves in meeting some forecasted sales numbers in "flash" reports issued by some units to Tyco corporate, in particular in the Tyco Printed Circuit Group.
