 A New Tech Battle for the Home; As Industries Collide and Gadgets Morph, Consumers Face a Whirl of Choices   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2005  At this year's CES, one hot topic will be "place-shifting," the idea of transferring live TV broadcasts and other video content to cellphones, laptop computers, office PCs or other devices. TiVo, for example, this week will formally announce a long-awaited service called TiVoToGo. It lets some models of its hardware transfer recorded TV programming over a home network to PCs or laptops -- with restrictions designed to limit transfers of shows to people in the same household.  Bernard Gershon, senior vice president and general manager of ABC News's digital-media group, endorses the MobiTV approach. While reserving judgment on Sling and Orb, he notes that ABC sometimes doesn't have the rights to redistribute material such as clips of sporting events, and makes sure it negotiates such rights in material transferred to MobiTV. "Copyright issues can become very very problematic," he says.  It is the second, open network that is inspiring many executives in Silicon Valley, who are working to make the TV as open and programmable as PCs. "Yes, we're going to have cable and satellite programming, but there needs to be an open conduit for new applications and new content that we've never dreamed of to exist on the TV," says Daniel Putterman, president and CEO of Mediabolic Inc., a San Mateo, Calif., maker of software for consumer-electronics devices.
