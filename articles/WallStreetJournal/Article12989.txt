 Indictment Alleges Westar's Former CEO Sought to Loot Firm   By Frank, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2003  Mr. [DAVID C. WITTIG], 48 years old, and Douglas T. Lake, 53, Mr. Wittig's former top deputy, "sought to systematically loot Westar of money and assets," according to the 40-count indictment by a federal grand jury in Topeka, Kan. The indictment also charges Messrs. Wittig and Lake with forcing out independent members of the board and monitoring employee phone calls to find out if staffers were speaking to the media or regulators.  Mr. Wittig's attorney declined to comment, saying he has yet to review the indictment. Mr. Lake's attorney, Edward J.M. Little, said: "This case concerns a dispute between Mr. Lake and his former employer Westar Energy Inc. over the terms of his compensation agreements, which were approved by an independent committee of the board of directors of Westar." He added that "Mr. Lake firmly denies the charges being made against him and looks forward to the trial of this case."  In September 2002, Westar hired the New York law firm Debevoise & Plimpton to conduct an internal investigation, which uncovered many of the details in the grand jury indictment. The Debevoise report was made public in May. Westar is under new management and is working to sell businesses acquired under Mr. Wittig. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Westar fell four cents to $19.76.
