 Stolen-Data Trafficker Is Sentenced; Co-Founder of Shadowcrew Is Latest to Get Prison Term In Breakup of ID-Theft Site   By Bryan-Low, Cassell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2006  A U.S. federal judge sentenced a co-founder of Shadowcrew, one of the largest online marketplaces for stolen credit-card and debit-card information, to two years and eight months in prison, bringing to eight the number of Shadowcrew members who have been sentenced since April.  Mr. [Andrew Mantovani], along with other administrators of the site, "handled day-to-day management decisions as well as long-term strategic planning," said Kevin O'Dowd, an assistant U.S. attorney in Newark prosecuting the case. "For example, he collected money from other Shadowcrew members to continue the site's operations," and "determined which individuals were permitted to become and remain members."
