 The Energy Conundrum: To Own or Ignore?; Sector's Shares Have Skyrocketed, But Oil-Price Drop May Signal Flammability of Bets on Industry   By McDonald, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2005  Glance quickly at the stock market and things don't look awful. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 4.6% this year and the Nasdaq Composite Index just behind it, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index is down a relatively tame 1.7%. Overall, companies in the S&P index are expected to post double-digit earnings growth for a record 14th quarter in a row and those companies' shares seem about fairly priced overall -- trading at about 16 times their expected profits for 2006 according to generally accepted accounting principles.  Pull out the S&P index's energy shares, which are up 30% through this year's third quarter thanks largely to soaring crude-oil prices, and a bleaker picture of this year's stock market emerges. Without the billions of dollars of market value added to energy stocks -- which make up almost 10% of the S&P 500 now, up from less than 6% at the start of 2003 -- the index is actually down more than 4%, according to Standard & Poor's. Earnings growth would be lower and valuations would be higher.  "We like energy over the long term and we do buy the whole supply- demand mismatch story," says Brett Gallagher, co-manager of the $47.7 million Julius Baer Global Equity Fund. But he admits that money managers playing catch-up could be the biggest determinant of near- term returns. "I think the sector is probably a little overvalued, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a run for energy stocks as we get to year-end," Mr. Gallagher says. "People who are behind will go there to catch up."
