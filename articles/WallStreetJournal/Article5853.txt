 Delphi Signs On With Auto Makers In Online Exchange   By By Karen Lundegaard, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  Delphi's announcement could help [Covisint] clear regulatory hurdles, said David Garrity, global auto research coordinator at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.  Talk of other suppliers forming a competing exchange should effectively end, Mr. Garrity predicted. Another big boost, he said, is that by signing up Delphi, "They get basically all of Delphi's suppliers."  Delphi spends some $15 billion annually on purchases, though not all of that will be done online. Last year, Delphi used online auctions, run by Pittsburgh-based FreeMarkets Inc., to handle some $400 million in purchases, saving the company an estimated $70 million. The company is under contract with FreeMarkets until the end of the year.
