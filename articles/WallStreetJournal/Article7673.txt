 As Iran-Contra Counsel Pursues Alleged Crimes, Experts Think Some Cases May Be Hard to Prove   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1987  But after more than three months of televised congressional hearings and the release of boxloads of sensitive government documents, Mr. Meese appears to have changed his mind. "If I didn't think that laws could have been broken," he said during a recent television interview, "then I wouldn't have launched the criminal investigation and sought an independent counsel." Sen. Paul Trible (R., Va.), a member of the Senate investigating committee, puts it more bluntly: "There's certainly evidence of clear wrongdoing, criminal wrongdoing."  Although polls indicate strong public opposition to prosecution of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North and other participants in the affair, Lawrence Walsh, the court-appointed Iran-Contra prosecutor, is digging into potential violations of as many as 10 or 12 different federal statutes, according to law-enforcement officials and other persons familiar with his inquiry.  Lawyers for Col. North and Rear Adm. John Poindexter, the former national security adviser, have identified their clients as principal targets of Mr. Walsh's broad grand-jury investigation, though both men deny any wrongdoing. And the list of other targets is believed to include retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who directed the Contra-resupply network, and his business partner, Albert Hakim.
