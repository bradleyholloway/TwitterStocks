 Riddle: Why Won't a Typical Millionaire Take You for a Ride in His Fancy Car?   By By Ed Bean, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1985  Thomas Stanley, a marketing professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta, has been studying the ways of the rich, particularly those with net worth of at least $1 million, for the past 12 years. He has surveyed thousands of millionaires and probed the attitudes and habits of about 700 in small focus groups. What he has found will disappoint those who think most of the nation's moneyed elite sit around the country club waiting for the photographer from Town and Country Magazine.  The high-profile leisure class shows up as a minority in Mr. Stanley's research. Much more common is the owner of a small business -- a string of dry-cleaning stores, hamburger franchises or travel-agency offices -- who works long hours and doesn't have time for a vacation. He's more likely to have a Sears charge card than American Express, and he uses his bank more for borrowing than saving. His life wouldn't interest the scriptwriters of Dallas or Dynasty.  But if there were a movie in Mr. Stanley's research, it would be G-rated. America's millionaires have long marriages and if they have girlfriends, they don't talk about them. They don't talk about going to Las Vegas, either. Outside of California, no millionaire has ever shown up for one of Mr. Stanley's focus-group sessions wearing a gold chain. When Mr. Stanley watches his millionaire subjects get into their cars, he usually sees four-door American sedans, or Volvos with no chrome. Old station wagons aren't uncommon. "These are the most traditional people in the world," says Mr. Stanley.
