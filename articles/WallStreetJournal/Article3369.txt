 Letters to the Editor: FCC's Cable Rules Preserve Diversity   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  Contrary to Mr. [Holman W. Jenkins Jr.]'s statement, the FCC last year did not tighten the ownership rules. Rather, we loosened them substantially to recognize the growth of satellite video competition and to help companies offer new services. First, we changed the formulae for calculating the ownership cap so that as competitors to cable gain market share, a cable company is able to control a larger percentage of cable subscribers nationwide. Second, we revised the cable ownership attribution rules to permit interest holders in an entity to insulate their interests from attribution if they are not involved in the video programming activities of that entity.
