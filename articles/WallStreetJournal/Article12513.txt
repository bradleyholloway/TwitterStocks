 The Best Way to.... ....Trade Stocks Online investing has rapidly become mainstream; But not all sites are equal   By By Gaston F. Ceron, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1999  Investors have been quick to jump on the online-trading bandwagon. A June survey by Gomez Advisors Inc., a Lincoln, Mass., Internet research firm, and Harris Interactive Inc., a Rochester, N.Y., market-research firm, found that 4.6 million online investors had traded at least once in the prior six months. And despite fears of a slowdown in online-trading activity, the survey found that 16.3 million more people were poised to begin trading online.  To help you steer through the choices, we have come up with a guide to online brokers, including a comparison of some of their services and prices. We have listed the top eight online brokers, in terms of customer assets, as ranked by Salomon Smith Barney, plus the online offerings from two traditional, large Wall Street firms. Also listed are performance data from Keynote Systems Inc., which since early June has been publishing on its Web site transaction-performance figures on several of the larger online brokers.  Merrill Lynch Direct's online-trading fees start at $29.95, in line with the basic fees charged by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online and Charles Schwab Corp. Among other features, the Merrill Lynch Direct Web site offers access to stock research by Merrill analysts, real-time stock quotes, financial tools to help investors plan for retirement and other goals, and investor-education information. Clients can also watch Internet video reports from Merrill analysts and economists.
