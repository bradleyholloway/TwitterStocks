 SEC Accuses Cannon Group Of Violations   By By Daniel Akst, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1987  Cannon Group Inc. defrauded investors, inflated profits, submitted false documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission and had its chief banker on its payroll, the SEC charged in a civil suit filed here.  Simultaneously, Cannon settled the suit by consenting to a court order that bars future securities law violations and requires other steps to ensure compliance. Two top Cannon executives also agreed to be barred from future violations, as did a former Cannon executive.  SEC officials wouldn't comment on the settlement terms, but Cannon, its officers and directors still face several civil suits that Cannon says were triggered by the SEC inquiry.
