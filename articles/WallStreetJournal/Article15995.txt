 Americans' Use of Web for Election News Quadrupled Since 1996, Survey Indicates   By By Ted Bridis, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2000  Pew conducted its survey by telephone during October and November among 4,186 randomly selected online users. The poll was conducted as part of a larger effort by Pew to track Internet use over time.  The survey found that younger Web surfers especially mentioned convenience as the reason for seeking out election news, and they mostly turned to the Web sites of major news organizations. Fewer than 10% visited sites that specialized in politics or visited the Web sites of candidates. The Web sites of CNN and The Wall Street Journal were judged most useful among those surveyed.
