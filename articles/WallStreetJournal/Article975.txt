 Efforts to Lift Thailand's Stock Market Falter, Despite Optimism on Prospects   By By Helen White, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1987  BANGKOK, Thailand -- Until Black Monday, Thailand's stock market was one of Asia's best performers. Since then, it has been one of the worst. Yet prospects for economic growth and stock market performance in Thailand are still regarded as among the best in the region, even if the Oct. 19 crash leads to a U.S.-led recession.  The Thai bourse's drop wasn't as immediately precipitous as plunges on most other Asian exchanges in the wake of Wall Street's Black Monday, but in the eight weeks since, it has become one of the hardest hit. The exchange's index has fallen 46% since Oct. 19. A longstanding limit on daily fluctuations in stock prices helped slow the decline.  Many securities advisers believe the market has fallen far below what it should be, judged by these aspects of the Thai economy: Industrial investment, both foreign and domestic, is surging because of cheap labor and cheap land. Diversification of Thai products and export markets gives Thailand more insulation from a U.S. economic slump than many of its neighbors have. Real gross domestic product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's goods and services, is forecast by both government and private economists to rise between 5.9% and 7.2% next year -- identical to 1987 growth estimates.
