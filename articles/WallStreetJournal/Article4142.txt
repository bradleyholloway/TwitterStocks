 Petition by Smith International Filed Under Chapter 11   By By Brenton R. Schlender, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  The Newport Beach, Calif.-based oil-services concern's petition under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code wasn't unexpected in the wake of a federal judge's ruling in favor of Hughes Tool Co., culminating a 15-year-old dispute. Smith had said it faced possible default on loan covenants for about $260 million in debt. The company also noted in documents filed with its petition that some of its lenders were considering filing an involuntary Chapter 11 petition against it.  The filing will provide Smith protection from Hughes, a Houston-based oil-services concern, and other creditors while it works out a plan to pay its debts. The bankruptcy documents didn't indicate whether Smith would appeal that judgment.
