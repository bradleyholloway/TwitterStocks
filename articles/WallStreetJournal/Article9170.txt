 Letters to the Editor: Cleaning Up the Mess in Churches   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2000  It seems we have just recovered from the trauma of no more throwing rice at weddings, (at least here in Quincy) when we have to face this dirty linen thing. In the rice caper, pigeons were the merciless offenders. They would swoop in after the rice was thrown and eat it. I'm sure you know what they did next. They put the janitors and maintenance men to the test. Well, we put an end to that transgression. Now we blow bubbles at the newlyweds. But isn't it possible this may cause infertility? You never know.  I'm sure we'll come up with some way to fix the wine problem. Since there are three denominations mentioned, Lutheran, Episcopal and Catholic who use wine, and some denominations use grape juice, which also stains, maybe it could be an ecumenical endeavor.
