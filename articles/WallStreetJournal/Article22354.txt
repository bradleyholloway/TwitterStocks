 Horse Play: Hartsfield Grabs for Equine Business   By By Ken Gepfert, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1997  When they fly, horses travel first class at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.  So why does Hartsfield's $2.6 million equine quarantine facility have nary a horse as Mr. Kennedy shows off its three-quarters-inch-thick imported rubber mats (to cushion horses' hooves) and spacious, stainless-steel stalls? The answer tells a lot about the frustrations of trying to add more Arabian stallions, Colombian flowers and other exotic imports to an airport known mainly for its crush of domestic human travelers.  But getting the federal government to designate the airport as a port of entry for imported horses, wildlife and fruits has proven more elusive. A perishables center next door to the equine facility was certified by the U.S. Agriculture Department as a cold-treatment center for fruits ranging from mangoes to kiwis late last year -- four years after the airport built it. Hartsfield finally won the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's blessing as a wildlife port of entry in 1996 after eight years of lobbying.
