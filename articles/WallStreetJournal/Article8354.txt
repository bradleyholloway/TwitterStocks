 Shifting Gears: Some Manufacturers Drop Efforts to Adopt Japanese Techniques --- They Hit Snags With Ideas Such as Quality Circles, Just-in-Time Deliveries --- Melding People and Machines   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1993  Federal-Mogul Corp., deciding that its automation had gone too far, has removed much of the fancy equipment at an auto-parts plant, and General Motors Corp. is now relying more heavily on "people power." Whirlpool Corp. has soured on Japanese-style "quality circles" as a means of tapping employee ideas, and General Electric Co. and Corning Inc. have turned to other ways of tapping employee ideas. Losing favor at some companies is the Japanese "just-in-time" system of minimizing inventory by having suppliers deliver parts only as needed.  Although what they learned from Japan improved quality and productivity in some areas, it "hasn't made them really competitive," says Ranganath Nayak, who heads the world-wide operations-management practice at Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm. "Companies have been obsessed with one fad idea or another at the cost of their overall focus," he adds. The upshot: Paltry gains in relation to the $800 billion in capital investment and $150 billion in worker training that he estimates American manufacturers spent in the past decade to implement Japanese ideas.  One reason is that American companies went overboard in copying Japanese automation. Federal-Mogul, for instance, mistakenly surmised that the Japanese got a major cost advantage from computers, robots and other automated equipment. Burdened with labor costs significantly higher than those in Japan and facing mounting pressure from auto makers to cut parts prices, the company revamped its Lancaster, Pa., auto-parts plant in 1987 with state-of-the-art automation -- and with ideas imported from Japan.
