 The Stories a Parents' Home Reveals --- Emptying Out Their House, Janet Thomas Learned Things She'd Never Known   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  Janet Thomas spent much of last spring at her red brick childhood home here where tulips, red geraniums and white petunias grew on a sloping front yard. Her mother, Dorothy, died in 1990 at the age of 86. Her 93-year-old father, Edson Wissinger, had decided to move to a nearby retirement community.  Karen McCrory, who has handled dozens of estate sales, helped Janet sell much of the furniture and other household items in an all-day sale. Ms. McCrory is always on the lookout for photos and letters that might have been overlooked by family members. She sets them aside and urges a son or daughter to keep at least some of them, even if they don't want their parents belongings crowding their own home, or anything to do with an unhappy childhood. "Perspectives change," she says. They may want it later as they review their own lives and find huge holes.  Ms. McCrory recalls one house where nothing remained of the father except his WW II army uniform, a pair of shoes and love letters to his wife while they were dating. Everything else belonging to him had been purged long ago. The daughter said her mother hated her father, who was an uneducated miser. The son didn't attend his funeral. Ms. McCrory gave them the letters to read. It was the only chance for the children to see their father before he became a tyrant and to understand why their young mother was charmed enough to fall in love with him.
