 PURSUITS; Books: Eco-Frights for Kids   By Meghan Cox Gurdon, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2007  An ominous sense of environmental fragility, it should be said, is by no means confined to children's books specifically about global warming. The recent "Little Fur" (Random House) books by Isobelle Carmody are "eco-fantasies" in which humans actually stink of greed and cruelly despoil the Earth with their gas-guzzling Road Beasts. "The Day the Stones Walked" (Philomel), by T.A. Barron, illustrated by William Low, concludes with an author's note about the long-ago deforestation of Easter Island. "Will we, who live on the bigger island called Earth . . . make the same mistake on a much larger scale?"  Whether the sky really is falling this time or not, more books are coming. The publisher Scholastic is leading its autumn lineup with a children's version of "The Down-to-Earth Guide to Global Warming" by Cambria Gordon and Laurie David ([Al Gore]'s producer on the film "An Inconvenient Truth"). Here, too, the young will be asked to make sacrifices, such as putting their computers on "sleep" and switching toilet-paper brands.
