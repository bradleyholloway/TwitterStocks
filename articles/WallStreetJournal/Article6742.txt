 Hot Topic: Pakistan Plunges Deeper Into Chaos   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  It appeared increasingly likely that the Supreme Court would declare Gen. [Pervez Musharraf]'s election last month to be illegal because he hadn't yet resigned his position as chief of the army, a violation of Pakistan's constitution.  Pakistan provides critical support for U.S. operations against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and there are few strong leaders to take Gen. Musharraf's place. The U.S. "doesn't have a very good hand to play," says Daniel Markey, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.  Ms. Bhutto hasn't closed the door completely to working with Gen. Musharraf, whose term had been set to expire this week and who has said he would hold elections by Feb. 15, one month later than originally scheduled. Ms. Bhutto said Friday that Gen. Musharraf could still preserve their deal if he stepped down as army chief, restored the constitution and held elections by Jan. 15, as originally scheduled.
