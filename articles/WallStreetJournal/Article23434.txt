 Driving a Supermodel; Mercedes' S65 AMG Is a Corporate Jet With Wheels   By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  The S65 AMG is $191,000 worth of "look at me," from the "AMG" and "Biturbo" badges to the big five-spoke wheels that show off the high- tech braking hardware needed to stop a 4,985-pound sedan capable of hitting 155 miles per hour. Sure, it costs more than many people paid for their first house -- or maybe even their present house. But as they say, if you have to ask, maybe it's not for you.  The S65 AMG is very much a connoisseur's car. The real point of this car isn't the top speed or horsepower -- or even the city fuel economy of 13 miles per gallon that leads to a $2,600 gas-guzzler tax. After all, there's no public highway in the U.S. where a driver could legally (or safely) wind a car out to 155 miles per hour. The magic of the S65 AMG is in the torque. The big AMG's V12 delivers 738 pound- feet of torque at a low 2000 revolutions per minute. Translated from car-geek-speak, this means that on the highway this very large, very heavy turbo-charged sedan accelerates effortlessly with no sensation of lag or laboring, and without lunging bursts of power. This isn't a muscle car. It's a corporate jet with wheels.  Mercedes plans to build only about 1,000 S65 AMG sedans a year world-wide, says Rob Allan, AMG product manager for the U.S. Only about 40% to 50% of that total will make it to the U.S., he says. European AMG customers have the option of ordering their cars customized to their personal specifications by an AMG "performance" studio. American customers can't do that yet, but Mr. Allan says "we know there's definitely a demand for it."
