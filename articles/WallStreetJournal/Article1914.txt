 State of Despair: West Virginia, Mired In Poverty, Corruption, Battles a Deep Gloom --- Scenic Riches Don't Make Up For Low Pay, Bad Schools, So Its People Flee the Hills --- Sending Two Sheriffs to Jail   By By Clare Ansberry and Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1988  But these days Beth Daniell seems more typical. An assistant professor of English at West Virginia University in Morgantown for two years, she finally wearied of being threatened with forced furloughs and unsigned paychecks. So, like thousands of others, she left the state this year. She took a teaching job in Chicago that pays 40% more. Because of the shrinking population, now less than 1.9 million, there is a good chance the state will lose one of its four House seats after the next U.S. census in 1990. The emigration, some figure, rivals the exodus from Oklahoma in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.  Not that West Virginia has a monopoly on hardship. Louisiana may be worse off. And there are other parts of Appalachia -- an area that extends across all of West Virginia and parts of 12 other states -- that are characterized by staggering unemployment and poverty.  There is magic here -- Miss Ella's beloved poplar- and maple-covered mountains, rising majestically from green valleys -- and it offers a certain solace to many West Virginians. In the days when America moved the goods of its farms and factories by water, the mountains were no hindrance to the state's economy. In fact, they were rich in coal. In the late 19th century, Wheeling was America's richest city in per capita income. But as the nation turned first to railroads and then to trucks to move its output, the mountains discouraged the building of modern highways, factories and industrial parks.
