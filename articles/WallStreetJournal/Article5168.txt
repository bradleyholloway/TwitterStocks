 U.S. Universities At an Economic Crossroads: Graduates Learn Diplomas Aren't Tickets to Success   By By Wendy Bounds, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1994  Ms. Pfefer received her diploma from American University in Washington, D.C., in 1984 and never picked up her resume from the typesetter. When her mother insisted she interview in Pittsburgh during her senior year, Ms. Pfefer approached the prestigious Burson-Marsteller public-relations firm with a pen-marked resume, said she would frankly rather stay in Washington and never wrote a thank-you letter. Two weeks later, Burson-Marsteller offered her the Pittsburgh job, which she accepted.  Now it's 1994, the year Ms. Hill graduated jobless from Ohio University after mailing at least 75 cover letters and resumes. Graduation came, and she moved home to take a $200-a-week summer internship at an amusement park. More letters went out -- still nothing. "People used to say if you had a degree, that guaranteed you a job," grumbles Ms. Hill, who, like Ms. Pfefer, had internships and good grades.  Certainly, the other side of that coin is that most working college graduates earn more -- and often considerably more -- than high-school graduates. The trick for the new graduate is to get a foot in an employer's door, which is no easy task as the U.S. business scene takes on a more streamlined look. Big companies such as Procter & Gamble Co., AT&T Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co., which once provided thousands of jobs to college graduates, are doing less recruiting. Restructurings and layoffs have forced job cuts, and many companies are now hiring from within to fill openings. Meanwhile, as the pool of unemployed experienced workers grows, there are fewer spaces for young graduates.
