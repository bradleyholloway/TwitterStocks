 Cancer Study Yields Mixed Results; High-Dose Chemotherapy, Stem-Cell Transplants Cut Relapses, Don't Prolong Life   By Golden, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2003  The studies conducted in the Netherlands and the U.S., which appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine, evaluated the effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem-cell transplantation, compared with conventional chemotherapy, for treating breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.  High-dose chemotherapy, combined with stem-cell transplants to help the body cope with the toxic onslaught, has become a generally accepted treatment for high-risk patients with some other forms of cancer, such as Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer. In May, a study published in the New England Journal found that patients with multiple myeloma -- a form of blood cancer -- who received high-dose chemotherapy and stem cells lived a year longer than those receiving standard chemotherapy.  Eric Winer, director of the breast oncology center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said other treatments, including new drugs and more-frequent administration of conventional chemotherapy doses, remain more promising. "Within the breast-cancer community, I don't see these studies leading to a groundswell of enthusiasm for asking more high-dose therapy questions," Dr. Winer said. Dana-Farber stopped participating in trials for the high-dose approach to breast cancer several years ago.
