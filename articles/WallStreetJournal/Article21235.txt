 NASD Board Voted to Oppose Set Halts In Trading if Stock Markets Plunge   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1988  But the board's decision to oppose trading halts as a matter of policy does raise questions about the future of the trading limits jointly proposed by the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last month, a week before the NASD vote. Introduction of those circuit breakers is contingent upon, among other things, the adoption of similar market-closing mechanisms by all domestic markets.  As previously reported, the Big Board and the Merc proposed to slow trading when the biggest stock-index futures contract is down an equivalent of 96 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average during a day, and to halt trading when the Dow falls 250 points and again when it falls 400 points.  A spokesman for the Big Board said that if the NASD doesn't like trading halts, it should suggest some alternative means of addressing investors' concerns. He said the New York Stock Exchange continues to support the proposals that it and the Merc made last month. But he added, "The proposal can't go forward without the participation of all markets, because to do so would disadvantage and confuse the investing public."
