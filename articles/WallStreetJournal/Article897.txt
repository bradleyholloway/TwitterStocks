 Revlon Accepts Higher Offer From Chairman --- Perelman Company Raises Its Bid for Rest of Shares To $20.10 From $18.50   By By Ann Hagedorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  Revlon Group Inc. directors accepted a sweetened offer by MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. to acquire the Revlon shares it doesn't own for $20.10 each, or about $800 million.  The directors also agreed to merge Revlon with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, which is owned by Revlon's chairman, Ronald O. Perelman. MacAndrews & Forbes already holds about 33% of Revlon's 59 million shares outstanding.  Howard Gittis, vice chairman of Revlon and of MacAndrews & Forbes, said the price was reached in negotiations with Revlon's outside directors; Wertheim Schroeder & Co., their investment adviser, and lawyers for shareholders who had brought 16 suits against Revlon complaining the initial offer was too low. Mr. Gittis said the suits have been dropped.
