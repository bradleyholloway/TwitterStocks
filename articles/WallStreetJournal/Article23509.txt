 Rising Mining Costs Weigh on Rio Tinto's Earnings   By Stephen Bell and Alex Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2007  The result was further damped by a $314 million impairment charge of Rio Tinto's Argyle diamond mine because of industry cost pressures, raising the cost of the move underground at the Western Australia mine to about $1.5 billion, from an earlier forecast of $910 million.  Higher prices also lifted results by $513 million, and Rio Tinto said the outlook for its markets remains positive with growth in China showing no signs of softening. Mr. [Tom Albanese] said demand for commodities in the Chinese markets is "motoring ahead," with copper, aluminum and iron ore all showing strong consumption growth. "We've seen nothing resembling a slowdown . . . or an inventory build," he added. China represents 17% of Rio Tinto's sales.
