 Traders Predict Further Growth In the Dollar --- Unit's Rise to 3-Month High Against the Yen Fuels Bullish Near-Term Views   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1987  As the dollar climbed to its highest level in more than three months against the Japanese yen Friday, some traders and economists predicted a brighter future for the U.S. currency.  Investment flows from Japan figure importantly in the latest rise in bullish sentiment for the dollar, and the U.S. unit is expected to strengthen more against the yen than against other major currencies. That trend already showed itself last week, as the dollar climbed 1.6% against the Japanese unit, in contrast to a 0.7% rise against the West German mark.  "The dollar is returning to the uptrend, especially against the yen," Keiichi Udagawa, chief foreign exchange trader at the Bank of Tokyo's New York branch, said. "The dollar is very gradually going up, one day, then another day, and another." The dollar's progress most of last week resembled a crawl, with trading volume reduced by summer vacations in Europe and a slowdown in the U.S. ahead of the Independence Day holiday.
