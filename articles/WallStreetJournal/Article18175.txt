 Australian Wool Sales Canceled for 3 Weeks Due to Uncertainty ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1991  MELBOURNE, Australia -- Wool sales in Australia, the world's biggest wool exporter, have been canceled for three weeks because of uncertainty over a price-support system operated by Australian Wool Corp.  The government-backed wool-marketing concern supports the price of wool above 7 Australian dollars (US$5.48) a kilogram using contributions from wool growers and borrowings.  Wool Corp. said that "because of the continuing speculation in the market and the media about the future of the reserveprice scheme," the corporation decided to defer wool auctions for up to three weeks. The deferral limits the liability of the market-support fund until "firm and unequivocal policies for the industry's future" are announced, the statement said.
