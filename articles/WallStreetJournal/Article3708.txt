 Increasing Your Odds in a Heart Attack; Study Says the Right Hospital Matters More Than Speed; Find an Angioplasty Center   By Amy Dockser Marcus, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2003  "Maybe care should be regionalized and they should go to the closest angioplasty center, even if it takes extra time," said Alice K. Jacobs, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at Boston University Medical Center, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. "Then you have an experienced team waiting, and they can perform angioplasty 24 hours a day and can get the artery open faster."  The four-year study randomly assigned 1,572 Danish patients to treatment with angioplasty or drug therapy, with 1,129 going to local hospitals and 443 to angioplasty centers. The patients treated with clot-busting medication suffered second heart attacks at a rate four times that of the group that received angioplasty. There was little difference in outcome for angioplasty patients based on whether they been taken directly to an angioplasty center or transferred there from another hospital.  Dr. Jacobs cautioned that she isn't sure that the Danish study is directly relevant to the U.S., primarily because of longer hospital transfer times in the U.S. In the Danish study, 96% of patients originally admitted to a local hospital, then transferred to another facility, were in the angioplasty lab within two hours of their original diagnosis. The average in the U.S. is more than three hours, Dr. Jacobs noted.
