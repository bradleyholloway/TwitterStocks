 A Tax Cut: The Perfect Wartime Boost   By By Arthur B. Laffer and Stephen Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2003  The above points should be enough to convince any senator that President [Bush]'s tax bill is good for the country and that it's needed now. President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher cut tax rates to win the "Third World War." President Kennedy reignited prosperity from the sluggish Eisenhower/Nixon era by tax-rate cuts. Surely our Senate doesn't want to emulate the 16 years of Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter with tax increases and slow growth. Even the four years of President Bush senior were plagued by slow growth and higher tax rates. President Clinton, after a poor start during which taxes were raised, changed his tune and became a tax-cutting pro-growth president. The transition for President Clinton was definitely helped by the election of a Republican Congress in 1994. The last six years of the Clinton administration included Nafta, welfare reform, the reappointment of Alan Greenspan (twice), a huge capital-gains tax-rate cut, reduced federal spending as a share of GDP and budget surpluses. Let's keep the momentum going.  Because of the rapid growth of the Clinton '90s and the reduction in spending and budget surpluses during President Clinton's tenure in office, the U.S. has a degree of fiscal flexibility as never before. Assuming 5% nominal GDP growth per year, the U.S. would have to run deficits of $500 billion per year for the next 10 years just to reach the level of debt relative to GDP that we had in 1993. While we're not suggesting that that would be the "right thing to do," what we are suggesting is that the idea of excessive federal debt is not the appropriate consideration to keep our president and our Congress from doing what's right for our country. We need President Bush's tax cuts now.
