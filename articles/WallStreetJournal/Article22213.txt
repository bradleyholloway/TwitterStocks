 Pricey Operation: A Plan to Cut Back On Medicare Expenses Goes Awry; Costs Soar --- Hospitals Rush to Remodel To Offer Subacute Care -- And Get Paid Twice --- Federal Officials Are Fuming   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1996  By moving Ms. Horne, Chester County Hospital broke free of strict federal limits on how much the Medicare program pays hospitals to care for the elderly. No longer was the hospital limited to a $10,500 lump-sum payment for her full stay, regardless of how protracted her recovery might be. Instead, Chester County could bill Medicare twice. It still collected the $10,500 flat rate but now also qualified for an extra $554 a day, including reimbursement for therapy, tests and lab work, for her stay in the new "subacute" suite.  Hundreds of other hospitals are seizing this chance to get more money from Medicare. They are remodeling underused patient floors and rechristening them subacute or skilled-nursing facilities. Then they divide elderly patients' stays in two, transferring the patients to these floors partway through a hospital stay so that the Medicare billing clock can be restarted.  Federal regulators are fuming. While skilled nursing is a covered benefit under Medicare, the officials say its costs have mushroomed out of control. Part of the problem, they add, is that hospitals and nursing homes no longer think of subacute care as a special service needed only by a few patients. Attracted by the financial payoff, hospitals instead are whizzing vast numbers of patients into subacute units, the officials suggest.
