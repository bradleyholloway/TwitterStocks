 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2004  "These criminal acts will not weaken the government's determination to fight this group, which is isolated legally, socially and in its way of thinking," Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said yesterday. He was speaking at the first news conference by a senior Saudi official since May 29, when Islamist terrorists killed 22 people, mostly non-Saudis, in the eastern oil town of Khobar.  Prince Saud said the latest version he had seen had solved his principal objections. But he said it had to be realistic and tackle economic issues, too. "You can't get reforms if you don't provide the bread," he said. "If the countries of the West want to urge reform in the Middle East, it should be done by example, not by force."  "Very often, EU regulation is not based on rigorous impact assessment," said the spokesman, Alfredo Filippone. "Also, legislation seems to be worked in isolation so that every commissioner or director general proposes something, but they don't really coordinate."
