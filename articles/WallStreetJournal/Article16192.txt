 Monthly Mutual Funds Review --- Investors Get Soaked in Market's Storm --- Fund Managers Share Some of Their Strategies To Survive Tough Times   By By Tom Lauricella, Theo Francis and Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2002  To help him weather such market conditions -- the toughest since he began running the Aim Aggressive Growth portfolio in 1992, Mr. [Bob Kippes] has taken a number of defensive moves. Despite his fund's name, Mr. Kippes had toned down the portfolio's aggressive posture over the past year. So even while he still has a few large holdings in such companies as SunGard, he had already cut his investment in technology stocks to around 18% from a peak of 50% in December 1999.  It's a sign of how far down the market has come that a growth-stock manager like Mr. Kippes finds himself agreeing with the value-investing style's best-known advocate today, Warren Buffett. Looking back on the market excess, Mr. Kippes quoted Mr. Buffett, saying: " `it's only in the rinse cycle that you find out how dirty the laundry was.' "  As a result, Mr. Schneider began aggressively buying WorldCom shares. By Sept. 30, he had invested more than $21 million, or 6.55%, of the fund's then $320 million in assets in the stock of the telecom-service provider. The fund's WorldCom stake dropped steadily to 3.5% at year end as other investments in the portfolio appreciated and Mr. Schneider began selling WorldCom shares.
