 Internet Issues, Nasdaq Jump Up Off the Mat   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1999  Internet-related stocks, as measured by the 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index, rallied 10.1% yesterday, after the 18.7% slide on Monday, the biggest fall for the index based on data going back to July 1997. Helping the Internet stocks was positive comments on the group from several brokerage firms, including Goldman Sachs.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes manufacturing stocks as well as some formerly highflying drug, financial and technology stocks, inched up yesterday 8.02 points, or 0.08%, to 10448.55. The surge in the formerly out-of-favor smokestack stocks has left the industrials up 13.8% for the year. Although the manufacturing stocks, such as Caterpillar and AlliedSignal, fell yesterday, resurgent market darlings such as GE, Johnson & Johnson, Wal-Mart and Citigroup pushed the index up. The blue-chip index stands just 0.43% short of the record it hit on Friday.  Big technology stocks, financial stocks and other long-time market leaders got a boost from reassuring comments released in the morning by Goldman Sachs investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, Wall Street's most prominent bull. Unlike some other analysts, she said the rotation toward economically sensitive stocks has gone too far. The global recovery is just beginning, she noted. With the old leaders still showing earnings strength, she said, they too should benefit from continuing low inflation and gradual economic recovery abroad.
