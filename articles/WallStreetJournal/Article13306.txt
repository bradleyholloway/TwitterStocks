 Tip of the Week: Pension Bill Bolsters 529s   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  The change makes the use of a 529 plan "a permanent education- planning technique," says Bill Fleming, a managing director for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hartford, Conn. "Before, we were always concerned about children going to college after 2010 and whether we'd be paying income tax on their 529 distributions."  Picking the right 529 plan, however, isn't always easy. Check your own state's plan first, since many offer state-tax breaks to residents. Compare the plans' investment options, fees and expenses.
