 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Food & Drink -- Eating Out: Playing With Our Food; Why egg-filled ravioli and other food stunts are so popular   By Sokolov, Raymond, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2007  Mr. [Heston Blumenthal], Wylie Dufresne of wd-50 in New York and Grant Achatz of Alinea in Chicago, all of them part of the molecular gastronomy movement led by El Bulli's Ferran Adria in northeast Spain, deploy scientific tools such as liquid nitrogen and low-temperature "sous vide" water baths to produce startling and often surreal dishes. They are remarkable to look at and astonishing to taste -- fried mayonnaise, after-dinner whiskey gum and mystical essences such as "toasted hay."  Ms. Lo, a Michigander as well as an alumna of the same New England private school as Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, with a degree in French from Columbia, combined all of her backgrounds to reinvent a folkloric Shanghainese dish that started out as a soup-filled bun with a pork meatball inside. It came to Queens, N.Y., as a soup dumpling shaped like a beggar's purse served at Joe's Shanghai. By 1998, when Joe's opened a Manhattan branch, it was on every epicure's lips, literally and figuratively.  At Centro Vinoteca, in the basement kitchen, a meticulous fellow called Humberto rolls out a long, thin layer of dough for the steroidal ravioli and cuts out three-inch disks with a sort of cookie cutter. Onto them he spreads a mixture of ricotta and Parmesan cheese. Then he cracks an egg, separates the yolk from the white and gingerly deposits a perfect sun of a yolk on the cheese. A second disk of dough goes on top and is pressed in place to make a single large raviolo (ravioli is the plural), or, to be more exact, a raviolone (the last syllable, an Italian "augmentative," implies bigness beyond the normal) with a raw yolk inside.
