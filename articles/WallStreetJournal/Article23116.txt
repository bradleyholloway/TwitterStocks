 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Discovering Profits in Timing Funds; A Student s Tip Aided Professor in Research Into Trading Strategy   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2004  Looking at market-timing research being circulated in 2000 and 2001 caused the Securities and Exchange Commission's staff to "focus on the issue" of market timing, leading it to clarify to the industry steps that funds could take to deter the practice, says Paul Roye, head of the SEC's Division of Investment Management. But what the SEC staff didn't know -- and, of course, what wasn't detailed in the research papers -- was how widespread the practice was and that "there were funds cutting deals" with market timers to enable their rapid trades, he adds.  It was easy money because of a quirk in the way fund companies priced international funds. Investors like Mr. [Glenn Rasmussen] could place an order to buy or sell fund shares until 4 p.m. Eastern time, but the funds' share price was determined using the closing prices on securities traded in Europe or Asia, determined hours earlier. So if the U.S. stock market took a plunge after the Asian and European markets had closed, that move wouldn't be factored into the funds' net asset value, even though there was a good chance that Asian and European stocks would follow the U.S. market in the next day's trading.  "A year ago, I thought I'd come and work on this sleepy research topic," Mr. [David Dubofsky] says of his mutual-fund timing work. "But it's become a lot more important."
