 Cash Economy -- Behind Slow Growth in Europe: Citizens' Tight Grip on Wallets; A Thicket of Laws to Protect People Damps Spending; 'Debt Is Disreputable'; Better Things to Do Than Shop   By Walker, Marcus, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2004  Weak consumption in the euro zone -- the world's second-biggest consumer market after the U.S. -- means one less source of growth for U.S. exporters. It has thus contributed to the ballooning U.S. deficit in the trade of goods and services, and is weakening the dollar: European companies that export to America are paid in dollars, which they then sell to buy euros. But because Europeans aren't consuming as many American products, U.S. exporters don't receive many euros to balance things out. Eventually, the falling dollar will mean Americans won't be able to afford as much from Europe, which will threaten Europe's meager, export-reliant growth.  "I'm not relying on there being anything," says Ms. [Anke Hemmann], 27 years old. "If there is something, that's a bonus." So she puts 12% of her disposable income in a life-insurance policy that will serve as a private pension. That doesn't leave much for shopping, which -- like many Europeans -- she's not that interested in anyway. She buys shoes three times a year and an item of clothing roughly every six weeks.  David Thesmar, an economics professor at the Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique in Paris, doesn't even have a credit card. He and his wife want only enough money to meet their spending needs, and he would rather spend his free time with his kids than go shopping, he says. "I'm not a very big shopper," says the 32-year-old. "I don't feel bad when I buy cultural things like books or CDs, but it feels bad to buy futile things, especially when I buy clothes."
