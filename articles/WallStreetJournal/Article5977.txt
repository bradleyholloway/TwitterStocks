 EU Fiscal Ministers Meet to Confront Perils   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said on Saturday that Germany is showing tentative signs of economic recovery, and that any suggestion that Europe's largest economy is entering a recession is nonsense. Mr. Eichel also noted that Europe has already done its part to boost economic activity with tax cuts, introduced in a number of countries, including Germany.  Italy faces particular scrutiny because government ministers have already hinted that the country's 2001 budget deficit could hit 2%, double the level promised last year. One EU diplomat said yesterday that he expected Italy to tell its peers that the government's electoral commitment to reducing taxes would be phased in over time to ensure that its deficit did not balloon.
