 Hong Kong Seeks to Attract Islamic Bonds   By Cheung, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  Islamic bonds -- structured in accordance with Shariah, or Islamic law -- differ primarily from their conventional counterparts in that they don't pay interest, which Muslims consider to be usury. Instead, lenders receive a regular payment linked to the performance of underlying tangible assets.  "Hong Kong is late in coming into the game, but it's just a matter of the legal system being put in place to accommodate the Islamic product," said Edwin E. Hitti, president of Hong Kong's Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Since the government's announcement in July, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which functions as the local central bank, has formed a group to establish necessary laws, tax systems and other regulations to put Shariah financing on an equal footing with its conventional counterpart. The Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry has set up a five-member Shariah advisory council comprising Islamic scholars and professionals, including Mr. Hitti and the chief imam of Hong Kong, Muhammad Arshad, that will assess and rule on Islamic products in the city.
