 Amid U.S. Shortage, More Mexican Cement Is Sought   By Carlton, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2005  Friday, the Associated General Contractors asked Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez to suspend an antidumping duty on cement imports from Mexico as a way to increase supply. The shortage reports are "especially alarming" because they come at the beginning of the construction season, "meaning more severe problems are almost certain in the near future," Stephen Sandherr, the association's chief executive wrote to Mr. Gutierrez.  The U.S. imposed the duty in 1990 after American producers complained they were losing sales to Mexican rivals selling cement below cost. Many domestic producers are opposed to lifting the $50-a- ton duty, because they fear additional imports of cement will only worsen a possible world-wide glut as new plants go into production in coming years. A spokesman for the Commerce Department said the agency is engaged in a "dialogue" with the Mexican government about alternatives.
