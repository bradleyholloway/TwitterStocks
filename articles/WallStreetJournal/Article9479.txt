 Taste -- de gustibus: The Islam Expert Who Now Heads A Divinity School   By By Brendan Miniter, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2002  In an interview, Mr. [William Graham] said that he finds it ridiculous that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill -- his alma mater -- came under fire recently for requiring incoming freshmen to read "Approaching the Qu'ran: The Early Revelations," by Michael Sells. Critics said the book did not include the militant side of Islam, and they argued that requiring such a book in a state school breached the wall between church and state. Mr. Graham sees the whole controversy as a matter of academic freedom, and indeed a recent court decision, upholding North Carolina's reading list, agrees with him on this.  As for Islam itself, Mr. Graham believes that it is, as the phrase goes, a religion of peace. He explains that many everyday human-rights abuses committed in the name of Islam really occur because the Muslim world happens to overlap with a large swath of the impoverished world.  Mr. Graham isn't, as he confesses, an international relations scholar or a political scientist. He is a student of Islam and now a divinity-school dean, and looking across the Muslim world he sees a lot of reason to be hopeful. "It's not impossible at all" for Islam to be integrated into the modern world, he said. "It's not going to be easy, but Islam is going to have to reform. . . . But religious movements do this all the time."
