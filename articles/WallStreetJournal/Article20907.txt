 Futile Journey: Failed Farmers Find More Hardship as They Trek to City for Work --- Lack of Job-Seeking Skills, Age, Poor Credit Hurt; One Family's Difficulties --- Facing Blue-Collar Hostility   By By Alex Kotlowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1985  The scorn of city dwellers, who feel threatened by these new urban immigrants, is just one of the problems facing a growing group of farmers now searching for work. Mr. DeCourley, who lost his farm in 1981, was among the first of those who are being driven from their land by the unrelenting five-year farm recession. Now, he and Gary scratch to make a living in the city, selling other farmers' produce.  An estimated 20% to 25% of former farmers have left their home counties since Mr. DeCourley and his sons were forced off their farm, and more are expected to follow as the farm crisis worsens, according to studies conducted at the University of Missouri and Iowa State University. Rex Campbell, a University of Missouri sociologist, estimates that as many as 300,000 landless farmers will trek to the cities in the next two decades, speeding a growing exodus from rural areas.  Lloyd DeCourley and his wife, Sharon, typify the new group of landless former farmers. By most measures, Mr. DeCourley was a moderately successful rice and soybean farmer in southeastern Missouri. In the mid-1970s, he earned as much as $40,000 a year, in part because, like many farmers, he worked at other jobs -- including stints as a deputy sheriff and a country-and-western radio disk jockey -- to supplement his income.
