 Coke Aims to Improve Water Recycling; Proposal Marks a Bid To Address Criticism In Developing Nations   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2007  Criticism of heavy water usage by Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo Inc. has been strongest in India, where water shortages in rural areas can be severe and where the companies have been accused of draining water from poor communities. A Coca-Cola plant in Kerala has been closed for two years because of opposition from residents.  "This is an aspirational goal, but behind it is work that's already taken place and measurements that we already make," Mr. [E. Neville Isdell] said in an interview. "You focus on the areas which are relevant to your business, and that is what we're doing. Water is clearly a relevant area. And that then gets employee engagement and legitimization from the shareholders as well."  "So much of the press these days is focused on climate change and humanity's and business's use of carbon. I really believe that water is the next carbon," said Carter Roberts, U.S. president of WWF, which is working with Coca-Cola on the company's water program. While water shortages now mainly affect the poor -- Mr. Roberts estimates 1.1 billion people world-wide lack access to safe drinking water -- he says such shortages could become a growing problem for businesses in the future.
