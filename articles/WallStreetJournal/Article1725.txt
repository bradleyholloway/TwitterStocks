Those enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans may be required to receive the services from an in-network doctor or other provider in order for the services to be covered with no cost-sharing obligation, says Anne Hance, a partner in Washington, D.C., in the health industry advisory practice group at law firm McDermott Will & Emery.
