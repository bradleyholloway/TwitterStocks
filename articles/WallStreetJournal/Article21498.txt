 Profit Forecast Set by United Technologies --- Company Says 1991 Figure Could Trail Estimates; Some Lines Will Expand   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 1990  The current economic climate in North America has damped earnings prospects, said Mr. Rolls, who expects 1990 earnings somewhere between analysts' estimates of "$5.50 and $5.70 a share." Those numbers include a 21-cent-a-share gain from the sale of assets at the end of the third quarter and a 17-cent-a-share charge earlier. In 1989, the company earned $5.34 a share. Mr. Rolls declined to elaborate on the 1991 outlook, but said the threat of rising oil prices posed by the Mideast crisis worries him.  Chairman Robert F. Daniell said defense and aerospace have been profitable but shrinking orders have prompted the company to look for growth in other segments. "We're not accepting the high-risk (defense) contracts that we used to. We are being very selective," he said. The company's aerospace and defense business accounted for roughly half the concern's 1989 revenue of $19.76 billion. The commercial side consists of automotive, air-conditioning gear and elevators.  Mr. Rolls said the company sees major growth opportunities for its Carrier Corp. unit, the air-conditioning and ventilation systems maker that last year had revenue of $3.96 billion. The world-wide air-conditioning market is about $22 billion, with North America and Japan each accounting for $8 billion. The remainder is in Europe, where Mr. Rolls said UTC expects to make "major gains" in market share. He declined to supply numbers.
