 Polaroid Picture Is Unclear as Analysts Differ On Long-Term Outlook for Instant Cameras   By By Linda M. Watkins, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 13, 1987  The picture would appear to be bright for Polaroid. Its Spectra instant camera is selling briskly. The weak dollar has boosted overseas results. And earnings, after more than doubling in 1986, should see another healthy rise this year.  The conflicting views have been reflected in the recent ups and downs of Polaroid stock. The shares posted a healthy increase from mid-January to mid-February after Ms. Landry, long a bull on the stock, reaffirmed her buy recommendation. But they slid after the company released fourth-quarter earnings and began indicating to analysts that sales of Spectra were lower than expected in the quarter. The camera takes sharper pictures with brighter colors than previous instant models.  Some big retailers have kind words for Spectra. Abe Brown, general manager of 47th Street Photo Inc., the New York-based discount camera and electronics business, says Spectra sales haven't slackened since he started selling the camera, and instant-camera sales are way above those of a year ago. "Spectra has absolutely revitalized the instant photography market," he says.
