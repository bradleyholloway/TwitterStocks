 Feingold explains position on budget vote   By Feingold, Russ, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1993  Russ Feingold responds to an Aug 3, 1993 editorial "The Nitty Gritty," in which, he says, the author misstated several critical facts, including his position on President Clinton's deficit reduction program. Feingold says that he has, from the beginning, planned to vote for the program if it stayed close to the original $500 billion in net deficit reduction.
