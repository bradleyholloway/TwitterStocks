 See Beyond Faces Issues With Auditor   By By Scott Thurm and Mylene Mangalindan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2002  SeeBeyond's auditors soon called to express their concern about including the $2.2 million contract in the first-quarter results. According to SeeBeyond officials, the auditors were concerned because the customer planned to deploy, and pay for, the software in stages that could extend until March 31, 2003. Over such a long period, the auditors said, the customer could change its mind, or renegotiate the contract. And they wanted directors, as well as executives, to hear their reasoning.  Chief Financial Officer Barry Plaga says he thought SeeBeyond had a "pretty reasonable basis" for including the revenue in first-quarter results. While payment could extend beyond a year, Mr. Plaga says the customer, who has bought SeeBeyond's software before, is likely to use, and pay for, the software sooner.  As analysts, investors and reporters continued to ask questions, SeeBeyond acknowledged the auditors' role. But the changing explanations "breach the trust an investor has with the company," says Mr. [Jordan Klein]. The matter has "created a credibility problem for management," echoes Michael Marzolf, of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. Mr. Marzolf speculates that SeeBeyond's shares wouldn't have fallen as sharply if the company had acknowledged the auditors' role on the April 22 call. "The stock was not down 50% because they missed the quarter by $2 million," he says.
