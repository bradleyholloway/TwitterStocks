 Dole Backs Plan To Raise Funds For War on Drugs   By By Ellen Hume and Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1986  It would be similar to the $1 voluntary political contribution box on current tax returns, Mr. Dole told reporters yesterday as he came out of a bipartisan meeting at the White House on the drug issue. It would "bring in hundreds of millions every year," he said.  The White House is putting the finishing touches on a package of proposals they hope will upstage the House's sweeping, $3.5 billion bill, scheduled for floor debate today. The White House is under increasing election-year pressure to go along with substantial spending increases to improve aerial surveillance of drug-producing areas, hire hundreds of additional federal agents and provide anti-drug grants to state and local governments.
