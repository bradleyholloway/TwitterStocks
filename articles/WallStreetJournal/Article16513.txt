 Russian Banks Prove Tempting; Sale of Tiny KMB Underscores Interest in Country's Growth Story   By Chazan, Guy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2005  Despite growing concerns among Western political leaders about President Vladimir Putin's crackdown on private business and democratic institutions, foreign investors who for years had shunned Russia as too risky now see it as an opportunity too big to pass up. Banking is a particularly tempting sector, offering Westerners a chance to cash in on Russia's consumer boom. In contrast to other big emerging markets such as China and India, Russia allows foreigners to own banks. Regulators also seem to be getting serious about cleaning up the notoriously weak sector.  Foreign banks are riding the wave. In February, Citigroup Inc. Chairman Sanford Weill met President Putin to pitch him on a credit card and discuss the bank's ambitious expansion plans in Russia, one of its priority markets. Citibank's consumer loan portfolio soared in 2004 to 2.5 billion rubles, or about $90 million, and it plans to double its private client base to 300,000 by year's end.  "We're looking to make Russia one of the biggest consumer businesses that Citibank has world-wide," says Rajive Chadha, Russia manager for Citibank's global consumer group.
