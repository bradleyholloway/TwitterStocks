 Uneasy Boom: Norway's Oil Bonanza Stirs Fears of a Future When Wells Run Dry --- As Output Climbs, Many Say Money Is Being Wasted And a Slump Lies Ahead --- A Town's Varying Fortunes   By By Kyle Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1995  For tiny Norway -- due later this year to surpass Iran and trail only Saudi Arabia as the world's second-biggest crude exporter -- North Sea oil has turned into a gusher of cash as new drilling technologies revive dormant fields. A country that a generation ago eked out a living on agriculture and shipping today has Europe's second-highest standard of living, after Switzerland. "The money is dropping from the heavens down into our hands," says Marianne Andreassen, a finance ministry official. "It's a gift."  Although Norway is undoubtedly better off, short term, with its oil bonanza than without it, many worry it may be worse off in the long run unless it starts managing its oil more wisely. "Sooner or later, it's all going to fall," frets Odd Kvaloy, who runs Stavanger's hospital, which was built with oil money. "And then where will we be?"  Even as Norway is producing oil as never before -- its output is at a record 2.7 million barrels a day, up 35% since 1993 alone and nearly quadruple a decade agopressure is mounting to limit its production. If it acquiesces, crude-oil prices could increase world-wide. But Norway has repeatedly thwarted attempts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb output. By keeping its crude flowing, Norway, which isn't an OPEC member, has eroded support for the cartel's moves and helped hold down prices.
