 Ebbers Will Serve Prison Term In Louisiana   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2005  "It is virtually unheard of for a first-time, white-collar offender like Mr. [Bernard Ebbers] to be required to serve his sentence in a medium- security facility," Mr. [Reid Weingarten] wrote. Prisoners facing sentences as long as that imposed on Mr. Ebbers normally aren't assigned to low- security facilities because of the risk they will attempt to escape, but the judge agreed that Mr. Ebbers wasn't a flight risk.
