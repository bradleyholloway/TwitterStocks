 Manager's Journal: Discounting Is No Bargain   By By Robert Shulman and Richard Miniter, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1998  With total sales shrinking this summer, Quaker Oats's new CEO, Robert Morrison, was desperate for some good news. He told analysts about Quaker's fast-growing bagged-cereal business, where sales volume was up 9%. Bad idea. Quaker was boosting volume by slashing prices and squeezing margins. Sales were up, but profits were down. Worse still, Quaker was signaling that its brand is just another cereal. Little wonder once-loyal customers are migrating to more deeply discounted store brands.  General Motors recently offered a new, indirect discount: a free security system called OnStar, worth $1,500. This comes on top of other rebates which total $2,000 on some models. But OnStar was supposed to be a strong reason for consumers to pay more for GM luxury cars. Now it's just another freebie. "People used to be proud to own a Corvette or Cadillac. Now they just wait for the price wars," sighs an Arlington, Va., car salesman.  Consider the saga of the Lacoste polo shirt. Rene Lacoste, a 1930s French tennis champion, created the legendary shirt. His distinctive crocodile emblem soon developed real cachet, fetching high prices and earning fat margins. In 1970 Lacoste sold its U.S. rights to Minneapolis-based General Mills. Sticking to the high-price, high-margin strategy General Mills had by 1980 turned Lacoste shirts into a $400 million business.
