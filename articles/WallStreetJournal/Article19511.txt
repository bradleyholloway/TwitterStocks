 KirchMedia Plans to File for Bankruptcy This Week if Rescue Doesn't Materialize   By By Matthew Karnitschnig, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2002  A failure of KirchMedia would likely mark the biggest German bankruptcy since World War II and put an unfortunate end to founder Leo Kirch's 50-year rise from poor Bavarian farmboy to billionaire media mogul. The crisis comes amid a slew of prominent recent insolvencies in Germany, among them filings by construction group Philipp Holzmann AG and airplane maker Fairchild Dornier Corp.  Complicating matters further, the shareholders -- which also include Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holdings, U.S. investment group Capital Research, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and German retailer Rewe Group -- have been unable to agree on a share division between themselves. KirchMedia, which employs most of the group's 10,000 employees, carries most of its parent's total debt, of between 6.5 billion and eight billion euros.
