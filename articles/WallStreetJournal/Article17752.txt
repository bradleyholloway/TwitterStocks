 Business World: Rocket Makes Tackle a Private Launch Puzzle   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1987  John F. Yardley, president of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., at least has one competitor out of his hair, or so he hopes. The State Department set about last month to block acceptance by any American company of a Soviet offer to launch satellites into space at bargain rates. Such a deal would violate a U.S. ban on the transfer of space technology to the Soviet Union, said State. It was unimpressed by the Russians' promise that they wouldn't peek at the inner workings of any satellite shipped to their Tyuratam launch site.  A few days later, the McDonnell Douglas Corp. unit nailed down a launch contract of its own, its first since President Reagan ceded the commercial business of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to private industry a year ago. Mr. Yardley made a $100 million deal with Hughes Aircraft to launch two satellites a British firm will use for direct broadcasts to Europeans.  The privatization of commercial space launches is thus well under way. But there are a few sputters. For one thing, says Mr. Yardley, "it's a little fuzzy what our government's position is," Mr. Reagan's decision last August notwithstanding. The president had said "the private sector, with its ingenuity and cost effectiveness" will take over commercial business. But Mr. Yardley finds that NASA isn't in any great hurry to relinquish its role and "there are a lot of detailed things to be ironed out that affect four different departments, Commerce, Transportation, NASA and the Department of Defense."
