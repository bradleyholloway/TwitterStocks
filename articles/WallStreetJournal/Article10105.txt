 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2007  Economists polled by Dow Jones estimate 85,000 jobs were added to U.S. business payrolls in November, down from October's 166,000 but still strong enough to help allay worries about a recession.  On the other hand, a report from payroll company Automatic Data Processing and economic-forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers hints that private payrolls rose by a robust 189,000 jobs in November, and by even more when government jobs are counted. But the ADP report hasn't been as accurate as its promoters said it would be when launched last year.  Statisticians also have to make sure that they properly account for the relative importance of different sectors. When once-hot sectors, like housing, go cold, the sample sizes in the government numbers can get kooky, overweighting some sectors that don't matter as much as before.
