 West Virginia Weighs Lawsuit Against Brokers   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1989  The state of West Virginia has decided to retain a special securities law firm to investigate whether to sue several major brokerage firms in connection with $279 million in losses from the state's consolidated investment fund.  The state's seven-member board of investments, which includes the governor, treasurer and auditor, agreed yesterday to hire Wolff Ardis, Memphis, Tenn., experts in securities law. The firm has acted as special counsel to both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.  Thomas Heywood, legal counsel for Gov. Gaston Caperton, said the outside firm will determine whether to file suit against brokerage firms that processed high-risk transactions for the state's $1.3 billion investment fund. Firms that processed investments for the fund include Morgan Stanley & Co, Salomon Brothers Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co, and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
