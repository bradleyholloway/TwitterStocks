 SmartMoney.com: Credit Scores You Don't Know You Have   By Todorova, Aleksandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  Think of the credit scores that auto lenders use as traditional FICO scores with a soft spot for the auto-related part of your credit report. If you've had auto loans that have been paid on time, for example, your auto-loan FICO score will reward that more than your traditional FICO. But if you've had late payments on an auto loan, or a car repossession, your auto score will suffer more than your traditional score.  Where insurance scores can get confusing is the range they use. Fair Isaac's FICO scores run between 300 and 850, but its insurance scores range from 300 to 900. (The company doesn't release a breakdown of what is considered a "good" insurance score the way it does for its traditional FICO score.)  What you may not know is that these credit scores are simply knock- offs of the real thing. "The only playce to get your legitimate FICO score is through FICO's Web site or Equifax," says [John Ulzheimer], president of Credit.com. The credit scores sold by TransUnion and Experian are their own so-called "educational scores" that are sold to consumers -- not lenders.
