 Not Our Bag, Coach Says in a Lawsuit Alleging Target Sold Counterfeit Purse   By Vanessa O'Connell and Kris Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan Friday, Coach alleged that Target was a counterfeiter by selling a Coach-style purse, complete with a hang tag that says "Coach," according to Coach Chief Financial Officer Mike Devine. The allegedly fake bag has Coach's signature C-pattern and a touch of snakeskin-like fabric in the center of the bag, according to a photo of it included in the lawsuit. The bag, purchased from a Target store in Largo, Fla., is an "exact replica of a genuine Coach handbag" bearing at least one Coach trademark, the suit says.  The Coach suit is seeking at least $1 million as well as information about where the bag was made. "This is a counterfeit," Mr. Devine says. "We have gone into stores in Florida and purchased this ourselves. It isn't ours."  Though Coach has encountered other instances of stores selling Coach counterfeit goods, those stores were "usually small mom-and-pops" against which Coach sought criminal actions, working with police, Mr. Devine says. "What we don't see is reputable retailers selling counterfeits, which is what is so surprising about the Target situation," he said.
