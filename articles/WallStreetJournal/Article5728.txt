 Tiny Cerent Makes Big-League Connections   By By Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1999  The closely held Petaluma, Calif., company makes devices to route telephone calls and computer traffic on and off fiber-optic lines. Since its first products were completed last September, Cerent has won orders from more than 70 companies. On Monday, for example, Williams Communications Group Inc. said it would buy $25 million of Cerent gear for the Tulsa, Okla., company's high-speed national network.  Networking companies seem to pop up with hot boxes all the time. But Cerent's customer list sets it apart from other Internet-related start-ups, generating a buzz about a possible public offering sometime this year. "It's caused a lot of fever on the Street," says Chris Crespi, a telecommunications-equipment analyst for Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, who says Cerent has won more customers more quickly than any company he's seen in this business.  Cerent is attacking an overlooked bottleneck as phone networks morph to accommodate the huge flows of Internet traffic. Companies such as Williams are laying thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables for long-haul transport of Web pages and video at the speed of light. Others are busily trying to speed local connections to homes and businesses through cable modems, high-speed phone lines and wireless systems. Cerent executives say, and some analysts agree, that their hardware can link those two parts of the network more cheaply and easily than alternatives.
