 Kraft CEO to Revamp Company; Holden Gets a New Global Post   By Ellison, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 2004  In a related move, Altria Group Inc., which owns an 84% stake in Kraft, said it will sell its large office facility in Rye Brook, N.Y., that employs about 1,000 people, most of whom work for Kraft. Those positions will be relocated to other Kraft offices, the two companies said. Altria Chief Executive Louis C. Camilleri, who also is chairman of Kraft's board, approved the reorganization plan.  In his new role, Mr. [Roger K. Deromedi], who is known for his financial acumen, will have to re-establish Kraft's credibility with investors who have been disappointed with the company's efforts after the initial public offering. Prior to being named sole chief executive of Kraft, Mr. Deromedi, 50 years old, served as CEO of Kraft Foods International, which last year generated about $8 billion of Kraft's $30 billion in revenue.
