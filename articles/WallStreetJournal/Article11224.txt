 Anti-Abortion Protesters' Convictions Under RICO Statute Upheld on Appeal   By By Milo Geyelin, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1989  A federal appeals court ruled that protesters who broke into an abortion clinic and destroyed its equipment violated civil anti-racketeering laws.  Issued late last week by a three-judge panel of the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the ruling upholds a lower court's novel application in 1987 of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, known as RICO. The appeals court found that the law can be used against protesters and demonstrators who commit serious crimes during their protests.  Edmond Tiryak, a Philadelphia attorney representing the clinic that was the target of the attacks more than three years ago, hailed the decision as an unprecedented and badly needed deterrent against violent anti-abortion organizers. Similar cases relying on the RICO statute are pending in about a dozen other cities.
