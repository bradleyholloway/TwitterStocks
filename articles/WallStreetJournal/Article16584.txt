 Your Money Manager As Financial Therapist; Brokers and Planners Offer A Psychological Approach To Better Aid Client Goals   By Wei, Lingling, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  At Wachovia Corp.'s Wachovia Securities, advisers have been using a process dubbed "Envision," which is designed to help clients identify what they want to achieve, prioritize those goals and monitor their progress. Some of its advisers term the process "marriage counseling." Ameriprise Financial Inc., formerly known as American Express Financial Advisors, has incorporated so-called life-planning skills into its training of advisers who serve mass-affluent individuals, typically $100,000 to $1 million in investible assets.  To play therapist, these advisers go beyond standard questionnaires of financial goals and income expectations to delve into deeper issues, such as hopes and dreams. "Most of the times, I feel like Barbara Walters," says Paula Feinberg, an El Paso, Texas-based financial consultant at Smith Barney, the brokerage arm of Citigroup Inc. "We need to give clients a sense of security so that they are willing to share with us things they don't want to tell other people."  "It's crucial for spouses to be really honest with each other from very early on," offers Ms. Feinberg, who often advises clients together with her husband Albert Feinberg, also a consultant at Smith Barney. "If you really know what matters to you, you know immediately what to cut out."
