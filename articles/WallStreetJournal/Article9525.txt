 Oil Powerhouses Vow to Intervene To Avert a Shortage if War Comes   By By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2003  Mr. [Claude Mandil] said that he had the solid backing of all IEA member states to use the agency's reserves to preclude oil shortages -- including France and Germany, which have sought to slow any U.S.-led attack on Iraq. Should hostilities break out, the flow of oil from Iraq, which currently produces about 2% of the world's oil, would almost certainly dry up, and exports from neighboring states also could be interrupted, pinching global supplies.  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, have pledged to increase output to make up for a loss in Iraqi supplies. Washington officials have indicated the U.S. would release oil reserves if needed in conjunction with any move by the IEA. U.S. emergency reserves are stored in underground salt domes along the Gulf Coast. When reserves are released, companies are able to bid for the oil and then take delivery by means of tanker or pipeline.  Kuwait -- whose invasion by Saddam Hussein sparked the 1991 Gulf War -- is again in the line of fire. Mindful of the risks, British oil giant BP PLC has started pulling out two-thirds of its employees and their dependents from Kuwait. Some employees of U.S. companies operating in Kuwait and their families are also pulling out, oil-industry officials say. U.S. companies decline to discuss the matter.
