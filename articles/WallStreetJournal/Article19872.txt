 Style & Substance: A Brand Excels by Breaking Fashion's Rules   By Rohwedder, Cecilie, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2005  Akris, whose work force of about 500 employees is about the same size as Gucci Group NV's tiny watch division, doesn't disclose sales or profit figures. But anecdotal evidence about its trajectory is compelling. High-end U.S. retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Inc.'s Saks Fifth Avenue now rank it among their top-selling designer labels, right near Chanel SA's namesake brand.  The U.S. market, with its favorable high-end careerwear demographics, has always been central to the company's strategy, and it's where Akris derives about a third of its sales. The company goes to lengths to please retailers, going so far as to incorporate merchants' suggestions into its clothing designs. "I never wanted to do showpieces; I want to do pieces that sell on the shop floor," said Akris designer Albert Kriemler, the founder's grandson.  Just don't expect Akris to become celebrity-centric, like so many other fashion brands. Akris, which nods to the front-row crowd at the fashion shows with only scant magazine advertising and select charity sponsorships, doesn't solicit or pay celebrities to wear the brand. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields, who have both worn Akris, contacted the company first, Akris said.
