 Economy Sends Mixed Message, Data Suggest --- Experts Say Numbers Don't Add Up to Recession; Inflation Worries Ease   By By Christopher Georges, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1995  Personal income fell 0.2% in May, the first decline in more than a year, while spending rose 0.7%, the Commerce Department reported.  While Monday's numbers all pointed in the same downward direction, economists cautioned that the details suggested slow growth rather than a recession, and shed no light on what the Federal Reserve might do about interest rates when it meets today and tomorrow. "The subcomponents are weak, but not severe," said Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. economist Marilyn Schaja, referring to the purchasing managers' survey.  The Commerce Department report on personal income also had some bright spots. While personal income fell in May after adjustments for inflation, disposable personal income -- which is income after taxes -- actually rose 0.6%. The rebound from a 1.3% decline in April largely resulted from higher tax payments in April required by a 1993 law. Without adjusting for inflation, disposable income was up 0.7% during May. Also in May, consumers spent more on big-ticket items, such as cars and appliances, as durable-goods spending rose 2.5%.
