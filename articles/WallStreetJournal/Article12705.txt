 Danaher Counsels No Vote on Plan For Cooper Move   By By Robin Sidel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2001  "By voting `against' the reorganization proposal, Cooper shareholders can demonstrate their support for the proposed combination of Danaher and [Cooper] and send a strong message to the Cooper board that they want to preserve the opportunity to consider the Danaher merger proposal," [Danaher] said in the proxy materials.  Cooper's board is scheduled to meet this week to consider the Danaher offer. Danaher executives outlined the offer in a meeting with Cooper executives at the end of last month. Although it hasn't acted on the offer yet, Cooper has expressed disappointment that Danaher made the bid public and reiterated its belief that the Bermuda move will benefit the company.
