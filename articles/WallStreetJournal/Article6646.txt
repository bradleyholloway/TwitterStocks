 Hedge-Fund Crowd Sees More Green As Fortress Hits Jackpot With IPO   By Gregory Zuckerman, Henny Sender and Scott Patterson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2007  Fortress estimates its private-equity funds have averaged 39.7% annual returns since 1999 and its hedge funds have averaged 14% annual returns since 2002. Fortress has been among the fastest growers in the business. In 2001, it managed $1.2 billion, and that rose to roughly $30 billion last year -- a 97% compound annual growth rate.  The firm's five principal partners -- Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Robert Kauffman, Randal Nardone and Michael Novogratz -- retain 77.7% of the combined voting power of Fortress. Their stake was worth $9.7 billion after Friday's close.  At Fortress's heart are Mr. Edens and Mr. Briger, who built it with a unique template, combining the long investment horizon of private- equity firms with the quick trading structure of hedge funds. Mr. Edens, in particular, developed an investment style marked by contrarian bets, creative financing and a knack for building business from investments.
