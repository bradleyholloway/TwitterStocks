 GM Splits Its Basic Stock 2 for 1 and Sharply Boosts Dividends on All Three Classes of Common Shares --- Payout Rise Was Expected But Split, First Since '55, Comes as a Total Surprise   By By Paul Ingrassia and Jacob M. Schlesinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1989  The moves are major planks in GM's campaign to convince investors that its turnaround effort is taking hold. GM had been widely expected to boost the dividend on its basic common shares some time this year, particularly after Chairman Roger B. Smith hinted last November that he favored an increase. But some analysts were surprised that the increase came so soon, and the 2-for-1 stock split was "a complete surprise," said Wendy Beale of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "No one was even talking about that."  "This sends a message to our stockholders that we've got a fundamental improvement in our earnings power," GM's Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview yesterday. By splitting its stock, he added, GM "is hoping to get a broader base of stockholders" by reducing the price of its shares.  -- Raising the quarterly dividend on Class H shares 64% to 18 cents a share from 11 cents. Class H shares represent an interest in earnings attributed to GM Hughes Electronics Corp., a subsidiary that includes Hughes Aircraft Co.
