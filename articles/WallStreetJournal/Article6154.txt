 Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2003  "He always says `I just want to make a dent,'" his ex-wife caustically observes. "But what he really wants to do is make a splash." A childhood friend notes that [RAY MITCHELL] needs "too much to be liked" -- a "bad weakness to have." Ray's weakness nearly gets him killed in a brutal beating, a crime investigated by that same childhood friend, now a police detective driven by her own need to make things right. But Ray refuses to name his assailant.  In "The Pepperdogs," he applies those skills to a thriller set in the present, in Kosovo, where peacekeeping duty has been relegated to Marine reservists. During a routine patrol, a Marine captain gets kidnapped by Serbian thugs, and a small group of his buddies set out to rescue him. "The Pepperdogs" is the nickname of an elite Marine reconnaissance team made up of New York-area reservists.  In "Sphinx: History of a Monument," [Christiane Zivie-Coche] takes us through the life and times of this landmark -- nearly 65 feet tall, from ground to top of headdress, and 238 feet long, from forepaws to lion's tail. Contrary to rumor, the Sphinx did not lose its nose to Napoleon's army or to Mameluke, the ruthless 14th-century Egyptian ruler. Ms. Zivie-Coche puts the theft, if that's what it was, sometime between the third and 10th centuries.
