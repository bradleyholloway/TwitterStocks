 Canada Expected To Approve Easing Sale of Some Arms   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1991  The Canadian Parliament is expected to approve today a weapons-sales law that will allow General Motors Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary to become a major supplier of light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia.  General Motors of Canada Ltd., the only military armored vehicle manufacturer within the GM group, has a Saudi contract for 393 light armored vehicles and is "close" to a new Saudi contract for a further 1,117 vehicles. The two orders are valued at about 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.31 billion), a GM Canada spokesman said.  The Saudi sales have been jeopardized by a provision of the Canadian criminal code restricting the production and sale of automatic small arms weapons. The light armored vehicles are equipped with such a weapon, a 25-mm cannon.
