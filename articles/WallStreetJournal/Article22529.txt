 Compaq's Rose Steps Down as Head Of Firm's Computer-Server Business   By By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1999  Compaq also said it named Michael D. Capellas, 44 years old, as acting chief operating officer in what analysts called a sign that the search for a new chief executive could stretch over several quarters. "It's not raining high-tech CEOs right now," said Louis J. Mazzucchelli Jr., analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. "It is going to take a long time to fill it."  Since April, when the board sacked Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer, the company has been run by three directors. Mr. Capellas, a former Oracle Corp. executive who joined Compaq less than a year ago as senior vice president of information management, will oversee Compaq's sales, service and product groups until a new chief executive is named.  Mr. (John T.) Rose, a key player in the acquisition a year ago of minicomputer maker Digital Equipment Corp. and the one who took charge of folding Digital products into Compaq, is leaving effective today. A Compaq spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the departure, and Mr. Rose didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
