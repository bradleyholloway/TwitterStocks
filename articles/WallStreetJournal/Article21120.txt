 Film: Borsch Belt Princess Hot to Cha Cha Cha   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1987  "Dirty Dancing" opens with smudged, gray images -- they could be protozoa seen under a microscope -- moving hypnotically to the wheedling love song, "Be My Baby." Occasionally the outline of two people hugging, thigh wrapped around thigh, comes into focus. The credits, scripted in hot pink, splash boldly against this smouldering stew.  Well, there is a lot of bumping and grinding in "Dirty Dancing," but the movie's temperature isn't at all that feverish. It's what you would call a warmhearted picture with some hot dancing, some B-movie class consciousness, lots of nostalgia and lots of cliches. Yet dopey as it is, it's hard not to feel affection for "Dirty Dancing," and not just because it has a '60s sound track to rival the "Greatest Hits" records that are occasionally hawked on late-night TV.  "That was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me Baby and it didn't occur to me to mind," says the narrator. "Baby" is the star of the movie, a soon-to-be Mount Holyoke coed who wears her hair naturally frizzy and dreams about joining the Peace Corps. She's played by the earnestly charming Jennifer Grey, best known, until now, as the bratty little sister in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." She's come a long way in a year.
