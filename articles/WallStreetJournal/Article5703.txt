 Fluor Plans New Round of Cutbacks, Says 1999 Profit to Be Below Estimates   By By John R. Emshwiller, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1999  Fluor said the cutbacks, which will also involve moving out of some business lines and closing some offices, will produce a one-time charge of $130 million to be taken in the current quarter. The Irvine, Calif., company said the after-tax effect of this charge is expected to reduce earnings for 1999, ending Oct. 31, to about $107 million, or $1.42 a diluted share. In fiscal 1998, Fluor earned $235.3 million, or $2.97 a share, on revenue of $13.5 billion.  The consensus estimate by analysts for Fluor's fiscal 1999 earnings has been about $2.99 a share, according to First Call. Even after eliminating the effect of yesterday's announced charge, Fluor is projecting fiscal 1999 earnings of only about $2.65 a share.  At a news conference after the annual shareholders meeting, Fluor Chairman and Chief Executive Philip J. Carroll Jr. said analyst estimates hadn't yet fully factored in worsening business conditions, particularly at the company's big A.T. Massey coal unit. The coal business is "about as tough as we have ever seen," said Mr. Carroll.
