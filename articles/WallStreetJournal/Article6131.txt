 Philips Electronics Cuts Parts Unit --- Dutch Firm Says Action On Division Will Lead To Charge of $173 Million   By By Dan Bilefsky, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2002  "Components was a key division, but this closure is part of Philips's attempt to make its operations leaner and more effective," said Jeremy Cohen, a Philips spokesman. He added that the mobile-displays division will be moved into the semiconductor unit, which produces components for mobile phones.  Philips also has been hit by the worst slump in the chip sector in decades -- a downturn that shows little signs of improving. In September Philips, the No. 3 chip maker in Europe, said it expected its core semiconductor division to suffer a 13%-to-15% drop in sales in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. Two months earlier it had said it expected a sales decline of as much as 5%.
