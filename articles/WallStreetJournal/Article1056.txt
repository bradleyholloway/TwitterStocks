 Weighted Index Funds Vulnerable to Bubbles   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  John C. Bogle and Burton G. Malkiel ("Turn on a Paradigm?" editorial page, June 27) accept that market-weighted indexes over-weight stocks that are overvalued and under-weight stocks that are undervalued, but dismiss the point altogether by referring to the weakness as temporary.  Institutions have, not unreasonably, come to rely on market-weighted index funds as a high capacity investment strategy for their core assets. This reliance renders them defenseless in extended periods of capital misallocation, which repeatedly afflict free markets. This reality is ignored by Messrs. Bogle and Malkiel.
