 Love & Money: Our Family Drama: The Readers' Weigh In   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2005  "No manager," this reader says, "gets to have the balance between work and home [Amy] wants, and she should have known that when she accepted a managerial position." She says that even though working moms and their families learn to adjust to the upheaval, "there's never enough time to give the children all the quality time they want and should have. But that's part of the package that comes with a working mom. It's a trade-off, and both of you should have realized the life-altering changes that would occur when Amy took on a full- time job."  In making the switch to full-time mom, she says, she "didn't anticipate the 'emotional trauma of the life change,'" as I described it in my column. "We're muddling through and figuring out our roles," she says. "Your series validated that it's all right and even normal not to have it all figured out. You confirmed that as we recalibrate our lives, we must reinvent ourselves [though] it's not always easy to leave the 'old selves' behind."  "We were astounded when my son told us of his pain," she says. "I behaved as I always had, defending his dad and us for the move. Thankfully, I realized finally what I was doing. I said, 'I'm sorry. I'm not listening to you.' "
