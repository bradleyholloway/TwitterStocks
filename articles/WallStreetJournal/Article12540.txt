 In a Merger, Insiders Include the Fellow Doing the Xeroxing --- So, a Graphic Design Team Can Be as Conspiratorial As an Oliver Stone Movie   By By Erin White, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2000  Mr. Corn is a graphic designer, and the New York consulting and production company he owns, Admaster Communications, is one of a handful of businesses that spend part of their time putting together the corporate-logo backdrops and other materials that companies use at news conferences when they announce mergers, acquisitions and partnerships.  "We can't afford to trust anyone," says Mr. Corn, 41 years old, who summons his staff to action with the murky sentence: "We're going in the fall in the South." The line is paraphrased from Oliver Stone's movie "JFK," one of Mr. Corn's favorite conspiracy thrillers and the inspiration for many of his office directives. He recently packed off four of his people on a clandestine mission, conducted mostly on the outskirts of Dallas. All they knew at first was the code name: "Northstar."  Mr. [Michael] Magnani checks credit reports of potential hires, looking for signs of "duress." People with financial problems, he explains, are more easily preyed upon. And you don't know what someone in tax trouble, for instance, might do. Once hired, nVision staffers don't send project e-mail outside the office unless it is encrypted. They don't mention companies by name, even in the office, and they keep clients away from the locked part of the building where the most-sensitive work gets done. Code names are substituted for company names in documents until the last minute, when a switch is made.
