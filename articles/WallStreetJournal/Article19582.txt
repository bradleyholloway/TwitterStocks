 NBC Is Close to a Deal to Buy Bravo   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2002  NBC, owned by General Electric Co., instead is planning to swap most or all of its stake in Rainbow Media Holdings, a Cablevision programming subsidiary that owns Bravo, for full ownership of the Bravo channel.  Buying Bravo, which runs movies and such series as "Inside the Actors Studio," would give NBC an additional venue to show its programs and draw viewers as well as a way to defray programming costs.  NBC already employs this strategy for news with its cable channels MSNBC and CNBC. Despite those channels' recent ratings struggles, other networks envy that strategy because of the financial advantage it gives NBC.
