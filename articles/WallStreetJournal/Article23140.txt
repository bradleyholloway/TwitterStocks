 The Kitchen Sink Might Fit, Too, In Latest Tote Bags; Busy Women Take Their Lives With Them to Work; Keys, Shoes, Shinguards   By Beatty, Sally, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 2004  To lighten her load, Ms. [Jill Wehrli]'s husband, Jim Johnson, occasionally attempts to clean out his wife's bag. But inevitably, books, papers and glasses creep back in. Sometimes, when he and his wife are traveling together, Mr. Johnson carries her tote bag himself. "He'll say, I can't watch you carry this any more," says Ms. Wehrli. "And every time he picks it up, he says, 'You have got to be kidding.' "  For some women, a bulging tote bag can be a reassuring presence. "It's a feeling of security to have every file you need, or every file you may need," says Susan Newman, an author who lives in New Jersey. Her Tumi tote bag measures a whopping 20 by 16 by 4. In it Dr. Newman lugs a book, files, tape recorder, calendar, scarf, sweater, shoes, a banana and yellow highlighter pen. "It's a traveling office, is what it is," she says.  Sometimes her husband will offer to carry her tote, but Dr. Newman says she prefers to shoulder her bag herself. "I'm very possessive of my tote," she explains, "I don't like it out of my sight for even a second. My tote is my life."
