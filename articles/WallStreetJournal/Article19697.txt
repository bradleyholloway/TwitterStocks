 In Russia, the Score Is Siloviki 6, Oligarchs 0   By Melloan, George, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2003  Mr. K. also used some of his $8 billion wealth to back parties and politicians opposing Vladimir Putin. He disregarded a warning the president had given the oligarchs shortly after he was elected: Stay out of politics. He is the sixth important oligarch to have made that mistake. Of the five others, three have repented and two, Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, are abroad, having been forced to flee Russia. With his treatment of Mr. [Mikhail Khodorkovsky], Mr. Putin again warned the oligarchs: I don't care how advanced and modern you are -- don't disobey my order.  This, of course, sounds a lot like the old days, when property rights didn't exist and the law was whatever the Communist Party chieftains decreed. Russia acquired capitalism but did so in a very messy way, and its version of capitalism remains very messy today. Departing from the free and easy ways of the [Boris Yeltsin] administration, Mr. Putin has packed his government with his former colleagues in the KGB, now the FSB. Known as the siloviki (meaning "strong ones") they are reasserting the power of the state.  Judging from the opinion polls, Mr. Putin's high standing with the Russian public hasn't suffered much from his high-handed behavior. Billionaires don't get much sympathy from the broad public even in the U.S. But a closer look suggests some considerable disquiet over the danger that Russia might be reverting back to the old police state patterns. The capital that fled before and during the ruble crisis isn't in any hurry to return. A good many foreign investors who had thought of cashing in on Russia's recent flurry of growth are now having second thoughts.
