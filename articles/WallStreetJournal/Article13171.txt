 Local-Telephone Luster Fades; Concerns Over Video Foray, Competition From Cable Hurt Shares   By Searcey, Dionne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2005  Moody's Investors Service downgraded some of Verizon's debt in certain of its local-phone operating companies, citing fears that "competitor's inroads" will cause the units' performance to decline faster than expected.  The Bells "continue to generate solid free cash flow despite the pressures they're facing," said William Power, equity analyst at asset-management firm Robert W. Baird & Co., who lists his target share price for the end of the year for Verizon at $40. As of 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Verizon shares were at $35.17. Mr. Power, who doesn't hold any Bell shares, has "neutral" ratings on Verizon, SBC and Bellsouth.  "The competition, it's somewhat uncertain going forward," said John Krause, an equity research analyst at Thrivent Investment Management Inc., who doesn't rate the shares. Mr. Krause's Wisconsin-based firm would typically be investing more in the Bells, he said. But currently it holds about 1.6 million shares of Verizon, approximately 300,000 fewer than it held last summer.
