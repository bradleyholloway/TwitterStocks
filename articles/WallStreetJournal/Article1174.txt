 Patent Nonsense   By Sewell, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2007  The Patent Reform Act would allow patents already issued to be reviewed, either immediately after the patent is granted or later, if a party can establish that significant economic harm may arise from the assertion of the patent. This new procedure would help weed out bad patents and cut down on litigation as a first resort, as it would allow for meaningful challenges to bad patents in the patent office, which is best situated to evaluate the claims. While some fear this will give patent infringers a tool to challenge patents they are infringing, the Patent Reform Act authorizes the director of the patent office to develop and enforce rules to prevent such abuse.  Another area for reform is the standard for calculating damages. Many products are comprised of thousands of patented components, but if one infringes just one patent on, say, a windshield wiper, the patent holder can seek damages based on the value of the entire car to which that wiper is attached. This threat of artificially high damages encourages litigation, premature settlements and distorts the value of patents. In addition, a finding of "willfulness" -- which may trigger treble damages -- can result from a defendant merely being aware of a patent which the defendant in good faith believed was invalid.  The U.S. Supreme Court has taken four patent cases over the past year, an astonishingly high number, and in all four of those cases it decisively ruled in favor of those advocating reform. "Gobbledygook," "worse than meaningless" and "retards progress" are just a few phrases used by justices recently to describe some key patent standards.
