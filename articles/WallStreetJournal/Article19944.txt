 Awash in Cash: Cheap Money, Growing Risks; Woodland Haven: U.S. Timberland Gets Pricey As Big Money Seeks Shelter; Rush Reflects Glut of Capital, Low Payoff on Other Assets; Sold: 5% of State of Maine; But Do Trees Grow to the Sky?   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2005  Already, "what we are seeing here in Maine is that there definitely is a spike in development," says Cathy Johnson of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, a group affiliated with the National Wildlife Federation. She and other conservationists are fighting a plan by Plum Creek Timber Co., a real-estate investment trust, for housing, resorts and stores on 9,000 acres near Moosehead Lake in central Maine. "Maine's North Woods is the largest undeveloped block of land east of the Mississippi," Ms. Johnson says. "The future of this area is being determined."  Still, the sale was disclosed at almost the same time that International Paper announced plans to sell more of its U.S. forest holdings, and potentially its entire remaining 6.8 million acres. Meanwhile, another longtime timber investor, California Public Employees' Retirement System, has sold its U.S. holdings, notes Mark Wilde, a Deutsche Bank Securities analyst. He wrote a report called "What Does Harvard Know?" in which he posed the question: "Does this mark the top?"  Most timber investors say no, although few deny that paying today's elevated prices will limit investment returns somewhat. The rising U.S. timberland prices are pushing some buyers abroad. Says Grantham Mayo's Mr. [Bob Saul]: "There aren't many wild frontiers. Eastern Europe is one. Russia is another. It is hard to find the undiscovered spot."
