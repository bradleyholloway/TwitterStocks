 New Rule May Lead More Arbitrations Into the Courtroom   By Craig, Susanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2005  The New Hampshire court's decision to overturn an arbitration panel's decision is rare. The NASD doesn't keep track of how many of its awards are vacated but said that anecdotally it is aware of very few. In one incident, in 2003, a New York state court overturned the largest punitive-damage award ever levied against a Wall Street firm, saying the $25 million that mutual-fund company Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. was ordered to pay former broker Stephen Sawtelle bore no relationship to the harm he suffered. That case is still on appeal.  Courts can vacate an award for bias or fraud, and they also can overturn a panel's ruling if they find there has been "manifest disregard" of the law. In general, arbitration panels aren't required to follow the law, but they can't stray too far from it. "This is one of those exceedingly rare cases where an arbitration decision was based on manifest disregard of the governing law," Judge Joseph DiClerico wrote in his decision last week overturning an award against Citigroup broker James McCarthy.  Judge DiClerico said it doesn't matter whether Wall Street firms have similar compensation plans. "The panel also decided not to consider the wage laws because plans like the CAP are commonly used in the securities industry. In doing so, the panel set aside the governing law in favor of its perception of an equitable result and industry practices," he wrote. "The panel's decision not to consider the New Hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for the governing law."
