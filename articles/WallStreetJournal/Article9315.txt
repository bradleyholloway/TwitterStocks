 Word of Slow Economy May Stem Illegal Labor   By By Joel Millman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2001  Federal officials aren't entirely sure why there has been a sudden slowdown, though some suggest it could be related to cold weather or to a greater fear of getting caught. But some labor economists are considering a more provocative theory: They say the relationship between a burgeoning pool of Mexican workers and their U.S. employers has become so refined that the flow of information to "sender" villages now acts as a control valve on the flow of migrants. Mexico's workers, aware of rising layoffs and slowing economic growth in the U.S., are simply waiting to be "called" back rather than risk a fruitless crossing.  The latest U.S. Census shows between three million and six million undocumented Mexican workers entered the U.S. during the 1990s, many more than demographers thought. They settled in low-end industries, profoundly affecting U.S. labor markets in what some economists call a virtual "Mexicanization" of the many U.S. industries that drew cheap imported labor during the long expansion.  Data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics this spring support that view. The BLS defines job categories by race, with "Hispanic" serving as a close proxy for Mexican migrants. The 1990s ramp-up of Hispanic-Mexican participation in dozens of categories -- from meat cutter to carpet layer to landscaper -- has transformed whole sectors of the U.S. economy that now are staffed by younger, more mobile work forces than the ones they replaced.
