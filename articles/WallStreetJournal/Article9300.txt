 Cocoa Tumbles, as May Contract Falls Nearly 8%   By By Enza Tedesco, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2001  COFFEE: In a surprising display of strength, arabica coffee futures at CSCE moved higher on the back of intense speculative buying. The most-active May contract ended 1.35 cents up at 67.25 cents a pound, after touching a high of 68.50 cents, the market's highest level since Feb. 1. Large commodity funds were buyers from the opening bell, which enticed smaller speculators and locals into the rally. Lack of aggressive selling prevented the market from relinquishing all of its gains, but a sustained upward move is seen as a "struggle," given the coffee market's fundamental oversupply situation, observers said.  SOYBEANS: A late surge of speculative buying sent benchmark May futures to a much stronger close above last week's highs. May futures rose seven cents to $4.67 a bushel, taking out last week's high of $4.65 toward the end of the session. The rally came as traders prepared for tomorrow's U.S. Department of Agriculture monthly World Agricultural Supply & Demand Estimates report, which analysts expect will predict record U.S. soybean exports for the current marketing year.
