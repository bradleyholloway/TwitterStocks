 Broken Homes: Vacation-House Sales Slow to a Standstill In Some Parts of U.S. --- Would-Be Sellers Place Hopes In Aging Baby Boomers, But Will They Be Buyers? --- Some Foresee a New Surge   By By Cynthia Crossen and Mitchell Pacelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1991  Fortunately, help is on the way, or so contend many in the real-estate industry. The baby-boom generation -- 82 million strong -- is just hitting the prime age for buying second homes, 45 to 54 years old. Although recovery of the second-home market typically lags behind the primary market, real-estate brokers say demand will jump in the next few years.  "The share of baby boomers who will end up buying second homes in the next decade will be tiny because even those who are affluent on paper will feel strapped," says Cheryl Russell, a demographer and author of a book called "100 Predictions About the Baby Boom." She adds that "mortgage payments, tuition costs from day care to college and saving for retirement will prevent most baby boomers from feeling well-off."  "Back in 1986, you'd show a house, and there would be another broker right behind you showing it. So your guy would say, `What's he doing?' and you'd say, `He'll probably buy it,' so your guy would just buy it," says H. Flint Ranney, owner of Denby Real Estate in Nantucket. "You don't see that anymore." Mr. Ranney says that, with baby boomers now having babies, it will be 10 to 15 years before they can afford second houses.
