 Building Outlays Rise Slight 0.1% After 3-Month Drop   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 2, 1989  Construction spending barely increased in April after falling three consecutive months, the Commerce Department reported, another sign of an industry weakened by high interest rates.  A solid rise in spending on public building projects, such as schools and sewer systems, nudged overall construction outlays 0.1% above March's level, to an annual rate of $414.9 billion.  Although figures are adjusted for seasonal changes, they don't take inflation into account. After adjusting for the effects of inflation, construction spending was virtually unchanged in April at a $355.3 billion annual rate, compared with a $355.2 billion rate in March.
