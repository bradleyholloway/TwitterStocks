 Corporate Governance (A Special Report); Blowing the Whistle: Sarbanes-Oxley requires that companies treat internal complaints -- and complainers -- seriously   By Plitch, Phyllis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2004  In pursuing Mr. [Daniel Thobe]'s complaints, DPL wasn't operating under all of the strictures of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, since the company hasn't held this year's annual meeting yet. (The provisions against retaliation, however, did take immediate effect in 2002.) DPL legal and public-relations advisers say the audit committee wasn't directly motivated by Sarbanes-Oxley -- it was simply doing what it considered to be best for the company and its shareholders.  The three executives all deny any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, they didn't make it past a May 16 board meeting, where the directors unanimously accepted the law firm's findings. Mr. [Stephen Koziar Jr.] announced his decision to retire before the meeting, and Mr. [Peter H. Forster] and Ms. [Caroline Muhlenkamp] resigned before the day was out. Stanley Arkin, an attorney who represents Mr. Forster and Ms. Muhlenkamp, says they resigned because, given the publicity surrounding Mr. Thobe's complaints, the board "was really concerned about the ability [of the two executives] to govern and we were concerned about not having paralysis or a stalemate." Mr. Koziar didn't return phone calls seeking comment for this story.  "It's ratting on a boss," says Deborah J. Cornwall, managing director of Corlund Group LLC, a Boston consulting firm that advises companies on leadership and corporate governance. "The fundamental problem that is built into that is the psychological isolation coming from people accused of the wrongful act," Ms. Cornwall says. "It's a very subtle isolation. It's not that anyone nails the door shut in the office."
