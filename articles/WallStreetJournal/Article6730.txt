 Constitution Wasn't Carved on Stone Tablet   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2007  A non-lawyer's view of "originalism" in deciding constitutional issues might be an interesting counterpoint to Mr. [Steven Calabresi]'s essay extolling its virtues. Originalists feel that the original intent of the Framers is the only criterion that should be used in deciding constitutional issues. The philosophy of a "living" Constitution is the alternative that gives originalists such heartburn. In that case, a more expansive but still precedent-oriented interpretation of the Constitution is embraced, one that recognizes that over the past 200 years our country has become technologically advanced, more diverse and better educated. The Constitution is remarkably unclear in many places and for someone to claim that only they have the key is absurd. Let's look at three examples.  In this, he is in the excellent company of Ronald Reagan. In his 1983 essay "Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation," President Reagan wrote: "Make no mistake, abortion-on-demand is not a right granted by the Constitution. No serious scholar, including one disposed to agree with the Court's result, has argued that the framers of the Constitution intended to create such a right."
