 Nursing Homes In Georgia Cut Medicaid Beds   By By Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1996  The nursing-home problem is the result of a move to slash Georgia's budget. Last summer, Gov. Zell Miller ordered the state Department of Medical Assistance to reduce spending by 5%; as a result, the agency's outlay (coupled with the federal government's matching funds) for Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes was reduced by $38 million.  The nursing-home industry, fearful of across-the-board cuts that would have forced hefty payroll reductions, hammered out an agreement with Georgia officials for a 3% reduction in state payments to nursing homes for Medicaid bills. About 85% of all nursing-home patients in Georgia are Medicaid recipients.  But now, Georgia advocates for the elderly say the changes are making it harder for the state's 364 nursing homes to cover their costs, in turn prompting many to shun Medicaid patients in favor of those paying with Medicare or private insurance. "Basically, the fewer Medicaid residents you have, the more likely it is that you still get 100% of your costs back," says Becky A. Kurtz, the state's ombudsman for long-term care.
