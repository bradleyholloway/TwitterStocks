 Japan Reports Surge Of 53% in July Sales of Imported Vehicles ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses surged 53% in July from a year earlier to 17,339 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association announced.  The rise in July means that imported auto sales have risen from the year-earlier levels for 67 months in a row.  Also, the replacement of the heavy commodity tax on imports with a lower consumption tax last April resulted in price reductions and made it easier to buy foreign-made cars, they said.
