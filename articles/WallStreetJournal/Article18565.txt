 Live From Vegas... It's Talk Radio, TV, Rock on the Internet --- Computer Architect Malamud Embarks on First Full Day Of Multimedia Broadcast   By By Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1994  Carl Malamud, computer-network architect and self-styled pioneer on the Internet, expects today to broadcast his first full day of radio-television programming over the global web of computers. Part public radio, part C-SPAN, the broadcast -- "Radio Technology for Manana" -- will include news, live interviews and rock music.  The Internet, which has 20 million users and counting as it transforms from geeky enclave into hip phenomenon, usually carries all manner of computer data and programs rather than over-the-air fare. But powerful workstations with high-speed hookups can receive information at eight times the speed of typical Internet links, letting them get audio and video broadcasts.
