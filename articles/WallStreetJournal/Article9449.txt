 Amtrak to Borrow $200 Million, Restructure Its Management   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2002  Under the restructuring plan, Amtrak will centralize its operations in Washington, D.C., and dismantle its three-unit management structure. That structure put control of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor unit in Philadelphia, its intercity train unit in Chicago and its Western trains in Oakland, Calif. The three-unit organization, which was put in place in the mid-1990s to foster innovation, instead drove up Amtrak's costs and slowed its decision making.  Mr. [David Gunn]'s critical assessment of Amtrak's condition and the remedies represent a stark contrast to the more hopeful picture presented by Mr. [George Warrington]. Under Mr. Warrington, Amtrak said repeatedly that it was on track to meet the congressional deadline that Amtrak operate without federal subsidies by the end of this year.
