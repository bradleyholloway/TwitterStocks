 Christie's New Bid: Online Auctions   By Crow, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  [CHRISTIE]'s says it's adding online sales now because it believes new remote-bidding technology will broaden its audience, especially overseas. "We've got to open the door wider," says Andrew Foster, Christie's chief operating officer and international director of operations. "But are we being careful? Yes."  Despite a few noteworthy sales -- including $8.1 million for a first printing of the Declaration of Independence -- Sothebys.com's auctions didn't lure enough online sales, even after the house joined forces with Amazon.com Inc. and, later, eBay. Consignors were hesitant to offer prized Picassos to virtual sales that lacked the glamour of traditional auctions. After losing $100 million, Sotheby's discontinued its online sales in 2003 although it continues to field real-time bids from eBay bidders at about four collectibles auctions a year. A Sotheby's spokeswoman declined to comment on Christie's venture.  Both houses put their catalogs online, but Sotheby's has generally sworn off selling items under $1,000. Christie's says it plans to use the Internet to drive up sales in that category -- even though they don't generate huge profits. Christie's estate sale in July 2005 brought in $3.6 million, compared with $143 million spent on contemporary art at its May 9 evening sale.
