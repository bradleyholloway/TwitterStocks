 What's Your Pay? SEC May Require More Disclosures   By Plitch, Phyllis, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2004  Citing last month's settlement with General Electric Co. in connection with its disclosures of benefits provided to former Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch, Mr. Beller warned that "material deficiencies" could expose companies to potential enforcement action. GE didn't admit or deny the SEC's findings.  Under the rules, "clear, concise and understandable disclosure" of essentially all compensation paid to officers and directors, is required, he said. Unless that is done, the disclosures are "not in compliance, literal or otherwise, with our rules." Furthermore, he said, there can't be material omissions that can make disclosures misleading.
