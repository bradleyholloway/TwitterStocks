 Easy Money: Leniency for Con Man Allowed Him to Get More Millions at Bank --- First Fidelity Bancorp. Unit Put Mamarella on Payroll After His Fraud Surfaced --- His Links to a Mafia Captain   By By Jonathan Kwitny, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1986  His lawyer, William Martini, argued before Judge Whitman Knapp that this was Mr. Mamarella's first brush with crime and that he had made no money from the frauds. Both statements, Mr. Martini says, were based on what he believed at the time. But Mr. Mamarella admitted later that they were untrue. Mr. Martini also argued that Mr. Mamarella and some friends had recently started "a business which they have worked hard at and which is becoming successful. . . . And he has good relations with the bank."  Mr. Mamarella later admitted forging other testimonial letters on his own behalf. But Judge Knapp didn't know that. He let Mr. Mamarella walk out of court on probation. And for the next 10 months, through IFA, his insurance-premium financing company, Mr. Mamarella continued to milk First Fidelity of millions of dollars.  Neither officer testified at the trial. But Mr. Dickerson, in a letter to the bank's holding company introduced as evidence at the trial, asserted that the Mamarella loans were the doing of Mr. Petrycki, the bank's president, and others. "I have had nothing to do with this series of events," his letter said. "Mr. Petrycki took direct control of credit and transactional approval for the entire series of loans. Mr. Apple dealt directly with Mr. Petrycki. . . . Surely you cannot allow me to be a scapegoat and my career ruined." Mr. Dickerson was fired anyway.
