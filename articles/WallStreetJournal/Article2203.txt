 Thanks, But We'll Be Watching Reruns of 'My Favorite Martian'   By Goldman, Kevin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1991  Some of the exhibitions and gimmicks at the 1991 trade show of the National Association of Television Program Executives are described. Perhaps the most off-the-wall new show was "Grudge Match," which is described as "People's Court" meets "American Gladiators."
