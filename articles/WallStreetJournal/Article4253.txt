 Anheuser-Busch Profit Rose 18% In 4th Quarter   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1987  Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported an 18% increase in fourth-quarter net income as its beer gained market share at the expense of weaker competitors.  The St. Louis-based brewing and food concern's share of the beer market grew to 38% from 36.6% a year earlier, mostly at the expense of the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 brewers -- Stroh Cos., G. Heileman Brewing Co. and Pabst Brewing Co. The market share of the No. 2 brewer, Miller Brewing Co., a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos., grew last year to 21% from 20% in 1985, according to industry estimates.  Anheuser-Busch's gains came despite problems with some of the company's brands: the continuing decline of Michelob, the brewer's brand in the so-called super-premium segment; lackluster sales of LA, a low-alcohol beer; and the demise of Baybry's, a champagne-based wine cooler.
