 Muslim Activist Wages 'Gender Jihad'   By Al-Saqaf, Walid, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2005  Despite the criticism, Dr. Wadud is continuing her campaign. She was one of the featured speakers last month at an academic conference in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on "The Changeable and Unchangeable in Islamic Thought," where she delivered a lecture on reading the Quran through a "gender perspective." And she is finishing a book, to be released next year by a British publisher, titled "Inside the Gender Jihad: Reform in Islam." She describes it as an academic tract for "contesting the unequal treatment that women have experienced . . . in the context of Muslim communities."  Dr. [Amina Wadud] is one of a growing number of Western Muslim women publicly doing so. Asra Nomani, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, is leading what she calls the "Muslim Women's Freedom Tour" to mosques around the U.S. And Irshad Manji, a lesbian activist living in Toronto, has created a stir with her book, "The Trouble With Islam," an "open letter" to Muslim world about, among other things, its treatment of women.  The event didn't get much attention in the U.S, but triggered a wave of criticism across the Middle East. Al-Jazeera, the television network, headlined a report on its Web site: "Cleric: Women may not lead prayer." It quoted the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Ali Gumma, as saying that "the vast majority of scholars say it is forbidden." A Saudi newspaper charged: "Feminist Agenda May Harm Muslim Women's Interest" and quoted the Saudi Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence) Academy as condemning the action as "misleading heresy and sedition."
