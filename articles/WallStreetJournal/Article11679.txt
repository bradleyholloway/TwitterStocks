 Entertainment: Video Games Get Racier as Technology Enables Makers to Target Older Players   By By Patrick M. Reilly, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1993  One of the fastest selling electronic games of the Christmas season provides a glimpse of where video games may be headed. "Night Trap" is a cinematic, CD-based adventure in which the player must protect a houseful of scantily clad young women from a gang of zombies armed with big hooks.  Developed for the new, hot-selling Sega CD player by Digital Pictures Inc., "Night Trap" has the sound and feel of a B-grade slasher flick. Step aside, Super Mario Brothers: The next generation of games will be racier and more daring and often will be aimed at adult sensibilities.  As industry executives converge on Las Vegas tomorrow for the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, the $5.5 billion U.S. video-game industry is going digital. Sega Enterprises Ltd.'s Sega CD player has flown off store shelves at $300 apiece, hooking up to Sega video-game systems to play what are essentially small, interactive movies using real actors on digitized film.
