 A Cheap Dollar Will Be Costly   By Makin, John H, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1992  John H. Makin discusses why it is better policy for the US and Japan to let the dollar rise against the yen. Makin says that if the dollar falls like Treasury officials, the New York Federal Reserve and Japanese officials want, US interest rates would be higher and there would be an increased risk that the 1992 version of the US economic recovery will fall as flat as the 1991 recovery did.
