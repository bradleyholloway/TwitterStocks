 SunTrust Accuses Rival First Union Of Using a Questionable Tax Shelter   By By Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2001  SunTrust, Atlanta, and First Union, Charlotte, N.C., have been vying for two months over Wachovia, a Winston-Salem, N.C., bank with operations from Virginia to Florida. SunTrust is making a hostile $14.75 billion bid for Wachovia, while First Union is pursuing a friendly $14.53 billion offer. Wachovia shareholders will vote Aug. 3 on whether to accept First Union's offer.  First Union and SunTrust have spent the past several weeks trading attacks, but yesterday's letter signals a new level of urgency on SunTrust's part. SunTrust's bid is only 1.6% better than First Union's. When SunTrust made its hostile bid in mid-May, its bid was 16.7% higher than First Union's offer.  A SunTrust spokesman said the bank began working a month ago with a person knowledgeable of First Union's use of the lease-in/lease-out vehicle. That spokesman, Gary Peacock, said SunTrust doesn't take correspondence with federal regulators lightly and that SunTrust wouldn't have made the allegation if it didn't believe its source.
