 Management: Time Warner Defines, Defends System of Values   By By Eben Shapiro, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 1999  At the behest of Chairman Gerald Levin, the entertainment giant is putting groups of its most promising executives through an intensive two-day program designed to define and disseminate what the company calls its "core values and guiding principles" -- among them "diversity," "respect" and "integrity." The first of the groups met this week at the Sheraton Hotel here, and about 1,000 executives in all are slated to go through the program.  The notion of a values program seems almost incongruous at Time Warner, a company long known for a bare-knuckled business style and one that just a few years ago was a hotbed of internal strife and turf wars. While the heads of the movie division and the music division slugged it out for control of the recorded-music business, Time Warner was under attack from civic leaders and police groups, who castigated the company's role in distributing violent rap lyrics. And with the company's stock price lagging, Mr. Levin himself seemed perpetually in danger of losing his job.  Company executives who participated in the germination of the program say that in the past two years Mr. Levin has become convinced that only companies with strongly articulated values will prosper and survive in the increasingly hectic, complex digital age. His views on creating an enduring corporation were influenced by "Built to Last," a thoughtful business book written by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras. The men identified "visionary" companies and found common themes, including that most successful companies are guided by "core values and sense of purpose beyond just making money."
