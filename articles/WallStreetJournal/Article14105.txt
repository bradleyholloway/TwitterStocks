 States' Residency Rules for Lawyers Found Unconstitutional by Top Court   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1985  Some 40 states impose some form of residency requirement for lawyers, from living in to having an office in the state. Some states say a person must be a resident to take the bar examination; others, like New Hampshire, say that a person must live in the state when admitted to practice.  Although the justices reviewed only New Hampshire's requirement, the decision, written by Justice Lewis Powell, was broad enough to cast doubt on all existing residency requirements for lawyers. "The nonresident's interest in practicing law is a privilege protected" by the Constitution, the court said.  The immediate impact of the ruling will be to make it easier for big law firms in major cities, and for corporations with large legal departments, to handle lawsuits wherever they are filed. Until now, companies and law firms that regularly have business in states with residency requirements have had to retain a local law firm to act as "local counsel."
