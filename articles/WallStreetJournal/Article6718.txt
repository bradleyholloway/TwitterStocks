 Forex View: Expectations of Rate Cut May Send Dollar Sliding   By Molinski, Dan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  Friday's report showed a drop in U.S. payrolls in August, the first such retreat in four years, and left many investors convinced the Fed will reduce its benchmark federal-funds rate, probably at its Sept. 18 meeting. The weak jobs figure is the first key report to suggest that the difficulties in the U.S. housing sector are affecting the broader economy.  Still, analysts don't forecast a major dollar selloff, and they say the currency might even see some intermittent bounces as markets scramble to re-evaluate the U.S. economic outlook.  An intermeeting rate cut would be "one of the most positive signs one could get from the Fed regarding its commitment to the U.S. economy, and that would be a positive for the U.S. dollar, at least in the short term," he said.
