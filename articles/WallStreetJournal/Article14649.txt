 Scientists Mapping Human Genes Seek New Way to Express Findings   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1989  Human Genome I, which convened in San Diego to ponder the $3 billion, 15-year project, featured a proposal for streamlining the work by adopting a common language in lieu of the prevailing scientific "Tower of Babel." The proposal is that scientists express their findings by giving the precise sequence of a short piece of DNA and its approximate location on a chromosome in a form called "sequence-tagged sites," or STS.  Admittedly imprecise, the STS strategy "is like describing an intersection in New Jersey in perfect detail, and then saying it lies somewhere between Edison and Menlo Park," says proponent Charles Cantor, a Columbia University scientist moving this month to head the Department of Energy's genome work at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California.  But the STS strategy could yield a crude map of the entire human genome, or genetic code, in as little as five years. Reducing all descriptions of key genetic landmarks to such shorthand also would let scientists meld their findings in a common database, and lessen if not eliminate the need to store vast fragile samples of actual DNA, the stuff of which genes are made.
