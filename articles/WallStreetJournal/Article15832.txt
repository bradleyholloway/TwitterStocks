 Uncool Idea: Chilling the Water In Your Pool With Big Ice Blocks   By By Christine B. Whelan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1999  Dedicated pool owners are dropping hundreds of pounds of ice into their 90-degree pools in hopes of some relief. Only one problem: It doesn't really work.  Sno Cap Ice Inc. in St. Louis sells a 270-pound block for $30, but with a warning: "We tell them right up front that it doesn't really work except psychologically. You have nice clear blocks of ice floating in the pool. But it doesn't cool anything off," says manager Bob Cordes Sr.  Tom Niemeier, a St. Louis architect, says he had to try it for himself for an upcoming pool party. He learned that he would have to buy an awful lot of ice for what was at best just a brief chill. For $55, Mr. Niemeier bought 800 pounds of ice in 10-pound blocks from nearby Glacier Ice and dumped it into his 94-degree pool.
