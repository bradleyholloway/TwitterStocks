 Cabbage Patch Creator, Coleco Sign New Accord   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 1985  WEST HARTFORD, Conn. -- Parents who fought to fork out $30 or more for Cabbage Patch Kids will soon be able to do the same for Furskins, a teddy bear just as homely and cuddly as the phenomenally successful dolls.  Coleco Industries Inc., trying to duplicate the success of its Cabbage Patch Kids after its disastrous Adam home computer, said it signed a licensing agreement to make and market Furskins.
