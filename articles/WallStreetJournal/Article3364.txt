 Lockheed President Is Stepping Down After Six Months   By By Jeff Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  While Mr. [Louis R. Hughes], 51 years old, is said to have left to accommodate family concerns, analysts have speculated for months that he could wind up departing, partly because his ultimate role wasn't clearly defined. Mr. Hughes will be paid $8 million in cash and other compensation for his work this year, said people familiar with the arrangements. A Lockheed spokesman said Mr. Hughes wasn't available to comment and said the company declined further comment.
