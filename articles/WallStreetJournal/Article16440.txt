 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2004  Q: My husband knows of one individual who cited "religious reasons" for failing to pay federal income taxes. Also, someone else he once worked with told him they "don't want to support the military, so they don't pay taxes." Is there a way for an individual to do this? Of course, I'm skeptical.  Tax lawyers say they would strongly advise clients not even to think about trying this argument. The IRS goes into more detail on this subject on page 20 of a document on its Web site called "The Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments." It says: "Some argue that taxpayers may refuse to pay federal income taxes based on their religious or moral beliefs, or objection to the use of taxes to fund certain government programs. These persons mistakenly invoke the First Amendment in support of this frivolous position." The First Amendment "does not provide a right to refuse to pay income taxes on religious or moral grounds, or because taxes are used to fund government programs opposed by the taxpayer."
