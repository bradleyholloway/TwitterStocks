 Deals & Deal Makers: Bids & Offers   The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2002  The annual meeting was held earlier this week at the La Quinta Resort and Club, a golf resort in La Quinta, Calif., that is operated by KKR-owned KSL Recreation. There, public and private pension-fund managers were warned by the 12 KKR partners that all the money that has been raised by other private-equity firms is making it tougher for them to uncover deals where they can earn a high return on investment. Until things pick up, it appears both KKR and its investors will be singing the blues.  Rob Tholemeier, a senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the new rules are "a sham." Mr. Tholemeier is annoyed by a measure that would prohibit analysts from buying or selling stocks around the time they are issuing research reports about the companies. "This is a really dumb idea," wrote Mr. Tholemeier who, when contacted, said he was acting in a solo capacity and not on behalf of Wells Fargo & Co.  J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has fired more than 100 investment bankers, or more than 20% of its investment-banking staff, in Asia during recent days as part of a global initiative to trim costs and win more deals. After the cuts, the bank still has more than 350 investment bankers in Asia, making it the biggest investment-banking presence in the region, said Peter McKillop, a company spokesman. He declined to confirm the number of bankers who have lost jobs but said the cuts were part of a global reorganization launched in New York by Geoffrey Boisi, J.P. Morgan's global co-head of investment banking.
