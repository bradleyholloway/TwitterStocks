 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  Austrian oil and gas company OMV AG said it is redoubling its efforts to take over Hungary's MOL Nyrt and has launched legal proceedings to stop the Hungarian government from blocking the acquisition. Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, OMV's chief executive, urged MOL's board to remove all hurdles to the deal and let shareholders decide. Hungarian authorities have resisted the acquisition, calling it an attempted hostile takeover of a strategically important national treasure. MOL said it hadn't been informed of any pending legal action.
