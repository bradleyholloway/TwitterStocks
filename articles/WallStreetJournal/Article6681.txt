 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  Yahoo Inc. will close its online auction service for North America next month, signaling the Internet company's intention to focus on more-profitable endeavors. The Sunnyvale, Calif., company's auctions in the U.S. and Canada will end June 16, although some tools will remain accessible until Oct. 29. The closure won't affect Yahoo's auction services in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. Yahoo is retreating from North America's auction market nearly nine years after launching the service.
