 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Scott R. Schmedel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1989  Poison pills are a corporate defense; they give rights to shareholders to buy discounted stock in case of a hostile takeover. The issue: Does the conferring of rights give holders something of value that should be taxed? Private ruling 8925087 blesses only one transaction, which isn't identified, and can't be cited as precedent. But it appears to be the first favorable ruling on the issue and is "very significant," says New York lawyer Peter Faber.  The ruling concerns one bank holding company's complex acquisition of another for common stock carrying poison-pill rights. The ruling gives no specific conclusion or reasoning on the pill rights, but it goes to great lengths to describe them before reaching its favorable conclusion that the transaction qualifies as tax-free for all concerned, Faber notes.  IRS private ruling 8924002 notes that the utility didn't base its payments on the purchase price, didn't make or sell the systems, and got no sales commissions. Instead, it says, customers performed a service by reducing usage and got compensation based on the utility's savings. No law excludes such compensation from income, so customers are taxable on it, the IRS says. Further, the utility must file reports on annual payments to any customer of $600 or more.
