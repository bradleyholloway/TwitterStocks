 If You Can't Trust The BBB, to Whom Do You Turn Then? --- The Better Business Bureau Is Fending Off Complaints About Its Own Practices   By By John R. Emshwiller, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1988  The affair has produced two lawsuits and an investigation by California's attorney general. It has raised questions about the conduct of nationally known consumer-affairs commentator David Horowitz, who was a paid consultant on the project. It led, last November, to the closing of the Los Angeles BBB. "This is our Bureau-gate," says Terry Hilliard, a former executive vice president of the bureau in Bakersfield.  Bureau officials say many of the complaints are overblown. But they are embarrassing nonetheless to an organization that for 75 years has espoused consumer protection and business ethics. "There were some problems," concedes Stephen Jones, a vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc., the national umbrella organization. "But I don't think there was any fraud by the Better Business Bureau."  Most of the controversy has involved Better Book Inc., a now-defunct San Francisco company that contracted with a dozen bureau chapters -- most of them in California -- to publish directories. Better Book was to print and distribute the directories and keep all the advertising revenue. Its sales people also were to sell BBB memberships. Revenue from that, minus sales commissions, was to go to the individual bureaus.
