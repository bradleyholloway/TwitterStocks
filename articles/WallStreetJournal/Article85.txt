 LAW   By By Christi Harlan, Milo Geyelin and Amy Dockser, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1989  Dr. Karabell's suit, filed last month in federal district court in Philadelphia, claims that he borrowed $50,000 from Caesars of Atlantic City last August and lost it in 80 minutes. He then borrowed $30,000 at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and lost that in 70 minutes.  The following day, Dr. Karabell borrowed $50,000 from Trump Castle Hotel and Casino and lost it all again, this time in 45 minutes, the suit says. Later he borrowed $43,000 at TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort and lost that in two hours.  Attorneys for Trump Castle won't comment on the suit; lawyers for Trump Plaza couldn't be reached. But attorneys for Caesars and TropWorld say Dr. Karabell's suit is without merit. Robert Reilert, general counsel for Caesars, says, "He never told us he was a compulsive gambler. We would have cut him off if he had told us."
