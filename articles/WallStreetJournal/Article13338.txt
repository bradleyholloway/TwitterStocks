 Early Industry Expert Soon Realized a Staff Has Its Own Efficiency   By Crossen, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2006  Mr. [Frederick W. Taylor] also believed that workers could be motivated only by money. But if they were paid a flat day rate, they had no incentive to produce more than yesterday. If they were paid by the piece, they knew from experience their employer would likely cut the piece rate. "When a naturally energetic man works for a few days beside a lazy one," Mr. Taylor wrote, "the logic of the situation is unanswerable. 'Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay I do and does only half the work?'"  "You have been quarreling because there have been no proper standards for a day's work," Mr. Taylor chided bosses. "You do not know what a proper day's work is. We make a bluff at it and the other side makes a guess at it, and then we fight."  As Mr. Taylor should have known, his system was doomed in all but a few settings. Soldiering was a force of nature, not subject to human rules of science. "Rates of work are not determined by chance or by the quirks of individual personality," wrote Hugh G. J. Aitken in "Taylorism at Watertown Arsenal," his 1960 study. "A norm of output is a universal feature of all organized groups, set and maintained by the group itself and often defended by highly effective sanctions."
