 Letters to the Editor: HMOs Would Gun Down Doc Adams of `Gunsmoke'   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2003  Another TV physician, my personal favorite, was Galen Adams, M.D., of "Gunsmoke" -- known as "Doc." Here we have a doctor with a real black bag who treats all the sick and injured of any age, makes house calls as frequently as office visits, delivers babies and removes bullets with equal skill, and always knows when to use a tender bedside manner or bark at his patients to get the desired healing behavior. He accepted payment in chickens or pies or other barter, and sometimes, depending on the patient's situation, refused payment without fear of being investigated by U.S. Marshall Matt Dillon and possibly fined or imprisoned for fraud.
