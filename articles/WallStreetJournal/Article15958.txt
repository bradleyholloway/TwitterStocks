 The Uses of Useless Things   By By Henry Petroski, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2000  Recent obituaries of the inventor Edward Craven Walker carried portraits of both him and his creation, the lava lamp. This household icon of the late 1960s and 1970s is indescribable in words alone, and a still picture gives only a hint of what the thing does. Even streaming video cannot capture the essence of a lava lamp. In this regard the unusual artifact is not unlike a lot of other very popular but seemingly useless things.  "If you buy my lamp, you won't need drugs," said Walker, who was a naturist and successful producer of nudist films. But countless hippies are believed to have smoked pot and dropped acid in the eerie colors and shadows cast by the earliest lava lamps. Indeed, the lamp is one of the defining images of psychedelic culture, with its brightly colored goo morphing in slow motion and seeming to defy gravity by releasing garish globs that float gently upward only to fall back down again inside a softly angled, glass-enclosed, liquid-filled space.  The first lava lamps bore names like Astro and their forms were influenced by the space age into which they were launched. But by the late 1970s, consumers had lost interest and annual production dropped from one million a year to hundreds a month. Walker sold his firm to one of Britain's fastest growing companies, Mathmos, named for the evil bubbling force in the movie "Barbarella." Since appearing in recent '70s retro films and television shows, the lava lamp has experienced a resurgence of popularity. Yet even Tim Haggerty, CEO of the Chicago firm that manufactures the lamp in the U.S., admits that it is "not an essential item in anyone's life."
