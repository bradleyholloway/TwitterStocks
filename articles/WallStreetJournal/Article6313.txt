 Boeing Seeks to Sell Major Plants In Effort to Cut Production Costs   By J. Lynn Lunsford and Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 2004  Establishing the plants' purchase price is a complex exercise. While a final buyer would pay something for the physical assets, most of the negotiation will be over the long-term supply contract between Boeing and any eventual purchaser. In 2001, Boeing sold a small St. Louis division to GKN Aerospace of Britain for about $64 million, but the real value of the transaction was in a long-term supply contract between the two firms, says a person familiar with Boeing's operations. Typically in such deals, the new owner renegotiates labor agreements with unions based on the salary structure of the new employer.  The changes haven't come without pain to the company's labor unions, which have seen their ranks dwindle substantially with the layoffs of more than 30,000 employees in the past three years. "I don't know how much of a company you want to give away before you lose control of it," said Mark Blondin, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents mechanics and others on Boeing's assembly lines. According to the union, the average Boeing machinist earns slightly more than $25 an hour and has been with the company 18 years.
