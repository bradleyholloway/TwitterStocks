 Business Technology: Microsoft Sets Price Cuts In Bid to Boost Xbox Sales   By Cheng, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2007  The Redmond, Wash., software company cut the price of a popular model of its Xbox 360 system by $50 to $349. It also trimmed the price of its cheaper "core" package by $20 to $279, and its higher-end "elite" package by $30 to $449. The difference in packages is determined by whether the system has a hard drive, what size it is, and whether the controllers are wireless.  Microsoft, however, insists the price change has been in the works for months. "This has been our plan all along," said David Hufford, director of Xbox product management. "The first phase was capturing the core audience, which we've done successfully. Now as we enter our third holiday [season], we're aiming to expand [the] audience."
