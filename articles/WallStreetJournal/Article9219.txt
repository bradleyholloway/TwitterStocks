 Dime, in an Effort to Elude North Fork, Will Sell Stake, Launch a Major Buyback   By By Nikhil Deogun and Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2000  Moreover, Warburg Pincus's venture-capital investments in technology companies could give Dime much-needed technological expertise in its back-office, branch, and service-center operations. Mr. [Anthony Terracciano] didn't rule out positioning Dime as an attractive purchase for another bank in the future. But he said of North Fork's Mr. [John Kanas], "He isn't relevant to my agenda."  Dime's agreement with Warburg Pincus came after it failed in its efforts to find an alternative suitor to North Fork, Melville, N.Y., which four months ago launched a hostile stock-and-cash bid that valued Dime at the time at $17 a share, or $1.89 billion. North Fork did succeed in forcing Dime to call off its planned merger of equals with Hudson United Bancorp, Mahwah, N.J., but failed to woo Dime to the altar. North Fork's stock-and-cash offer is currently valued at $16.83 a share.
