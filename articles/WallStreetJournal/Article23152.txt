 See Spots Run: Old TV Campaign Ads, Now on the Web   By Lavin, Frank, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  Fortunately, you don't have to stay in front of your TV this year. Hard-core junkies can see what is perhaps the finest collection of presidential campaign ads ever assembled in "The Living Room Candidate," a Web exhibit organized by the American Museum of the Moving Image at www.movingimage.us. It consists of some 200 television ads from 1952 to 2004 as well as some of this year's Web-only ads.  You can see the efforts to project a "new" Nixon in 1968, and a warm Nixon in 1972. The former was covered exquisitely in Joe McGinnis's "The Selling of the President," which described the labored efforts to apply Madison Avenue methods to Nixon's ad campaign.  Finally, the exhibition, by curators Carl Goodman and David Schwartz, is marred by occasional flashes of ignorance suggestive of a political agenda. It tells us that Reagan's 1980 victory was due "to a demographic shift toward an aging population that was growing more conservative." Huh? But voters shifted away from Carter across the board; his 1980 defeat was not a conspiracy of a newly elderly electorate. Elsewhere it claims that in 1984 "interest rates were high." In fact the official rate was more than three percentage points lower that November than when Reagan took office in January 1981. Yet this sloppiness doesn't detract from the exhibit. The ads speak for themselves, literally.
