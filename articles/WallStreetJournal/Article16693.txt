 'A Doggie Bag, S'il Vous Plait'; We Ask Waiters in 7 Countries To Pack Up Our Leftovers; 'Are You Joking?' in Moscow   By Sesser, Stan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2006  The doggie-bag concept isn't confined to the land of the super-size portion. Food historian Francine Segan found references to it in England when she did research for her book on Renaissance cooking called "Shakespeare's Kitchen." She explains that hosts used "oversized napkins in those days, in part because they ate with their hands, but also to provide a huge container for leftovers. Hosts liked to get extra points with guests by being very generous with leftovers."  In Paris, too, we got a look that might be translated as "Zut alors!" At the elegant La Braisiere, specializing in food of the French Southwest, our server was taken aback at our request to take the leftovers home. But since high-end Parisian restaurants make it a point to cater to patrons' whims, the packages arrived neatly wrapped in aluminum foil and plastic wrap, and labeled in black marker pen "fish" and "lamb." When the chef made the rounds of the dining room later that evening, we asked how many people request doggie bags. "None," he replied.  In Tokyo, however, we were flatly turned down at a restaurant called Torafuku in a high-end shopping mall. "I'm sorry," said the waiter, "but we don't allow customers to take home any leftovers, no matter what they are." It turned out to be a policy dictated by the mall for all its restaurants, for reasons of hygiene. While there's no law against doggie bags in Japan, the nation's health ministry advises against them.
