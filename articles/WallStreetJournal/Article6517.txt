 All Manner of Objects, Combined Artfully   By Feinstein, Roni, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2006  In the Combines, drips, splatters and brushy swaths of paint inherited from the artist's Abstract Expressionist elders intermingle with all manner of objects and materials drawn from everyday life: plain and printed papers, fabrics, articles of clothing, eating utensils, working light bulbs, Coke bottles, a ventilator and stuffed animals -- most famously the angora goat encircled by a tire in "Monogram" (1959), arguably the artist's most celebrated work. Attention-grabbing and often shocking, these works were denounced by some when first exhibited as little more than a fusion of Willem de Kooning's brushwork, Marcel Duchamp's iconoclasm and the collage technique practiced by Pablo Picasso and Kurt Schwitters. Others celebrated the Combines for their wit and bravura, describing them as nets that randomly captured the stuff of life. Mr. [ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG] once wrote in 1959: "Painting relates to both art and life. Neither can be made. (I try to act in the gap between the two.)"
