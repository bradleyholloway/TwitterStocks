 Market Timing Is All in the Approach   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2004  The Nasdaq Composite has made an impressive 84% comeback since its bear-market low on Oct. 9, 2002. Yet the index is still 59% below its level in March 2000. "Bear markets do take a toll," says Leslie Masonson, author of "All About Market Timing" and president of consulting firm Cash Management Resources in Monroe, N.Y. "There's no reason investors should stick around and watch their portfolios get demolished."  Take a seasonal view: You can combine different systems to get the best results. Sy Harding, publisher of the newsletter Street Smart Report, has refined the "best six months" strategy by using an indicator based on moving averages to provide a more exact buy or sell signal. He noticed that favorable periods for stocks lasted between four months and eight months, and so he either stretches or limits his investment season depending on the MACD, or Moving Average Convergence-Divergence.
