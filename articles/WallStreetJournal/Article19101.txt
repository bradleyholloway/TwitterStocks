 REIT Interest: First Industrial Will Buy, Sell or Lease -- For a Fee   By By Barbara Martinez, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1998  Here's how it works: People who sell their real estate have a limited time to purchase new property with the proceeds if they want to delay paying capital-gains taxes. First Industrial, based in Chicago, aims to help them buy industrial buildings from a portfolio of properties that it either owns or wants to own, for a fee.  First Industrial then leases the property from the investor, for less than the property's revenue, pocketing the difference. Later, the investor can sell the property back to the REIT for operating partnership units, which allows the investor to continue to defer taxes.  Analysts say this is among the most novel ways REITs are coping with slowing earnings growth and squeezing out extra bucks for shareholders. Increasingly, that's what investors say REITs should be doing. Just acquiring and developing properties "in this market is not enough to give you the juice you need for a good investment story," says Jay Leupp, analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
