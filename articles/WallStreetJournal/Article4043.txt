 Ford Motor Co. Invests $20 Million In American Robot   By By Doron P. Levin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1985  Ford Motor Co., in an effort to speed development of a "factory of the future," bought an unspecified stake in American Robot Corp., a closely held Pittsburgh-based concern.  Romesh Wadhwani, chairman and chief executive officer of American Robot, said his company will be in charge of providing computer software and services that will link computers to robots and other programmable machines for upgrading automation at Ford's Markham, Ontario, electronics plant. A Ford official explained that the Markham plant is similar in significance to General Motors Corp.'s Saginaw steering-gear plant, which is being built to demonstrate high-technology factory automation.
