 Insider Selling Remained Mild Last Month   By By Cassell Bryan-Low, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2001  Most recently, R. Blake Young, Dynegy's president of global technology, bought 15,000 shares on Oct. 4 valued at $597,750, increasing his direct holdings to 18,000 shares, which excludes options. Directors Sheli Rosenberg and Joe Stewart picked up 2,800 and 1,000, respectively, on Oct. 1. After the transactions, Mr. Rosenberg reported ownership of 11,391 shares and Mr. Stewart of 7,657 shares. At the end of September, Hugh Tarpley, president of strategic investment, made his first open-market purchase of 7,500 shares and director Jerry L. Johnson increased his holdings by 500 shares to 1,073.  The purchases all were made before Dynegy started negotiations with Enron on Oct. 24, said company spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser. The merger was announced on Nov. 9. She added that company insiders bought the shares "because they have confidence in Dynegy stock and felt like it was an opportunity to purchase shares at a good price." Dynegy shares had plunged in the weeks following the Sept. 11 attacks, and were down 16% by the time insiders began buying shares at between $33.17 and $39.85 each. The stock has since rebounded, and was at $41.70 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
