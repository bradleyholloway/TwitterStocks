 Dollar Weakens on U.S. Inflation News But Then Stages Rebound Later in Day   By By Caitlin Randall, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1989  The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index. The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2%, a smaller increase than expected. The market had anticipated a 0.4% rise in the price index.  The September index fueled speculation, damaging to the dollar, that the Federal Reserve soon will ease monetary policy further.  In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks, down from 1.8485 marks late Wednesday, and at 141.70 yen, up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was quoted at $1.5990, up from $1.5920 late Wednesday.
