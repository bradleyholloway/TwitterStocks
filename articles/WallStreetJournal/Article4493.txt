 Tokyo Shares End Day Mixed on Profit-Taking As Exchanges Slump in London and Frankfurt ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1989  Tokyo stocks closed largely mixed Thursday as investors who began worrying about the market's recent high-pitched advance decided to take profits. Stocks slumped in London and Frankfurt.  In Tokyo, the Nikkei index managed to edge up 13.31 points to close at 32078.43, its fifth consecutive record. The Tokyo stock price index of all first section issues fell 1.00 to 2489.07. First section volume was estimated at about 1.6 billion shares, compared with 1.79 billion Wednesday.  Tokyo shares began trading Thursday on a firm tone, benefiting, brokers said, from stable currencies and interest rates and also from the recent strength of overseas securities markets. Foreign institutional investors, which are said to have been expanding the ratio of Japanese securities in their portfolios, also continued to snap up shares and help boost the market, brokers added.
