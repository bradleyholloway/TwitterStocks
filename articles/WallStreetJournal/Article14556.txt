 Investors Hunt for '89's Takeover Targets --- All Keep an Eye On Fundamentals   By By Kevin G. Salwen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1989  Takeovers -- and the fear of them -- were the stock market's catalyst last year as deals erupted in industry after industry, from Kraft in the food business to Firestone in tires. Corporate giants such as Sears launched restructurings; Texaco slated a stock buy-back in the face of a hostile shareholder. Meanwhile, money managers helped themselves to the goodies, with some posting returns of 50% or more.  Both caution as Caveat No. 1 that investors shouldn't buy a stock solely in hopes of a takeover. "If I wouldn't buy a stock for fundamental reasons, I wouldn't touch it," warns Robert M. Raiff, managing director of research at C.J. Lawrence. "Nine times out of 10, when you play a speculation game, you get burned."  Both analysts use computer models to create lists of undervalued stocks. They compare a company's stock price with its potential takeover value, often called its private market value. While many stock investors scrutinize corporate earnings, a crucial yardstick of value for these two analysts is a company's potential sale price.
