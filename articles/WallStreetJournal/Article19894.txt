 Style & Substance: Going Over to the Dark Side; In Some Cities, Blond Coifs Cede the Crown to Brunettes; Allure's New Cover Looks   By Rohwedder, Cecilie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2005  "There is a desire among women to look authentic in their fake hair color," says Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure, which recently ran a six-page article called "Chocolate Cravings" on the brownout. So far this year, six out of eight of the fashion-and-beauty magazine's covers have featured brunettes, compared with just three for all of 2004 -- "a real aberration for us," Ms. Wells notes.  For some women, going brown marks a return to simpler hair, and a simpler life. Regular root touch-ups can make the blond experience both expensive and time-consuming. Eliane Hartmann, a 38-year-old architect from Hamburg, Germany, decided to stop the head games after the birth of her second daughter. "I was a bleached blonde for most of my youth," says Ms. Hartmann, who now has dark brown hair. "Once you have kids, you don't have the time to get color every six weeks."  Not everyone finds it so easy to let go of golden roots. "People think you're more intelligent when you're a brunette," says Jeanne Brink, a 25-year-old from Cape Town, South Africa, who recently went from ash blonde to mocha brown. "But you get much more attention from guys as a blonde." Come next summer, Ms. Brink says, she will be back to being a blonde.
