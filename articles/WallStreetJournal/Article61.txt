 Continental Air to Raise Discount Fares, Assuring Industrywide Boosts Next Week   By By Francis C. Brown III, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1988  Continental Airlines, in a surprise move, said it will raise its round-trip discount fares systemwide by $10, matching similar increases by other airlines.  Continental's decision to match the fare increases effectively assures that discount fares will increase industrywide next week -- a rarity for this time of year when traffic is usually slow. Normally, airlines wait until late May to increase fares.  Moreover, Continental's decision to match the increases means that American Airlines -- for now, at least -- has gained the upper hand in its longstanding struggle with the unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp. for control of industry pricing. American, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., touched off the latest round of increases last week, when it proposed raising all discount fares except for so-called MaxSavers, the industry's lowest fare level.
