 Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2000  Larry Brown's fourth novel begins with the title character alone in the middle of the night on a backwoods highway in north Mississippi. She is 17 years old, utterly innocent (she has never used a pay phone or left a tip or seen a movie), too beautiful for her own good and bent on hitchhiking her way to the coast and leaving her sexually abusive father behind.  For all the drama of the opening pages and for all the truth behind Larry Brown's reputation as a chronicler of the violent South (his previous novels are "Dirty Work," "Father and Son" and "Joe," where Fay was introduced), the book drifts into near domesticity when a state trooper, Sam Harris, rescues Fay from the side of the road and brings her to his house. His wife, Amy, takes her shopping and Sam teaches her to fish. Sam and Amy have lost their own daughter, and Fay provides them with a measure of comfort. Fay is happy in a way she hadn't known was possible, and for a while she even lets herself believe that her new life will be her salvation.  But this is a Larry Brown novel, loaded, as always, with undercurrents of menace, and it isn't long before a series of tragedies propels Fay back to the road, headed for Biloxi. Once there, she is drawn into a tawdry and menacing world, and the chapters flash by again like fenceposts on the highway as the novel rushes toward its shattering conclusion.
