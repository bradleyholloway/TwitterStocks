 U.S. Currency Rises Sharply; Gold Falls $1.20   By By Stephen Grover, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1985  The U.S. dollar rose sharply against major foreign currencies yesterday in expectation of further oil-price cuts and indications that the recent slide in U.S. interest rates has temporarily halted.  Lower oil prices translate into a lower rate of inflation, which is good for the dollar, and an end to sagging U.S. interest rates would mean that the diminishing value of dollar-denominated investments has come to an end.  In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 3.0720 West German marks, up about 0.8% from Monday's quote of 3.0480 marks. The British pound declined 1.6%, to $1.2633 from $1.2843 on Monday.
