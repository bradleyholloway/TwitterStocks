 Argentine Leader Calls For Vote 6 Months Early   By By Michelle Wallin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2002  Mr. [Eduardo Duhalde]'s surprise announcement casts a new pall of uncertainty over Argentina's economic fortunes just as the nation moves forward with talks on an emergency aid package from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is scheduled to send economists specializing in fiscal, monetary and banking policy to Buenos Aires during the next several weeks, with an eye toward signing a loan program Argentina hopes will reach at least $20 billion. Argentina had hoped to secure the rollover of upcoming payments to the IMF and Inter-American Development Bank while loan talks continue, but the IDB said yesterday its charter doesn't allow a postponement of payments.  Mr. Duhalde was appointed caretaker president by the nation's congress Jan. 1, at the height of political upheaval that began in December when deadly rioting forced Fernando de la Rua out of office. In a series of political twists and turns, the country worked through three temporary presidents in a matter of days, with Mr. Duhalde finally installed by Argentina's congress.
