 IBM Plans to Increase Disclosure Of Items That Boost Bottom Line   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2002  Investors, skeptical of the complicated accounting of big companies such as IBM in the wake of the Enron Corp. accounting scandal, also will be on alert for surprises. Whether investors will like IBM's new openness, "depends on what they disclose," said Steven Milunovich, of Merrill Lynch.  IBM said its "other income" category will be expanded to include gains on real-estate sales and currency-exchange gains and losses that had been included in the sales, general and administrative category. IBM also said it will increase disclosure of the impact of its overfunded pension plan on financial results.
