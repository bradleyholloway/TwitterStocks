 U.S. Officials Say Food Aid to Russia Had Been Diverted   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1999  U.S. government and aid-agency officials confirmed that $1 million in U.S. food assistance to Russia was diverted in the mid-1990s.  Agriculture Department Inspector General Roger C. Viadero told the House Agriculture Committee that investigators had discovered aid money was deposited in a Russian bank, then moved to offshore accounts. The money had been diverted from the proceeds of the sale of $3.7 million of food shipped to Russia as foreign aid.
