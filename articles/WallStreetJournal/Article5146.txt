 World Wire [5]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1994  Taiwan formally removed most restrictions on the establishment of foreign banks, under a liberalization policy aimed at making the island country a regional financial center and easing its planned entry into the main world trade body.  The government also shortened to two years from five the minimum period that a foreign bank must run a Taiwan operation before it may open a branch. And it scrapped rules that limited foreign banks' domestic-currency deposits to 15 times the capital they brought into Taiwan; capital minimums now are $5.66 million for an office and $4.5 million per branch.  Vietnam will restrict the use of foreign currency in the country and require Vietnamese companies to deposit foreignexchange earnings into special bank accounts, starting Oct. 1. The government aims to assert control over the currency trading business, boost demand for Vietnam's dong currency and improve public awareness of banks' reliability. Foreign bankers said the move would improve chances of making the dong fully convertible. Businesses that accept foreign money -- the U.S. dollar is commonly used -- will have to deal exclusively in dong; exceptions include some hotels and duty-free shops.
