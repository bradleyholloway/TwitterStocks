 Health Watch: Employers Aren't Eager to Offer HSAs   By Lieber, Ron, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2004  This year, however, employers haven't been scrambling to sign up employees for HSAs partly because of a one-time hiccup. Employers plan their insurance offerings for the following year by the middle of the previous year, but it took the Treasury department until this summer to sort through all of the questions that employers had about how to administer them.  -- A couple of alternatives. Many employers are choosing instead to offer health-reimbursement accounts, or HRAs, close cousins of HSAs that are a couple of years older than HSAs. HRAs, which are also paired with high-deductible insurance, do allow employers to offer full coverage of diabetes and other conditions. Workers don't get to put their own funds in them, however, or choose how they're invested. (Only employers can contribute to the account.) Plus, employers have the option of forbidding workers to take the money with them when they quit.
