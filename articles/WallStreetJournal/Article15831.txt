 U.S. May Buy Back Bonds to Trim Debt --- Reverse Auction Would Be First of Kind in 100 Years; Investors Applaud Plan   By By Michael M. Phillips and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1999  Awash in tax revenue from an 8 1/2 -year economic boom, the Treasury Department announced it is proceeding with a plan under which it may buy back some of the $3.6 trillion in bonds it has sold to the public.  For two years, the Treasury has been reducing debt by issuing fewer new securities as old ones mature. The department said yesterday that it expects to cut privately held marketable debt by $11 billion this quarter, bringing the overall reduction in government debt to $87 billion in fiscal 1999. But it has been at least a century since the U.S. offered cash for securities that haven't yet matured, although the government swapped new bonds for old bonds during the 1960s and early 1970s.  "In the past seven years, we've balanced Washington's books -- we've cut its credit-card balance," Mr. (President) Clinton told reporters in the White House Rose Garden. "Now let's refinance our nation's mortgage and then wipe the ledger clean. Paying down the debt creates wealth, creates jobs, creates opportunity. It's the right and responsible thing to do, and we have the chance of a lifetime to do it."
