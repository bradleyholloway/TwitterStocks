 Mobil Fees In Panama Under Fire --- Affiliate's Payments Are Related to Right To Operate Terminal   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1999  A Mobil affiliate paid three Panamanians $2.7 million in consulting fees after securing the right to operate a Panama Canal fueling terminal formerly used by the U.S. government. The terminal was important to Mobil, because it offered a great opportunity to profit from refueling ships passing through the canal. The three consultants Mobil paid included an associate of former dictator Manuel Noriega and a ruling-party official.  Internal corporate documents show that at least one Mobil executive believed the men were representing the Panama government. On Thursday, a prominent Washington attorney with long involvement in the U.S. government's anticorruption efforts asked the Justice Department to investigate the situation. The department declined to comment.  The attorney, Jack Blum, who investigated drug and weapons charges against Mr. Noriega and one of the consultants, Jorge Krupnik, for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the 1980s, said in a letter to the Justice Department that documents and other materials "suggest that a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has occurred and an investigation is warranted."
