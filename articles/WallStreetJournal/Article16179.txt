 Taste -- Review & Outlook: Who You Gonna Call?   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2002  Just ask Roberta Kitchen, an African-American mother of five whose youngest daughter, Toshika, was rescued from a rotten municipal school system by a Cleveland voucher. When the program was challenged in court, it was the Institute for Justice, a free-market-based public-interest law firm, that defended the rights of Cleveland parents like her before the Supreme Court. And that was an education in itself.  "I was disappointed that the NAACP and the Urban League and ACLU were not jumping all over this issue," says Ms. Kitchen. "For me the help started with the Heritage Foundation, and from them to the Institute for Justice and others." As Ms. Kitchen soon learned, not only were the established civil-rights groups not in her corner; they were all busy writing amicus briefs to uphold the miserable status quo.
