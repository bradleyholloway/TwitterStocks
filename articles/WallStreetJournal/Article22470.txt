 Private Electronic Trading Systems Face New Controls, Competition in SEC System   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1998  The regulations, which also could lead to lower costs for individual investors, are being put in place as brokers and exchanges move to create markets on the Internet. Approved by a 5-0 vote, the rules "represent common-sense regulation that still ensures investor protection," SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said.  Screen-based systems have been used primarily by big institutional investors, including mutual funds. But that is beginning to change, as small investors flock to the Internet to trade in stocks. As a result, the Internet will become an increasingly important market. Several exchanges are planning Internet-based systems.  Until now, private electronic markets have been treated as broker-dealers with few supervisory or regulatory obligations. Under the changes, they must register with the SEC as an exchange or as a broker-dealer with more requirements triggered as their trading volume rises. Internet markets also will have to register with the SEC.
