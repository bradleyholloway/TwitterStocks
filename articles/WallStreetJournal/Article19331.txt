 From WSJ.com: OpinionJournal.com   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  The first time I visited Jerusalem was in June 1967, three weeks after its liberation. I had bolted from my junior year at college, and, armed with press credentials from my home town paper, the Berkshire (Mass.) Eagle, had made my way to the Jewish state via deck passage on a boat out of the southern Italian port of Brindisi. I tramped around Jerusalem for days, gaining a physical sense of how walls, gates and obstructions had divided the city only weeks before. I had scores of conversations at the time, but none more memorable than one about Vietnam.
