 Federal Industries Expects Net to Fall In 1990 as Much as 20%   The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1990  WINNIPEG, Manitoba -- John Fraser, president and chief executive officer of Federal Industries Ltd., said the industrial holding company expects a 15% to 20% decline in net income this year as a result of the "deteriorating economic outlook" in Canada.  In 1989, the company had net income of 45.6 million Canadian dollars (US$39.1 million) or C$1.66 a share, on revenue of C$2.28 billion. Mr. Fraser had said earlier this year that the company expected 1990 net to be about the same level.
