 U.S. Railroads Expected to Post 8% Rise in Profit --- Successful Cost-Cutting, Consolidation in West Fuel the Improvement   By By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1997  The rise in profits, they said, reflects continued cost-cutting, consolidation of some railroads in the West and an easing of an earlier glut in freight capacity in the trucking industry, which competes with railroads for some freight business. The takeover fight among Eastern railroads over Conrail Inc. is unlikely to affect profits substantially in this quarter, analysts said.  But profits were held down at some companies, they added, by slow growth in a few key freight commodities and rising fuel prices, which are up about 15% from last year's rates. Measured in car-loadings on the major carriers, traffic in grain was up less than 1%, as some farmers declined to ship a portion of their harvest in a season of relatively low prices. Traffic in chemicals also was flat, according to the Association of American Railroads.  Union Pacific Corp., Bethlehem, Pa., is expected to post slightly higher earnings in the fourth quarter. According to a First Call consensus of analysts, per-share earnings are expected to increase about 3.5% to 90 cents from 87 cents a year earlier, with last year's earnings adjusted to reflect the recently completed spinoff of the company's Union Pacific Resources unit.
