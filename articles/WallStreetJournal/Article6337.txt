 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- House of the Week: Homestead by Olmsted   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 2004  Due Diligence: This early 20th-century stone, marble and brick manor modeled after a French chateau was designed by architect R.H. Wambolt of Boston firm Bigelow & Wadsworth for original owner George Robert White. The estate was named the Wyck Estate when it was purchased by Lawrence and Eleanor Reeve in 1944. Mr. Reeve, an architect, and his wife have since passed away, and their children have decided to sell the estate. The grounds of the Wyck estate were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed New York's Central Park and Boston's Emerald Necklace.
