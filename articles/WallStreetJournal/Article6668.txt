 Imus Suspended Over Race Slurs; CBS, NBC Move To Contain Fallout For Lucrative Show   By Barnes, Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  Mr. [Don Imus] -- known for a curmudgeonly interviewing style and guest roster of A-list politicians and media luminaries -- last week referred to the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "nappy- headed hos" during his show. His comments were similar to those of his longtime producer, Bernard McGuirk, who on air called the women's final, which Rutgers lost to the University of Tennessee, the "Jigaboos vs. the Wannabees."  In a harshly worded statement announcing the suspension, NBC called Mr. Imus's comments "racist" and "abhorrent." CBS subsequently released a brief statement saying it also would suspend Mr. Imus's show. A CBS spokesman said the company hasn't yet decided whether Mr. Imus's suspension will be with or without pay.
