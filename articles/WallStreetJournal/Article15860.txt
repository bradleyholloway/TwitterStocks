 Saul Steinberg Insurer Faces Major Tests   By By Deborah Lohse, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1999  Mr. (Saul) Steinberg for several decades has kept a highly leveraged insurance company moving through a complex series of stock and bond offerings, refinancings, aggressive accounting techniques and asset sales, all the while collecting one of the industry's biggest salaries. Better known to some from the society pages, which have chronicled such Steinberg extravagances as his 50th birthday party a decade ago replete with actors staging his favorite art masterpieces, he largely has been out of the headlines lately.  And so, Mr. Steinberg is looking squarely in the eye of a series of transactions that some insurance-industry experts and executives characterize as make or break. It could take a highly fortuitous confluence of events, many of them outside the control of Mr. Steinberg, for Reliance to emerge with its independence and financial strength intact.  "I really believe strongly that we are going to be able to show the ratings agencies that we've raised capital (with the IPO and other initiatives), and, once we do that, I don't see any problem with refinancing this debt," says Lowell C. Freiberg, Reliance's chief financial officer. He maintains that Reliance, having sold various underperforming and noncore operating units over the years, now has five profit centers "in very good shape." He also points out that Reliance sports one of the lowest debt-to-capital ratios of its history.
