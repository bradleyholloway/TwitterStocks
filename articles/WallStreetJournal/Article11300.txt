 Some Propositions About Sentences   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1989  Judge Robert Carter has quite a task today: How does he punish securities officials convicted under RICO in a trial the Justice Department has since admitted should never have been brought? He's not the only federal judge in New York these days who has to somehow do justice in cases brought by federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani.  Officials of Princeton/Newport go before Judge Carter with the cold comfort that the prosecutorial abuses in their case won't be repeated. The Justice Department recently made two rare amendments to the manual governing federal prosecutions. One acknowledges that RICO charges totally confuse tax cases and should never be used in them. The other prohibits prosecutors from again using forfeitures to drive legitimate businesses into liquidation before trial.
