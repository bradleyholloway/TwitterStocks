 Factory Orders Jumped 4.3% In November --- Strong Advance Was Paced By Defense Items; Sales Of New Homes Tumbled   By By Alan Murray and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1985  New orders for manufactured goods rose a strong 4.3% in November, the Commerce Department said, signaling renewed growth in production during the first part of the year.  The factory-orders report confirmed the department's advance report two weeks ago, which said that orders for big-ticket durable goods during November rose at the fastest rate in four years. The new report showed that orders for nondurable goods were also reasonably strong that month, rising 0.6% after declining 1.5% in October. Durable goods are items intended to last three years or more.  Orders for all durable goods rose 7.8% in November, rather than the 8.3% in the advance report two weeks ago. Factory inventories fell 0.3% to $285.52 billion after rising 0.4% in October to $286.43 billion. Factory shipments rose 0.9% in November to $192.15 billion after increasing 0.2% in October to $190.52 billion.
