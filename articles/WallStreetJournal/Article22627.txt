 Belgians Find Bonn Castle Is a Hard Sell --- Villas Glut the Market as Diplomats Leave for Berlin   By By Alfred Kueppers, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2000  BONN -- Belgium may be a minor player on Europe's diplomatic stage, but it had one of the grandest embassies here during the heady post-World War II period, when Bonn was the scene of intense political intrigue. Those days are long gone, however, and the Belgians are finding it difficult to sell their history-filled mansion.  The Belgians aren't the only ones. Ever since the German parliament left for Berlin last summer, the world's diplomatic missions have been making a slow exodus from this quiet Rhineland city, vacating 18th-century castles and riverside mansions. Many historic former ambassador's residences, Italian, British and Korean among others, still await new owners.  Among these buildings, one highlight is the Kommende, or ruling seat, an 18th-century estate built on the foundations of a 13th-century Teutonic Knights' stronghold. From 1953 until 1999, it was the Belgian ambassador's residence, and it was put up for sale last April. Asking price: 7.9 million marks, or about $3.9 million.
