 Big Board Presses for Subsidies on Site Favored for Expansion, Sources Say   By By David D. Kirkpatrick and Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1998  Only one big obstacle remains as the New York Stock Exchange plans to expand into a new space near its current location in lower Manhattan: negotiating state and city subsidies for the move, according to people close to the discussions.  Negotiators for the city and state of New York have nearly locked up agreements that would allow the exchange to take over the block behind the landmark facade of the old Morgan Guaranty building at 23 Wall St., these people say. The new facility would cost about $600 million to $800 million, including acquisition of the sites on the block and building two new 50,000-square-foot trading floors, people close to the discussions say. But the exchange is holding out for as much money as possible from the state and city, they say.  Neither the exchange nor government officials are ruling out any options, but discussions are now focused on taking over several buildings currently occupied by J.P. Morgan & Co. They include two buildings that the investment bank owns at 23 Wall St., 15 Broad St. and two addresses that it leases from local landlord WHW Associates at 37 Wall St. and 43 Exchange Place.
