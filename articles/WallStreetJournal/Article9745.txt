 The Middle Seat: Airlines Retreat as Price Wars Take Their Toll; Service Cuts by Big Carriers And Their Low-Cost Rivals Are Starting to Raise Fares   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  The retreats aren't limited to the big higher-cost airlines. America West Airlines has scaled back its foray into nonstop flights between California and New York. Frontier Airlines will end its experiment to build a minihub in Los Angeles. Struggling Independence Air is canceling its service to Lansing, Mich., and Dayton, Ohio. AirTran Airways has pulled out of two cities where it couldn't roust enough traffic: Greensboro, N.C., and Tallahassee, Fla.  "Airlines are less willing to invest in developmental flying," said J. Scott Kirby, executive vice president of sales and marketing at America West. "Given the financial condition of the airline industry, you really don't have any other choice right now."  AirTran said it used planes that had been flying to Greensboro and Tallahassee to boost service to bigger cities. "We tried everything we knew to make it work and it didn't work," AirTran spokesman Tad Hutcheson said.
