 Preach to the Choir   By By William McGurn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 2001  On the first Sunday after the Catholic bishops criticized George W. Bush's decision to allow federal funding of embryonic stem-cell research, I was curious to hear the follow-up in my parish. But far from talking about stem cells or the preciousness of human life, our priest mentioned his vacation at Cape Cod and then . . . nothing. So I called my parents: No word on stem cells there, either. Ditto for a college roommate, though my sister-in-law in Boston did recall hearing something about it at the church they go to at the beach.  Informal surveys of acquaintances suggest I am not alone, as do polls such as the recent Harris Interactive survey showing Catholics supporting embryonic stem cell research by 61% to 24%, or the ABC/Beliefnet poll showing a majority of Catholics supporting legal abortion.  What accounts for this curious dynamic? Surely the first is the clergy itself. Far from treating Catholic teaching on life and sexuality as a gift, designed to help their flocks live happy, decent lives, too many priests and bishops groan under what they see as the unpleasant task of presenting to affluent congregations a litany of No's: no abortion, no birth control, not even in vitro fertilization for couples desperate to have a child. Unfortunately, that has fed another temptation, largely among those who have tried to get their churches to be true to their faith but have been rebuffed. Many of them have rightly found their way into the Republican Party, and the danger today is that they forget the GOP is just that: A party, not a church.
