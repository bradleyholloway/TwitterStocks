 Dubai Ports World Sells U.S. Assets; AIG Unit Buys Operations That Ignited Controversy As Democrats Plan Changes   By Neil King Jr. and Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2006  The backlash against the deal in Congress and across the U.S. provoked concern in the Arab world and among investors elsewhere that the U.S. was turning against foreign investment, especially in sectors that involved security concerns. "There is a risk that the Cfius process can discourage foreign investment and really chill the foreign investor community," said Daniel Price, who heads the international practice at law firm Sidley Austin LLP.  Mr. [Mohammed Sharaf] said there were "no bitter feelings" over the thwarted purchase, but acknowledged regrets. "It is sad that we aren't there anymore and couldn't be there. It has been a difficult experience for everyone," he said. Mr. Sharaf said DP World would like to return to the U.S. market once Congress and the Bush administration work out modifications to foreign-investment rules.
