 Dow Industrials, Nasdaq Decline; Cisco Helps Weaken Tech Issues   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2001  Shares in makers of the communications chips used in Cisco's networking products declined sharply, with PMC-Sierra falling 3.99 to 40.11, while Conexant Systems declined 1.33 to 9.87, and Broadcom dropped 4.29 to 40.24, all on Nasdaq.  Some of the enterprise networking products also came undone, with Extreme Networks falling 2.16 to 32.49 on Nasdaq. Makers of rival communications technologies also took a spill. Juniper Networks declined 1.53 to 57.37, while Ciena dropped 1.06 to 60.54, both on Nasdaq.  The Nasdaq Composite Index, suffering from the Cisco fallout, declined 42.14, or 1.9%, to end at 2156.63. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average acquitted itself nicely, keeping its loss to 16.53, or 0.15%, to finish at 10866.98.
