 U.S. Suspends Paying General Dynamics Corp. --- Alleged Billing Abuses Cited For Halting a Portion Of Payments to Concern   By By Tim Carrington, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1985  The Pentagon suspended certain payments to General Dynamics Corp. for at least 30 days while it investigates allegations that the company loaded bills to the agency with extraneous items.  Defense Department spokesman Michael Burch described a slew of billing abuses alleged at a House hearing last week as "nauseating," and asserted that the suspension of payments was part of a broad policy to "get tough" with military contractors. However, the Pentagon is suspending only general and administrative payments to the company and will continue to make much larger progress payments on military jobs.  The Pentagon estimated that the general and administrative payments amount to about $35 million a month. Defense Department officials weren't able to provide estimates of the progress payments that would continue. Congressional investigators estimate that Pentagon payments to the company total $600 million a month.
