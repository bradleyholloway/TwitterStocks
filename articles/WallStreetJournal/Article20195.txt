 Politics & Economics: Afghanistan Measure Could Avoid Impasse Over Iraq Funding   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2007  About $30 billion, or a sixth, of the Pentagon's latest $190 billion spending request before Congress is related to Afghanistan, where the U.S. commitment has broad bipartisan support. By approving the full sum this month, lawmakers could sidestep divisions over Iraq and provide an infusion of cash for Army operations accounts, which are consuming about $6.6 billion a month.  That would appear to be enough to carry the Army well into March, and buy time for a debate early next year on the future of U.S. policy in Iraq. Iraq commander Gen. David Petraeus is slated to report to Congress next spring, and the fight now is really over what conditions will be attached to so-called "bridge funding" to carry the military until that debate is completed.
