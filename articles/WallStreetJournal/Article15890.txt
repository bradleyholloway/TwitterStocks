 House, Senate Diverge on Bills For Bankruptcy   By By Dawn Kopecki and Jeffrey Taylor, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2000  Bankruptcy legislation approved by both houses of Congress seeks to curb the tide of personal-bankruptcy filings by holding people responsible for their debts. But the House and Senate go about this in different ways.  The bills reflect the political reality that holding consumers more accountable, in an age in which bankruptcy filings have soared to all-time highs, has broad support in Congress and in the White House. Differences between the versions now must be worked out in a House-Senate conference.  Creditors -- banks and credit-card companies -- prefer the House bill over the Senate version, because the House's legislation is seen as having more rigorous and inescapable mechanisms for limiting bankruptcy filings. "Any final bill will fall somewhere between the House and Senate versions, but we hope the final bill will include the House approach on consumerbankruptcy issues, including needs-based bankruptcy," said Philip Corwin of Federal Legislative Associates, which represents the American Bankers Association.
