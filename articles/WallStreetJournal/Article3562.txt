 Powell Deputy to Visit Pakistan And India in Bid to Ease Dispute   The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2002  Nearly a million men backed by tanks, warplanes and missiles have been mobilized by Pakistan and India on their 1,800-mile border since the raid on the Indian parliament, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militants fighting its rule in Kashmir. New Delhi says the guerrillas operate freely from Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Fears of war surged after a raid on an Indian army camp last Tuesday that India again said was staged by Pakistan-based militants. Of the 34 killed, many were wives and children of Indian soldiers.  India ordered the expulsion of Pakistan's ambassador Saturday to protest the attack and on Sunday streamlined its armed-forces command by putting paramilitary border forces under army control, a move military experts said showed a preparedness for war. Pakistan asked the international community yesterday to press India to open a dialogue.
