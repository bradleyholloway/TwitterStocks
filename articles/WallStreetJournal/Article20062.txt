 PURSUITS; Leisure & Arts -- Masterpiece: Olin Stephens's Radical Yacht; Dorade is 75; its maker is 98 -- and they both remain (sea)worthy of admiration   By Knecht, G Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2006  [OLIN STEPHENS] was at the helm when Dorade crossed the finish line on July 31. Longer sailboats generally go faster than shorter ones, but Dorade, the third smallest of the 10-yacht fleet, reached the line more than two days before the second-place boat. When the times were handicapped, or "corrected," to reflect the differences among the yachts, Dorade's time was almost four days better than its closest rival. Dorade went on to win the Fastnet Race by a wide margin. When the crew returned to New York City, where Sparkman & Stephens had its office, they were rewarded with a ticker-tape parade, a first for sailors.  OVER LABOR DAY weekend, he and Mr. Stephens, now 98 but still traveling to yachting events around the world from his home in Hanover, N.H., boarded Dorade to compete in the Museum of Yachting's annual Classic Yacht Regatta in Narragansett Bay. Although Mr. Stephens himself advised the crew on the most favorable sail combinations, Dorade placed second after a section of the rigging failed in winds gusting to more than 30 knots. "We would have won otherwise," said Mr. [Edgar Cato], who plans to continue racing Dorade in the Caribbean and New England.  Unfailingly modest, Mr. Stephens is reluctant to rate Dorade as a masterpiece. When I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago, he said it was too narrow, that it would go even faster, and be less "rolly," if he had given it just a bit more breadth. But he acknowledged that Dorade was a breakthrough -- or, as he put it, "a kind of awakening" -- for yachting design. "I knew that a lighter boat with outside ballast was the way to go, and that a deep and narrow hull would go through the sea nicely. It was obvious. It was like taking candy from a baby. It just had to win."
