 Seagram, as Liquor Sales Wane, Plans Cutbacks in Spirits Business   By By Alix M. Freedman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1988  Former Seagram executives and industry observers close to the company said the reorganization, which would be the third in about as many years, signals that Seagram is seeking to further improve its profitability. The distiller is also trying to shrink dependence on its spirits business, in an era when liquor consumption is declining at about 2% annually. Two years ago, Grand Metropolitan PLC of London outstripped Seagram in dominating the global spirits business. And Guiness PLC is now running neck-and-neck with the family-run distiller founded by Samuel Bronfman in 1928.  Edgar Bronfman Jr., Seagram's 33-year-old, third generation heir apparent, is focusing on his previously stated goal of turning Seagram into "the best adult-beverage company in the U.S." -- omitting the word alcoholic. Earlier this year, for instance, Seagram took a giant leap outside the hard liquor business into orange juice, acquiring Tropicana Products Inc. for $1.2 billion. Mr. Bronfman Jr., who was recently promoted to the new position of executive vice president of Seagram's U.S. operations, has also been the driving force behind Seagram's dominance of the $1 billion wine cooler market, where it now holds a 36% share.
