 Oil Prices Fall as Iraq Accedes to U.N. Inspectors   By By Matthew F. Gallagher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1997  Crude oil futures fell at the New York Mercantile Exchange after Iraq said it would allow the return of United Nations weapons inspectors.  Nymex traders saw this as an end to the three-week U.N.-Iraq standoff, and as a lifting of the threat of military conflict, which could have dislocated oil supplies from the Middle East.  The December crude oil contract fell 64 cents to $19.16 a barrel, after touching as low as $19.05 a barrel, the lowest price for a nearby contract since July 22. January crude fell as low as $19.43 a barrel, the lowest price for that contract since July 15.
