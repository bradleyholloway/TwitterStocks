 EU's Chemical-Testing Rules Are Scaled Back on Trade Concerns   By Victoria Knight and Mary Jacoby, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2005  The parliament's conservative and socialist groups had been at odds over the extent of health and safety data companies should gather on as many as 30,000 chemical substances used in manufacturing processes. But on Tuesday, the European People's Party and the Socialist Group backed a business-friendly compromise that wouldn't immediately require companies to pay for new testing of chemicals.  Businesses said the changes would make rules more workable while targeting the most dangerous chemicals. Under the compromise, companies would submit only basic information -- such as name, manufacture and safety data -- in the first 18 months after registering a chemical. The European Parliament will vote on the bill Nov 17. It also requires approval by EU member countries' governments, but their vote was delayed at Germany's request and hasn't been rescheduled.
