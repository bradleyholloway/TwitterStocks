 The Mossberg Solution: The Video Camera Revised; Radical New Design, Lower Cost Simplifies Shooting and Sharing; Image Quality Can Be an Issue   By Walter S. Mossberg and Katherine Boehret, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2006  Well, a small company has invented just such a video camera, and we've been testing it. It's a radical new design, unlike any other video camera we've tested, and has the potential to expand the video- camera market to people who, until now, have been reluctant to use one, or to use one very often. Not only that, but this simple, low- priced new design is due to spread by the end of this year, because it has been licensed to several big-name camera makers, who plan their own versions.  You can also take the camcorder to stores like Rite Aid or CVS, where for about $10 they'll copy the footage off of the camcorder and make a DVD, complete with menus, that's playable on most DVD players and computers.  Up to 98 clips can be captured in the Point & Shoot's 30-minute recording period. After turning the camera on with the Power button, we only had to press the red Record button to start taping. In the top left corner of the screen, numbers flashed showing how much time had elapsed. The up and down arrows work as zoom buttons for the camera's slight 2x digital zoom, and pressing record again stopped filming, ending a segment.
