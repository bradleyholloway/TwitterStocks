 Our Credo: Free Trade and Competition   By Zoellick, Robert B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2003  It is critical for the U.S. -- along with the European Union -- to propel the Doha trade and development agenda. That is why America has challenged our WTO partners to view this negotiation as a once-in-a- generation opportunity. We have proposed the elimination of all tariffs on manufactured goods by 2015. In agriculture, the U.S. has called for eliminating export subsidies, cutting $100 billion from domestic subsidies that distort production and trade, and slashing tariffs to no higher than 25% -- with the U.S. average dropping to 5%. The U.S. has also pressed to open services markets, which the World Bank estimates could add $900 billion a year to developing economies alone.  So what should the U.S. do if other nations choose protectionism over free trade? Under the WTO's procedures, one nation can block progress. It would be a grave mistake to permit any one country to veto America's drive for global free trade. Our strategy is based on a concept that any economics professor should appreciate: competition. If some countries hide behind the false security of protectionism, the U.S. will work with those that believe true economic strength is achieved through openness. The strategy is simple: The U.S. is spurring a competition in liberalization. In the wake of the disastrous protectionism of the 1930s, Secretary of State Cordell Hull employed this logic to cut tariffs and build momentum for global trade rules by negotiating 32 bilateral agreements.
