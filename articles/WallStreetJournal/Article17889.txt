 Data on Texas Banks Being Taken Over Queried on Accuracy   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1988  William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said investors "have raised some questions" about the accuracy of financial reports on the two banks: Texas American Bancshares Inc., Fort Worth, and National Bancshares Corp. of Texas, San Antonio.  The move throws into doubt Mr. Pohlad's contract to take over the banks with FDIC assistance. His agreement, announced July 20, calls for two companies controlled by Mr. Pohlad to invest as much as $200 million and for the FDIC to contribute $475 million, with the prospect of getting some back.
