 William Long's Direct Style Helped Sway GM to Tennessee Site for Saturn   By By Ed Bean, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 1985  Mr. Long, 55 years old, is commissioner of Tennessee's Department of Economic and Community Development. Day to day, he directed the sales job that helped to persuade General Motors Corp. to build its much-publicized Saturn auto complex in Spring Hill.  "That's not our style," says Mr. Long. "We didn't think a quality corporation like GM would make a decision based on popping firecrackers." Mr. Long likes to sprinkle his speech with "these fellers . . . ," but he's come a long way from the middle Tennessee farm where he grew up. After retiring from the Marines several years ago, he received a doctorate in education and human development coordination from Vanderbilt University. Then a friendship with Gov. Lamar Alexander led to several high-level state jobs before this one, including commissioner of the state's prison system.  Mr. Long defers to the governor, who he says was the inspiration for the state's strategy in dealing with GM. The governor had numerous conversations with GM Chairman Roger B. Smith, although unlike some other governors, he never made a pilgrimage to Detroit. Mr. Long understates his own job this way: "Get the right information to the right people at the right time."
