 Barron's Insight: For Anheuser-Busch, Wagons Are Rolling Again   By Williams, Christopher C, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  Company officials said they lifted prices "significantly higher" over the Memorial Day and July Fourth holidays, and they're planning increases on the majority of the company's volume for early next year. Also, they expect revenue per barrel to increase 1% to 2% this year. Analysts expect earnings for 2006 to rise 5%, to $2.54 a share.  Still, paying 20 times 2007 projected earnings, or around $55 a share, wouldn't be unreasonable for a cash-rich franchise in the early innings of a turnaround. "Many of the growth and margin initiatives that Anheuser laid out have yet to come to fruition," says Steven Roge of Roge Partners Fund, who values the shares at $57.
