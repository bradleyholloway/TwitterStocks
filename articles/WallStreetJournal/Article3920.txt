 Vivendi Universal Profit Triples; Gains in Music, Videogames Cited   By Clow, Simon, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 2005  Restructuring at Vivendi has left doubts among many analysts and fund managers over the company's combined media-telecommunications strategy, but the financial cleanup has put the French company in better shape. During the first quarter, overall financial charges dropped to 53 million euros from 257 million euros a year ago thanks to lower debt levels and a rise in the value of a convertible bond linked to Spanish television group Sogecable. [Vivendi] said increased profit at its Canal Plus pay-TV unit also boosted earnings, helping it shrug off the effect of a weak U.S. dollar and more-sluggish growth at its SFR-Cegetel telecommunications division.
