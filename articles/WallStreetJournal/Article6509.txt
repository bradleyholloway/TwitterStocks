 Sightings: Making Ideas Beautiful; Do art and ideas mix? It depends on who's stirring the pot   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2005  Again, this bald description makes "Super Vision" sound like a technical tour de force -- which it is. Yet it's far more than that. "I think of the stories in 'Super Vision' as the emotional side of data," explains Marianne Weems, the show's director. "The point is to bring visceral sensation and visual impact to these stories -- and as we move more deeply into interpreting the factual material on which they're based, we move away from the literal."  This is what lifts "Super Vision" out of the pedestrian realm of the purely factual. Yes, Ms. Weems and her collaborators are rightly disturbed by what she calls "this new form of surveillance and its constant incursions into the realm of our selves." But instead of preaching a strident sermon about how "dataveillance" threatens the right to privacy, they've transformed their fears into a fast-flowing stream of nonliteral images that stick in your mind like the swirling colors of an abstract painting. Just when [John Jr.], the identity thief, thinks he's gotten away clean, you see in the distance what looks like a flock of birds. Then, as it draws nearer, you realize that it's actually a cloud of computer-generated data points hurtling through the air to chase him down. That's not politics -- it's poetry. And it's the quintessence of "Super Vision," a work of theatrical alchemy in which ideas are turned into art by making them more beautiful.
