 Top Designers Shill on TV --- Reward Is Reaching Masses Without a Large Sales Force, But Cable Selling Has Risks   By By Ann Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2002  Glitzy upscale fashion designer Randolph Duke introduced his own HSN line, "The Look by Randolph Duke," two summers ago and now appears with new products every other month. Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck has been selling an exclusive cookware line on the network for the past two years. And HSN just signed up Anne Bowen, who created the much-talked-about, $2.5 million diamond-encrusted gown worn by Jules Asner, of the E Entertainment channel, at the Academy Awards. Ms. Bowen is designing an exclusive line of vintage-inspired apparel.  TV is still a risky venue. Designers can tarnish their high-priced reputations -- and worse, they may discover that their products are too stylized to sell well to a mass audience. The bulk of HSN's audience is women over 40 years old, with an average annual income of $61,000. But in these tough economic times, Mr. [Mark Rios] and others say HSN is worth a chance because it gives their products instant visibility in millions of households world-wide. It's a way "to cut down on overhead and conserve resources" even if his early efforts haven't been stellar, Mr. Rios says.  His sales improved the second time but still fell short of HSN's targets, and he isn't scheduled to reappear anytime soon. A buyer told him that the products might be too stylish for the network's current customer base, though an HSN spokesman says the network may invite Mr. Rios back in the future as part of an attempt to attract such customers.
