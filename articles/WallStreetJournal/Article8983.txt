 Polo Magazine Gets a Whipping From Lauren in Trademark Case   By By Wendy Bounds, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1998  A U.S. magistrate in Houston issued the preliminary injuction against closely held Westchester Media of Dallas, publisher of Polo magazine, a 23-year-old title that last year transformed itself into an upscale "lifestyle" magazine, leading Polo Ralph Lauren to allege trademark infringement.  The order concluded: "There is a concerted effort to replace the audience of the old Polo magazine and to appeal to readers who have no special affinity to, or interest in, equestrian sports." Moreover, "from the context of the targeted audience and advertising media . . . there is a likelihood that (Polo Ralph Lauren's) products and services will be associated, in error, with the new Polo magazine."  While the judge stopped short of such a bold measure, the ruling is strongly worded in Polo Ralph Lauren's favor, arguing that Westchester attempted to capitalize on consumer familiarity with the Polo Ralph Lauren name. Westchester bought Polo magazine from Ami Shinitzky last year and overhauled the content and marketing. While the magazine once promoted primarily horse bandages and saddle softener, it now touts Escada and Cartier. Moreover, the magazine has launched a direct-marketing venture with pricey retailer Neiman Marcus -- which also sells Polo Ralph Lauren apparel.
