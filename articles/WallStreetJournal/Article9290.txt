 Johnnie Walker Targets a Younger Market   By By Shelly Branch, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2001  Given new media's seemingly endless permutations, more marketers are tempted to experiment with offbeat ways to refashion their brands. Yet it remains to be seen whether old-line icons like Johnnie Walker can use a dry, productless Web site to inspire hipsters to drink Scotch, or if typically cynical twenty-somethings will swallow the idea that Johnnie Walker's main goal here is "to help people progress in their careers," as Mr. [Michael Stoner] puts it.  To pre-empt any backlash from bartenders or wholesalers regarding its unusual campaign, Johnnie Walker has run a parallel ad in the trade press. That spot shows a bottle of the product, as well as a drink of the Scotch on ice, and reads: "Ignore this." The ad text goes on to explain that if young people really cared about bottle photos and 120-year-old traditions, then "the Scotch category would be in a very different place."  Indeed, Scotch whisky sales have been declining in the U.S. for the past decade. Johnnie Walker -- despite its current thirst for younger drinkers -- has risen above the pack with one of its premier lines. According to Impact Databank, retail sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label were up 5.2% in 1999; 2000 figures aren't yet available. Sales of Johnnie Walker Red, a less-expensive brand, fell 1.4% in 1999. By comparison, leading Scotch brand Dewar's, owned by Bacardi-Martini USA, saw sales inch up 0.7% in 1999.
