 FCC Head Plans End to Staffers' Freebies   By Dreazen, Yochi J, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2003  "In this town, perception often becomes reality, so I sincerely believe it would be in the best interest of the FCC" if staffers no longer went on industry-paid junkets, Mr. [Frank Wolf] wrote. The lawmaker added that staffers at the Securities and Exchange Commission are barred from accepting similar trips.  In a response sent to Mr. Wolf last month but only released yesterday, Mr. [Michael Powell] said that staffers there had acted ethically, but he conceded that "travel paid for by entities that we directly regulate can create an in appearance of impropriety." He said he would ask Congress for a $500,000 increase in the FCC's fiscal year 2005 budget so the agency could "largely eliminate" such trips.
