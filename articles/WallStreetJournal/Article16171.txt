 Stock Analysis: CSFB Takes Top Spot in Stock-Pickers Survey   By By Susanne Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2002  CSFB, once heavily weighted in technology stocks, reduced its exposure to the sector in the third quarter of 2001 and continues to reap the rewards of that decision. Its portfolio advanced 9.7% in the first quarter, thanks in part to oil-services firm Weatherford International Inc., which gained 40.2% in the period and was the survey's top performing stock. CSFB placed fifth and sixth, respectively, in the 12-month and five-year results.  Although firms at the top of the list remained cool on tech, others continued to stick with the sector, despite continued losses. WorldCom Inc. dragged down the performances of a few firms, notably Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rauscher, Edward Jones, US Bancorp's US Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney. Edward Jones was the only one of the group that removed the stock market laggard from its portfolio in the quarter, which helped mitigate its losses on the firm.  A Piper strategist was not available for comment. A spokeswoman said the portfolio has an investing time horizon of between 12 and 18 months and the company isn't focused on quarterly performance. She added that Piper's portfolio emphasizes macro trends, which can skew performance in the near term. The quarter-to-quarter results "appear to be feast or famine as sectors rotate in or out of favor," she said.
