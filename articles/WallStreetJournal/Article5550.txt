 OK, but Please: No Tiptoeing Through Tulips   By By Mary Flood, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1997  Just call the National Wildflower Center in Austin and hope you're put on hold. Callers lucky enough to have to wait are serenaded by pro-flower jingles that have become some of the biggest hits not on the charts in Texas.  Cowboy yodeler Don Walser, backed by a fiddle, warbles, "Though some of us are thistles and prairie roses too, we're no shrinking violets that wilt beneath your shoe." The ballad by bluesman Johnny Nicholas includes, "I'm a wildflower, baby. I got deep dirty roots and pretty blossoms hanging off my arms."
