 A Leader Who Got Real   By O'Grady, Mary Anastasia, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2006  Mr. [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] was born in Rio in 1931 into "a perfect upper-middle- class existence" that included a French tutor and a father who "distrusted big business, financial markets or any kind of profiteering, as he believed that money corrupted people." Having been thus "educated" at home, the young Mr. Cardoso took up sociology at the University of Sao Paulo, doing field work in the city slums. As he trudged through "seas of mud" in a white lab coat, he and his classmates -- "perhaps more interested in being socialists than sociologists" -- were appalled at the legacy of Brazilian slavery.  He made little progress in understanding the "mystery" of Brazilian poverty. In 1967 he published "Dependency and Development in Latin America," a book that he calls his "finest academic work." Fans of political polemic may recall that it was named by the authors of "The Perfect Latin American Idiot" (1999) -- a critique of statist and socialist thinking -- as one of the region's top-10 idiot-producing works.  Given Mr. Cardoso's intellectual background, it's not surprising to find him hard-pressed, in these pages, to condemn the region's leftist repression. Of Fidel Castro he writes: "I was always surprised by how polite, curious, good-humored and soft-spoken he could be." Still, Mr. Cardoso mentions a telling moment at a 1999 summit meeting in Havana. When the heads of state were alone at a luncheon, one said to Castro: "Damn it Fidel! What are you going to do about this lousy, piece-of- **** island of yours? We're sick of apologizing for you all the time, Fidel. It's getting embarrassing."
