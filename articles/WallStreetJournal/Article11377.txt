 Davis, Citicorp Corporate Finance Head, Steps Down   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  Citicorp's head of North American corporate finance, George L. Davis, resigned in what appears to be the first fallout from a shuffling of top officers in January.  Mr. Davis, 55 years old, couldn't be reached for comment. However, a memo from Chairman John S. Reed to policy committee members said that "the business has changed considerably from that envisioned in 1987," when Mr. Davis rejoined the large banking company. Mr. Reed's memo added, "George feels that he can make a greater contribution elsewhere."  Mr. Davis's resignation, Citicorp executives said, isn't related to the bank's rising levels of problem loans for corporate takeovers and commercial real estate, two troubled areas that Mr. Davis oversaw.
