 Web-Video Spots Present Dilemma For Advertisers   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  What he doesn't enjoy: Having to sit through "pre-rolls," the commercials that precede many Web videos. "It's really annoying to have to wait 10 to 20 seconds to see a commercial when you are trying to get away from that by not watching TV," Mr. [Abelsky] says. Some Web video sites, such as YouTube and Google, are mindful of consumers like Mr. Abelsky. Neither runs pre-roll advertising. But that isn't the case at many other popular Web outfits, including Yahoo, AOL, MSN and MTV's Overdrive, where pre-roll ads are plentiful.  "Over time, users might choose to go to sites which don't have these kinds of ads," says Gokul Rajaram, a director of product management at Google. The search giant decided to eschew pre-rolls after discussions with advertisers and online publishers about the potential for pre- roll ads to drive viewers elsewhere, he says. Google doesn't yet sell video ads on Google Video, but it has tested "post-roll" spots that run at the end of a video.
