 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2006  Fierce fighting with Hezbollah and, Israeli TV claimed, some Iranian Revolutionary Guard members, killed 15 Israeli soldiers and wounded 38. Despite U.S. warnings against escalating the conflict, Israel's security cabinet voted to feed more forces into the battle and widen a buffer zone, but will hold off briefly in a bid to spur faltering U.N. talks on a peacekeeping force. Hezbollah's chief, Nasrallah, went on TV to taunt Israel, saying southern Lebanon will be its army's "graveyard," and warned Israeli Arabs to get out of Haifa to escape a rocket barrage. But he also endorsed deploying Lebanon's army in his territory if Israel leaves first.  Iraq fighting killed three U.S. soldiers, and two others are missing in an Anbar helicopter crash. Sectarian violence showed no letup as an Iraqi health official reported 1,500 violent deaths last month in the Baghdad vicinity alone. U.S. troops caught four men believed to be the kidnappers of reporter Jill Carroll. She was apparently held within sight of a U.S. base.
