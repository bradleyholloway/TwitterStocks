 Access Health Sees Drop in Net In Its 4th Period   By By Charles McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1992  RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. -- Access Health Marketing Inc. expects to report that net income for the fiscal fourth quarter eased about 1% to $320,000, despite strong revenue growth, said Kenneth B. Plumlee, president and chief executive.  Mr. Plumlee said in an interview that earnings were squeezed by heavy costs associated with new products, and that the slight profit drop masked an otherwise strong quarter and fiscal year for the provider of consumer health care information and referral services.  The latest quarter's net equates to five cents a share. Mr. Plumlee said revenue for the quarter jumped 23% to $3.2 million from $2.6 million last year. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company earned $324,000, or seven cents a share. Access Health had about 6.2 million shares outstanding in the quarter, compared with 4.8 million a year earlier.
