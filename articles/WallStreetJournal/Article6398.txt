 Bird Flu Jumped From Person To Person in Dutch Outbreak   By Chase, Marilyn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2005  Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota who is writing a book on avian flu, said that adding the Dutch findings to the Asian flu situation suggests "the perfect storm is right ahead of us."  "Look at the big picture, all the different factors," Dr. [Anthony Fauci] said. A widespread bird flu, a jump to humans, and now person-to- person spread are "cumulative probability factors" for pandemic, he said. "When all that happens within a highly virulent strain, you've got a problem."
