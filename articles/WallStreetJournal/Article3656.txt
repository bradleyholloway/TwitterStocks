 Updates on War Push and Pull Stocks --- Volatile Trading Ends With a Modest Gain, Dow's Seventh Straight   By By Craig Karmin and Kate Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  With analysts still cautioning that the U.S. economy remains sluggish, many traders were betting that the so-called war rally may be their best opportunity of the year for big gains. And once the guns fall silent, there is a fear that the rally may fade as well. "Nobody wants to be short right now," Mr. [Todd Leone] said. "When there is a decisive victory, you will probably see a spike, and that could be the top."  The market got off to a tough start, as the Dow industrials plunged nearly 135 points in morning activity in what traders described as a lack of clarity about how the U.S. was faring in Iraq a day into the strikes. Some also pointed to President Bush's speech the previous night, when he warned Americans that the war may be "longer and harder" than some people have predicted.  Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.76%, or 0.74 point, to 98.63.
