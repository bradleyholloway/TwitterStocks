 Credit Ratings   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1995  CONSECO Inc. (Carmel, Ind.) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the credit ratings of this insurance holding company, and its affiliates, citing concerns about the company's high leverage after its recent merger with CCP Insurance Inc. The ratings concern said the downgrades, which affect $900 million in debt, reflect Conseco's "constantly shifting mix of business as a result of its aggressive acquisition and divestiture strategies." Last week, Conseco said it completed its merger with CCP Insurance for $23.25 a share in cash, with Conseco being the surviving corporation.
