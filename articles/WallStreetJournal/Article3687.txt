 Review / Books: Merger From Hell   By By L. Gordon Crovitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 20, 2003  Mr. [Alec Klein] finds few heroes. He reminds us that serial entrepreneur William von Meister, not [Steve Case], founded the online service that became AOL but goes too far in dismissing Mr. Case as a former Pizza Hut taste researcher who succeeded at AOL because he was "plodding, methodical, relentless." It was Mr. Case, after all, who turned Control Video -- a startup that delivered games to Atari devices over phone lines 20 years ago -- into AOL's helping hand, bringing tens of millions of people onto the Web. At AOL, Mr. Case prevailed against entrenched competitors CompuServe and Prodigy. He was confident people would flock to the Web if it were easy, and AOL's marketing genius included distributing millions of free-trial AOL discs in everything from magazines to packaged frozen steaks.  AOL did much to stimulate interest in the Web, but its all-elbows business practices also helped strangle the goose laying the golden eggs. Mr. Klein notes that AOL had a goal of extracting, in advertising fees, at least half of the venture-capital funding of the dot-coms with which it did business, leaving them starved of operating capital. At the end of one especially tough quarter, AOL executives forced Spanish-language ads onto the AOL home page so that they could bill the advertisers for page impressions.  What's next for AOL Time Warner? Mr. Klein's account ends just as Mr. Case resigns as chairman, but now the operating units are again focused on their own customers and bottom lines. AOL has a veteran media and online executive, Jonathan Miller, as its CEO. It must get past investigations into its earlier accounting procedures, and it somehow needs to convert its dial-up AOL customers into broadband users. Still, we should recall the traditional resilience of strong brands, whether those of Time Inc. magazines, Warner Bros. studios -- or AOL.
