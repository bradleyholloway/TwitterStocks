 Dollar Advances Against the Yen, Also Tops Mark   By By Betty W. Liu, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1996  The yen ended lower against the dollar and the mark in global trading yesterday, as traders reacted to a narrower-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and hedged their bets on the next German interest-rate move.  Early in New York, traders sold the yen against its U.S. and German counterparts on news that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected to a seasonally adjusted $8.11 billion in June. Analysts had expected the figure to be $9.6 billion.  Late in New York, the dollar was at 1.4886 marks, up from 1.4875 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency also was at 108.40 yen, up from 107.84 yen. Sterling rose to $1.5480 from $1.5456. The mark was at 72.82 yen, up from 72.50 yen Monday. About noon Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 1.4878 marks and at 108.40 yen.
