 Boom Town -- Now Poised to Challenge AOL Online: MSN --- After Many Attempts, Microsoft Tries Again for a Leg Up In Consumer Web Services   By By Kara Swisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2000  For one thing, the number of truly powerful portals has declined precipitously over the last year (Hasta la vista, AltaVista!; Going, going, gone, Go!; Snip, Snap!). The central destination points for consumers on the Web have narrowed down to three: AOL, Yahoo! and Microsoft. And because Yahoo!, popular as it is, has no monthly subscriber relationship with its users, it's up to MSN to provide the most aggressive competition to AOL.  He ticked off a number of recent initiatives the company has used to spur momentum: a $150 million global-marketing campaign; another attempt to distribute software, this time integrating MSN and its Explorer browser in an AOL-like package; and a commitment from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to place MSN in the wide-ranging Microsoft.NET effort to create new Web services.  It helps that MSN now falls into a newly formed division called Personal Service and Devices headed by Rick Belluzzo, a former Silicon Valley executive whose leadership of the interactive-services businesses has proved a much-needed steadying influence at MSN. Because he had little online experience, the appointment of Mr. Belluzzo last year was seen by executives at AOL and Yahoo! as a sign that Microsoft had little interest left in competing in the consumer Internet space.
