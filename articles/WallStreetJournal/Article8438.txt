 Taiwan Curbs Foreign Role In Stock Market --- Central Bank Is Concerned Over Currency's Climb; Move Is Shift in Policy   By By Jeremy Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1994  TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's central bank, concerned about the recent appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, is slowing the flow of foreign capital into the country's booming stock market.  It is a policy shift that won't sit well with foreign investors, who are eager to get a piece of the Taiwan stock market's skyrocketing rally. On Wednesday -- the first trading day of 1994 -- the market's weighted index shot up 346.28 points, or 5.7%, to 6416.84. Trading slowed Thursday, with the Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Index up 37.68 points to close at 6454.52, the highest level since June 7, 1990.  Just two months ago, the central bank opened the floodgates and allowed overseas institutional investors unprecedented access to the market. Since early November, regulators here have authorized about US$1.6 billion of planned investments of foreign capital in Taiwanese securities. That money has helped spur the current rally, which has boosted share prices 60% in the past two months.
