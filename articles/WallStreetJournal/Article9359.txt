 Unilever and P&G Reach Settlement In Espionage Case   By By Emily Nelson and Sarah Ellison, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2001  The companies declined to disclose terms. P&G is expected to pay Unilever about $10 million as part of the agreement. Both consumer-products makers said the settlement protects their business interests and ends the matter. P&G promised in a statement that "none of the information has been or will be used in any P&G plans."  The settlement ends negotiations that started in April after P&G revealed to Unilever that competitor-intelligence contractors it had hired had taken improper steps in spying on the Anglo-Dutch company's hair-care division. The agents, in addition to searching garbage Dumpsters outside Unilever's Chicago offices, allegedly misrepresented themselves to obtain information. The talks dragged on in an effort to determine exactly what kind of information P&G obtained and what kind of resolution would be satisfactory to both companies.
