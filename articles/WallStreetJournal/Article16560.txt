 MarketWatch: P/Es Show the Bubble's Not in Stocks   By Farrell, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2005  For the moment, let's ignore the housing bubble and take a full- color snapshot of the stock market through the lens of equity mutual funds. Let's compare today's stock market with the disaster-waiting- to-happen in early 2000.  Yes, it's still higher than the historic broad-market P/E of 17, but nothing like in 2000 when it was more than double the historic average. Returns also dropped from a heady 21.1% to 12.4%, much closer to long-term returns in the 11% range. Overall, this is an indication of market health, not a signal that we're at the edge of a precipice.  -- Individual categories. Just five years ago, growth-stock funds generated annual returns of 38% to 59%. P/E ratios were between 35.5 and 43 times earnings, more than twice the long-term market average. Although still somewhat high, growth returns and P/E ratios have pulled way back, while the midcaps and small-caps are now closer to historical ranges.
