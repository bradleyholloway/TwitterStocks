 Anti-Wrinkle Cream Gives Maker's Sales A Rosy Complexion --- Johnson & Johnson Deluged By Retin-A Orders After Report in AMA Journal   By By Ann Hagedorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1988  Johnson & Johnson's Fountain of Youth -- its Retin-A anti-wrinkle cream -- appears to be overflowing.  First-quarter sales already have exceeded expectations for all of 1988, industry analysts say. Larry Feinberg of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said sales of Retin-A will be $50 million to $60 million in the first quarter -- his original estimate for the full year. As a result, he raised his 1988 sales projections to between $180 million and $200 million.  Last year, sales were just $38 million for Retin-A, a Vitamin A compound approved for treating acne, yet effective as an anti-wrinkle agent.
