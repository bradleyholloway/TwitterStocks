 Travel: Some air-fare sales are no sales at all   By Hirsch, James S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1995  Critics say discount fares advertised by many airlines are deceptive, since the discounts are based on the price of the airlines' standard 14-day advance-purchase tickets. Because this standard fare is actually higher than many other special fares available to travelers, the announced sale may be either overstated or nonexistent on some routes.
