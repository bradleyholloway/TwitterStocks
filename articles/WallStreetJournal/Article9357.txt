 Some Illegal Immigrants Get to Pay In-State Tuition at State Colleges --- Charging Lower Resident Fee Could Entice More to Attend; Opponents Say It Flouts Law   By By Russell Contreras, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2001  This week, as Mexican President Vicente Fox makes a state visit to the White House, President Bush has been weighing the possibility of offering temporary work permits to millions of illegal Mexican immigrants in the U.S., opening the door for some to apply for permanent resident status. The move is part of a debate about what government benefits should be given to such immigrants. (A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision established the obligation of communities to educate illegal immigrants through 12th grade.)  Opponents say illegal immigrants have no right to be in the U.S. in the first place and shouldn't expect taxpayers to fund their college education. "There are fewer college seats and the average America family is struggling with rising tuition," says Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. If states offer in-state tuition to such students, "without a doubt, more illegal immigrants will come and try to get into our colleges," says Barbara Coe, chairwoman of the California Coalition of Immigration Reform.  In California, the state with the most illegal immigrants, Gov. Gray Davis last year vetoed a bill extending in-state tuition to undocumented students, citing an annual cost of $64 million. The Democratic governor said California would have been required to give residents of other states the same discount, due to a clause in a 1996 immigration law that says if undocumented immigrants are given benefits based on residency, such benefits must be extended to all U.S. citizens.
