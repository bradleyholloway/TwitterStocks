 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2004  The president, campaigning in Missouri in a forceful defense of his economic prescriptions as the best possible, warned that Democrats will try to use deficits as a club to avert making his tax cuts permanent, but that such reasoning just masks their big-government incorrigibility.

Two U.S. soldiers died defusing explosives. Kuwait wants its own Halliburton inquiry.  Powell insists Pakistan dismantle an atomic-weapons trading network "by the roots" as Islamabad denied a military plane had delivered nuclear equipment to North Korea. It also contends al Qaeda wasn't given secrets.
