 Big New York utilities propose spot market for electricity supply   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1995  Eight of New York state's largest public utilities are planning to submit a joint proposal calling for, among other things, the creation of a spot market for the supply of wholesale electricity. The proposal would continue regulation of electricity distribution to residential and commercial customers but would allow the utilities to buy energy from a pool supplied by independent power producers and marketers and the state's other utilities.
