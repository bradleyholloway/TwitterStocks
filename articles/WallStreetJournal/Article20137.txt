 Order Without Law Now Pervades Gaza Under Hamas Rule; As Families Crowd Beaches, Some Say Calm Won't Last; Prisoners Clamor for Judges   By Simpson, Cam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  Gazans are grateful for this peace, but many remain uneasy over what could come next. "I have a feeling it's going to be even worse than before. And it's not just me. Everyone has this feeling," says Ramadan Malaha, a tanned 41-year-old in a white, Nike T-shirt who rents 100 water pipes and sells food to beachgoers from his Sunset Cafe. Still, Mr. Malaha acknowledges he's breathing easier for now. "You don't see guns on the beach anymore."  Even though his Fatah movement, founded by Yasser Arafat, lost the balloting, Mr. [Mahmoud Abbas] had refused to cooperate with the Islamists. Anarchy resulted, as most of Mr. Abbas's security forces refused to report for duty under Hamas. Some of those who did work clashed violently with the new Executive Force. The Bush administration and Europeans, both of which backed the elections but then boycotted Hamas when it won, supported Mr. Abbas's efforts to shun Hamas. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Europe.  A global boycott of Hamas remains, meaning that the Islamists have little to offer the people of Gaza beyond their security crackdown. So they're moving forward with haste. "Our theory," says Mr. [Abu Hammam], a bearish man with a bushy beard and blue eyes, "is that when criminals get away with their crimes, they repeat them. So we're sending the message, 'You won't get away with it.'" On Gaza's streets, his edict translates into near-constant displays of overwhelming force.
