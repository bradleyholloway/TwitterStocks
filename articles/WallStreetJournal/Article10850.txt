 Film: Woody Discovers There's No Place Like Home   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1986  At two separate screenings of Woody Allen's new movie, "Hannah and Her Sisters," I heard people around me say with satisfaction: "Now this is a real movie." One reason they said this, I think, is that unlike most of Mr. Allen's work, "Hannah" ends without ambivalence. Life has meaning, the one we've been taught by the movies. No matter what the divorce statistics say, love, marriage and family will bring the happy-ever-after.  "Hannah" is scored like a complicated piece of music, with each movement spinning off a basic theme. (I am not speaking metaphorically. Mr. Allen literally directs the movie as a series of movements. New scenes are introduced by intertitles and dramatic shifts in music to herald the appearance of a new character.)  For example, there is Hannah's sister Holly (Dianne Wiest). She's the flibbertigibbet coke-head who takes on the part of the lovable neurotic that Diane Keaton used to play in Mr. Allen's movies (she even dresses in Keatonesque anti-fashion fashion). Mr. Allen himself plays Mickey, Hannah's hypochondriacal first husband, who is given the job of wrestling with Mr. Allen's familiar dybbuks. And Max Von Sydow is Frederick, the artist as an older man, the lover Lee leaves for Elliot. Irascible and high-minded, he's the only character in the movie with genuine intuition. When Lee comes home all skittish from her first rendezvous with Elliot, Frederick looks closely at her face and shouts: "Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?"
