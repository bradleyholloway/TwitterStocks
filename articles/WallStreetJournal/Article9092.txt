 Belgrade's Papers Are Filled With Broadsides Aimed at Milosevic in Wake of Kosovo Accord   By By Robert Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  In the past four days since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted a deal allowing NATO troops into Kosovo, newspaper columns have exploded with interviews with opposition leaders, attacking the government and demanding new elections and an end to martial law.  Vladan Batic, head of Serbia's Christian Democratic Party and the coordinator of a bloc of opposition parties, the Opposition Alliance, made an unexpected appearance in Sunday's Blic newspaper calling for a new deal in Serbia, including fresh elections.  But it already appears that the martial law declared 10 weeks ago at the start of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's bombing campaign has started to give way. The war with NATO over Belgrade's policy of ethnic intolerance in Kosovo provided Mr. Milosevic with an opportunity to crack down on Belgrade's lively media. Independent broadcasters, like Belgrade's popular Radio B92, were taken over by the state and broadcast only pro-government, anti-NATO propaganda. Others were shut down. Newspapers were heavily censored, excising any critical comments of the regime or the policies that led the country into war.
