 Investors Cheer T-Online's Plan To Take Over Spanish Portal   By By William Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2000  The Ya.com acquisition fills a big gap, leaving the United Kingdom as the only major European market where T-Online is still not present -- though T-Online officials say they are exploring options there. T-Online has acquired Club Internet of France and launched a Web portal in Austria. This year, it plans to launch a Web portal in Switzerland and, together with Ya.com, in Italy.  T-Online will issue 15.25 million new shares, or 1.25% of its capital, and make a cash payment of 100 million euros to Ya.com shareholders. Spanish telecommunications group Jazztel PLC -- Ya.com's controlling shareholder -- will hold nearly 1% of T-Online. A lockup restriction prevents Jazztel from selling its T-Online shares until Oct. 17 without T-Online's consent. After that date it can sell a third of its holding, but cannot sell the remaining two thirds until after Dec. 1.
