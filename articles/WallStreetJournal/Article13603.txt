 The Middle Seat: Fliers Saw Longer Delays in 2008   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2009  Flights arrived on time at a slightly higher rate last year, a result of a 7% reduction in the number of U.S. airline flights jamming airports and airways and better performance from a few airlines, notably US Airways Group Inc. Last year, 75.4% of U.S. passenger airline flights arrived on time, according to FlightStats, up from 73.5% in 2007. In 2007, US Airways ranked near the bottom among the 10 largest airlines in on-time performance, but the airline rallied its work force to focus on on-time flights, reworked schedules and spent some $50 million to upgrade equipment, fix computer problems, hire more operations management, fill open mechanics spots and fix lingering problems left from its merger with America West Airlines.
