 Allegheny Beverage Posts $2.4 Million Loss For Fiscal 1st Quarter   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1986  CHEVERLY, Md. -- Allegheny Beverage Corp. posted a net loss of $2.4 million for its fiscal first quarter ended June 28, reflecting depressed sales, high operating costs and interest expense from an acquisition.  Allegheny said the loss includes a write-down of $709,000 from a long-term investment in a health-care related company. Retail office furniture and building maintenance subsidiaries both reported losses as well.  Revenue for the quarter increased 34%, to $301.5 million from $225.3 million for the year-earlier quarter. Allegheny said the higher revenue is because of results of Servomation Corp., which it acquired in May 1985.
