 A Special News Report About Life On the Job-and Trends Taking Shape There   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  Employers say it's best not to deal with them. Sears, Roebuck & Co., Nike Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. say they don't pay attention. "It could be seen as an endorsement," says Grant Jones, a spokesman for Micron Technology Inc., which discourages employees from posting. Issues could also become public. Agency.com, an Internet concern, posted a response to gripes on Vault.com, and the posting led to coverage in several newspapers, including this one. A spokeswoman says the company won't respond to public message boards again. Mr. [Mark Oldman] thinks companies likely read them anyway.  The Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees mostly prevailed in recent NLRB cases against two companies, but the union isn't cheering. The union's complaints against Parts Depot Inc., a Roanoke, Va., auto-parts concern, involve events from 1994, making the NLRB's order that the company must bargain with the unit less likely to be upheld on appeal. In the union's case against Jonbil Inc., a Chase City, Va., jeans maker, the company folded three years ago. "It's a real frustration," says David Sailer, a union director.  The NLRB concedes budget problems, vacancies and turnover led to a backlog of about 400 old cases, though it says the backlog has been reduced substantially. Meanwhile, the union blames delaying tactics while employees come and go. "Employers are seeing that delaying a result is the same as winning," says Brent Garren, a Unite attorney. Attorneys for the two companies point the finger at heavy union litigation. Herbert Winkler, Jonbil's former chief executive, calls the issue moot.
