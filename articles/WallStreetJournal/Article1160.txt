 PURSUITS; Leisure & Arts -- Sightings: Short Is Good; The concise joys of condensed books -- and the virtues of brevity   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2007  New York -- ORION BOOKS, one of England's top publishing houses, has just brought out the first six titles in a series of abridged versions of such classic novels as "Anna Karenina," "Moby-Dick" and "Vanity Fair." The covers of these paperbacks, which have been shortened by as much as 40%, bill their contents as "Compact Editions." "'David Copperfield' in Half the Time," as one entry promises. Malcolm Edwards, the series' publisher, told a Times of London reporter that "many regular readers think of the classics as long, slow and, to be frank, boring."  I haven't seen any of Orion's Compact Editions -- they'll be published in the U.S. starting in August -- but I'm not inclined to be snippy about them, because it happens that I grew up reading abridged novels, an experience that did me no harm whatsoever. My parents were among the many Americans who subscribed to Reader's Digest Condensed Books, a once-popular series of volumes published between 1950 and 1997 that offered its readers abridged versions of such popular novels as "Advise and Consent" and "The Caine Mutiny." Like Orion's Compact Editions, Condensed Books came in for a fair amount of teasing. Betty Comden and Adolph Green, for instance, wrote a very funny song in which they speculated on how the Digest's editors might have summed up "Gone With the Wind": "Scarlett O'Hara's a spoiled pet/She wants everything that she can get/The one thing she can't get is Rhett/The end."
