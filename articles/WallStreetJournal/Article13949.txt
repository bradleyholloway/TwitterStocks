 Rock & Pop Music: M83 Emerges With a Sound All Its Own   By Fusilli, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2011  Over the course of 22 tracks on his new album, "Hurry Up, We're Dreaming" (Mute), Anthony Gonzalez, who performs as M83, unleashes a rollercoaster ride of glossy power rock, whirring electronica and moody folk-based ballads.
