 AIDS Panel Says 4 'Critical' Areas Need Fast Action   By By Michel McQueen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1987  A panel appointed by President Reagan to advise him about AIDS identified four "critical" areas on which it will make recommendations by February, earlier than a report was due.  Retired Adm. James Watkins, head of the 13-member commission, said the four areas are: a shortage of information about the prevalence of the AIDS virus in the population; the need for home health care and other out-of-hospital care for AIDS patients; the concern that there are too few drugs available to treat AIDS patients and carriers of the virus; and the lack of programs to treat intravenous drug abusers, who constitute an increasingly large percentage of the victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  The commission has been embroiled in internal disputes, including the resignation of its first chairman, and has been criticized by civil rights and gay advocacy groups. These groups have said some of the panel's members lack experience with AIDS-related issues and it doesn't include representatives of groups most affected by the disease.
