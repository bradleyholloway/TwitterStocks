 Digital-Music Officials Criticize Subscription Prices   By Smith, Ethan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2006  The concern is that, when selling their music to subscription services, music labels engage in what may amount to a passive form of collusion, resulting from their use of "most favored nation status" clauses, as they are known in the trade. Unlike downloading services -- in which labels sell songs to retailers for a set wholesale price -- the prices charged to subscription services are derived from complex licensing agreements. The most-favored-nation clauses, or MFNs, seek to ensure that if a rival label negotiates better deal terms, the label with most-favored-nation status gets the same terms. Critics say that, because all of the major labels have sought or secured such clauses from subscription-music services, the result is anticompetitive.  "Seller-side MFNs are inherently price-increasing and anticompetitive," says Jonathan Potter, executive director of the Digital Media Association, a trade organization whose members include Apple, Yahoo, Time Warner Inc.'s AOL, Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, RealNetworks, Napster, Viacom Inc.'s MTV, and MusicNet Inc.  Many music-service executives have questioned the legality of such contractual provisions and generally fight to keep it out of final agreements. "Antitrust enforcers seem to recognize most-favored nation as a red flag," says Albert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, an independent think tank. "Not to say it's inherently illegal, but you'd want to take a closer look at how it works and what the effects are."
