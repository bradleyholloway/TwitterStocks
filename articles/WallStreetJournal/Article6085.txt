 Kmart Reacts to Anonymous Letters   By By Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2002  Some of the letters claim that in the weeks and months before Kmart sought bankruptcy protection in January, Kmart executives told finance-department employees to deviate from standard accounting practices and also made "misleading and deceptive" statements to the public, according to the Detroit News, which says it has obtained copies of several letters.  Kmart has declined to comment on details of the letters. But the allegations have been credible enough to spark separate investigations by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, not to mention a group of internal Kmart sleuths, the company has said. Mr. [James B. Adamson] wrote that Kmart has provided "letters, as well as numerous other documents," to the outside inquiries.  Mr. Adamson also wrote that the company's investigation has revealed "the need to re-emphasize to everyone in the Kmart organization the importance of abiding strictly by the Code of Conduct." This week, all Kmart employees must attend training sessions about the company's ethics code, which covers such issues as accounting practices and conflicts of interest.
