 Update on Small Business: Online Lenders to Announce They Will Become Partners   By By Joshua Harris Prager, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2000  PrimeStreet, an online small-business loan brokerage firm, and LendingTree Inc., an online consumer-loan brokerage company, will announce today that they are becoming partners.  The online lenders will refer customers to each other via a point-and-click link on their Web sites, allowing PrimeStreet to act as the small-business arm of the LendingTree site and vice versa. The alliance makes sense, says Doug Lebda, the founder and chief executive officer of LendingTree, because the two companies have identical business models. Both use credit scoring to assess loan applications and pair prospective borrowers with lenders in exchange for a broker fee.  Just ask Doug Galen. In September, Mr. Galen, vice president of business development at E-Loan Inc., helped the online consumer-loan brokerage firm move into the small-business arena through a partnership with LiveCapital.com (then named LoanWise.com). And so far, the partnership is bearing out his hunch. "The lion's share [of the small-business loans] are the under-$75,000 loans, which really mimic the owner's credit," he says. And so, he adds, the lender's "work-to-return ratio is fantastic."
