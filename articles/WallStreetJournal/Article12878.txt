 El Paso Executive Quits Energy Firm   By By Alexei Barrionuevo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2003  Once the heir-apparent to Chairman and Chief Executive William Wise, Mr. [Ralph Eads III]'s star fell swiftly after the collapse of Enron, the trailblazer in energy trading. In September, one week after a judge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said El Paso withheld natural gas supplies from California in 2000 and 2001, the company promoted H. Brent Austin, the company's chief financial officer, over Mr. Eads, to president and chief operating officer. Within days, Mr. Eads informed top management of his intention to leave El Paso once he had wound down the trading business, according to a person familiar with the matter.  A lawsuit filed by Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., one of El Paso's largest single shareholders, accuses Mr. Eads of encouraging El Paso traders to engage in so-called round-trip, or "wash," trades. The trades, which are essentially mirror-image swaps of the same amount of energy for the same price, are the focus of several federal investigations into a number of energy companies, including El Paso. El Paso has denied conducting wash trades and declined to comment on the lawsuit. Mr. Eads also declined to comment on the lawsuit.
