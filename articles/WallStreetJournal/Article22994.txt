 New Disease Curbs Visits to Toronto Hospitals --- Expectant Mothers Turn To Midwifery for Delivery; Postponing Routine Care   By By Elena Cherney And Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2003  Ms. Miles is among a growing number of Ontario residents who are shunning hospitals and even doctors' offices for fear of contracting SARS, which has killed six people in Toronto. Family doctors in the areas where the outbreak has hit hardest -- Scarborough, east of downtown, and York region, a suburb to the north -- said many patients are skipping routine doctor visits because they are worried about exposure in the waiting room.  "The general public is pretty much spooked by this," says Ian Zatzman, head of family practice at the York Central Hospital, one of the two Toronto-area hospitals where a cluster of cases have led to a near shutdown. Dr. Zatzman's practice, which is off the hospital premises, is "not as busy as usual," with some patients calling to cancel their allergy shots, blood-pressure checks and similar routine visits. "There's no risk" to visiting his office, Dr. Zatzman says, because like health professionals across Toronto, he is wearing a mask, gloves and gown throughout the day and taking other precautions.
