 Systems Center Officer Unloads Stake -- Quietly   By By Alexandra Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1989  Kevin McNerney, chief financial officer of Systems Center Inc., called securities analysts Sept. 7 to calm them about the stock's 8% drop that day. But according to some of those analysts, Mr. McNerney didn't mention that he had sold all his shares in the Reston, Va., software manufacturer two days earlier.  Mr. McNerney is one of six Systems Center insiders who have sold shares since late July, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The insiders, who include the chairman and the senior vice president for customer support and development, sold at prices between $22.50 and $25 a share.  Mr. McNerney said that when the stock began to drop, he took time from the company's regular board meeting to "assure" securities analysts and the firm's largest holders. He said he told Mr. Spalding about his own stock sale and the selling by other insiders; but he said he doesn't know when he told Mr. Spalding and can't recall whether he conveyed the information to other analysts.
