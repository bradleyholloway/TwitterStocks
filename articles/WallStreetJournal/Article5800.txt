 Manager's Journal: Fat Firms Fill Law Partners' Pockets   By By Cameron Stracher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2000  Big. And getting bigger. The recent spate of law firm mergers has made them hefty. Twenty-three hundred lawyers, count 'em, at Baker & Hostetler; 1,200 at Skadden, Arps. And now topping the scales at 3,000: the newly merged trans-Atlantic firm comprised of Britain's Clifford Chance, New York's Rogers & Wells and Germany's Puender, Volhard. The small fry, the firms with mere hundreds, are quaking in their wingtips and searching frantically for dance partners.  There are many reasons to be big. The same firm that handles a client's corporate work can handle its litigation. British clients can make a deal in Germany and use their trusty British counsel. An American client seeking French antitrust advice can turn to its New York law firm. One-stop shopping is the management consultant's mantra. Law firms, like the big accounting firms, are bloating up and consolidating down. The accounting firms, if they have their way, will soon join the law firm acquisition frenzy, eventually leaving us with one global megalith, PricewaterhouseCoopersCliffordchanceRogers & Wells.
