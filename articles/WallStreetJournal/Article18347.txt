 GICs Are Being Dropped from Retirement Plans by Some Major Firms in Favor of Bond Funds   By Pulliam, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1992  Following federal seizure of several large insurers in 1991, some corporations are dropping guaranteed investment contracts (GIC) from investment selections made available to employees for retirement plans.
