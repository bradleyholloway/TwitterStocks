 Saatchi Sets Target Of Profit Margin Of 12% by 2001   By By Charles Goldsmith, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1999  Advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi PLC set a new target to boost its overall profit margin to 12% by the end of 2001, bringing it far closer to the margins enjoyed by its larger rivals.  Saatchi's target, which compares with a margin of just 5.3% back in 1995 and expected 1999 margins of about 10%, was announced as the advertising agency reported first-half operating profits of GBP 13.2 million ($21.2 million), up 21% at constant exchange rates. Pretax profits totaled 13.8 million, compared with 19.6 million in the year-earlier period, which included an 8.2 million gain in 1998 from the sale of a corporate-identity business.
