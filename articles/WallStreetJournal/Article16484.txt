 Krispy Kreme Sinks 15%, but Rayovac Surges 17%   By Baker, Nick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2005  Small-cap stocks eased for the third straight session, burdened by Krispy Kreme Doughnuts' accounting woes and concern about the holiday season for airlines.  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (NYSE) sank $1.83, or 15%, to $10.48. The company will go into default on its credit facility Jan. 14 because questions about its accounting have delayed its financial reports. Krispy Kreme said it plans to restate fiscal 2004 results and other restatements are possible.  Rayovac (NYSE) gained 5.09, or 17%, to 34.65 as traders react to the battery maker's bid to diversify through buying United Industries, a maker of fertilizer, insect repellant and pet supplies, for $1.2 billion.
