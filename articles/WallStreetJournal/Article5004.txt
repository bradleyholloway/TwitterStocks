 Investment Dartboard: Money Manager Wins Her Third in a Row   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1993  Including Mr. Morgan and Ms. Bramwell, four of the 112 professional investors who have participated in the contest have achieved as many as three wins, consecutive or not. The other two are financial publisher Jonathan Steinberg and money manager Remy Fisher.  Led by Ms. Bramwell, a corps of professional stock-pickers handily outperformed a randomly chosen Dartboard Portfolio in the latest contest, which ran from Dec. 7 through the end of May. The pros were up 28% collectively. Stocks chosen by a volley of darts flung at the stock listings rose 6.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.7%.  Attempting to run her streak to four straight, Ms. Bramwell chooses InaCom Corp., a marketer of computer equipment. InaCom has some 1,200 computer centers around the country, but it isn't seeking walk-in consumer traffic. Rather, it serves large corporations, which typically order dozens of computers at a gulp, along with software and service.
