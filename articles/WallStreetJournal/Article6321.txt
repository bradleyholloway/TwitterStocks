 Yahoo, Google and Internet Math; Revenue Is Counted Differently By the Web-Search Powerhouses, Creating Confusion for Investors   By Scott Thurm and Kevin J. Delaney, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2004  A different accounting choice by [Google] has a big effect there. That was Google's decision to reassess the value of stock options it has granted since 2001. In essence, Google said in its filing that it now believes it granted those options, mostly to employees, at lower exercise prices than they were really worth. Last year, for example, Google said it distributed nearly 20 million stock options, at an average exercise price of $2.65 a share. But details in the filing suggest Google now thinks its own stock was valued at roughly $31 a share last year.  Different Ways, Different Means  Google and Yahoo use similar accounting methods for most items on their income statements, but Yahoo counts certain revenue and sales costs that Google excludes. Here's how both companies stack up using each other's methods:  Google's first quarter of 2004 revenue and expenses, in millions  Net Operating and Sales income other expenses costs Total  Using Google's accounting $64 $273 $53 $390 Using Yahoo's accounting $64 $273 $316 $652  Yahoo's first quarter of 2004 revenue and expenses, in millions  Net Operating and Sales income other expenses costs Total  Using Google's accounting $101 $375 $74 $550 Using Yahoo's accounting $101 $375 $282 $758  Source: the companies' SEC filings
