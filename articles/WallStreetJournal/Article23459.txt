 PURSUITS; Sports -- Colleges: Roar Wars: The New Science of Fan Power; To gain an edge, teams give rowdy fans prime seats and shop for louder bleachers   By Adams, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2007  Mr. [Paul Allen] later hired Mr. [James Poulson] to construct Qwest Field in Seattle. In addition to contracting engineers to make sure that the wind and rain would disproportionately hit the visitors' sideline, Mr. Poulson placed the cheapest endzone seats (where, he says, the "crazies" sit) atop steel risers that send thundering noise to the hard surfaces on the overhangs and roof, redirecting it back to the field. The Seahawks are among the NFL's leaders in false-start penalties called against visiting teams.  There are certain lines teams can't cross in their quest for a bigger homefield edge. The NFL, for example, requires that team- generated noise like public-address announcements or piped-in music cease when the visiting team has the ball and the play clock starts. In the NBA, teams can artificially generate noise with music or other sound effects, but it can't exceed 85 decibels during play or 95 decibels when play is stopped. There are no limitations on fan- generated noise.  At other schools, it's more than just musical chairs that's going on. When Oklahoma State University expanded its Gallagher-Iba Arena -- already one of the loudest venues around -- it went overboard to make sure that those deafening noise levels didn't drop. After taking sound readings and measuring reverberation times throughout the building, architect Gary Sparks came up with a strategy: Instead of building the extra 7,300 seats outward, he stacked them on top of the existing seats on a steep slope. He also added a flat ceiling stripped of almost all absorptive materials. The goal was to give every sound wave a direct path to a hard surface that would send it ping-ponging around for as long as four seconds.
