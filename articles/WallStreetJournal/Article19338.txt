 Cool Reception for India's Satellite-TV Rules --- Murdoch's Star, Sony Could Be Thwarted By Curb on Foreigners   By By Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2000  The government's move to allow direct-to-home satellite took the industry by surprise. Four years ago, Star TV, a unit of Mr. [Rupert Murdoch]'s News Corp., had made plans for a British-style subscription-satellite service called ISkyB, only to have India ban direct satellite on national-security grounds. The satellite-TV decision appears aimed at satisfying both Hindu nationalists in Mr. [Atal Bihari Vajpayee]'s coalition, and private industry. With India's growth slowing, Mr. Vajpayee's government has been under pressure from international ratings agencies to prove it is moving forward with economic reforms.  To draw subscribers in India, any package would have to include programming from Star, Zee, and Sony Corp.'s TV channel, Sony Entertainment Television, says Rathikant Basu, head of Star TV in India until earlier this year. Star and Zee, former partners, are archrivals. "I don't think Zee would join a Star platform, and I don't think Star would join Zee." One possibility, he said, is that the government's terrestrial-television monopoly will organize a satellite company itself.
