 Consolidation of mutual-fund industry is accelerating, with insurers in control   By McGough, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1994  Two acquisitions by mutual-fund companies are in the works, illustrating the continuing consolidation of the mutual-fund industry. The mutual-fund unit of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co is believed to be close to buying the fund business of another insurance company, Transamerica Corp, for $30 million or more. In a potentially bigger transaction, Liberty Financial Cos, a unit of Liberty Mutual Group, is understood to be in talks to buy Colonial Group Inc, a mutual-fund concern with $14 billion in assets.
