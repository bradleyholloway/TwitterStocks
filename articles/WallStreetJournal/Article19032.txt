 Regulators Stop Oxford Ex-Chairman's Severance   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  New York state's top insurance regulator ordered Oxford Health Plans Inc. to suspend payments to its former chairman Stephen F. Wiggins under the $9 million severance package he was awarded upon his stepping down from the post in late February.  The Norwalk, Conn., company disclosed in its annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week that it had agreed to pay Mr. Wiggins a lump sum of $3.6 million and an additional annual fee of $1.8 million for each of the next three years in payment for his services as a consultant. Mr. Wiggins, who remains a board member, had to give up his post in the wake of a computer-system debacle that led it to report a $291.3 million loss in 1997, wiping out the company's entire cumulative profit since it went public in 1991.  Mr. Levin protested the severance package in a letter to Oxford's recently elected chairman, Fred Nazem. He said he was directed to order a suspension of payments by Gov. George E. Pataki, who had expressed "serious concern" about the amount of the severance and some related perks, including payment of membership dues at a country club.
