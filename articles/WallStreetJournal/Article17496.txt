 Five Issues Launched In Eurobond Market Totaling $950 Million --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1985  The rush of fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds continued, with five issues totaling $950 million launched to take advantage of the narrowing gap between yields on Eurobonds and U.S. Treasury issues.  And late in the day, the World Bank offered $300 million of 10 1/8% bonds due 1995, at a cost of only 10 basis points over the yield on the U.S. Treasury note due May 1995, bankers said. A basis point is 1/100 percentage point.  Two other issues paying at least 10% -- for the State Bank of South Australia and Swiss Bank Corp. -- received warm receptions. But a 10 1/2% offering for Kyowa Bank Ltd. traded outside its full underwriting fees.
