 WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Sizing Up Facebook --- The Biggest IPO in History Could Trip Up Small Investors Who Play it Unwisely; Here's a Guide   By Levisohn, Ben, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2012  The initial public offering, expected on May 18, could value the company at anywhere from $77 billion to $96 billion based on its $28- to $35-a-share price range -- making Facebook the biggest company to go public in U.S. history, according to Dealogic. Skeptics point to worries that the company's rocketing sales and earnings growth is slowing, and say the biggest investment gains for the eight-year-old company already might have been reaped by the founders, venture capitalists and other well-heeled investors who took earlier stakes. [...]of the 33 U.S. companies valued at more than $77 billion, the low end of Facebook's expected valuation, only two, Amazon.com and Bank of America, have price/earnings multiples above 100 -- and in BofA's case the P/E ratio is high mainly because earnings have been weak.
