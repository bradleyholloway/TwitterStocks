 California Asks FTC to Reject Grocery Merger   By By Peter Waldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1988  California's attorney general asked the Federal Trade Commission to reject American Stores Co.'s acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc., citing possible anti-competitive effects.  Specifically, Mr. Van de Kamp said the American Stores-Lucky merger, in combination with Vons Cos.' recent $410 million proposed acquisition of Safeway Stores Inc.'s 172 supermarkets in Southern California, would create a "duopoly" in the state's grocery business. That's because the two mergers effectively reduce competition in Northern and Southern California from four major chains to two -- Vons and American Stores in the South, and Safeway and American Stores in the North, he said.
