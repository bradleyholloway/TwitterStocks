 Taste: The Hard Way Down --- Do you wonder what a crash landing feels like? Wonder no more   By By Charles R. Eisendrath, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 2001  Other news was less welcome. [Julia]'s right leg was clearly broken. But what terrified me was her back, where the worst pain was. I also worried about our younger son's head, in which a tumor near the brain stem sleeps in dormancy. Five years ago, doctors irradiated it and sank a plastic shunt just behind the hair line. Had the crash jarred something loose?  We had gone to Costa Rica on an ocean fishing trip, but my ambulance reveries wafted me far away to fly-fishing waters in northern Michigan and Quebec. When you hook a parent-size trout, there is often a sudden commotion, out of which comes a fish the same size as the one on your line, to swim with it, matching every turn of its struggle. On a later cast, you often catch the second one, which is nearly always of the opposite gender. So it was with us in the jungle: First we five had agitated together in our distress; and then the two of us old ones had traveled in tandem, in an attempt to get Julia to safety.  The Pacific Ocean off Nosara, near where we had fished and crashed, is far too big and deep to notice the intimate goings-on that are visible in trout streams. The scything of a dorsal fin on the surface or a silvery flash are the only signals readable from a boat, yet they are unmistakable and always involve a chain of loss and gain. In the sea, trouble-signals from a hooked fish often advertise vulnerability to predators, and an opportunity for profit. It is not unusual to boat a fish with a piece or two missing, complicating the meaning of freeing it.
