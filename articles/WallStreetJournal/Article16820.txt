 Rydex's Leveraged ETFs; New, Lower-Cost Funds Aim to Lure Investors Away From Rivals With Higher Fees   By Salisbury, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  The Rydex funds, slated to start trading on the American Stock Exchange on Wednesday, will track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the S&P MidCap 400 index and the Russell 2000 index of small companies. The Rydex funds will carry investment costs of 0.7% of assets a year, compared with 0.95% for ProFunds' ETFs. The expense ratios of the ProFunds ETFs are among the highest for any exchange- traded funds.  Both ProFunds and Rydex already peddle traditional mutual funds that offer investors leveraged returns. But, in terms of leveraged ETFs, Rydex has so far ceded the field, allowing ProFunds to get a big head start. Rydex has focused instead on currency and stock ETFs. ProFunds' ProShares leveraged ETFs, the first of which began trading in June 2006, have been a hit, collecting more than $8 billion in assets so far, according to fund researcher Morningstar Inc. ProFunds offers more than 50 ETFs.
