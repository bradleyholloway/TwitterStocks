 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Hidden Danger   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 1990  With the election only days off, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt opened a Democratic assault on the Federal Reserve's independence yesterday by sending Chairman Alan Greenspan a letter in which he "asked" the Fed to provide an "endorsement" of the budget deal with a big monetary easing. The U.S. political economy has arrived at a volatile and potentially dangerous turn in its history.  -- A huge Republican loss in Congress, thereby weakening or even killing the President's ability to have his vetoes sustained.  -- The American economy coming off the relatively strong third quarter and slipping into negative growth in the fourth quarter and start of 1991, while the U.S. financial system teeters amid extremely aggressive regulators and a weakening asset base.
