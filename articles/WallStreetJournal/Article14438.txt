 Renault's Dedeurwaerder Steps Down Following Difficulties 'Readjusting'   By By Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1988  Jose Dedeurwaerder has resigned as director of sales and international affairs of Regie Nationale des Usines Renault following longstanding difficulties the former American Motors Corp. chairman had in "readjusting to the Renault system," company officials said.  The officials said Mr. Dedeurwaerder's resignation was motivated by continuing difficulties in adapting to being part of a management team after being chairman and chief executive officer of AMC from 1982 to 1986. Renault last year sold its 46% stake in AMC to Chrysler Corp.  Mr. Dedeurwaerder, who was unavailable for comment yesterday, will be succeeded by Paul Percie du Sert, Renault's chief financial officer since 1984. Mr. Percie du Sert's place will be filled by Planning Director Louis Schweitzer, but Renault officials say this is an interim nomination.
