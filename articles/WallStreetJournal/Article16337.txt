 Credit Suisse Group Swings to Net Profit, Lifted by Units' Sale   By Mijuk, Goran, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2003  The bank didn't give a specific forecast for 2003 and 2004. Mr. [Philip Ryan] said Credit Suisse would continue to keep a tight grip on costs and wouldn't initiate big cost cuts. The bank also poured cold water on any takeover plans, following comments last month from Mr. [Oswald Grubel], who told the Handelsblatt newspaper that the bank was considering a substantial acquisition in the German retail-banking sector. Mr. Ryan said an acquisition was three to five years away, and would depend on significant structural changes in the German industry beforehand.
