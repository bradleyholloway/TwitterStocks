 O'Connor Suggests Path on Redistricting   By Barrett, Paul M, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1995  Justice O'[Connor] indicated she believes race can be a legitimate consideration in drawing so-called majority-minority districts, as long as the districts are relatively compact and thereby reflect geographic, economic and other nonracial motivations. Even if "these peculiar districts" in Texas were thrown out, she said at one point, the state could draw new, more uniform majority-minority districts as a "means of ensuring racial balance."  As is typical, it was impossible after yesterday's arguments to predict with any confidence how the Supreme Court will resolve the Texas and North Carolina disputes. The justices' questions directed at lawyers -- as well as comments aimed at each other -- did reveal, however, that Justice O'Connor wasn't the only member of the court who appears to be uncomfortable about clarifying the law in this area.  In another decision, issued last June, the court struck down a district in Georgia based on the principle that race ordinarily can't be the "predominant factor" driving legislative draftsmen. Justice O'Connor was a somewhat reluctant fifth vote supporting the Georgia ruling. She wrote a separate concurring opinion emphasizing that the Supreme Court didn't intend its actions to result in scores of districts being invalidated.
