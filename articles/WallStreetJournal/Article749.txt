 Business and Finance [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1986  THE FDIC IS SEEKING broader powers to handle big bank failures. FDIC Chairman Seidman told a Senate panel that some major banks are in trouble and that the agency needs greater authority to prevent a big failure from triggering a crisis. Regulators said most of the troubled banks have substantial energy loans.  Sen. Domenici unveiled a three-year budget plan that would slash Reagan's military buildup and boost taxes $70.3 billion. The proposal is aimed at meeting Gramm-Rudman deficit targets through 1989.  Exxon is slashing capital spending 26% this year due to falling oil prices. U.S. Steel, meanwhile, expects a $260 million charge this quarter because of the dwindling value of its Marathon Oil unit's oil and gas inventories.
