 White House Seeks Copyright Protection For Text, Software Published On-Line   By Cooper, Helene, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1995  "Unless we provide legal protection for intellectual property, customers won't be able to reap the benefits of these new technologies," Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said during a news conference. Mr. Brown said the U.S. must take the lead in protecting intellectual property on such media as the Internet, and exhorted other countries to follow suit.  "This is great news," said Ken Wasch, president of the Software Publishers Association, which represents some 1,200 software publishing companies. "Our greatest fear is that the Internet will become a vehicle of free distribution of information."  "This will really begin to make good on the promise of on-line delivery," said Jonathan Newcomb, chief executive of Paramount Communications Inc.'s Simon & Schuster. Many of the publishing company's textbooks, for example, are available in CD-Rom, he said. "We're not going to provide that on-line without some protection."
