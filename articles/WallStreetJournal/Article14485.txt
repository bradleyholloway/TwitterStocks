 U.K. Investigates Kuwait's 22% Stake In BP, Citing 'Public Interest' Concerns   By By John Marcom Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1988  The British government started an inquiry into Kuwait's 22% holding in British Petroleum Co., citing "public interest" concerns about the Arab oil producer's influence over the world's third-largest oil company.  Analysts predicted the British probably would decide to block further Kuwaiti investment in BP and obtain binding promises that Kuwait won't seek a management role. That would reassure BP and United Kingdom officials, who worry that even a passive Kuwaiti holding could jeopardize the future of Britain's biggest company.  The monopolies panel's task is unusually delicate. The commission, which typically rules on takeovers that raise explicit antitrust problems, faces vague public-interest concerns in this case. BP holds huge oil and natural-gas reserves in the North Sea and is the U.S.'s largest oil producer. Lord Young said Kuwait's oil interests and membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries warranted the investigation. He didn't elaborate.
