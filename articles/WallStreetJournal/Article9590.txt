 EEOC Sees Rise in Intrarace Complaints of Color Bias   By Valbrun, Marjorie, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2003  As the nation becomes more diverse in what EEOC Chairwoman Cari Dominguez calls the "melange millennium," EEOC officials say they are focusing more on color and other "appearance discrimination" complaints. "We have a lot of racial blends, and we're trying to work out a way to determine what kind of adverse employment decisions can occur as a result," Ms. Dominguez says.  Since 1964, federal law has prohibited workplace discrimination "based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin." Many people assume race and color are synonymous and that the victim of discrimination must be of a different race than the alleged discriminator. "Much of it goes unreported because people simply don't know that such a distinction is covered by the law," says Joan Ehrlich, an EEOC district director in San Francisco. She says she is instructing her staff "to more carefully screen and question [complainants] to determine if color played a role in the alleged discrimination."  The pain caused by those insults was dwarfed, he says, by what he endured from other black children, who called him "black-a-boo" (meaning he was so black, he was scary). When he started working at an Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar outside Atlanta in late 2000, the abuse there "made me feel inferior and reverted me all the way back to my childhood and how I felt then," says Mr. [DWIGHT BURCH]. He left work angry and frustrated many nights and dreaded returning each day. "I live in this skin, and it's not easy," he adds.
