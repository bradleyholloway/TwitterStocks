 Hands Off My Industry   By Taurel, Sidney, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2003  Medicine has been transformed by pharmaceutical innovation. We've seen the widespread use of antibiotics, the discovery of agents for cancer, major advances in cardiovascular medicine. We've seen the development of new treatments for depression and the advent of drugs that make organ transplants possible and chemotherapy bearable. Today, we are experiencing the breakthroughs of biotechnology and the consequent surge of new therapeutic proteins. Many organizations and dedicated people have participated in this medical advancement. Importantly, it is the working partnership between government agencies, like the National Institutes of Health, academic institutions, and the pharmaceutical industry that has fueled this progress, bringing to people of all societies the medicines for a healthier and longer life.  I believe support for such legislation is due in large part to our critics' ability to trivialize the role of the pharmaceutical industry in medical innovation. Specifically, they perpetuate the belief that government and academic institutions are solely responsible for the discovery and development of new medicines. Their argument can be refuted by data from government sources. In 2001, Congress asked the NIH for a report of its involvement in all drugs with sales of more than $500 million a year. The NIH reported that 47 prescription drugs met the criteria. Of those, the NIH contributed to the discovery or development of four -- primarily through its program of grants to universities and research institutions. Looking at a broader range of pharmaceuticals, scholars at Tufts examined all 284 new medicines approved in the U.S. in the '90s. They found that 93% originated from the pharmaceutical industry, with 7% split between government and academic or nonprofit sources.
