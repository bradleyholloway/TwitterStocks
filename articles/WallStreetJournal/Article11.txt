 Capital Campaign: Japanese Are Lobbying Hard in U.S. to Offset Big Protectionist Push --- Using American Consultants, And Outspending Others, They Stress Mutual Ties --- A Long Record of Successes   By By Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 23, 1985  Shortly after Sen. John Danforth introduced a bill threatening to increase U.S. tariffs on Japanese telecommunications products, Stanton Anderson, a Washington lawyer, swung into action for his Japanese clients.  But Mr. Anderson and other members of Japan's vast lobbying force here hope to contain that trouble by publicizing the economic ties that bind Japanese and American business. The Japanese Embassy, for instance, has hired Hill & Knowlton Inc., a large public-relations firm, to remind Americans that Japanese companies have invested $14.8 billion in the U.S. and have created more than 100,000 American jobs. "We can't hurt them without hurting ourselves," argues Carl Green, a lawyer for the Japan Machine Tool Builders Associaton. "More of us is them, and more of them is us."  But one thing is sure: The resourceful Japanese lobby has a long record of success. "Japan hasn't lost a battle since Nixon acted against Japanese textiles," says Robert Angel, who used to manage the Japan Economic Institute, a Washington-based research organization sponsored by the Japanese government. "It can buy its way out of any trouble."
