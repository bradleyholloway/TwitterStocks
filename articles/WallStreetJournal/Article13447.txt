 Politics & Economics: Oversight of Blackwater Is Set; State Department Will Track Steps Taken By Security Firm in Iraq   By Neil King Jr. and August Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  Bureau of Diplomatic Security agents typically protect the secretary of state and other top diplomats overseas, much as the Secret Service protects the president and other White House officials. Lacking enough agents, the State Department has largely privatized security for its embassy personnel in hot spots like Iraq and Afghanistan under a large contract with Blackwater, DynCorp International LLC and Triple Canopy Inc. There are 1,000 people, mostly Americans, working for Blackwater in Iraq as part of this contract.  State Department officials said assigning government security guards to each Blackwater convoy will improve oversight and accountability. Critics said the move would change little, especially because of the fact that the Blackwater team will maintain command authority. "This puts diplomatic security into the role of a chaperone," said Peter Singer, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and an expert on private contractors in Iraq.
