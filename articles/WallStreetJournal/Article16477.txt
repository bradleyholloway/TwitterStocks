 Conoco Leaves Lobbying Group Seeking to Open Arctic Refuge   By Carlton, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2005  While ConocoPhillips's withdrawal isn't likely to itself stop efforts to open the refuge, it gives fresh ammunition to critics of the proposal. Environmental groups and others have argued that drilling would damage the wilderness, and efforts to drill in the refuge have been stalled. The amount of oil under the refuge is unclear, but previous surveys suggest recoverable reserves of between six billion and 16 billion barrels, which proponents of drilling say could help reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.  ConocoPhillips of Houston said its withdrawal was motivated, in part, by its primary focus on developing fields near established drilling areas on Alaska's North Slope and in supporting passage of a natural-gas pipeline project from Alaska to the Lower 48 states in the U.S. "Since ANWR is currently closed to development, we feel that any resolution or pledge on our part would be moot," a ConocoPhillips spokeswoman said in a statement yesterday.
