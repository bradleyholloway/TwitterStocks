 REIT Interest: Mack-Cali Expected to Make Major Purchases   By By Ann Carrns, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1998  When Cali Realty Corp. merged last year with Mack Co., Cali executives looked forward to benefiting from developer William Mack's extensive industry relationships.  By acquiring Pacifica, Mack-Cali enters the suburban Denver market with a strong local management team and 19 office buildings totaling 1.36 million square feet. Mack-Cali will issue common operating partnership units valued at $20 million to Pacifica Holding's investment group, which includes Apollo Investment Fund II LP. The Apollo fund owns an interest in eight of Pacifica's buildings, and will receive approximately half the partnership units -- valued at $10 million -- exchanged in the transaction, according to Mack-Cali executives.  The rub is that Mr. Mack, a director of Mack-Cali and chairman of its executive committee, also is a managing partner of financier Leon Black's Apollo Real Estate Advisors LP. In short, he is on both sides of the transaction. (At the time of the merger, Mr. Mack signed a noncompete agreement with Mack-Cali, but the pact exempted Mr. Mack's involvement with Apollo, according to Mack-Cali's SEC filings.)
