 Campbell Says Financial Chief Plans to Retire   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 2001  Recent events that some partly trace back to Mr. [Basil L. Anderson] are less positive, however. This week, for example, Vlasic International Foods Inc. -- which was spun off from Campbell in 1998 -- filed for bankruptcy court protection. Along with Mr. [David W. Johnson], Mr. Anderson was an architect of that transaction, which larded Vlasic with a $560 million debt load. And in November, Campbell said it was obligated to buy back some of its shares at a substantial loss, due to forward-purchase agreements.
