 Levitz, Emerging From Reorganization, Sets Management Pact With Seaman   By By Dan Morse, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2000  Under the plan, Seaman will manage Levitz's East Coast stores and handle some back-office functions nationwide. Also, a new holding company, Levitz Home Furnishings Inc., based in New York, is expected to be created and to own Levitz and a majority of Seaman.  The furniture chains said they will create efficiencies in advertising, merchandising, warehousing, distribution and administration. The pact is part of Levitz's revised reorganization plan, expected to be filed next month. It is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court, which Levitz expects by late summer.
