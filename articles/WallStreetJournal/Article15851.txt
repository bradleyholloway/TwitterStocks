 Data-Network Firms Find Fertile Ground in Argentina --- A Boom Attracts Foreign Investors; Ripples in Region   By By Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1999  Diginet Argentina SA, MetroRed SA and Techtel SA are among the new networking companies that have sprung up. They have drawn the backing of aggressive private investors: Diginet is partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group and the Rothschild family; MetroRed is controlled by Fidelity Investments.  By shooting signals across this city's cupola-filled skyline with wireless technology, or underground through proprietary fiber-optic rings, they are developing infrastructure that will revolutionize the way businesses communicate in the Southern Cone during the next few years. They also will provide a serious challenge to the two local telephone monopolies, Telefonica de Argentina SA and Telecom Argentina StetFrance Telecom SA, and other phone companies as they expand across the region.  "The needs of telecommunications are changing in Latin America," says Armando Silberman, chief executive of Comsat Argentina, a subsidiary of Comsat Corp., Bethesda, Md., that helped the Brazilian Internet portal UOL Inc. roll out its Argentine service last week. "The capacity and quality of the networks needed for data will be bigger and better" than voice networks.
