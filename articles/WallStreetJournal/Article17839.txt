 International Corporate Report: Remy Martin Drops Offer To Buy Benedictine S.A.   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1988  Under French stock exchange rules, a sweetened bid in a takeover battle must be at least 5% above a competing bid. Remy, a family-held French cognac producer, would have had to offer at least 8,085 francs a share to stay in the contest. That would have cost Remy 1.13 billion francs ($198.2 million) based on Benedictine's current capital, or 1.19 billion francs if the target company had proceeded with a defensive capital boost.
