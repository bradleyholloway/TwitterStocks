 Chrysler's Road Is Paved With Distractions; Suits and Other Brushfires Vie for Daimler CEO's Attention as He Steers U.S. Unit's Recovery   By Power, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2007  With Mercedes again posting big profits and Chrysler in a downturn, some analysts question Mr. [Dieter Zetsche]'s decision to do two jobs. "A CEO of a company this size should spend his time in a more balanced way on each of the divisions," says Arndt Ellinghorst of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Frankfurt. He adds that the company's multiple legal and political problems "obviously" detract from its effort to focus on Chrysler and Mercedes.  An engineer by training, Mr. Zetsche shows no intention of ceding his Mercedes post. "You can be a better CEO if you run one of the divisions," he told analysts during a conference call last fall. People familiar with Mr. Zetsche's thinking say the remark still reflects his view; Mr. Zetsche's spokesmen say that the Mercedes division is on track to reach its goal of achieving a 7% return on sales this year, and that the Smart small-car unit is set to turn a profit for the first time this year after years of losses.  For now, though, Mr. Zetsche's biggest problem is Chrysler. Praised for rescuing the division when he was its president from 2000 until 2005, Mr. Zetsche is seen by some as bearing part of the blame for its latest slide. Critics note the inventory buildup that saddled Chrysler with cars its dealers didn't want began when he was still at the division's headquarters. Similarly, they say, Chrysler's strategy of developing more large SUVs -- which left the company vulnerable when gasoline prices rose -- also took shape on his watch there.
