 Coal-Gasification Begins to Emerge   By Jakab, Spencer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2006  The U.S. has two of the handful of large IGCC plants operating world-wide, one in Indiana and one in Florida, but they were heavily subsidized by the Department of Energy. AEP's Mr. [Mike Mudd] says lower capital costs and far heavier penalties for emitting pollutants have brought the cost to within 20% of the leading competitor, supercritical pulverized coal plants. "That's primarily because IGCC is a new technology and it's got to go through a cost maturation," he said.  Perhaps the most compelling advantage of an IGCC plant is the ability to control carbon-dioxide emissions. In the event that the U.S. joins other developed nations in controlling greenhouse gases in coming years, retrofitting an IGCC plant to remove CO2 is vastly easier and cheaper. According to Mr. [Ed Lowe], the additional cost of electricity from stripping carbon dioxide from a pulverized coal plant is 66% versus just 25% for an IGCC plant.  Widespread adoption of the technology could counter a recent trend in the U.S. coal market that has seen demand for low-rank but cleaner sub-bituminous coal from the western U.S. increase sharply. Faltering output of eastern low-sulfur coal and rising demand have created a boom in the price of western Powder River Basin Coal, which is up almost 200% versus a year ago.
