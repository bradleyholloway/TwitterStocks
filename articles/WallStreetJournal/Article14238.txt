 Executive at Unit Of Manufacturers Hanover Resigns   By By Phillip L. Zweig, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1986  In the latest in a series of recent top-level departures from Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s investment banking unit, C. William Schroth, an executive vice president, merchant banking, resigned last week.  A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover said that Mr. Schroth, 38 years old, quit because of differences with management over "policy, outlook and philosophy." He described Mr. Schroth's resignation as a "friendly parting."  But banking sources familiar with Manufacturers Hanover's investment banking activities indicated that the banking company's top management was disappointed with the financial performance of the merchant banking unit and had offered Mr. Schroth a greatly diminished role in a planned reshuffling.
