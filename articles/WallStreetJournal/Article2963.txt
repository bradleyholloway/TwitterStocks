 Hunting Is Big Business -- But a Shot in the Dark   By By Caleb Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1997  Mr. [John] Baen ought to know. Aside from operating a modest 11,000 acres in Southwest and Northwest Central Texas that he leases to hunters, Mr. Baen recently completed a study with the imposing title "The Growing Importance and Value Implications of Recreational Hunting Leases to Agricultural Land Investors in America."  He also has a degree in wildlife science and is a walking hunting thesaurus, quick to utter phrases like "If it hops it drops," "If it flies it dies," and the hardy perennial "Let's go kill something." Mr. Baen says, "All of this is part of our Texas culture."  Typically, small and absentee landowners lose out, Mr. Baen says. Often a landowner leases his property to a farmer, who farms part of the parcel but then subleases to hunters for a lot more. Mr. Baen estimates that 60% of all hunting leases are made by agricultural tenants. "Local ranchers at the coffee shop, all they do is laugh" at the naivete of absentee owners, he says.
