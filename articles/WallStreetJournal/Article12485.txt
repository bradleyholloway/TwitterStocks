 High Court Weighs School-Impact Fees   By By Evan Perez, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1999  A dozen counties charge such fees to recoup the cost of the additional schools that often must be built when a new housing community increases the local population. Other impact fees, such as for roads, water and sewer, also have become common as local governments wrestle with the infrastructure demands of Florida's booming urban growth. Developers pay the fees and incorporate them into the price paid by home buyers.  In the case up for oral arguments yesterday before the state's highest court, a developer in Ormond Beach in Volusia County is arguing that residents of his Aberdeen development, about five miles from Daytona Beach, have no impact on the school system and therefore shouldn't have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in school impact fees.  The developer sued the county in Volusia County circuit court in 1997 after officials refused to exempt the planned 537-unit community from the school fee, which will exceed $300,000 when all the homes are built. The court ruled in favor of the developer and ordered the county to refund the fees paid. But the county appealed to the 5th District Court of Appeal, which without ruling passed it to the Supreme Court.
