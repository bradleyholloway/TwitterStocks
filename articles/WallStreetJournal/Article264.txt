 Greyhound Drives Down New Road in Quest for Success --- CEO Lentzsch's Fence-Mending Helps Turn Around Bus Company's Fortunes   By By Robert Tomsho, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1998  In its latest contract talks with drivers, Greyhound handled things differently. Craig Lentzsch, president and chief executive officer, opened Greyhound's books to Amalgamated Transit Union negotiators.  Such fence-mending has become symbolic of Mr. Lentzsch's efforts to reverse the big bus company's fortunes during the past three years. As a result, Greyhound reached a tentative accord last month -- more than a year before the drivers' current contract expires -- with the ATU on a six-year pact covering 4,600 drivers and other employees. Results of rank-and-file voting are expected in mid-March.  Greyhound drivers haven't approved a contract on the first vote since 1980. But this time, even union leaders are guardedly optimistic, thanks largely to peacemaking efforts by Mr. Lentzsch. Among his most popular moves was a promise never to hire a permanent replacement worker, a company tactic that enraged strikers during the walkout that began in March 1990. Although most union activity shifted from picket lines to courtrooms and federal labor-law hearings after a few months, that strike wasn't settled for three years.
