 New Russian Tax Laws May Damp Hopes Of Oil Companies to Do Business There ---- by Allanna Sullivan Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1992  Recent changes in Russian tax laws could throw cold water on the resolve of oil companies to do business in that republic.  During the past few weeks, the Russian government has enacted a number of decrees that appear onerous to oil companies. Industry officials say that among them is an export tax which immediately adds a charge of about $5 to each barrel exported from the country. Then there's a value-added tax of 28% on any services or goods purchased in the republic.  Only a handful of Western companies in the few joint ventures currently operating in Russia would be immediately affected. But such a move could discourage the industry, including major international energy companies, from pursuing their efforts to stake out oil production there. In fact, discussions involving tax changes such as these have become part of the deal-making process for parties interested in drilling in that part of the world.
