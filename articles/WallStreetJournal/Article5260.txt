 Toy Companies Expected to Post Mixed Results --- Second-Quarter Gains Seen At Hasbro and Mattel; Film Tie-In Helps Tyco   By By Barbara Carton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1995  The second quarter is becoming more significant to toy makers because increasing amounts of their revenues are tied to summer movie releases. However, the biggest movie-related toy, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, is made by closely held Bandai Inc. of Japan and continues to steal a large share of children's toy dollars.  Mattel Inc., El Segundo, Calif., with continued strong Barbie doll sales, should outpace competitors and post about a 10% earnings gain to around $63 million, or about 28 cents a share, up from $57.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share figures reflect a stock split that occured in January.  Mattel should see second-quarter sales growth of as much as 15% to between $730 and $750 million from the $650 million reported a year earlier. "Despite a very competitive environment, Mattel has seen strong top-line growth, solid product momentum and consistent performance," said Jill Krutick, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc.
