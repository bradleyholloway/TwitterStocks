Mr. (Fulvio) Conti's responsibilities will now be split among three executives. The finance and control briefs will go to Giovanni Stella, a former executive from ENI SpA whom Mr. Bernabe brought on board. Mario Rosso, the new head of personnel who was also recently brought in by Mr. Bernabe, will assume responsibility for real estate holdings, which are also expected to be sold quickly. Mr. Bernabe himself will handle the information technology brief.
