 Now Is the Time To Reform The Tax Code   By By Mortimer Caplin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2001  Our tax laws are riddled with an array of targeted tax preferences and so-called incentives -- grievously complicating tax compliance, eroding our tax base and thus necessitating increased tax rates to meet revenue demands. The federal tax code is replete with special deductions and credits, exemptions and exclusions, deferrals and other preferred treatment for particular industries, groups or interests.  That these common techniques -- typically justified on a variety of high-sounding grounds -- are simply tax reductions for one anointed body or other, was acknowledged by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill at his recent Senate confirmation hearings. In response to suggestions that business tax incentives might be good for our economy, Secretary O'Neill answered: "As a businessman I never made an investment decision based on the tax code. If you give money away I will take it, but good business people don't do things because of inducements."  Indeed, both as a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner and as a practicing lawyer, I have found most businessmen's attitude on tax incentives entirely in line with that of Mr. O'Neill. How true is the observation that our tax laws reflect "a continuing struggle among contending interests for the privilege of paying the least."
