 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: Sacred Texts, Used and Abused   By Beran, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2003  John Henry Newman saw the process at work in Judaism and Christianity: Jews and Christians work continuously with a small number of "pregnant texts out of which the succeeding announcements" grow. The Jews especially possessed, Newman said, a "traditional habit of contemplating" their sacred books, one that enabled them to expand the scope of their civilization without detaching it from the stalk. The plant grew larger, the blossoms more brilliant; but the root was ever the same.  The Greeks, too, perfected a technique of enhancing their public life by enlarging on their fundamental texts. Public men played an important part in this civic pedagogy; by applying traditional texts to new problems statesmen like Solon made the latent moral and spiritual poetry of their people active. They used what Wordsworth called the "Visionary Power . . . embodied in the mystery of words" to clarify and broaden the ideals of the polity.  For the Greeks the source of an authoritative language was Homer. For Americans, it is Shakespeare and, even more, the Bible. Some of Abraham Lincoln's most memorable words have biblical origins. "A house divided against itself cannot stand," he said in 1858. The "judgments of the Lord," he said in the second inaugural address, "are true and righteous altogether." But even when Lincoln is not directly citing scripture his moral vocabulary and the rhythm of his sentences reflect the Bible's language.
