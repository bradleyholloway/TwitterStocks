 If We Must Ration Vaccines for a Flu, Who Calls the Shots?; By Sharon Begley   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2006  Second, efficacy. Let's leave aside the fraught question of the value of a life. Evidence keeps accumulating that vaccinating the elderly might not even be the best strategy for minimizing deaths. The reason is that during some flu pandemics, the mortality rate among the elderly is hardly higher than during nonpandemic years. The flu certainly kills some old people, says Dr. Emanuel, but many would have died anyway. In addition, they may not benefit from flu vaccines as much as is assumed: A 2006 study found that the antibody response by people over 65 is less than half that in young adults.  LAST YEAR, scientists showed in a model that if you vaccinate about 60% of U.S. schoolchildren, flu deaths among the elderly would fall to 6,600 from the typical 34,000. "It's not necessarily true that the best way to protect someone is to vaccinate that person," says Ira Longini of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle. "In the case of the elderly, flu vaccine doesn't protect them very well, so breaking the chain of transmission provides greater protection."  For moderately contagious strains, says Prof. [Lauren Ancel Meyers], the optimal strategy is to vaccinate the kids. "This severs the transmission chain," she says, thereby indirectly protecting the old. For very contagious strains, it is better to vaccinate those most likely to die if they catch flu, such as the elderly. "Highly contagious strains can find their way around this buffer of immunized schoolkids," she explains.
