 Snack Attack: As Child Obesity Surges, One Town Finds Way to Slim; Somerville, Mass., Goes Beyond Schools to Push Exercise, Good Eating   By Parker-Pope, Tara, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  The Somerville study is believed to be the first controlled experiment demonstrating the value of a community-wide effort. It's only a small dent, but slowing the pace of weight gain among kids is the key to conquering childhood obesity, says lead author Christina Economos, an assistant professor at Tufts University. "It could be the difference between graduating overweight and graduating at a normal weight," she says. "We need to think about how it plays out long term."  "It's a balancing act, because it doesn't serve any purpose for us to produce meals nobody will eat,"" says Ms. [Mary Jo McLarney]. "It's about giving them the most nutritious, highest-quality meal we're able to, and it's probably more balanced than they're able to bring from home."  "Everyone was unhappy,"" concedes Ms. McLarney. "But we just decided it was in everybody's best interest. Kids have $1.80 in their pocket and they're choosing between a sundae, Powerade and a bag of chips or a salad or sandwich, what do you think they'll pick?"
