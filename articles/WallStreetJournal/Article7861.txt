 Convertible-Bond Game Becomes Riskier   By By Barbara Donnelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1989  On the one hand, many investors are jittery because of unexpected skids in stock prices, rising inflation and higher interest rates. On the other hand, the possibility of further stock market advances and a downturn in interest rates later this year makes them reluctant to head for the exit.  Convertible bonds are interest-paying securities that can be converted into a fixed amount of a company's common shares. The interest payments tend to prop up the price of a convertible if a company's underlying common stock takes a dive. At the same time, the price of a convertible tends to rise when the price of the related common shares goes up.  Meanwhile, an estimated $10 billion to $13 billion of existing convertibles disappeared from the market last year, says William M. Riegel, vice president at J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. Corporate mergers, repurchases, redemptions and calls (in which a company forces convertible investors to exchange their bonds for common stock or cash) were the cause, he says.
