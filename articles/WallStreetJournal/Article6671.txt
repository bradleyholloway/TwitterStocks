 Missed Messages on Benefits Of Menopause Hormones   By Parker-Pope, Tara, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  To be sure, most doctors say more research is needed to fully understand the data, particularly the lower mortality risk and higher stroke risk. And the data are a little more confusing for women who still have a uterus and take a combination of estrogen and progestin. Per 10,000 recently menopausal women, this group had four fewer heart attacks and seven fewer deaths, but nine more strokes. The WHI also has shown that among women who had never used hormones before, the risk of breast cancer increased 9% among estrogen-and-progestin users. That means a 50-year-old woman with an average 3% risk of breast cancer over the next 10 years would see her risk increase to 3.27% with hormones.  A re-analysis of the WHI data, published last week, has raised that question and new ones about the potentially protective effects of hormones on younger women who use them at the beginning of menopause. Researchers last week emphasized that the new analysis showed only that menopause hormones were safe for younger women to use to treat menopause symptoms, and that hormones shouldn't be used for any protective benefits. What's so surprising about the new analysis is that it signals that hormones could in fact be a powerful weapon in women's health.
