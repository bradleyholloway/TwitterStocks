 Taste -- Review & Outlook: FDR's Vice   The Wall Street Journal,  May 23, 2003  Arthur Schlesinger Jr. makes the point in a review of the reverential biography of [Henry Wallace], "American Dreamer," published by former Sen. John Culver and former newsman John Hyde three years ago. "[Eleanor Roosevelt] herself," wrote Mr. Schlesinger, "led the repudiation of Wallace in column after column." Not only did Eleanor attack Wallace for his alliance with the communists, she declared that "any use of my husband's name in connection with that party is from my point of view entirely dishonest."
