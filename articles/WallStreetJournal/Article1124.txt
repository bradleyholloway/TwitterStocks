 Sugar Farmers Are Sour on Plan to Guide Output   By Tomson, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2007  The USDA plan is needed, USDA Undersecretary Mark Keenum told a gathering of sugar-beet farmers last week, to maintain the U.S. sugar program at a "no net cost" to taxpayers. If the total sugar supply rises above market demand and prices fall, the government has to buy up the excess from U.S. producers. Congress created the complex sugar program to maintain a price-support system by controlling domestic and foreign supply.  Mr. [Phillip Hayes] said U.S. sugar producers were pleased that the USDA still wants to protect sugar producers in U.S. farm-bill policy, but producers stand against what they see as favoritism in the name of free trade with Mexico. The U.S. and Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement agreed to gradually reduce sugar trade barriers until free trade is achieved in 2008.  In fact, U.S. sugar producers are complaining that they could easily export to Mexico if the U.S. had negotiated a reduction in Mexico's tariff, which stands at 12.26 cents a pound. USDA control over domestic sugar production doesn't apply to exports or domestic nonfood use, and producers here would sorely like to see Mexico as an outlet.
