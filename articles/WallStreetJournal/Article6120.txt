 `Cincy' -- From Backwater to Bidding War   By By Kate Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2002  So, instead of possibly having to pay higher fees to Nasdaq, the trading firms hope that by buying Cincinnati, which is 68%-owned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, they can grab a chunk of the business for themselves. A person with knowledge of the discussions said that the CBOE has asked Cincinnati's bidders to come up with firm offers by the end of September. Whoever makes the highest bid will be poised to own the CBOE's controlling interest in the Cincinnati, with Cincinnati member firms owning the remaining 32% through their seats on the exchange.  In a counterattack, Nasdaq executives began questioning Cincinnati's ability to regulate such a large chunk of Nasdaq trading. "Cincinnati . . . doesn't have a significant regulatory [apparatus]," said Nasdaq Chairman Wick Simmons in a recent interview.  Mr. [David Colker] counters that Cincinnati takes its regulatory responsibilities "very, very seriously," and that "we are in good standing with the SEC." Nonetheless, in July the Securities and Exchange Commission handed Nasdaq a partial victory, mandating that Cincinnati no longer share its market-data revenue with Island for Nasdaq stock trading. In hopes of working out a new and more acceptable revenue-sharing arrangement, Island has continued to report Nasdaq trades to Cincinnati, anyway.
