 Coal Companies Are Slowed By Severe Shortage of Workers; Mines Can't Boost Output, So Utilities' Low Stockpiles May Lift Electricity Prices   By Maher, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2005  Today, most major coal suppliers are already "sold out" for 2005 and are busy locking in orders for production, while coal inventories at utilities have dropped to record lows. The National Mining Association forecasts that demand for coal, which supplies more than half of the country's energy, will outpace supply in 2005 for the third year in a row.  Meanwhile, with coal companies unable to rebuild inventories, some analysts are warning about possible disruptions and energy price increases. "If this summer were to turn out to be extremely hot, you're going to see some real problems," says Jim Thompson, managing editor of Coal and Energy Price Report in Knoxville, Tenn. "We've sort of dodged a bullet because we've had several mild seasons in a row."  Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power Co. -- the largest generator of electricity in the U.S., which purchases about 75 million tons of coal a year -- says the company has "a few facilities that are lower than our typical average level," but adds that "there's nothing that we would say is critical or that we have real strong concerns about." She says the company tries to maintain between 30 days and 40 days of coal inventory on average.
