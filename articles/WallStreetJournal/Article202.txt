 Shares Follow Larger Issues Higher, Boosted by Comments of Fed Chairman   By By Dave Pettit and Thomas Granahan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 24, 1995  But as has been the case for weeks, smaller issues were unable to keep pace with larger ones. While the Dow set its third new high in a little more than a week, the Russell 2000 Index finished 6% below a record that has stood for 11 months.  The Russell, which tracks small issues on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, gained 1.01, or 0.40%, to 254.95. That was short even of the five-month high of 257.47 the Russell reached last Wednesday as the Dow reached its first new high of the recent streak.  Shares of Medar plunged 4 5/8, or 34%, to 9 1/8 after the company came in with fourth-quarter net income of three cents a share, including a charge, compared with 10 cents a year earlier and well below analysts' expectations. The shares set a 52-week low of 8 3/4 intraday.
