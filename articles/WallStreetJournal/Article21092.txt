 Big Thrift Concerns Split on Question Of Writing Off FSLIC-Fund Investments   By By David B. Hilder, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1987  A sharp split is emerging among several of the nation's biggest thrift holding companies over whether to write off their investments in the $824 million secondary reserve fund of the insolvent Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corp.  H.F. Ahmanson & Co., the Los Angeles-based parent of the nation's second-largest thrift, yesterday said it plans to write off its $24 million investment in the secondary reserve fund in the second quarter. And Financial Corp. of America, the biggest thrift concern, said it would follow suit with its $23 million investment.  Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, testified on May 14 before a congressional committee that the secondary reserve had been wiped out, because the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, determined that the FSLIC was insolvent by $6.3 billion as of the end of last year. The Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, also sent a letter to thrifts directing them to write off their investments in the secondary reserve during the month of May.
