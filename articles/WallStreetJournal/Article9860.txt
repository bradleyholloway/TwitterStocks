 Prop One's Money   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2005  Opponents include all serious budget analysts, as well Governor George Pataki and his predecessors. Notably unhelpful has been Democratic candidate for governor, Eliot Spitzer, who'll say he's opposed if asked but hasn't shown any leadership. This will haunt Mr. Spitzer if he wins, because Prop One is a power grab by the legislature that would limit the governor's ability to veto spending bills. At a time when more than a dozen states are weighing proposals to slow the growth of government -- through constitutional tax and expenditure limits -- New York's lawmakers all too typically want to move in the opposite direction.
