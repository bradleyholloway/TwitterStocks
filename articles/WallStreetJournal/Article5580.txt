 United and Lufthansa Both Form an Alliance With ANA of Japan   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1998  UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa Airlines, the key partners in the six-carrier Star Alliance, each said they will form a strategic alliance with All Nippon Airways of Japan.  The agreements with ANA were struck bilaterally by United and Lufthansa, rather than by the global Star Alliance as a whole. Nevertheless, the added traffic that ANA brings to United and Lufthansa seem certain to strengthen the larger alliance, which also includes Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines System, Thai Airways International and Brazil's Varig.
