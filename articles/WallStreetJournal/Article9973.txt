 PURSUITS; Style: A New Lease on Luxury; In Paris, Europe's most upscale designer shops find a new favorite address; the trouble with Rue Royale   By Passariello, Christina, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  Paris -- ON A RECENT evening, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Christian Dior and their neighboring boutiques on Avenue Montaigne opened their doors to 2,000 of their most devoted clients. The block party was a celebration of Avenue Montaigne's rise as one of Europe's top shopping streets.  The same thing is happening in top shopping spots from New York to Tokyo, to varying degrees. The arrival of megastores such as Niketown on New York's 57th Street lowered the neighborhood's chic factor. Luxury brands like Hermes and Celine ventured several blocks uptown to Madison Avenue. Designers such as Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen were drawn to Manhattan's Meatpacking District, which speciality retailer Jeffrey had turned into a hub for high-fashion shoppers. In Tokyo's Omotesando district, Dior and Celine share the block with J.Crew. And Milan's famous Via Montenapoleone, home to the world's most exclusive brands, features a stock store selling discount Prada heels and Gucci coats.  The appeal of Avenue Montaigne, fashion executives say, is that it hasn't been adulterated by cheap brands. "It's a very homogenous avenue with only the top brands," says Jean-Claude Cathalan, president of the Comite Montaigne block association. "New store locations are already reserved before the old brands move out."
