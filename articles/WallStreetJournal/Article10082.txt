 Tax-Deferral Cap Weighed For Hedge-Fund Managers   By Lueck, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  Representatives of the hedge-fund industry already were arguing they shouldn't be singled out. "It seems to me singling out one industry for different treatment is not in keeping with general tax policy principles," said Lisa McGreevy, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Managed Funds Association.  Mr. [Rahm Emanuel]'s proposal may serve as a diversion from an issue he says is more complex: the taxation of carried interest, a cut of profits received by managers of hedge and private-equity funds as well as some real-estate investors. He so far hasn't been a vocal supporter of legislation pushed by others that would raise tax rates on carried interest. Still, the proposal may well become part of a big tax bill Mr. [Charles Rangel] is planning.  Mr. Rangel said he is "pretty confident" that his committee will soon pass a major tax bill. He said it is "very likely" that the measure would come to a vote in the full House. He acknowledged the Senate is unlikely to pass some of the provisions his panel is working on such as the permanent changes to the alternative minimum tax.
