 Thirteen Former Asbestos Firms to Settle Class-Action Suit for Over $100 Million   By By Cynthia F. Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1986  Thirteen former asbestos producers have agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit for more than $100 million, which would make it the largest settlement ever to be paid to victims of asbestos-related diseases.  The settlement, which came four weeks into the trial of the lawsuit, will pay 751 former workers or their survivors. The suit, filed in federal court in Marshall, Texas, claimed that the workers had suffered or died of respiratory diseases after being exposed to asbestos, a mineral once widely used for building and pipe insulation. Asbestos can cause cancer and respiratory diseases.  Attorneys for asbestos victims throughout the U.S. said terms of the settlement could set an important precedent. The fact that a class action was allowed in the first place was itself a precedent, they said.
