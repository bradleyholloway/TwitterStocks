 Nissan Unveils Expansion Plans For North America   By By Gregory L. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2000  Boosting sales in North America, the world's largest auto market, is a key part of Nissan's turnaround strategy. The company plans to introduce at least 10 new models in the U.S. over the next three years and local production is more cost effective. When complete, the Smyrna expansion would amount to a 13% increase in Nissan's North American vehicle-production capacity. Nissan also has two vehicle-assembly plants in Mexico.  In addition to the output increase at the Smyrna plant, Nissan will more than triple the size of its engine factory in Decherd, Tenn., adding capacity for V-6 and V-8 engines, powerplants critical for competing in the truck market and ones Nissan doesn't now make in North America. A Nissan spokesman said the plant, which now can produce about 200,000 four-cylinder engines, will have a total capacity of about 750,000 motors when the expansion is complete.
