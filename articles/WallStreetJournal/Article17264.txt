 'The Bonfire Of the Volvos'   By Sacks, Sam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2011  In The Concrete Island (1974), a man stranded in the median of a highway torches his Jaguar to signal for help; the action in High-Rise (1975) is triggered when a murder victim is found embedded in the crushed roof of a car. "Running Wild," a 1998 novella, is about the massacre of parents by their children within a luxury housing estate (the allegory here concerns the potential backlash against an overprotective parent-state).
