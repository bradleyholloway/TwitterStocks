 Avon Chief Says He's Had No Contact Since Wednesday With Jacobs, Amway   By By Jeffrey Trachtenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1989  James Preston, chairman and chief executive officer of Avon Products Inc., said he hasn't had any contact with Amway Corp. or investor Irwin Jacobs since the disclosure Wednesday that the two own 10.3% of Avon's common stock and may seek control of the company.  Earlier, addressing a standing-room only crowd at Avon's annual meeting in New York, Mr. Preston said, "Our distribution and selling systems, to say nothing of our culture and values, are enormously different from Amway. We see more conflicts than commonalities."  However, at least one Avon director appeared more open to a takeover overture, and two groups of shareholders filed suit to block Avon from implementing anti-takeover defenses. "I support management, but as a board member you have to listen to any outside offer," said Stanley Gault, chairman and chief executive officer of Rubbermaid Inc. in an interview after the meeting. Mr. Gault praised management for moving to get out of the healthcare business, but he added that it "waited too long to get rid of the losers."
