 More Americans Are Called for Jury Duty   By Adler, Stephen J; Lambert, Wade, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1990  The survey's sponsor, a group of corporate defense lawyers called the Defense Research Institute, also suggests that the expanded need for jurors may be a byproduct of increased litigiousness in the society. Archie Robinson, president of DRI, says more cases are being filed and prepared for trial than in the past. In addition, he says, a higher percentage are high-stakes cases that often take a long time to try. In such cases, he says, it's customary to call a larger pool of potential jurors, since many will be unable to serve in a long case and will have to be disqualified.  But jury researchers dispute Mr. Robinson's conclusion. Marc Galanter, a litigation expert at the University of Wisconsin law school, says available data in several large states indicates that the number of civil jury trials did not increase between 1984 and 1988. In federal court, there were 5,555 civil jury trials in 1984 and 5,676 in 1989, he said.  Mr. [Thomas] Munsterman says that another reason more people are being called for jury duty is that many courts are expanding their methods of finding potential jurors. While most jurisdictions used to rely primarily on voter-registration lists, in recent years many have added back-up lists, including driving records. Drivers' lists generally include 90%-95% of adults, while only about 70% of adults are registered to vote in most areas, Mr. Munsterman says.
