 Tracking Travel: New York Runs Up High Toll for Security   By Dahl, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1992  Even though the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey discontinued using police officers at its toll plazas in 1962, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, a quasi-public agency, has 800 officers who do most of the toll collecting at its bridges and tunnels in New York. The officers receive a salary of as much as $36,000, plus $10,000 more in overtime.
