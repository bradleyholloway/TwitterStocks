 Miller, Coors To Shake Up U.S. Beer Market   By David Kesmodel and Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2007  In a message to employees, Anheuser Chief Executive August A. Busch IV said the brewer must capitalize on the "significant transition confusion" that he predicted will occur when Miller and Molson Coors blend their U.S. operations. There will "likely be great concern within the SABMiller/Coors field sales and wholesaler organizations as people attempt to determine if they will have a role in this new structure," he said.  These beers are typically sold by independent local beer makers, although the big names are getting into the act. While craft beers are still a small slice of total revenue -- about 5% of the U.S. market -- they're the fastest-growing segment. Sales of craft beer rose 11% by volume in the first half of this year against year-earlier levels, according to the Brewers Association, a craft-beer trade group in Boulder, Colo. Molson Coors's hottest brand in the U.S. is Blue Moon, a Belgian-style wheat beer.  With the exception of stakes in China, India and Mexico, Anheuser has largely stuck to the U.S. Some analysts think Anheuser may ultimately merge with InBev, based in Belgium. Anheuser imports InBev's European brands, including Stella Artois and Beck's, into the U.S. under a partnership begun this year. A spokeswoman for InBev declined to comment.
