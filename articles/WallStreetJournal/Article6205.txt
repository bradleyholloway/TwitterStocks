 Enterprise: Would-Be Entrepreneurs Learn From the Search --- Firings, Sluggish Economy Bring More to the Hunt; Some Methods Pay Off   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2003  Talk to everyone. Kevin Flanagan looked at 45 companies. Owen J. Sullivan between 85 and 100. Ernie Lawrence, making the rounds of bankers, lawyers, accountants, investment bankers, business brokers and private equity firms, met with hundreds of people. These three Milwaukee-area entrepreneurs, all successful in their careers to date, say you never know where a good business lead will come from.  Messrs. Sullivan and Lawrence both did enough consulting work during their searches to avoid dipping into savings. Mr. Lawrence, 59, looking for a company to buy since the last one he ran was sold two years ago, cemented a relationship with his financial backer by handling a project at a company the firm owns. "In the process, I got to know them and they got to know me," he says.  -- Give something back. Mr. Lawrence was hoping the many professionals he visited with would pass his name along to others, widening his network and bettering his chances of finding the right company and backers. Likewise, he kept in mind the goals of those he was meeting with, "and tried to give them something in return." A referral to a banker. A chance for Milwaukee mergers and acquisition professionals to meet with a British financing firm he hooked up with. It mostly boils down to good manners. Be nice and respectful to the people you meet, and maybe they'll do the same.
