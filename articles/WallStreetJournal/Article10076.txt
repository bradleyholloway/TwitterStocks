 Credit Crunch -- Credit Markets: Treasurys Fall as Fed Warns On Rate-Cut Optimism; Bank Acknowledges Current Market Turmoil But Sees Limited Fallout   By Blumberg, Deborah Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  "The market took [officials] at their word," said T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, "that they're not really seeing real economic damage yet. The Fed is on the job, but it doesn't look like they've got their finger on the trigger."  David Ader, head of government bond strategy at RBS Greenwich in Greenwich, Conn., said the comments by Fed officials don't "translate to an on-hold Fed on the 18th but rather represent a Fed that is reminding [markets] that 1) they got themselves into a pickle, 2) they should do their homework better and not rely solely on rating agencies, and 3) the Fed won't ease to improve" investors' profit-and- loss accounts.  "The Desk supplied far more reserves [Thursday] morning than we thought would be necessary," analysts at Wrightson ICAP said in a research note. "This surge in reserve supplies suggests that the Desk feels that it is far behind its add-job for the period."
