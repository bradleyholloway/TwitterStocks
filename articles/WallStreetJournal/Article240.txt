 Military Personnel Show How to Switch To Corporate Careers   By By Hal Lancaster, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1997  No more.

Most are junior officers seeking entry-level management positions with major corporations.  They're getting a mixed reception, according to several veterans who have made the switch.
