 Good Morning, Vietnam   By Rubin, Robert E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  Vietnam is close to having completed negotiations for accession to the World Trade Organization. Once it does join, Vietnam will become part of the multilateral global trading system, with lower barriers to trade for the goods and services of its trading partners, and lower trading barriers in overseas markets to Vietnam's goods and services. This will be another major impetus for economic growth and development in Vietnam, as well as for integration with the rest of the global community.  Membership in the WTO will mean that the rest of the world will have a favorable trading relationship with Vietnam; while failure to adopt PNTR would simply leave us on the outside. It could also be seen globally as a major step backward by the U.S. with respect to multilateral engagement on the issues that affect both our country and the global community. And the U.S. has a strong national-security interest in helping Vietnam view itself as a partner in the global community.  Today's complex and uncertain issues in the global environment call for intense and open-minded policy deliberation. But our mutually reinforcing economic policy objectives remain best served by trade liberalization, relative openness to immigration and market-based economics combined with sound fiscal conditions and robust public investment and other public policies for needs that markets won't meet. Thus Congress should adopt PNTR for Vietnam now and vigorously pursue these other key ingredients for U.S. prosperity.
