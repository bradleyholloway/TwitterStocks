 A Pledge to Princeton Was for $100 Million, But Asia Intervened --- Mr. Wu Vows to Pay, in Time; School's Stake in His Firm Is Another Matter, Though   By By Steve Stecklow and G. Bruce Knecht, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  It was one of the proudest moments in Princeton University's history. Gordon Y.S. Wu (Hall), a Hong Kong businessman and an alumnus, announced in late 1995 that he was giving Princeton $100 million. Mr. Wu said the unrestricted gift, to be paid over a period of years, was meant to "reciprocate for the hospitality the American people have shown foreign students" such as himself.  In addition, it turns out that around the time he made his pledge, Mr. Wu volunteered to advise those who manage Princeton's endowment on how to invest in Asia. His advice: Buy stock in his company. Princeton did so, and has incurred a loss, at least on paper, that people familiar with the matter say exceeds the roughly $33 million Mr. Wu has paid on his pledge.  The seventh of nine children, Mr. Wu spent his early years in a tiny tenement apartment not far from his current skyscraper office. "My father started out a taxi driver," he says. "In the end, he was the taxi king. He owned 378 taxis." His mother was a big believer in American higher education, and all but one of her children attended college in the U.S. An older sibling steered Mr. Wu to Princeton, where he enrolled in 1954, then one of the few Chinese on campus.
