 Case on Disability, Seniority Goes Before Justices   By By Scott Ritter, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2001  Robert Barnett was a US Airways customer-service representative when he injured his back in 1990 handling cargo at the San Francisco International Airport. He said the carrier ran afoul of the ADA when it turned down his request for a less-demanding mailroom job. US Airways said other workers had dibs on open mailroom spots under its longstanding seniority system.  US Airways' seniority system, which isn't part of a collective bargaining agreement, decides duty assignments, shifts, shifts, holidays and transfers for its 14,000 customer-service employees. The carrier, based in Arlington, Va., routinely opens jobs for bidding four times a year, with senior workers getting preference. (US Airways vs. Barnett.)
