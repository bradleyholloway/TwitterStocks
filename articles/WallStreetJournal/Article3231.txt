 Review / Music: From Cuba With Love and Syncopation   By By Jim Fusilli, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 1999  Director (Wim) Wenders's film followed Mr. (Ry) Cooder on a follow-up trip to Havana, when he returned to produce the debut solo album of vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, who's now 72 years old. The resulting disk is an achingly romantic collection of ballads peppered with spicy, up-tempo songs. Mr. Ferrer mines the work of the great Cuban composers of yesteryear: "Bruca Manigua," a song of freedom, and "Mami Me Gusto," an ode to sensuality, were written more than 60 years ago by Arsenio Rodriguez, and "Que Bueno Baila Usted" was crafted by Benny More, with whom Mr. Ferrer once worked in prerevolutionary Cuba. With this material as a springboard, bolstered by uncluttered arrangements, Mr. Ferrer sings masterfully, with patience and passion. On "Herida de Sombras" he lets his voice, with its affecting vibrato, toy with a luscious female choir and the quavering guitar of Manual Galban. And on "Silencio" he duets with chanteuse Omara Portuondo, creating one of the highlights of the Wenders film and of this wonderful disk.
