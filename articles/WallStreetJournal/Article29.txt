 Loss of Space Shuttle Leaves Medical Experiments in Limbo   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  May 23, 1986  WHEN THE SPACE SHUTTLE Challenger was destroyed in January, its larger tragedy overshadowed setbacks to numerous shuttle-dependent projects. Among these were a whole class of biomedical experiments involving the production and purification of proteins and the packaging of other biologicals in space.  Says Charles Bugg, professor of biochemistry at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and principal investigator for a shuttle-based crystal growth project: "The idea is to develop a technology that will let us go into space and grow protein crystals of the highest possible quality for analytical purposes. This way, we can better determine the architecture of the protein molecule." Once the structure is modeled, scientists can use it to design new classes of pharmaceuticals, either by making modifications to boost potency of desired proteins or to block the growth of cancer cells and other harmful organisms.  SCHERING-PLOUGH CORP. of Madison, N.J., is working with Prof. Bugg on the synthesis in space of alpha-2 interferon, a substance that may be useful in treating certain cancers and viral infections. "Nobody knows exactly how interferon works," Elizabeth Olsen, a spokeswoman, says. But growing larger, more homogeneous crystals will enable the pharmaceutical company to analyze its structure better, she adds. "Of course, with the shuttle program temporarily on hold, we're not doing anything in space," she says. "But we're testing space equipment, both on the ground and in parabolic flight -- using an aircaft in the air that simulates weightlessness for short periods of about 20 seconds."
