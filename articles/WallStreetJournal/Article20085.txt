 Investors Look to Loan Servicers   By Wei, Lingling, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  Mortgage credit strategist Peter DiMartino at RBS Greenwich Capital said he can't overstate the importance of servicers in mitigating loan losses. "There is an adage out there," he notes, "that says, 'once you buy a bond, you are buying the servicer.'"  "Thus a diligent servicer could trap excess cash flows for the benefit of the strength of [the asset-backed deal] structure," Mr. [Andy Chow] said. "If, on the other hand, the servicer delays in liquidating REOs," he said, "the excess interest escapes" and the credit risk increases for investors.  Some investors also are questioning who shoulders more blame for the soaring delinquencies: lender or servicer? Joseph Lydon, president and chief operating officer of Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., a subprime lender and servicer, said "the best servicing in the world isn't going to cure bad loans." The company's servicing operation is rated "above average" by Standard & Poor Corp. and Moody's Investors Service, and viewed as "fully acceptable" by Fitch.
