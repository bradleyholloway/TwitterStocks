 Fairchild Aims to Benefit From Upswing In the World-Wide Aerospace Business   By Fron, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1996  Even without the gain, Mr. [Jeffrey Steiner] said the company would report "substantially" narrower losses from continuing operations than it did in the year-earlier third quarter, when Fairchild had an operating loss of $10.8 million, or 67 cents a share. Operating results at all of Fairchild's units are higher than a year earlier, he said. Mr. Steiner didn't comment on net results.  The sale of the units, as well as the merger of its communications-services systems with Shared Technologies has also substantially reduced Fairchild's debt. Shared Technologies assumed $223.5 million of Fairchild's existing debt, reducing the company's long-term debt to about $250 million from about $510 million and cutting the company's interest expense by about $30 million a year, Mr. Steiner said. With that debt out of the way, Fairchild should begin posting after-tax profits soon, he said.
