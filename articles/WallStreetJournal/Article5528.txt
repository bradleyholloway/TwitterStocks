 Apple Tries `Different' Approach To Help Change Company's Image   By By Yumiko Ono, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1997  His mission: to craft an advertising message as powerful as Nike's celebrated "Just do it" campaign. And in an inordinately hands-on manner, Mr. Jobs, brought back as interim chief executive just months ago, is gathering pictures and film footage of "geniuses" for the ads, which use the tagline, "Think different." At one point, Mr. Jobs even planned to narrate the spots, but opted instead for actor Richard Dreyfuss.  Apple aims to show that its computers are used as "incredible tools to change the world in some way, big or small," says Mr. Jobs, in an interview from his Cupertino, Calif., office, while simultaneously reading his e-mail. "I could see Apple using this (tagline) as a way to remind people of its values for the next 10 years."  On returning to Apple, Mr. Jobs began shaking up the company, quickly taking control of the efforts to polish Apple's image. To many people, the "Apple" name on a computer suggests a brand that's past its heyday. Mr. Jobs himself acknowledges that the Apple brand has "suffered from neglect." Apple expects to spend about $100 million on advertising annually.
