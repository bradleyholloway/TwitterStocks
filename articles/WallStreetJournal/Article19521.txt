 Review / Books: A Legendary Yacht Race Powered by Champagne and Caviar   By By G. Bruce Knecht, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2002  Indeed, by asserting that Atlantic still holds a record for single-hull yachts crossing the Atlantic during a race, Mr. [Scott Cookman] will renew a long-running debate. Here are the facts: Atlantic had a clear claim on the trans-Atlantic record for all types of sailboats, whether they were sailing in a race or just attempting to break the record, for a remarkable 75 years. It wasn't until 1980 that a modern multihull yacht bettered Atlantic's time. Since then, several multihull and monohull yachts that were sailing purely for record-breaking purposes -- and were therefore able to time their starts to coincide with advantageous weather conditions -- have lowered the time. In addition, some sailors believe that a French yacht broke Atlantic's record for a single-hull yacht competing in a scheduled race in 1981. For that reason Mr. Cookman should have done more to qualify his repeated assertions that Atlantic continues to hold a record for trans-Atlantic racing.  In 1905, 11 of the era's most impressive yachts gathered in New York Harbor for the start of a trans-Atlantic race sponsored by Kaiser Wilhelm II, the emperor of Germany, who promised to present the winner with a solid-gold cup. Outsized yachts have always been about more than just sailing, and as Scott Cookman writes in "Atlantic: The Last Great Race of Princes," the contest had everything to do with the kaiser's headlong rush to turn Germany into a great sea power. Planning to enter his own yacht, which would be crewed by regulars from the German imperial navy, the kaiser expected to award the cup to himself. Two British aristocrats and eight super-rich Americans were determined to stop him.
