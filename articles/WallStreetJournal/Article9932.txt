 Sri Lanka Aims to Revive Cash Crop   By Zaithoon Bin Ahamed, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2006  In October, the Spanish Red Cross and Sri Lanka's Department of Export Agriculture started a joint project to regenerate cinnamon plantations in the southern district of Galle, which accounted for more than 60% of the island's cinnamon output before the tsunami destroyed thousands of trees.  K.P. Mahinda, a cinnamon farmer in Hikkaduwa with a four-acre plot, lost all but two cinnamon trees to the tsunami. He is hoping the Red Cross's training program will lift prices for his cinnamon. "We have never had specialized training on planting and peeling. This will help improve our crop," he said.  Even before the tsunami, cinnamon exports were under threat from a cheaper substitute known as cassia, or Chinese cinnamon, which sells for a quarter of the price. Cassia comes from a Chinese tree with an aromatic bark similar to cinnamon, but of a lesser quality. Cassia is often sold under the "cinnamon" label.
