 U.S. Scientists Use Soybean to Develop Gasoline Alternative --- Farm Agency's Experiments Show Potential of Fuel; Price Is Still Uneconomic   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1989  PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Farmers may someday process their soybean crop into tractor fuel using a formula developed by scientists seeking to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and to find new markets for soybeans.  "Who knows when another petroleum shortage will push prices up, making our fuel more competitive?" said Marvin Bagby, an organic chemist at the Agriculture Department's Northern Regional Research Center in Peoria, where the fuel is being developed.  "We were close to the cost of diesel in 1983," Mr. Bagby said in a recent interview. But the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel eventually dropped below $1 a gallon, making soybean-oil fuel unattractive at its estimated production price of $1.45 a gallon, he added.
