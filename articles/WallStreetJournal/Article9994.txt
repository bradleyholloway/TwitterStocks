 'Soft Landing' May Cut Returns on Cash   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2007  Money-fund yields, which move in tandem, would thus fall. And the unusual current situation of yields on money funds and other short- term instruments topping those of bonds "won't last forever," says Mary Miller, director of the fixed-income division at investment manager T. Rowe Price Group in Baltimore.  The economists surveyed by The Journal aren't expecting dramatic changes in yields. But with a drop in short rates and a slight climb in long rates, they believe 2007 will see a return to a "normal" yield curve in which investors are paid more to take the greater price risk associated with longer-term bonds.  Experts warn investors not to make the mistake of diving into high-yield bond funds with a "me too" mentality. When the economy slows, high-yield bonds tend to suffer, because some companies default on their debt and investors start demanding higher yields.
