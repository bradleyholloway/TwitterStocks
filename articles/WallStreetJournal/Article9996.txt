 Eyes on the Road: Remakes and Sequels in Detroit; Auto Makers Repeat the Past With Their 'Future Vehicles' On Display at Auto Show   By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2007  For folks who couldn't get enough of the Brady Bunch, Chrysler took the wraps off the design of its new 2008 minivans, which will offer optional swiveling seats and a pop-up card table that allow second and third row passengers to face each other and play euchre on those long road trips. With each successive generation, Chrysler's minivans get closer to replicating the features and functions of 1970's conversion vans -- those rolling party wagons with the shag carpeting and the "If this van's rockin' don't come knocking" signs.  Consider GM's fanfare for a car called the Chevrolet Volt. GM rolled out the Volt at a big press event Sunday in Detroit's cavernous Cobo Hall, having previously released information in advance about the car for publication Sunday morning. The Volt, GM executives say, represents GM's determination to forge a path away from dependence on petroleum motor fuels. Using what GM calls "E-Flex" technology, the Volt could drive 40 miles on electric only power before a small gasoline motor kicks in to recharge the batteries. The Volt could get as much as 150 miles per gallon under certain conditions. The Volt "could nearly eliminate trips to the gas station," GM says.
