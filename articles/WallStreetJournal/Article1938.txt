 IBM Tests Selling Its PCs Within Department Stores   By By Paul B. Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1988  According to IBM executives, a decision on whether to begin selling the PS/2 models 25 and 30 that way on a broad scale could be made within a couple of months; if the company gives the go-ahead, department stores may be pushing IBM computers by early next year. Even if that doesn't happen, the test itself indicates IBM's renewed interest in the low-priced segment of the market.  "I think they probably have changed their attitude about the home and education markets," says Enzo Torresi, vice chairman of Businessland Inc., a big chain of computer dealers. "It's very easily said: IBM wants it all."  For one thing, going to department stores could devalue the product in customers' eyes. The move could also embroil IBM in a new price war. And IBM runs the risk of upsetting computer dealers, who now have a lock on PS/2 sales, and who have a history of strained relations with IBM. Recently, the dealers have begun warming up to the company -- and IBM is wary of antagonizing them.
