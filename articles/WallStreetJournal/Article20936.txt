 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Olof Palme   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1986  What makes the assassination of any major political leader particularly heinous is that it robs millions of the champion of their hopes. So it was with Olof Palme. But the slaying of the Swedish premier carries a special horror because Mr. Palme's entire career was set in defiance of the disorder and madness that seemed to have swept the rest of the world. He walked around without bodyguards, came out in favor of freezing nuclear arms and in the midst of world-wide confrontation led his nation on a determinedly neutral course. It is a mark of Mr. Palme's career that he won enormous respect even from those of us who believed he was profoundly wrong.
