 Tastings: Beaujolais, Both Nouveau and Not --- A Wine That's Best Drunk Young, It's Fresh, Fun -- And a Great Bargain, Too   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2000  This is probably the only time of the year Americans routinely hear the word "Beaujolais." That's because the much-hyped Beaujolais Nouveau, the first wine from France's 2000 vintage, has just been released. And don't get us wrong: We love Nouveau. In fact, we often host a party to welcome it. The wine itself is delightful and fun, and drinking it right away is a great way to welcome a new vintage. As always, we have conducted a blind tasting of Nouveau this year. After four straight disappointing years, how are they this year? The results are below.  Nouveau is meant to be drunk right away. In fact, by tradition, it should be drunk by the end of the year in which it was made. It's more a reason for a celebration than a wine. But Beaujolais, the real stuff, is very much a real wine. In fact, it's an outstanding and very versatile wine, and one of the world's great bargains. It's made from the Gamay grape in the Beaujolais region of France. It arrives about a year after the harvest and generally is meant to be drunk young.  There is plain Beaujolais and there is Beaujolais-Villages, which has to come from specific areas and is supposed to be better than plain Beaujolais. Then there are 10 areas within Beaujolais allowed their own "appellations": Fleurie, Morgon, Moulin-a-Vent, Brouilly, Cote de Brouilly, Chenas, Chiroubles, Julienas, Regnie and St.-Amour. Each has its own character, and you might see any of those names on a bottle in addition to the word Beaujolais.
