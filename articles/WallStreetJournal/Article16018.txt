 Adam Opel Is on the Verge Of Naming a New Leader --- Ex-BMW Official Forster Could Quickly Succeed Hendry, Insiders Say   By By Scott Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  One person close to Opel said he expected Mr. [Carl Forster] to start "as quickly as possible" after the meeting, while another suggested he could take over by May 15 at the latest. Company officials wouldn't comment on Mr. Forster or who would take over at Opel. Mr. Forster couldn't be reached for comment.  Mr. [Robert Hendry] announced in January that he was stepping down years before his contract was set to expire. The American joined Opel in November 1998, but had lost the support of key members of Opel's supervisory board as the German auto maker's market share slid much of last year. Mr. Hendry, who defended his record at Opel by saying he help to lay the groundwork for a recovery, declined to comment about who might be his successor.
