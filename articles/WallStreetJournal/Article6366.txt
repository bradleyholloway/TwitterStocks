 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2004  A: Yes. The IRS has granted more time to many people affected by storms and other calamities in presidentially declared disaster areas -- including parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. For details, see the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov), and click on: "Disaster Area Tax Relief."  More time also will be granted to victims of recent storms in five Minnesota counties, four New Jersey counties, six New York State counties and 25 South Carolina counties, says Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman in Washington. Details will be posted on the IRS Web site "in the near future."
