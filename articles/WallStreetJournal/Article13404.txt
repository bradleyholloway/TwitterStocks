 Eyes on the Road: One System, Two Visions; What to Do With an Electric-Drive System? Tokyo's Answer Isn't the Same as Detroit's Online edition  By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  The centerpiece of GM's big-SUV-hybrid system is what GM engineers call a "two-mode" hybrid system. Boiling down some fairly complicated tech talk, the system works like this: Two electric motors housed inside the transmission, a 300-volt battery pack and some sophisticated software combine to supplement the energy from a 6.0- liter V-8 motor. From a standing start, the hybrid SUVs can accelerate to about 20 miles per hour on electricity alone, if you depress the accelerator gently.  What's notable about the hybrid Tahoe and Yukon, based on the explanations of GM engineers involved in the project, isn't just the "two-mode" electric-boost system. It's all the other things GM's engineers did to make the Tahoe and Yukon more efficient.  The hybrid Yukon/Tahoe's body is about 400 pounds lighter than a standard model -- a significant reduction, but that's before you put in the hybrid drive, battery pack and related hybrid hardware. Once that's done, the weight's about the same, GM engineers say.
