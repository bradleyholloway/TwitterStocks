 Pentagon Offers Clinton Solution On Base Closings   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1995  The Pentagon is attempting to devise a face-saving way for President Clinton to deal with an independent base-closing commission's recommendation to close a big Air Force depot in California.  Under the Pentagon solution, President Clinton wouldn't contest the commission's recommendation to close McClellan Air Force Base, which employs about 11,000 people near Sacramento. But he would ask the commission to reconsider its recommendation that a portion of the work now being done at McClellan be transferred out of state. That solution would let the president appear to be defending Californians' jobs without really affecting the outcome; the Air Force has vast overcapacity in its maintenance depot system, and so can easily lose tens of thousands of jobs. "This basically accepts the [commission's] report, with one small recommendation for change," the administration official said.
