 GOP Seeks to Block White House Move To Fund Programs With Tobacco Money   By By Jeffrey Taylor, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1998  As the Clinton administration expressed cautious support for limiting the tobacco industry's legal liability, House Republicans unveiled legislation to block the White House from spending any tobacco money on new programs.  Justice Department official David Ogden said the White House can accept "reasonable provisions modifying the civil liability of the tobacco industry." His remarks to the House Judiciary Committee sparked both optimism that broad tobacco legislation is possible this year, and bitter bipartisan attacks on the White House.  Meanwhile, with the backing of House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, two GOP congressmen introduced legislation to block Mr. Clinton's tobacco-money plan. "We are laying down a marker," said Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who introduced the bill with Roy Blunt of Missouri. Tobacco money "is not a candy store the president can use to pay for whatever he wants." The president's recent budget proposal would allocate $65 billion in tobacco money to new programs, particularly child care, over five years.
