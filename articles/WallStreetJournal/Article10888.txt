 Dollar Posts Sharp Drop on Concern That U.S. Interest Rates May Be Cut   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1986  The dollar fell through its prior levels of support, triggering additional selling, traders said. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting on behalf of the Bank of Japan, bought dollars to slow the U.S. currency's slide. The Fed was said to have purchased about $200 million.  In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 168.55 yen, down 1.4% from 171.00 Wednesday. The dollar also tumbled to 2.2315 West German marks, down 1.5% from 2.2653; to 1.8370 Swiss francs from 1.8725, and to 7.1148 French francs from 7.2135.  The dollar sell-off began after Mr. Volcker told the House Banking Committee that another reduction in the U.S. discount rate wasn't contingent on West Germany's cutting its discount rate, which is the fee charged by a central bank on loans to financial institutions. Market participants previously have thought that another cut in the discount rate would come only after a round of coordinated rate reductions was initiated by West Germany or Japan.
