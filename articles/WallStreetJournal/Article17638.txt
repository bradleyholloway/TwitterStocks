 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Sell Some Gold   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  While yesterday's trading was quiet, Tuesday's action came atop the recent rise in gold, which got jumpy in mid-August after holding steady just below $350 for most of the year. To those of us who consider commodity prices the best early guide to monetary policy, the issue is whether this upsurge means the Fed has printed too many dollars, and that the general price level will once again start to accelerate. With the general economy tepid and the full incentive effect of the tax bill delayed into 1988, this would be an awkward moment indeed for the Fed to find itself forced into an anti-inflationary mode.  The surface explanations of the rising gold price are clear enough. The jump in price corresponded with increasing chatter about sanctions against South Africa, the major non-Communist producer of precious metals. This led to a soaring price for platinum, followed by gold. In addition, the Japanese have been heavy buyers of gold, ostensibly to mint a special commemorative coin honoring Emperor Hirohito. The world produces 40 million or 50 million ounces of new gold a year, and Japanese purchases this year may approach 20 million ounces.  The price of gold, though, is determined not only by the supply and demand for gold, but by the supply and demand for money. The gold price is a monetary variable not only because of history, but because of the current central bank holdings. The reserve assets of central banks do not include platinum, but central banks and international monetary institutions own more than 1.1 billion ounces of gold.
