 FTC ends objection to R.R. Donnelley's acquisition of Meredith/Burda in 1990   By Miller, James P, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1995  The FTC on Aug 4, 1995 ended its years-long legal opposition to the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co's acquisition of Meredith/Burda Cos. The panel found that the FTC's earlier objections to the $488 million acquisition had been based on a flawed view of the competitive market.
