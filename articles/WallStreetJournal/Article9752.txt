 CAO Singapore Fallout May Widen   By Matt Pottinger in Wuhan, China, and Cris Prystay in Singapore, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  Mr. Chen left Singapore on Nov. 30, the same day the company announced losses from derivatives trading that it estimated at $550 million. The company and the Singapore Exchange called for his return, which yesterday he indicated he would agree to do. "Mr. Chen has informed the company that he will return to Singapore sometime this week," said Gerald Woon, a spokesman for CAO Singapore. Mr. Chen has been cooperating with investigators, he said.  CAO Singapore's Chinese state-owned parent sold a 15% stake in the overseas unit in October. The parent, China Aviation Oil Holdings Co., lent the proceeds to CAO Singapore to help cover its mounting losses, according to an affidavit filed by Mr. Chen in a Singapore court on Nov. 29, one day before he left for China. Minority shareholders in CAO Singapore weren't informed of the arrangement, or of the massive losses, until after the affidavit was filed. The company says it is working on a plan to restructure its debt to creditors.
