 American Home, Monsanto Accord Won't Fill a Void --- Creating Powerhouse Firm Doesn't Solve Problem of Finding Heir Apparent   By By Elyse Tanouye and Thomas M. Burton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1998  American Home's chairman, Jack Stafford, 60 years old, and Monsanto's chairman, Robert Shapiro, 59, are strong chief executives who have created companies that reflect their personal visions and management styles. Both companies have mandatory retirement ages of 65 for their chief executives, but neither Mr. Stafford nor Mr. Shapiro has groomed an obvious heir apparent. There isn't a clear candidate among the companies' second tier of executives, industry observers say.  Mr. (Robert) Blount has been Mr. Stafford's trusted lieutenant and "one of the finest chief financial officers in America," says Mr. Hawkins. Had anything happened to Mr. Stafford, Mr. Blount was the executive who would have stepped in to run the company, people say. But he is about the same age as Mr. Stafford, making him an unlikely candidate to succeed Mr. Stafford over the long term.  Mr. (Robert) Essner, however, is young enough to ascend to the top leadership position and run the company for a decade or more. He became executive vice president and assumed the responsibilities of Fred Hassan, the American Home executive who was viewed as the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Stafford until he left last year to run Pharmacia & Upjohn. Mr. Essner "is viewed as a dynamic leader within the organization. . . . He's got a knack for getting the most out of employees," says one AHP insider. But outsiders note that Mr. Essner's career has been narrowly focused on pharmaceuticals, most recently leading Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Mr. Essner is unlikely to run the company "unless he does something dramatic in the next few years," Mr. (Hemant K.) Shah said.
