 GOP's Rep. Burton Accused of Releasing Selectively Edited Jail Tapes of Hubbell   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1998  Rep. Dan Burton, one of President Clinton's chief Republican antagonists in Congress, was accused of releasing selectively edited tapes of telephone conversations by presidential confidant Webster Hubbell to show Mr. Hubbell aided a cover-up.  Mr. Burton's House Government Reform and Oversight Committee will respond to the criticism as early as today by releasing complete transcripts of the calls, made while Mr. Hubbell was in prison on a fraud conviction, according to a statement by the Indiana Republican.  Excerpts released Friday by Mr. Burton show Mr. Hubbell telling his wife to inform a White House aide that he intends to remain "loyal," and describing potentially improper conduct by Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 1980s when she was Mr. Hubbell's law partner. But in additional excerpts released yesterday by committee-Democrats, Mr. Hubbell denies he was aiding a cover-up and says Mrs. Clinton didn't participate in any wrongdoing.
