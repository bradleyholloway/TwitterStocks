 Opposition Is Mounting in Canada To Trade Pact Talks With The U.S.   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1985  The Reagan administration is expected to notify Congress this week that it plans to begin talks on expanding a two-way trade that already exceeds $120 billion annually. The two countries are the world's largest trading partners.  Polls show most Canadians favor freer trade with the U.S. But long delays in starting the talks have given opponents, such as left-wing politicians, women's and nationalist groups, unions, farm organizations and various industries, time to organize against the negotiations.  Closer U.S. ties were part of the Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's election platform last year, and President Reagan agreed at a March meeting to seek them. But Canada didn't officially ask for negotiations until three months ago, and talks can't start until 60 working days after Mr. Reagan's notice to Congress. This would push the start of the talks into late spring or early summer.
