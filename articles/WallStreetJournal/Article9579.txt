 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; Unlikely ETF Investor: Mutual Funds; Barclays Move May Free Portfolio Managers to Put More Cash in Traded Rivals   By Shipman, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2003  A recent waiver to federal securities laws won by Barclays Global Investors could provide mutual funds with an important enhancement to help them manage their portfolios using ETFs. Barclays, a unit of Britain's Barclays PLC, is the sponsor of the largest number of ETFs in the U.S., with a total of 76 stock and four bond offerings now available under Barclays's iShares brand name.  Those low rates mean holding even a small portion of its portfolio as cash can produce a drag on the fund's investment performance. So managers unable to find specific securities to purchase may choose to "equitize" their available cash by buying shares of an ETF that tracks the fund's benchmark, such as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF or the SPDR Trust, the ETF known as the "Spider" and which tracks the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.  In the developmental days of its ETF products, Barclays identified mutual funds as potential ETF investors, though to what extent was anyone's guess, said James Parsons, a managing director in the firm's ETF business. "We assumed funds would be a user" of ETFs, Mr. Parsons said. But they weren't considered the main market, so the restriction imposed by Rule 12(d)1 wasn't of much concern.
