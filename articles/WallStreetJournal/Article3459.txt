 Stocks Zig-Zag: Morning Surge Eased on Mixed Earnings News   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 2001  After knocking stocks down on Wednesday, investors seized on some so-so earnings news and sent shares back up yesterday. Guardedly optimistic comments from the likes of cellphone maker Nokia, communications-chip maker Broadcom and Dell Computer, together with some upbeat economic news, combined to send the major indexes ahead.  The optimism was cautious at best; although the major indexes soared in the morning, as the day wore on they gave back more than half of their early gains to profit taking. The Nasdaq composite had been up 3.13%, or 63.16 points, at its high. The Dow industrials were up as much as 1.03%, or 109.29 points, at their high. They actually fell into negative territory just before the end of regular trading hours, only to rebound at the last minute.  Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.79%, or 1.03 points, to 131.09.
