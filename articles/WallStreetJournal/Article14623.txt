 Don't Use Roe As a Litmus Test For Judges   By By Gary L. McDowell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1989  Now it is George Bush's turn to grapple with this long-simmering issue. The Supreme Court's Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision on Monday, by stopping short of overturning Roe, opened the door to further tortuous rulings on abortion, perhaps on the three new cases accepted by the high court for its next term.  While scholars such as Sheldon Goldman of the University of Massachusetts find no evidence that the Reagan process included a litmus test, some conservatives are already demanding that President Bush nominate no one to the judiciary who does not pass muster on Roe. A commitment to overruling Roe, they insist, must be the key measure of a potential judge's juridical worth.  On the other side, liberals, too, are keeping a wary eye on judicial selection. Because Roe is the essence of modern judicial review, it is also a liberal litmus test. During the confirmation battle over Robert Bork, for example, Sen. Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) made it clear that unless Judge Bork was prepared to say he would uphold Roe, he could forget Sen. Packwood's vote.
