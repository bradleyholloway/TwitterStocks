 The Middle Seat -- Terminal Case of Blandness: Airports Could Use a Makeover   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2004  A Hollywood production designer who created the Seussian neighborhood for "The Cat in the Hat," Mr. [Alex McDowell] was asked by director Steven Spielberg to build an airline terminal for the eponymous movie, "The Terminal." Rather than film in an existing airline terminal, which as all travelers know would be subject to the vagaries of security concerns and disruptions, Mr. Spielberg wanted his own terminal. He ended up with a three-story building as big as two football fields, complete with escalators and polished granite imported from China, constructed inside a former stealth bomber hangar in Palmdale, Calif.  To be sure, we're all spending a lot more time in airport terminals since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Mr. McDowell came away from his terminal study convinced that European airports do a better job than U.S. airports making a comfortable environment for travelers. There's little doubt that airports could do more: Better seating, more entertainment -- anything to help pass the waiting hours. A few airports have tried little things, like putting out a few rocking chairs. Yet if they're in the wrong place -- outside security, for example -- they don't get used.  In the end, making the terminal a place where you'd want to spend time goes against the grain of typical terminal design. For years designers have been building airport terminals as cold places where you don't want to linger. Ever see a terminal with wood floors or nice carpeting, comfy chairs or a bar with live entertainment? New terminals are almost universally filled with carpeting so ugly that stains blend in, or shiny granite floors that reflect shop signs. They have acres of glass that give an attractive openness -- but also suggest that you're trapped in a fishbowl.
