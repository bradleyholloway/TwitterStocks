 Sources Say Ontario Insider Inquiry Touches Most Canadian Securities Firms   By By Leonard Zehr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  The Ontario Securities Commission's investigation of possible insider-trading activity is touching nearly every major Canadian securities firm, sources said, and reflects a tougher attitude toward insider trading in Canada.  It is understood that the commission has written to the firms requesting trading information for as many as three dozen people. "The (commission) is casting a pretty wide net in the hope that they can catch someone with their hand in the cookie jar," said an official of a large Canadian insurance company.  The new laws won't affect targets of the current investigation because they aren't officially in force yet, but they illustrate the growing concern of Canadian authorities over insider trading.
