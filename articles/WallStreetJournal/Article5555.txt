 AT&T to Buy Teleport for $11.3 Billion --- Investors, Analysts Applaud Long-Distance Giant's Local-Phone Strategy   By By Steven Lipin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1998  AT&T Corp. said last night that it will acquire Teleport Communications Group Inc. for $11.3 billion in stock, an expensive but strategically crucial move to penetrate the local-phone business.  The announcement of the transaction wasn't made until after the stock market closed yesterday. But shares of AT&T soared on a report in The Wall Street Journal that a transaction was imminent, adding $4.5 billion to the company's stock-market value, which now stands at $102 billion. Investors and analysts seem to buy into the strategy being deployed by the nation's No. 1 long-distance provider, and few expect any major regulatory obstacles toward completion of a transaction.  "This is a good deal for us, for business-phone customers across America, and a good deal for the shareholders of both companies," said Mr. Armstrong, in a conference call. "Teaming with Teleport will speed our entry into the local market," he said.
