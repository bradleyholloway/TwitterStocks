 Options Report: Options Traders Move to Protect Positions Amid Caution After Lucent's Profit Warning   By By Steven M. Sears, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2000  Options traders turned slightly cautious Friday, increasing their use of defensive equity put options, though remaining committed to the bullish way.  Bullish call options traded briskly across the market, but earnings warnings from such market leaders as telecommunications-equipment concern Lucent Technologies Inc. have traders fretting and looking for ways to protect positions.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange's equity put/call ratio rose to around 0.53 before closing at 0.48, up from 0.41 Thursday. While the ratio is still in neutral territory, the upward move underscored growing concern about the health of equity investments.
