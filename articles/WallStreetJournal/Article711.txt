 Lobby Group Seeks Probe of Legislator On Gifts, Funds Use   By By Brooks Jackson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1986  Common Cause called for a House probe of allegations that Rep. Bill Boner (D., Tenn.) received substantial gifts from executives he helped while in office and profited personally from campaign committee funds.  The allegations against Mr. Boner were uncovered over the past 11 months by Nashville Tennessean reporters Joel Kaplan and James Pratt, who recount them in an article in the current issue of Common Cause magazine.  The article says that Rep. Boner has been accused of bribery by a former Pentagon contractor, James Wellham, who paid Rep. Boner's wife Betty nearly $50,000 in "legal fees" for work Mr. Wellham says she didn't do. Rep. Boner befriended the contractor after helping him get a $70,000 payment that the Pentagon was slow in releasing.
