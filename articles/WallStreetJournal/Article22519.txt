 Investor Confidence in Brazil's Central Banker, Ex-Manager of Hedge Fund, Pushes Stocks Higher   By By Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1999  Good things, judging by the powerful rally that has swept through Brazil's stock market. Since his appointment on Feb. 2, Brazil's central bank president Arminio Fraga, a former portfolio manager for George Soros, has taken steps to reassure the international financial community that he understands its needs.  There are skeptics. Some analysts wonder how long the honeymoon will last. Felipe Garcia Ascencio, head of Latin American research at IDEA Global.Com, an economics analysis firm, says Mr. Fraga clearly knows how to drive market sentiment, but suggests the central banker may be on weaker ground in the realm of monetary policy.  So far, swooning global investors and skeptical economists alike agree that Mr. Fraga has made the right moves. Painfully aware of the meltdown in South Korean share prices last year as its bank creditors mulled whether to roll over delinquent loans, Mr. Fraga met personally with key figures at money-center banks in the U.S. and Europe to secure firm commitments that Brazil's loans would be extended. As a result, not only were Brazil's credit lines extended, but additional loans were secured.
