 E-Business: Microsoft Finds Rival in Liberate For Europe's Interactive-TV Market   By By David Pringle, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  Several leading European cable companies are committing themselves to using television software from Liberate Technologies, Microsoft's tiny San Carlos, Calif., rival, at least for the next few years. Both Britain's Telewest Communications PLC, in which Microsoft bought a 22% stake last year, and NTL Inc., 2.5%-owned by Microsoft, are using Liberate to make major upgrades of their interactive-television services in the United Kingdom, having passed on a second opportunity to adopt Microsoft's rival software.  It isn't likely that cash-strapped cable companies will roll out Microsoft's new boxes or switch to Microsoft software. Telewest, which has three Microsoft executives on its board, and NTL simply intend to upgrade the Liberate software on their existing boxes. "We have been happy with the performance of Liberate," says Gavin Patterson, commercial director of Telewest's consumer division.  To be sure, interactive TV is still in its early stage, and Microsoft might yet mount a comeback in Europe. Ed Graczyk, director of Microsoft's TV group, estimates only 30 million of the 1.5 billion televisions in the world run any kind of interactive service, leaving Microsoft with plenty to play for. Moreover, Microsoft's Advanced TV software was rolled out in June by TV Cabo, a unit of Portugal Telecom SA.
