 Social Insecurity   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  Sheesh -- what were we thinking? Call us naive, but we are surprised that President Bush's Commission on Social Security seems ready to punt. After Mr. Bush campaigned on the subject and survived, we expected the Commission led by former Senator Pat Moynihan and AOL chief Richard Parsons to plunge ahead and tell the country what to do. What's to lose?  -- In Option Two, workers could invest 4% of their payroll tax, up to a maximum of $1,000 a year, also with offsetting reductions in benefits. Here, however, Social Security benefits for all retirees would be indexed to annual price changes instead of wage growth. This preserves the purchasing power of benefits while moving the entire system into better financial balance. As a political sweetener, this option also calls for increased benefits for low income workers and surviving spouses.  That leaves Option Two, which we admit has some appeal. It allows more money to be invested in a personal account, which means a quicker building of assets; moves the system toward solvency faster and with fewer transfers from nonpayroll-tax revenues; and boosts wealth accumulation for the lowest income workers. A political downside is that demagogues will portray the inflation adjustment as a reduction in benefits (even though the actual purchasing power of pay-outs would stay the same).
