 The White Hats of Black Monday: Howard Baker Deputizes an Informal Markets Advisory Group   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1987  The top officials who normally would counsel Mr. Baker, the White House chief of staff, weren't at their desks. Treasury Secretary James Baker was in Europe. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was in Texas. Secretary of State George Shultz, an economist and past Treasury chief, was finishing a Middle East tour.  Now, a "core group" of these contacts continues to give Mr. Baker market information and advice on a regular basis, senior White House officials say. Among other things, this network helped coordinate the decision to set shorter trading hours in financial markets for a time after the crash. Initially these counselors advised the White House to respond carefully to the market collapse, but soon they began urging a show of presidential leadership and dramatic moves to cut the federal budget deficit, say sources familiar with the dialogue.  -- Mr. Schreyer, the Merrill Lynch chairman. He may be the market player Mr. Baker knows best, because the two have worked together in the past. Before joining the White House, Mr. Baker served on the Merrill Lynch advisory council, a group of prominent business and political leaders who counsel Merrill Lynch. In addition, Mr. Crippen, Mr. Baker's economics aide, served as executive director of the Merrill Lynch council before moving to the White House.
