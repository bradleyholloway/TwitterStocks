 Dollar Recovers a Bit Against the Yen; U.S. Currency's Prospects Are Unclear   By By Stephanie Hoo, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1999  The dollar climbed higher against the yen, recovering some of the losses it suffered in Tuesday's threeyen plunge.  The dollar's rise against the yen also helped push the U.S. currency slightly higher against the euro, which remains pressured by speculation that the European Central Bank will need to cut rates within the next few months to spur eurozone growth.  Late yesterday afternoon in New York, the dollar was trading at 112.84 yen, up from 112.14 yen late Tuesday in New York. The euro was trading at $1.1304, down from $1.1340 late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at $1.6353, down from $1.6389 late Tuesday. In Tokyo at midday Thursday, the dollar was trading at 113.23 yen and the euro was trading at $1.1315.
