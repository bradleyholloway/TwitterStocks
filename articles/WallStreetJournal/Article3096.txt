 Notable New Movies   By by Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1998  Here's a gift from the movie gods. Who would have expected so much fresh humor and visual elegance from this latest version of an old war-horse? "The Mask of Zorro" gives us two Zorros, one trained by the other. Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins are apprentice and Zen master: Luke and Obi-Wan with lightless sabers. Well, almost lightless; it's a measure of the movie's flair for deft detail that audiences laugh appreciatively when an incandescent mote dances down Zorro's blade.  The movie restores Mr. Banderas to the status of resplendent star, which is what he was in Spain, the country of his birth, when he was making comedies like "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" with the director Pedro Almodovar a decade or so ago. Mr. Hopkins really functions as Zen acting master; his sonorous voice and his blithe sense of the ridiculous make him a perfect foil for the younger man. And Catherine Zeta-Jones, the beautiful English actress who resists Mr. Banderas as long as humanly possible, gets to take Zorro on in some snazzy swordplay along with the love play. "The Mask of Zorro" puts style back in summer entertainment.
