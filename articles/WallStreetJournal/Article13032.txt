 Costlier Insurance May Lie Ahead For the Overweight   By Fleming, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2004  The report underscores a growing awareness of the broader social costs of obesity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently estimated that obesity-related medical expenditures in the U.S. totaled $75 billion in 2003. The U.S. has a far higher proportion of obese people than other developed countries, but it isn't just an American problem. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia, have seen obesity rates soar over the past 20 years, doubling or even tripling as a percentage of the population. A person is considered obese with a BMI above 30, and overweight with a BMI between 25 and 30. BMI is calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the square of one's height in meters.
