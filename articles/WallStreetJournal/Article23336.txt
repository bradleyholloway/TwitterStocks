 Retailers Post Soft February Sales; Chill, January Promotions Sapped Traffic Last Month; Discounters Perform Better   By Hudson, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2006  "January was so strong," Retail Metrics president Ken Perkins said, referring to that month's 4.8% sales gain. "People came out and spent in droves. Some sales may have been siphoned out of February into January. Clearly, a number of retailers mentioned that [customer] traffic was down. Obviously, there was a weather factor."  Stephen Hoch, professor of marketing at the Baker Retailing Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, played down the relevance of the February results to the broader economy. "Frankly, there are many other issues of uncertainty," Prof. Hoch said. "What will happen with the housing market and all of the unsold inventory? . . . There is so much other uncertainty that we can't really separate the signal from the noise."  Discounters fared well in February, paced by Wal-Mart's gain, Target Corp.'s 3.6% gain and Costco Wholesale Corp.'s 7% gain. Lower-income shoppers likely were buoyed by relatively constant gasoline prices and low January heating bills. "Weather was not a large factor for us," said Jim Kelly, chief financial officer of Family Dollar Stores Inc., which showed a 4.4% gain.
