 MarketWatch: Do-It-Yourself Bankruptcy: Be Careful   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2005  Yet while the paperwork is daunting, some say it isn't impossible. "It's like an income-tax form, or a Social Security application," says Steve Elias, a bankruptcy lawyer in Lakeport, Calif., and a founding editor of Nolo, publisher of self-help legal guides. "There are a lot of 'add this line, carry this line over to here,' like on a Schedule C . . . but most people aren't going to have to do that," he adds, noting that a majority of Chapter 7 filers will have income below their area's median, so their paperwork load will be reduced significantly. Nolo will release new how-to bankruptcy guides, complete with forms and updated for the new law, in 2006.  Mr. Elias recently developed a service aimed at California consumers who can't or won't pay the higher bankruptcy lawyers' fees: advice by phone for a flat rate of $100, to be used in conjunction with "petition-preparer" services. These are nonlawyers who help consumers file bankruptcy paperwork but are prohibited from offering advice. See his Web site: www.bankruptcylawproject.com.  Nathalie Martin, a professor at the University of New Mexico's School of Law and author of J.K. Lasser's "The New Bankruptcy Law and You," warns consumers to shop carefully: "I have seen the most horrifying mistakes and lack of understanding of the bankruptcy system by petition preparers."
