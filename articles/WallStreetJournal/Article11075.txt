 Soviet Bank Taps Eurobond Market For $78 Million --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1988  A Soviet bank is issuing 100 million Swiss francs ($78 million) of bonds in what bankers described as the first such offering by an enterprise incorporated in the Soviet Union.  The terms on the offering, managed by Bank fuer Kredit & Aussenhandel AG, the Swiss subsidiary of West Germany's West Deutsche Landesbank, are to be made final next Wednesday. But many managers already are saying the 5% coupon on the Soviet bonds is tight for a 10-year issue from a relatively unknown borrower. They add that normally conservative Swiss investors might be reluctant to buy paper from a communist country.
