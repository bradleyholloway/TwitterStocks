 Agencies Don Lab Coats to Reach Consumers; Firms Deploy Scientists Within Creative Groups To Make Messages Stick   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2007  The addition of scientists to the process marks a big departure from how Madison Avenue typically works, which is to rely largely on creative teams, including an art director and writer. More firms are testing the waters. About two years ago, PHD, a media-buying firm owned by Omnicom Group, added a new "neuroplanning" software program, created with the help of fMRI brain scans and neuroscience, to help it decide which media to use for ad campaigns. Another ad firm, Crispin Porter + Bogusky, has a consulting arrangement with a cognitive anthropologist who frequently helps on new ad campaigns. The Miami- based shop had him talk to consumers as part of the research it did before crafting a Coke Zero ad campaign. "The growing amount of advertising clutter on the airwaves is driving the need for a more scientific approach," says Peter Mears, a managing partner at PHD.  Many ad executives pooh-pooh the idea of a more scientific approach to creating commercials. "I think it's a trend going through the business," says Allen Adamson, author of "BrandSimple" and a managing director at Landor Associates, a branding firm. "Agencies can't differentiate themselves. This is just about advertising agencies trying to fight off being commoditized."
