 College Savings Plans Get Better Grades   By Mincer, Jilian, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2006  The 529 plans, named for a section of the tax code, are "the best tax-advantaged way to save for college," says David Pearlman, a senior vice president and deputy general counsel at Fidelity Investments, a major 529 provider.  The College Savings Plans Network, an association of state officials who administer 529 plans, has agreed to provide additional online tools to assist 529 shoppers. Information about 529 plans already is available on that group's Web site, www.collegesavings.org, as well as at www.nasd.com and www.savingforcollege.com, a site founded by accountant and 529 specialist Joe Hurley.  The competitive bidding for state 529 contracts has made investment firms "much more sensitive to cost, and that's good for investors," says Andrea Feirstein, president of AKF Consulting in New York, which advises 529 plans.
