 Dole Tentatively Approves United Air's Purchase of Pan Am's Pacific Division   By By Christopher Conte, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1985  Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole tentatively approved United Airlines' proposed acquisition of Pan American World Airways' Pacific division.  United, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Inc., has agreed to pay $750 million for the Pacific routes and to acquire or assume leases for 17 jumbo jets of Pan Am, a unit of New York-based Pan Am Corp. United also would assume an additional $150 million of long-term leases on certain Pan Am jets.  United was designated to operate that route under a 1982 agreement between the U.S. and Japan authorizing a third U.S. carrier to join Northwest and Pan Am in the transpacific market. Once United acquires Pan Am's Pacific routes, only two carriers will remain in the market, leaving the door open for Mrs. Dole to assign the route to a new carrier.
