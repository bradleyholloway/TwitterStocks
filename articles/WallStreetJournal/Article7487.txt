 Cable Firms, TV Stations to Meet Today In Bid for Compromise on Access Rules   By By Peter W. Barnes and Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1986  When Time Inc.'s Manhattan Cable Television system dropped a New Jersey public television station from its lineup last fall, the company argued its New York viewers had little interest in New Jersey news and public affairs programming. Manhattan Cable wanted to free the channel to broadcast the Congressional network, C-Span, and the Black Entertainment Network.  Before last summer, dropping a station would have been difficult, if not impossible, for a cable operator. But a federal appeals court ruling in July struck down the so-called government "must carry" rules that required Manhattan Cable and other cable companies to carry all broadcast signals even faintly available in their franchise area, and now cable operators are testing their new-found freedom.  The controversy stems from a 1980 FCC ruling ordering Quincy Cable TV Inc., a Quincy, Wash., cable operator, to continue broadcasting two television station signals that it had dropped. After protracted legal wrangling, a federal appeals court in Washington said must-carry rules violated Quincy's First Amendment rights. Must-carry was adopted by the FCC in 1965 to protect local television stations from other, more distant broadcast signals. Cable now reaches more than 40% of the nation's television households.
