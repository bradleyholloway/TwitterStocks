 With Trade Center Defendants Convicted, U.S. May Try to Deal   By By Margaret A. Jacobs, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1994  The men who were convicted last Friday of conspiracy in the attack on the twin-tower complex are all unindicted co-conspirators in the coming terrorism case against Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 14 others. That case, set to begin here Sept. 19 before a new judge and jury, alleges a foiled conspiracy to "oppose by force" the U.S. government and "to levy a war of urban terrorism."  While the first case was built on extensive circumstantial evidence, the case against the sheik is expected to rely heavily on undercover tapes and the testimony of government informant Emad A. Salem, a former Egyptian army officer whose motives have been impugned by the defense and whose work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation was considered erratic. Many of the defendants are expected to assert that they were entrapped by Mr. Salem and that they are completely innocent.  That's where the Trade Center defendants may come in. The government may be willing to ask Judge Kevin T. Duffy for leniency in sentencing certain of them in return for their testimony, which would presumably bolster that of Mr. Salem, according to lawyers familiar with such cases. The U.S. Attorney in New York, Mary Jo White, would not comment on the case against the sheik but acknowledged that there are no plans to indict the Trade Center defendants in that case. That leaves open at least the possibility of a deal under which one or more would testify.
