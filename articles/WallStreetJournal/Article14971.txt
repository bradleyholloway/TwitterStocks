 May Retail Sales Increased 4.2% Despite Weather --- Results, Though Tepid, Are Sufficient to Continue Recovery in Spending   By By Gregory A. Patterson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1992  Retail sales last month rose about 4.2% from year-earlier levels, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.'s retail index, which includes sales results from 10 of the nation's largest retailers.  Results were particularly encouraging in light of unseasonably cool and dry weather over much of the country last month, noted Jeff Finer, retail analyst at the Salomon Inc. unit. Hotter and wetter weather in May tends to spur sales of lawn-and-garden equipment and apparel. Both of those sectors registered lower-than-expected results.  Discount sellers continued to post bigger sales gains than department stores and apparel sellers. Several analysts noted that sales made in connection with this year's relatively late Easter, coming in mid-April, may have taken some of the momentum from May's sales.
