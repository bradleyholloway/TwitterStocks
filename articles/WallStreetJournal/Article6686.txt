 SmartMoney: Stocks to Smooth the Ride   By Fonda, Daren, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  CHUBB (CB, $53) Even if the economy suffers, Americans will still have to insure their tangible assets. And if there's one group that won't ease up on protecting its possessions, it's the wealthy -- Chubb's target clientele. Investors have historically paid a premium for Chubb's shares, but at a recent $53, the stock trades at 10 times this year's expected profit, slightly below the industry average. Wall Street expects Chubb's earnings to fall to $5.33 a share this year, down from last year's $5.60 a share, mainly because of exceptionally light claims in 2006. But the profit decline may already be priced into the stock and Chubb plans to buy back up to 20 million shares, which should help the company's per-share results.
