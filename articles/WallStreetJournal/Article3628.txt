 PCCW Makes Early Loan Payment   By By Phillip Day, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 2002  The purchase in 2000 of Hong Kong's Cable & Wireless HKT for $28.5 billion and the steady revenue it brought has been one of the few positives for PCCW, which at the height of the dot-com boom was a highflier on the Hong Kong stock market.  From $12 billion at the time it bought the phone company, PCCW's debt is now down to a net $4.2 billion or so. Reducing its debt already has freed PCCW from most of the covenants governing the phone company's revenue.  Currently, PCCW can "upstream" about 75% of its telephone revenue through dividends to the parent company. If a rumored new loan-refinancing deal goes through in the new year, it could be free to do what it wants with 100% of the takings. PCCW said it is interested in hearing what its bankers propose but that it hasn't yet settled any deals.
