 Companies Serve Up Junk Deals; Offers Planned by Charter, Dynegy and Nextel Raise Concern About Supply Glut   By Barkley, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2003  "There's no doubt that there's still a lot of money out there looking for a home, so it's not a question of demand. It's a question of, 'Is it the right deal?' " said Mark Durbiano, who manages $6.4 billion in high-yield bonds at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.  "When you have back-to-back months like that, you would have expected to see a slight negative impact on the new-issue market, but you really haven't," said John Rote, managing director and head of high-yield syndication at Banc of America Securities.  "Our investors tell us they have been receiving a lot of money from pension funds, insurance companies have been pushing a lot of money into high yield, and you've also seen hedge funds and smart value investors putting money into the asset class through the year," Mr. O'Hara said. Investors in search of higher yields will probably stick with junk bonds "for some time," he said.
