 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Templeton's Turn   By By John J. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  May 2, 2003  The most lucrative prize on the planet -- the only one that pays winners more than Nobel laureates -- used to be called the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. Then, two years ago and with little fanfare, Sir John Templeton changed its name. He dropped the word "religion."  Mr. [Holmes Rolston III]'s selection confirms that the prize really is heading in a new direction. In its early years, the award went to well-known religious figures, such as Mother Teresa and Billy Graham. Others recipients have included Catholic intellectual Michael Novak and Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn. But in 2000, Mr. Templeton wrote of a desire to "facilitate the discovery of over 100 fold more spiritual information than humankind has ever possessed before."  By rewarding thinkers like Mr. [John C. Polkinghorne], Mr. Templeton underwrites the valuable practice of trying to reconcile religion and science. The challenge for the prize in the years ahead will be to avoid sliding into a theistic mire of sloppy thinking that isn't grounded in any religious tradition. At the same time, it has a remarkable opportunity to help unite believers who are willing to accept scientific rationalism as a tool of faith and scientists who are finding that cosmology and other matters are most useful to us when they address religious questions.
