 Dollar Touches Round of Fresh Lows; Currency Feels Pressures Of Apparent Indifference By U.S. To Its Weakness   By McGeever, Jamie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2004  Unable to shake off the heavy downward pressure from low U.S. interest rates and the apparent indifference of U.S. monetary authorities toward its weakness, the dollar sank to new lows.

"A bit of profit-taking may be starting to show its head in the euro, which maybe shows some nervousness ahead of these meetings and sensitivity to the [euro's] high price," Mr. [Tim Stewart] said. "But I still think you should hold core short dollar positions. The story's not over yet."
