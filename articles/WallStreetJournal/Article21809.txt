 China Lifts Control On Exchange Rate For Dollar, Yuan   By By James McGregor, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1993  China lifted a foreign exchange control that had driven much of the country's currency trading into the black market.  The State Administration for Exchange Control acknowledged yesterday that limits on the U.S. dollar exchange rate imposed in mid-February had been lifted the day before. The control, which capped the Chinese yuan-U.S. dollar exchange rate in official exchange centers at just above 8-to-1, was abolished without public announcement.  "It is our inclination to let supply and demand decide the exchange rate," said Li Zexing, deputy chief of the government body's exchange rate division. Mr. Li said a new cap hadn't been set, but added, "We retain the right to impose a new limit."
