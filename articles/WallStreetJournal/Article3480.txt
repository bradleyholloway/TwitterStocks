 Bin Laden Trail Extends to Swiss Outfit --- In Search for Financiers Is One Firm With Links To an Egyptian Group   By By Yaroslav Trofimov, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2001  On what actually happened to Al Taqwa in recent months, the versions of Mr. Nada and the Swiss investigators diverge. Mr. Nada says that Al Taqwa was liquidated at the end of last year for losses, and that his new company, Nada Management Organization, is a completely new entity. But Urs Zulauf, head of legal enforcement at the Swiss Banking Commission, said that his body investigated whether the Lugano-based Al Taqwa, a unit of the Bahamas banking company, was illegally operating as a bank on Swiss soil. That investigation ended in June, and, while no proof of such illegal activity was found, the commission told the Lugano firm to change its name to Nada Management to avoid confusion. In the meantime, Mr. Zulauf said, Bahamas authorities pulled the Al Taqwa Bank's license on the islands.
