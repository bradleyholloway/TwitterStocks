 Leading the News: Judge Dismisses SEC Proceeding Against Auditor   By By Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2002  Rather than wait until new nominees are confirmed to fill vacancies on the five-member commission, the SEC pressed ahead with the Ernst & Young action based only on the vote of Isaac Hunt. Mr. [Harvey Pitt], who represented the accounting firm in his private law practice, recused himself, as did Cynthia Glassman, who worked at Ernst & Young before joining the commission last year.  On May 20, the SEC alleged in a civil administrative proceeding that Ernst & Young's profit-making marketing agreement in the late 1990s with PeopleSoft prevented the accounting firm from serving as an unbiased auditor of the publicly traded company's books, a federally regulated role intended to protect the investing public. The case stems from a multiyear SEC investigation into Ernst & Young's auditing work for PeopleSoft, a Pleasanton, Calif., business-software developer.
