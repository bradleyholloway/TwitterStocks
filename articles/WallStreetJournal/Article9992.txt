 Home & Family: Shopping Around / Christmas Tree Stands   By Sara Schaefer Munoz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2006  IN MANY HOMES, now is the time to put up the Christmas tree, a ritual that can drive even the most harmonious couples to scream at each other "I said to the left!" Hoping to eliminate the repeated "Is it straight yet?" we tested several of the latest tree stands that promise to be easier to set up and more successful at keeping the tree stable. But only two out of four did away with the need to crawl on the floor and get under the tree.  Comment: The 30-pound steel device comes in a polished red and has three long legs that give a tall tree good stability. But it took a number of tries to get it straight and we still had to crawl under the tree. Still, when done, the tree stood up to the child tug test. With small children running around a towering tree, this is the stand we would want.
