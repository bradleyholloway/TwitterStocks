 A Mysterious Tale Is Best for a Winter Holiday   By By Tom Nolan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  Stephen Kendrick, the Universalist minister whose "Holy Clues: The Gospel According to Sherlock Holmes" was a clever hunt for traces of theology in the Holmes-[Arthur Conan Doyle] canon, now takes a leap of faith into fiction with "Night Watch," an inventive pastiche offering a hitherto unknown account, by John Watson, M.D., of a Holmes investigation in the winter of 1902.  Slyness is a survival skill in occupied France in 1942, the setting of "Kaleidoscope." In this engrossing series entry, J. Robert Janes's unlikely but believable team of French Surete's chief inspector Jean-Louis St-Cyr and the Gestapo's Hermann Kohler ("a damned good cop" and, luckily, "a bad Nazi") are sent to Provence the week before Christmas to solve the murder-by-crossbow of a woman who may have been smuggling black-market goods -- or Resistance fighters.  Charlene Weir's "A Cold Christmas," the latest in her series with Kansas police chief Susan Wren, also makes good use of a small-town setting. As Christmas nears, Ms. Wren's Hampstead is experiencing "the worst winter since Kansas became a state." Most of the police force is sick with flu when the corpse of a repairman is found stuffed into a basement furnace. The repairman was a creep, collecting morsels of scandal. He was also an enigma, with a made-up identity and a cache of cash. What was he up to? And who among Hampstead's citizens felt threatened enough to kill him?
