 Uncivil Rights   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2006  Women's groups are also in on the distortion. They're using statewide ads to claim that ending affirmative action would lead to an end to women's health clinics, programs to tutor girls in math and science, and funding for breast cancer treatment. There's one problem with these scare tactics: The initiative doesn't apply to health clinics or tutoring programs. Two states -- California and Washington -- have passed nearly identical initiatives, and there has been no negative effect on women's opportunities.  The opponents of Proposal 2 have also rolled out Tommy Amaker and Tom Izzo, the men's basketball coaches at Michigan and Michigan State University, respectively. They declared at a press conference that the initiative would hurt the university system by reducing "diversity." Once upon a time, the goal of civil rights legislation was equal opportunity. But with that goal largely achieved, the proponents of racial preferences have now moved the goalposts to "diversity" for its own sake. This sets race above other qualities, which erodes public confidence in individual merit as opposed to group rights.
