 U.S. Currency Continues Its Move Higher --- German Central Bank Fails To Intervene in Market As Traders Had Expected   By By Stephen Grover, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1985  In late New York trading, the dollar stood at a 12-year high of 3.2300 West German marks, up from 3.2220 marks Tuesday. The dollar also rose to more than 260 Japanese yen for the first time since November 1982, and it set a high of 9.8563 French francs. The British pound, which fell to $1.1120 yesterday from $1.1133 Tuesday, was at its second-lowest point ever.  But soon after noon, New York time, and after business had closed in Europe, the bankers were told to go home, traders said. "It may have been that the (West German central bank) was concerned that the (U.S.) Federal Reserve would take action to sop up reserves in its banking system," said Mory Ogata, a senior vice president and treasurer of Union Bank, Los Angeles. The Fed, if it withdraws funds or injects them into the system, usually does so between 11:45 a.m. and noon, New York time. Had it withdrawn reserves, it might have helped boost U.S. interest rates. That would have made dollar-denominated investments even more attractive than they already are, and thus made mark investments less appealing.
