 Tribune Adopts Takeover Defense After Bass Rumors   By By Francine Schwadel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1989  Tribune Co., adopting an increasingly popular anti-takeover defense, sold $350 million of a new series of convertible preferred stock to its employee stock ownership plan and said it would use the proceeds to buy back as many as eight million of its common shares.  The Bass rumors, as well as speculation that Tribune Co. might be considering a leveraged buy-out or a sale of its newsprint or broadcasting properties, have been pushing up the price of Tribune shares sharply. Spokesmen for both the Tribune Co. and Bass group, which recently bought a 40% stake in the St. Petersburg Times, declined to comment.
