 Motorist Mayhem: Drivers Are Turning Increasingly Violent --- Frustrations in Heavy Traffic Often Lead to Shootings; Getting Even vs. Survival   By By Monica Gonzales, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1987  On the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York, a red Honda flashes its high beams at a Mercedes driven by Arthur K. Salomon, 52 years old, a retired Salomon Brothers investment banker. Mr. Salomon steers over a lane to let the Honda pass.  But when the two cars later pull off at an exit, police say, the drivers exchange heated words. Mr. Salomon pulls out a pistol and wounds the other driver, Gianluca Cotugno, 19, with a shot in the abdomen.  Along the Eisenhower Expressway in Chicago, a Porsche attempts to pull off the shoulder ahead of a 1980 Mercury driven by Thomas Rotoloni. When Mr. Rotoloni fails to yield, the Porsche pulls alongside and the driver fires two shots. One bullet flattens Mr. Rotoloni's rear tire; the other shatters a window, grazing his chin.
