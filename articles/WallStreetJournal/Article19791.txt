 Creator of Show 'Blow Out' Weighs In on Reality Television   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2004  Mr. Silverman, 33 years old, is a newfangled Hollywood executive. His production and distribution company Reveille LLC, a joint venture with General Electric Co.'s Universal Television Group, has tried to shift the paradigms within the production world by relying on financing from Madison Avenue. For one of his recent creations, "The Restaurant," which ran on GE's NBC, Mr. Silverman joined forces with Interpublic Group of Cos.' Magna Global. Now, he is working with Robert Reisenberg, an Omnicom Group Inc. executive, to develop "The Club," a reality show about operating a nightclub on the Las Vegas strip.  Mr. Silverman: On "Blow Out" and "The Restaurant" we helped them staff it. The cast members are usually in stressful situations; you just don't focus on the boring ones. These are workplaces that attract people who tend to have dramatic personalities. One show is filmed in a Los Vegas nightclub, "The Restaurant" was filmed in New York and "Blow Out" was filmed in Beverly Hills -- that is three exciting places that have exciting people.  Mr. Silverman: No, I didn't. It's a soap opera, a show that takes time to build an audience. Just like "Blow Out" -- people take time to build relationships with characters. The show needed to stay in its time slot. When NBC aired the final two episodes back-to-back on Saturday night, ratings went up every half hour and it did really good ratings against Fox's "Cops." I just think if they had just stuck with it and kept it in a regular time slot, the audience would have stuck with it. That is how soap operas work. With network TV, they don't give much of a shot to anything nowadays because the marketplace is so aggressive.
