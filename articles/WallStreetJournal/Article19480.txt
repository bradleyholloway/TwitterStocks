 Wall Street Hopes Ford CEO Will Crank Up Company in Big Overhaul, Not Quick Fix   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2002  That nervousness and a jarring profit warning on Dec. 5 helped to push Ford shares to a 52-week low of $14.70 late last month. During the past few days, Ford shares have rebounded some from that low. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Ford was at $16.73, up 51 cents, fueled by encouraging industrywide car-sales figures as well as speculation about next week's announcement. But Ford's stock remains well below its 52-week high of $31.40, when the company was still viewed as the strongest in terms of sales and profitability of the Big Three.  Mr. [Bill Ford]'s relative youth and his affable persona make him easy to underestimate. Mr. Ford and his relatives control 40% of Ford's voting shares, and much of their personal wealth depends on Ford throwing off enough cash to pay a healthy dividend. But Mr. Ford hasn't shied from using his clout to end the careers of high-ranking executives who disappointed him, including Mr. [Jacques Nasser]. Mr. Ford has said that "everything is up for review" in assessing how to fix Ford's basic business.  To save cash, Ford in October halved its dividend, and more recently the company has signaled it is preparing to scale back or sell various noncore investments it made in recent years, such as its $1.8 billion purchase in 1999 of the United Kingdom-based Kwik-Fit chain of repair shops. Ford also has dumped stakes it acquired in U.S. auto dealerships and certain electronic-commerce ventures, including a stake in Internet Capital Group Inc. on which Ford lost nearly $50 million. Ford also unilaterally cut payments for certain contract workers.
