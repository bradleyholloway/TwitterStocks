 EU Rules Against France Telecom Over State Aid; Monti Demands Recovery Of at Least $995 Million; Paris Calls Benefits Proper   By Bryan-Low, Cassell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2004  France Telecom disputes the claim and says it will appeal to the European Court of Justice. The company -- which had net income of 3.2 billion euros in 2003 -- says for the time period of 1990 to 2001 it overpaid taxes by at least 1.7 billion euros. Jean-Yves Larrouturou, general secretary of France Telecom, said: "We are confident because we think we have all the elements to obtain a positive decision in the Court of Justice."  Mr. Monti backed away from pursuing an additional 7 billion euro payment after determining that while France's measures may have raised the value of the company's stocks and bonds, they did so without actually paying out state funds. The commission said "the statements created expectations and confidence on the financial markets and helped maintain France Telecom's investment rating."
