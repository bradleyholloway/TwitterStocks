Mr. Freeze, who grew up in New York and Utah, first visited Japan and learned Japanese as an 18-year-old Mormon missionary. After receiving an M.B.A. from the University of Hawaii, he found few recruiters coming to the Honolulu campus. When a friend decided to skip an interview with Japan's Nikko Securities, Mr. Freeze took over the time slot. Fast talking landed Mr. Freeze a Tokyo-based job selling Japanese stocks to foreigners.
