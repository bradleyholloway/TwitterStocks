 Germans Look Longingly at SEC Model --- Some Say Bills to Tighten Regulation of Markets Don't Go Far Enough   By By Alfred Kueppers, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2001  The legislation comes as Germany's nascent shareholding culture is being battered by the collapse of its Neuer Markt, which was meant to be a Nasdaq-like board for new companies. The index of the Frankfurt-based market has fallen 58% this year -- to an all-time low this week -- in part because of several scandals that further soured investor interest. Among those was the arrest of the former co-chief executives of Infomatec AG on charges of insider trading, and the admission by the former chief executive of EM.TV & Merchandising AG that he sold shares despite a lock-up agreement he had with a German bank.  Shareholder protection in Germany is still in its infancy. Right now, the regulator, known as the BAWe, is authorized to investigate insider trading, but not share-price manipulation. It also must forward its insider-trading evidence to local courts that often lack the expertise to effectively prosecute the cases. For this reason, politicians, executives and shareholder activists would like to see a central prosecuting authority for financial misconduct. This is currently not permitted under the decentralized German legal system, which turns over such powers to Germany's 16 states.  Another problem: In the U.S., the SEC has the authority to bring financial cases to civil courts or send them to an administrative law judge who deals solely with financial crimes. No such courts exist in Germany.
