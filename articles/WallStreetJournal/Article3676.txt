 Terror-Alert Level Raised on Threat Of More Attacks   By By David S. Cloud and Nicholas Kulish, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  U.S. intelligence agencies have come up with evidence that planners of last week's bombings were operating from Iran, according to a U.S. official. Telephone calls from inside Iran were made before and after the attacks to al Qaeda operatives suspected of involvement in the car bombings, the official said. The evidence indicates suspected al Qaeda member Saef al-Adel, an Egyptian who has emerged as one of the group's key operational planners, was involved in the Saudi strikes, which killed eight Americans.  Through British intermediaries, the U.S. has asked Iranian authorities about intelligence that some of the planners of last week's bombings were operating from Iran, according to a U.S. official. Britain, unlike the U.S., has diplomatic relations with Tehran. Iranian government officials initially denied the reports, the official said, but told the British that they would investigate further.  The FBI sent out an alert yesterday to more than 18,000 U.S. law-enforcement agencies cautioning officers around the country that al Qaeda still has the capability and the desire to carry off an attack in the U.S. and against Western and U.S. interests abroad.
