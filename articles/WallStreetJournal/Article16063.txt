 O'Connor's Remarks On Death Penalty Could Bolster Bills   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2001  Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's recent questioning of the death penalty's fairness could bolster congressional efforts to expand the rights of capital-case defendants and death-row inmates.  Justice O'Connor, widely seen as a swing vote on the high court, told a group of female lawyers in Minneapolis on Monday that "the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed." She said defendants with more money receive better legal representation, and that DNA testing should be more widely available to inmates facing execution.  In the first of those cases, a North Carolina man is petitioning for an outright ban on executing the mentally retarded. The court, in a June 4 ruling written by Justice O'Connor, overturned the death sentence of a retarded Texas man on procedural issues.
