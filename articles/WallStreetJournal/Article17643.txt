 Lewis's Upset Runoff Victory Over Bond May Mark New Political Bloc in Atlanta   By By Timothy K. Smith and Linda Williams, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  In Georgia's Fifth Congressional District, where black municipal politics may be more thoroughly evolved than anywhere else in the U.S., John Lewis won a race he wasn't supposed to win with a coalition that wasn't supposed to coalesce.  The plain-spoken sharecropper's son and former aide to Martin Luther King Jr. took the Democratic nomination Tuesday from Julian Bond, an embodiment of black middle-class sophistication. And he did it with the most unusual alliance of voters: poor blacks and rich whites.  Poor blacks supported Mr. Lewis because the black political establishment has "failed to deliver to the man on the street," says Mr. King. Whites supported him because they too wanted to register displeasure with the administration of Mayor Andrew Young, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and the only black so far to have held the Fifth Congressional seat.
