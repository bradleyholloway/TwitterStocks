 Ryanair Loses Case Over Ads   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2005  The jury said that in cases where the words "excluding tax" appeared, Ryanair wasn't guilty of misleading customers, validating its practice of advertising prices that don't include tax.  "This was an unnecessary action against Ryanair," the company said. "This case was brought on the basis of no complaint by a member of the public. Our Web-site page clearly shows consumers that prices quoted are exclusive of taxes and charges. The Web site also includes details of the taxes and charges to be paid by the consumer."
