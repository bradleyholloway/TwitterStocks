 Accounting-Change Plan Given Swift Approval Becomes Battleground of Bells, AT&T and MCI   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1999  Lobbyists for the Baby Bells sold the idea on Capitol Hill as an innocuous change that would simplify the way local phone companies keep their financial books. And it quietly won swift approval in both the House and Senate.  But now the Bells' desire to save $270 million a year -- peanuts in their multibillion-dollar business -- has triggered a fierce lobbying battle pitting local phone companies against nearly every other big player in the phone business. Long-distance carriers, regulators and consumer groups are howling that the proposed change would slow the onset of competition and cost consumers billions of dollars in higher phone rates.  At the center of the controversy lies a complex set of regulations that dates to the 1930s. Under the 1934 Telecommunications Act, companies that dominate their markets, like the Bells locally, must keep financial books that conform to a uniform accounting standard set by the federal government. The standard dictates how the carriers should do everything from categorizing their investments to depreciating their assets. Regulators use the data to set rates that carriers charge each other and consumers, and to determine which companies qualify for subsidies under a federal program to provide affordable phone service to all Americans.
