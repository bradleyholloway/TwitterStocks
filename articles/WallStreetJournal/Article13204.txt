 On a Different Coast, New Orleans Jazz Plays On   By Berlau, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  A slender redhead in her 50s, Ms. [Banu Gibson] strongly believes in the saying "the show must go on" and once sang with bronchial pneumonia when she could barely stand. This gig, however, was her hardest by far. "I almost have survivor's guilt being here," she says. "I see all of my city underwater, and I see so many people dead, and I'm sure I know some of them. So it's very difficult to go and perform like this. But there's a great healing power in music."  For her first number, she marked recent events with wry humor. "It seemed like I needed to acknowledge that I was working under duress," she says. As she sang the opening lyrics to "There'll Be Some Changes Made" -- "Change in the weather. Change in the sea. From now on, there'll be a change in me . . . " -- the audience burst into applause.  Throughout the performances, there were acknowledgements of the disaster and of New Orleans's contributions to jazz. Herb Jeffries, age 93, who had been a singer with the band of the great Duke Ellington, urged audience members to give and told about meeting New Orleans jazz pioneer Sidney Bechet and hearing about how the music was created. In one of the audience-organized "lobby jams," pianist Brad Kay dedicated "The Pearls" by Jelly Roll Morton to "our friends in New Orleans."
