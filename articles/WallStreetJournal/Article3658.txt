 The Assault on Iraq: Lightweight Marine Went AWOL Then Took Heavy Journey to Iraq   By By Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2003  Being a Marine rifleman was never going to be easy for [Leo Kendall]. At 5-foot-7, the 21-year-old weighs just 120 pounds. His endurance isn't great, and he isn't a natural fighter, unlike the 200-pound warriors who surround him. But his father was a Marine in Vietnam, and his oldest brother is a Marine at Camp Pendleton, Calif., and ever since he was an 11-year-old growing up in Enfield, Conn., Lance Cpl. Kendall wanted to be one, too.  He survived the first long desert march, or "hump" as the Marines call them. But soon he started to fall behind, drawing the ire of his hard-driving fire-team leader, Cpl. Dennis Osborne, 21, of Cincinnati, who issued the usual expletive-laced Marine encouragement to stragglers. Halfway through the second hump -- around five miles in the August heat with a 60-plus pound load -- Lance Cpl. Kendall keeled over face first in the sand, and ended up on an intravenous drip. A week later, he had to carry his own weight -- a 120-pound pack -- on a three-miler, uphill. No more than 200 yards out, he was again flat on his face, and ended up in the battalion aid station.  Within hours, Lance Cpl. Kendall was in his car, heading back to Twentynine Palms. He surrendered to First Sgt. Stephen Francois, Kilo Company's senior noncommissioned officer, explaining that he had been worried he would let his comrades down. The First Sergeant was surprisingly calm -- and lenient, punishing Lance Cpl. Kendall with 14 days of restriction to his barracks room.
