 Market Manipulation, Particularly Online, Is Way Up, SEC Says   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  Overall, Mr. [Richard Walker] said, the SEC is bringing fewer cases against broker-dealers for manipulating the market, typically with "pump-and-dump" schemes that artificially pump up a stock price, allowing the brokers to dump their own holdings at a profit.  Accounting and financial fraud, a hot-button issue for SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, accounted for about 20% of the agency's fiscal 2000 caseload. Accounting fraud generated about 100 SEC cases in 2000, a 10% increase over the prior year.
