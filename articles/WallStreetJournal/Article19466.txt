 Your Career Matters: Amid Downturn, More Companies Cut Pay, Benefits   By By Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2001  Ford Motor Co. announced yesterday that it will eliminate its 60-cents-per-dollar matching contributions to salaried staffers' 401(k) savings plans, suspend merit raises for about 2,200 senior executives and increase out-of-pocket costs for certain salaried employee and retiree health plans. It also is evaluating how deeply it should cut its 45,000-person salaried work force.  In August, Agilent reported a big fiscal third-quarter loss and plans to eliminate 4,000 jobs, or 9% of its work force. Ned Barnholt, Agilent's chief executive, characterized the downturn as the worst he had seen in his 34 years with Agilent and Hewlett-Packard.  Last month, Agilent decided to cut 4,000 more jobs and again impose a temporary 10% pay cut on 1,800 senior managers. (The first reduction ended Nov. 1 for everyone except the company's roughly 200 top executives and officers.) Starting next Feb. 1, the rest of Agilent's white-collar work force faces a 5% temporary pay cut, while hourly workers will work one day a month without pay. Ms. [Amy Flores] has no idea how long the latest pay rollback will last. Nevertheless, she says, "employees have been supportive of the pay cuts."
