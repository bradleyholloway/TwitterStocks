 Ultrashort Bond Funds Offer Option for Interest-Rate Blues   By Kim, Jane J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2005  Ultrashort funds have an average duration of one year or less, while short-term funds typically maintain a slightly longer duration of two to three years. Interest in ultrashort funds has accelerated amid the low interest-rate environment, which has sent annual yields for the average money-market fund to below 1%. Companies also have piqued investor interest by rolling out ultrashort options and lowering fees for existing ones.  Last month, Charles Schwab Corp. added two tax-free ultrashort bond funds to its YieldPlus family of taxable ultrashort bond funds. And Midanek/Pak Advisors launched the Midanek/Pak Ultrashort Duration Fund in October.  That is why it is important for investors who can't stomach any loss in principal to read a fund's prospectus to see what types of bonds the fund buys. The Midanek/Pak Ultrashort Duration Fund, for example, holds a mix of triple-A-rated debt and invests at least 50% of its assets in government securities. But the Strong Ultra Short-Term Income Fund historically has bought more midquality bonds, which helped boost yields but also hurt the fund in some years by credit blowups, says Morningstar's Mr. [Eric Jacobson]. For example, 2001 and 2002 were "very poor years" for the fund given that Qwest, WorldCom and AT&T Canada were three of its worst problem bonds, he notes.
