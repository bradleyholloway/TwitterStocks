 Commerzbank Takes Provision Of $874.5 Million for Bad Loans   By By Marcus Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2002  Commerzbank's loan exposure to Kirch hovers at roughly 300 million euros, with more than 200 million euros of that amount collateralized by film rights, according to an insider at the bank. Commerzbank hasn't set aside any provisions against its Kirch exposure, a spokesman said.  Commerzbank has also lost a 140 million-euro loan to construction group Philipp Holzmann AG, which collapsed last month. Unlike rival German banks such as Deutsche Bank AG and HVB Group AG, Commerzbank had no exposure to other recent high-profile bankruptcy filings, including Enron Corp. and U.S.-German regional jet maker Fairchild Dornier. But Commerzbank has suffered from its heavy lending to small and midsize companies in Germany.
