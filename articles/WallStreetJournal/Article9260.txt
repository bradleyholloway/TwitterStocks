 `Unusable' Voter Rolls   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  Al Gore may oppose tobacco, but his Wisconsin campaign apparently thinks it's the best way to drag some people to the polls. WISN-TV (themilwaukeechannel.com) has some arresting footage catching Gore campaign volunteers in the act of distributing packs of cigarettes to homeless voters after they'd been given rides to cast absentee ballots. A Milwaukee Rescue Mission employee told WISN that he asked Democratic workers to leave after he caught them trying to bribe potential voters with cigarettes. After viewing WISN's videotape, the local Gore campaign said the volunteers were "acting on their own" and had left the state.  Motor voter has helped fuel an explosion of phantom voters. Between 1994 and 1998, nearly 26 million names have been added to the voter rolls nationwide, a nearly 20% increase. The bipartisan polling team of Ed Goeas and Celinda Lake says that perhaps only 5% of those who register when they get licenses routinely vote, which artificially drives down voter turnout. Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, supports national voter registration, but says voter lists from around the country "are virtually unusable" and "more inaccurate than they have ever been."
