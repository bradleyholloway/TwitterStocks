 Goldman Sachs Abandons Policy It Says Hurt Growth in Commercial Paper Field   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1987  Goldman, Sachs & Co. decided to abandon a long-cherished policy that officials now believe has stymied the large securities firm's growth in the booming commercial paper business.  Under the policy, Goldman told companies and other commercial paper issuers they must either choose it as their sole dealer or choose someone else if they wanted to use multiple dealers. But Goldman officials concluded this strategy was forcing them to miss out on too much valuable business.  As a result, Goldman officials say the firm's management committee recently agreed to allow exceptions on a case-by-case basis. "There are people with very large programs who want to use us in addition to other firms, but because of the rigidity of our policy, we had to pass," said John P. Curtin Jr., chairman of Goldman Sachs Money Markets Inc.
