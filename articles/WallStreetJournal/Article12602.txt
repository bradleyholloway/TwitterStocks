 What's News: New England   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2000  In Maine, striking members of the 4,800-member International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted down a tentative agreement reached between its leaders and Bath Iron Works. A union negotiator said workers were unhappy with offers on their pensions, health plan and work rules. The rejection sends the strike into its second week. A subsidiary of General Dynamics Corp. of Falls Church, Va., Bath Iron Works is one of the largest private employers in Maine and builds Aegis destroyers for the Navy.  Because of the surge in prices of oil and natural gas, fuels used to make electricity, Rhode Island's Public Utilities Commission approved a request by Narragansett Electric Co. of Providence to immediately raise rates by 4% and another 10% effective Oct. 1. (The utility is a subsidiary of Britain's National Grid Group PLC.) The agency also approved a 32% rate increase that will hit natural-gas customers of Valley Resources Inc. of Cumberland, R.I. With gas prices rising so rapidly, Valley warned it may seek another increase soon. In Massachusetts, three utilities asked for double-digit rate increases beginning Oct. 1. The three are the Boston Edison and Commonwealth Electric subsidiaries of Nstar, Boston, and National Grid's Massachusetts Electric Co. subsidiary.
