 Theater: Broadway Musical Heads Overseas   By By Dale Harris, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 9, 1988  Moscow -- Next month, a revised version of Duke Ellington's "Sophisticated Ladies," originally presented on Broadway in 1981, will set forth on a lengthy world-wide tour. In the days when home-grown musicals were more or less synonymous with the American theater, a tour like this would have seemed perfectly natural. In the age of Andrew Lloyd Webber, it's an anachronism.  True, "Sophisticated Ladies" hardly is a musical in the classic sense. Like "Ain't Misbehavin' " or the forthcoming "Black and Blue" and "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," it's an anthology musical, a collage of favorite musical numbers. This approach enables producers to serve up material that already has won the public's approval and is likely to do so again. Such shows make a strong appeal to those longing for the kind of tunefulness that was once the chief glory of the Broadway musical.  Muscovites, at any rate, appear to do so. In the Soviet capital, where this revival began its career at the Rossiya Theater last October, there were murmurs of delight as soon as the band launched into the first bars of the title song, as well as of "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" and "I'm Beginning to See the Light." Throughout the evening, there were people humming along during the introductions, with others snapping their fingers in time to the beat. The moment the musicians struck up with "When You Take the 'A' Train" (written by Billy Strayhorn, rather than by Ellington, but adopted by the latter as his theme song during the '50s and '60s) the whole house broke into applause.
