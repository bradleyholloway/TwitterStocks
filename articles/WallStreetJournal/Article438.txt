 breakingviews / Insights on Investing: Is Blackstone Setting a Bridge Too Far?; The Equity Office Deal Uses Loan Strategy That Prompts Memory of Federated Fiasco   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2006  So why would the banks take on such risk? For the same reason First Boston did -- the fees. It received over $125 million in fees from Federated. At the time, First Boston's leading deal-maker, Bruce Wasserstein, hailed a new era of investment banking. Blackstone's backers prefer not to talk. Given the vast spoils on offer, it's understandable why Goldman, Bear and Bank of America are risking their shareholders' capital. But this is a hot potato they have to pass on before the music stops.  Though software contracting isn't a particularly highly paid industry, two of Infosys' American competitors, Accenture and Electronic Data Systems, paid their top managers $6.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in 2005. Shareholders don't get extra value for money when paying top dollar for U.S. managers. Infosys' competitors are perfectly decent companies, but Infosys' two top managers, Narayana Murthy and Nandan Nilekani, are giants of the industry who founded the company in 1978 and have built it to a $29 billion market value. Admittedly they also own enough Infosys shares to be worth $1 billion or so, but other senior managers at Infosys don't get paid a fortune, either.  Smaller Nintendo can't afford this arms race. So it has opted out. Its new Wii console doesn't even support high-definition graphics. If you're a hardcore gamer who loves seeing blood spatter in 3D, this isn't the machine for you.
