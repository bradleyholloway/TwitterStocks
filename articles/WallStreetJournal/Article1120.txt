 Solid Growth Sets Stage For Higher Europe Rates; ECB Hints at March Rise After Bank of England Tightens in Surprise Move   By Perry, Joellen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2007  The European Central Bank, meantime, fulfilled expectations and left interest rates for the 13 countries that share the euro on hold at a five-year high of 3.5%. But ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said rates remain "low" and stressed he wouldn't dissuade markets from expecting a further quarter-point rise in March.  The Bank of England's surprise increase could indicate that December's consumer-price inflation rate, due out Tuesday, will be higher than expected. "The most likely explanation is that they know next week's number will be a shocker," said Michael Saunders, United Kingdom economist at Citigroup in London.  Increased domestic demand and corporate investment, for instance, helped propel gross-domestic-product growth in Germany, Europe's largest economy, to a six-year high of 2.7% last year after adjusting for two fewer workdays, according to the Federal Statistics Office. But France's widening trade deficit and a fall in industrial output, reported earlier this week, are fueling fears about waning competitiveness in the euro-area's second-largest economy.
