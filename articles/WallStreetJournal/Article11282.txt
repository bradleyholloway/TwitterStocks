 Trade Talks Between U.S., Japan May Face Some Rough Sledding Ahead   By By Elisabeth Rubinfien, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1989  The success of the talks, which seek to break down structural impediments built into the Japanese economy that the U.S. says curtail Japan's imports and keep its trade surplus high, have been described by both sides as "crucial."  The talks grew out of the realization that despite changes in exchange rates and years of haggling over Japanese market access for foreign products, the $50 billion bilateral trade imbalance hadn't shrunk. Inspired by a relatively successful series of negotiations on expanding and opening Japan's capital markets, the U.S. proposed to look at deeper "structural" aspects of Japan's economy.  President Bush and Japan's former prime minister Sosuke Uno agreed in July to begin talks in which each side would point out problems in the other's economy. The goal was to develop a concrete plan for dismantling barriers and counteracting systems that both sides agree stand in the way of improving the trade imbalance.
