 S&P Bond Rating For Yonkers, N.Y., Is to Be Affirmed   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1988  NEW YORK (AP) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. plans to affirm its triple-B rating on the city of Yonkers, N.Y., general obligation bonds, according to an official at the rating concern.  Federal Judge Leonard B. Sand of Manhattan Tuesday found Yonkers in contempt for opposing a court-ordered housing desegregation plan; he ordered the city to pay escalating fines.  Standard & Poor's affirmation of its Yonkers' bond rating would be based on the rating concern's evaluation of the 1976 legislation that set up the debt-service mechanism for the repayment of Yonkers' general obligation debt, according to Rich Marino, assistant vice president of municipal finance at S&P.
