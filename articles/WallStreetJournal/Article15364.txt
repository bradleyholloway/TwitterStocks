 The PC Bible   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1995  Language of abuse and servitude is also out. Hence, "slaves" become "enslaved people"; and parents "guide," not "discipline," their children, who in turn are told to "heed," not "obey," their parents. References to "circumcision" are vexing, but the editors sadly concede that they can't come up with an adequate gender-free substitute.  The big challenge comes in how to deal with God him-, her-, it-self. The editors' solution is to ban pronouns and keep repeating the genderless word "God." The words "Lord" and "King" are also taboo ("Ruler" or "Sovereign" is substituted), and the patriarchal "Kingdom of God" becomes "Dominion of God." As for God the "Father," in this version, it's always "Father-Mother." Satan -- feminists take note -- gets similar gender-free treatment.  References to Jesus pose particular problems of their own. The words "he" and "son" are permitted in mentions of Jesus's life on earth. But the pre-existent and post-crucifixion Christ gets no gender. "Master" becomes "Teacher" and the doubly offensive "Son of Man" become "the Human One."
