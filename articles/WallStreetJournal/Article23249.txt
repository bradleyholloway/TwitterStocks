 Morgan Stanley Seeks SEC Figure To Fill Legal Post   By Ann Davis and Susanne Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2005  It is unclear if either Mr. [William McLucas] or Mr. [Stephen Cutler] is interested in the job. Messrs. McLucas and Cutler both said they couldn't discuss their plans. A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment. Mr. [Donald Kempf] didn't return calls for this article.  Morgan Stanley first approached Mr. McLucas last fall about the job in anticipation that Mr. Kempf might retire at year end. It backed off the search when Mr. Kempf decided to stay for at least another year, the people familiar with the search say. The effort to lure Mr. McLucas resumed after Morgan Stanley named a new vice chairman, David Heleniak, last month and gave him oversight of legal and other matters. Mr. Heleniak and Mr. McLucas have known each other for years.
