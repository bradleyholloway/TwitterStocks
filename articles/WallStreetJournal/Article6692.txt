 Eyes on the Road: Is Initial Quality Still Relevant?; Gains Across the Board Reduce The Gap Between Auto Makers Online edition  By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  Among the most improved: DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz. The German luxury brand slashed its problems per 100 score to 111 (putting it in fifth place) from 139 problems per 100 and 25th place in 2006. "We have never seen this" big a jump in one year, says J.D. Power's Joe Ivers.  The study compiles consumer responses to detailed questionnaires about "problems" encountered with new vehicles within 90 days of purchase. The study's methodology has evolved over the years to take into account such things as the distinction between a "dead by the roadside" failure and a customer's dissatisfaction with certain design choices (such as the German reluctance to take cupholders seriously.)  Mr. Ivers counters that there are other ways to look at the results. One problem can be enough to surpass "the customer threshold of pain" and result in damage to a brand, he says. "It's absolutely not just decimal dots," he says. "It tends to have a very huge effect on warranty costs." Mechanical issues remain about half of all problems, he adds.
