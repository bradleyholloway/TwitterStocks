 The outlook: Forbes's flat-tax plan will be a tough sell   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1996  Critics of presidential candidate Steve Forbes's flat tax plan say that it would slash home prices by 15%, because it would not allow a tax deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes. However, many economists predict that interest rates would fall if the flat tax were enacted, perhaps enough to compensate for the loss of the deduction. Others argue that Forbes's 17% tax rate would have to be raised in order to keep the plan from adding to the budget deficits.
