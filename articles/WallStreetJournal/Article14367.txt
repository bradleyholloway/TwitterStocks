 NASD Is Planning Automated System For 'Pink Sheets'   By By Priscilla Ann Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1987  The National Association of Securities Dealers is planning an automated price quotation system for as many as 30,000 over-the-counter stocks on which dealers previously could get quotes only once a day.  He estimates that 8,600 issues will trade on "Non-Nasdaq," as the new system has been dubbed. Nearly 4,400 stocks trade on the NASD's current automated quotation system, known as Nasdaq.  The new system means that investors will be able to obtain from stock brokerage firms changing price quotations throughout the day on thinly traded stocks, including many penny stocks, along with some large, closely held companies that trade infrequently and don't meet Nasdaq trading requirements.
