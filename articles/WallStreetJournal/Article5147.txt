 Brokers, Exchanges Asked About Policies On Phone Solicitation   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1994  Mr. Markey's letter follows a report released by the subcommittee on July 15, which showed that 20% of all telemarketing companies don't have a written policy concerning "do-not-call" lists. These lists are established and maintained by individual companies, and consumers who are aware of the law can request to be placed on the lists. Thirty-five percent of those responding to the survey don't formulate internal "do-not-call" lists.
