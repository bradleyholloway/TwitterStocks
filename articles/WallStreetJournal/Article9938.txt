 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- details: Cosmetics Makers Turning to Stone   By Boncompagni, Tatiana, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2006  Formulations have been around for decades, but they were mostly sold in plastic surgeons' offices to postoperative patients. Vendors say they're selling well and are introducing new lines. Jane Iredale, a Great Barrington, Mass., maker of mineral-based makeup since 1994, says retail sales reached $70 million in 2005, up 36% from the previous year. Some retailers say its $19 PureGloss lip gloss, which contains organic vegetable oil along with minerals, can be used as an overnight moisturizer. Earlier this year, Bare Escentuals in San Francisco -- its marketing materials say "you can sleep in it" -- introduced a nighttime treatment called RareMinerals ($60 for 0.15 ounce), made from 72 varieties. This year, French beauty brand L'Oreal Paris introduced Bare Naturale, a powder foundation ($15.25 for 0.35 ounce) with a "natural SPF 19."
