 In Rome, Some Cardinals Seem to Be Running for Pope   By Galloni, Alessandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2005  "They're all here to give back to the pope all the love the pope gave to the world," Cardinal [Tarcisio Bertone] said before reporters and TV cameras. The 70-year-old Cardinal Bertone is considered a "papabile," a "pope-able" contender for the Vatican. He recently raised his international profile by organizing a seminar calling for a boycott of Dan Brown's best-selling novel, "The Da Vinci Code," which some perceive to be anti-Catholic.  "How much filth there is in the church, and even among those in the priesthood," he thundered during his sermon, in what some observers interpreted as a reference to the recent sex scandals in the U.S. Catholic Church, a trauma that many Catholics believe the Vatican handled badly. "How much hubris," he added. Cardinal [Joseph Ratzinger], who was one of [John Paul II]'s closest advisers, also greeted pilgrims at the Vatican this week, making a sign of the cross on their heads.  To be sure, the papabili aren't openly declaring themselves candidates for the job. And other voting cardinals now gathering in Rome reject the notion that anything like a "campaign" has begun. The "novemdiales," or nine days, that follow a pope's death are supposed to be marked by reflection and prayer.
