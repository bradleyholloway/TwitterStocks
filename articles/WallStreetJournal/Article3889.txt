 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2005  A: The answer depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. The IRS says you generally can't deduct expenses for "unnecessary cosmetic surgery." This includes "any procedure that is directed at improving the patient's appearance and does not meaningfully promote the proper function of the body or prevent or treat illness or disease." For example, you generally can't include in medical expenses the amount for procedures such as "face lifts, hair transplants, hair removal (electrolysis), teeth whitening and liposuction."  You can include in your medical expenses amounts you pay for cosmetic surgery "if it is necessary to improve a deformity arising from, or directly related to, a congenital abnormality, a personal injury resulting from an accident or trauma, or a disfiguring disease." The IRS offers an example: Surgery to reconstruct a breast removed to treat cancer "corrects a deformity directly related to the disease." So the surgery cost "is includible" in medical expenses.
