 Your Annuity's `Death Benefits' May Be Overkill   By By Ellen E. Schultz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1998  If you die with a loss in your annuity, the death benefit ensures your heirs will get back at least your initial investment, minus any withdrawals. In the past year, brokers have emphasized death benefits to risk-averse investors, and the feature might be one of the primary reasons that people are buying annuities, now that this year's drop in the long-term capital-gains rate has trimmed the tax benefits of annuities compared with other investments. Variable annuities are designed as retirement products, with a basket of mutual-fund-like investment portfolios.  Critics have noted that while it might make sense to own an umbrella in Arizona -- it does rain in the desert, however infrequently -- the death benefit is rarely triggered, even though an investor is paying a fee for it. "You don't buy an annuity for the death benefit," says Ellen Rinaldi, principal at Vanguard Group's variable-annuities unit.  While others in the annuity industry acknowledge that the death benefit is rarely used, they say the feature has psychological benefits. "What the death benefit does is give the policyholder the confidence to invest in equity funds with the knowledge that if they were to die while the market is down, and the value of their account is down, their family would be protected," says Mark Mackey, president of the National Association for Variable Annuities, a trade group in Reston, Va.
