 Turkish War Drums   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2007  Note the timing of yesterday's theatrics. The Kurdish problem has festered for years but isn't as bad as when Abdullah Ocalan, since apprehended, led the PKK. The PKK is a big wedge issue, however, in Turkey's current political struggle. The Islamic-rooted, ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, is pitted against the secular establishment, led by the military. The army brass is happy to make the AKP look indecisive and weak ahead of parliamentary elections next month. The military's commander promised an incursion at an April press conference, without consulting with the government. The media also feed the populist fires, putting the AKP -- inclined to caution here -- in a tight spot.
