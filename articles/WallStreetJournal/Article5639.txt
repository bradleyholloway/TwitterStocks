 SEC Probes Fund Sales Via Brokers   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1998  The Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a detailed look into the way mutual funds are sold through brokerage firms to determine if fund companies improperly compensate firms that distribute their funds to small investors.  The SEC examination of mutual-fund distribution began about six months ago, when officials from the commission's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations began visiting fund companies on the issue, people close to the matter say. A big question on the SEC's mind: Are fund companies directing stock and bond trading through brokerage firms that go out of their way to distribute their funds?  An SEC spokesman wouldn't comment on the continuing examinations, but fund companies are concerned about what the inspection might turn up, people close to the matter say. In recent years, the SEC has become increasingly skittish about relationships between big brokerage firms and fund companies, particularly so-called load funds that are sold through intermediaries and charge commissions. One issue that has caught the SEC's eye is "exclusivity agreements," in which fund companies pay a fee to a brokerage firm to have its funds pitched over other comparable investments.
