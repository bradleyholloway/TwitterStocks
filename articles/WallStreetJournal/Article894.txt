 Reebok's Chairman Got Bonus Totaling $12.7 Million in '86 --- Sum Reflects Strong Showing By Athletic Shoemaker; Could Have Been Double   By By Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  CANTON, Mass. -- Reebok International Ltd. made big strides in 1986. Chairman Paul Fireman didn't do badly either.  On top of his regular salary of $363,931, Mr. Fireman received a bonus of $12.7 million, according to the company's proxy statement, issued yesterday.  That sum reflects an agreement under which Mr. Fireman is entitled to an annual bonus equal to 5% of the amount by which the company's annual pre-tax earnings exceeds $20 million. Pre-tax earnings for the maker of athletic shoes soared to $261.2 million in 1986 from $78.1 million in 1985, while net sales jumped to $919.4 million from $307 million.
