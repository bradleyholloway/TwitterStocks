 Questioning the Books: SBC Pension Fund to Boost Bottom Line   By By Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2002  By raising the expected return on its pension investments by one percentage point to 9.5% and slightly altering its inflation assumptions, the local phone company is likely to add eight cents to earnings per share this year, according to a report by Goldman Sachs Group & Co. analyst Frank Governali. Mr. Governali said SBC made the change as its fund investments fell 7% last year.  In 2001, SBC's more generous assumptions about pension investments accounted for two-thirds of the growth in its operating earnings per share, according to Mr. Governali's report. Operating earnings rose nine cents, with six cents coming from the changed pension assumptions. The operating figures exclude a variety of charges and gains and don't conform to standard accounting. In 2001, the San Antonio company's net income was $7.26 billion, or $2.13 a share, on revenue of $45.91 billion. That compares with net income of $7.97 billion, or $2.32 a share, in 2000, when revenue was $51.37 billion.  SBC, has moved from being one of the most conservative in its assumptions on pension fund returns to being slightly more aggressive than most of its peers, Mr. Governali said, though he added its assumptions are still well within normal range.
