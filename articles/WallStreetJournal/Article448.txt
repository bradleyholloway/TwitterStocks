 Stocks Can't Stand Success; S&P Tests a High Again, Dives   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2007  Stocks initially surged, partly due to news that new-home sales leapt in April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 98.90 points in the first 40 minutes, but then faded, finishing down 84.52 points, or 0.6%, at 13441.13, a swing of 183 points. It was the Dow's biggest point or percentage drop in two weeks. The Dow remains up 7.8% this year.  "Going into these long weekends, people used to worry about a terrorist attack. That fear is long gone. Now people worry that some big company will get taken out and the market will go up and they won't benefit," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at New York brokerage firm Cowen & Co. Multibillion-dollar takeovers by big private investment firms have spawned hopes that stock demand will remain robust, despite higher prices.
