 PURSUITS; Books -- With 'Friends' Like These: A Need for a Roman a Clef   By Phillips, Barbara D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2007  [Robby Benson] is probably best known to baby boomers as the actor who brought an earnest boyishness to starring roles in such 1970s films as "Ode to Billy Joe" and "Ice Castles." Younger generations know his voice as that of the Beast in Disney's "Beauty and the Beast." Over the years, he has shared movie marquees with Paul Newman and Jack Lemmon; directed several dozen sitcom episodes (of "Friends" and "Ellen," among others); and taught at colleges far from California. He is enough of a Hollywood type that he and his wife named their son Zephyr and their daughter Lyric, yet enough of an exception still to be married to the mother of his children after many years.
