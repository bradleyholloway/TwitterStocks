 U.S. Investigates Counterfeiting Of Rare Wines; Auctioneer Christie's, Others Are Subpoenaed; Liability Issues Loom   By Wilke, John R, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2007  Mr. [Richard Brierley], head of [Christie]'s wine department in the U.S., said growing awareness of the problem has made collectors and merchants more cautious. "People should be confident buying from reputable auction houses. It's a public forum that protects buyers."  The federal investigation and civil lawsuits could draw in some well-known names in wine. Michael Broadbent, a Christie's board member and author of a widely used wine-tasting reference book, is among those who have vouched for Mr. [Rodenstock]; the German's tastings are legendary for the rarity of the vintages, and are widely cited in wine books.  Christie's declined to make Mr. Broadbent available for comment and he couldn't be reached. But in the catalog for a glittering wine auction held in New York's Rockefeller Plaza in December, Christie's continued to tout Mr. Broadbent's tasting notes from a Rodenstock dinner. He described a 1934 Petrus Bordeaux as exceptional, "deeply coloured, very rich . . . where Hardy Rodenstock gets these wines I know not. There are simply no records of production, of stock or sales prior to 1945."
