 German Utilities RWE, VEW Plan $21 Billion Merger --- Stock-Swap Deal Will Vault Outfit To No. 1 in Europe   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporter William Boston and Handelsblatt correspondents Erwin Schneider and Heinz Juergen Schuermann, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1999  DUESSELDORF, Germany -- Utilities RWE AG and VEW AG have agreed to merge via a share swap that puts a preliminary value on VEW of about 19 billion euros ($21 billion) and will vault RWE back to the No. 1 spot in a ranking of Europe's publicly traded power groups, people familiar with the situation said.  RWE was briefly knocked from the top position when Veba AG and Viag AG, Germany's No. 2 and No. 3 energy groups, agreed to merge last month. But the Essenbased RWE vowed to go on the acquisition trail to reclaim that spot. RWE and VEW are located in the Ruhr Valley and are rivals, but their businesses make a snug fit. The merger will create an electricity and natural-gas powerhouse with combined sales of more than 43 billion eurosabout the size of the core energy division of Veba-Viag-and a work force of about 170,000 employees, and will generate more than 210 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year.
