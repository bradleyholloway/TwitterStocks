 United Technologies Breakup Value Becomes A Figure of Interest for Analysts and Investors   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  For the first time since Mr. Gray began putting together the high-tech conglomerate in 1972, Wall Street analysts have begun calculating the breakup value of its high-quality pieces. They include Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Sikorsky helicopters, Otis elevators, and Carrier air conditioners.  In a report last month, Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Michael Gardner said eight of the units could be worth a total $60 to $89 a share if sold separately. That's a hefty premium over the stock, which closed yesterday at 45 3/8, off 5/8. Adds Judith Comeau of Goldman Sachs: "Based on the phone calls I'm getting, there's a significant increase in interest from that perspective. I've never heard it before."  Some of Mr. Gray's later acquisitions weren't big winners, and earnings growth and stock market performance have been depressed by a recent series of write-offs and other disappointments. The Mostek semiconductor unit, acquired in 1980 for $345 million, was shut down last year in a $424 million write-off. The company had smaller flops in office tenant services.
