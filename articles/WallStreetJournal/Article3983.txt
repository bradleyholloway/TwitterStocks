 The Economy; THE OUTLOOK: Europe Might Need Some Economic Shelter as Housing Market Cools   By Marcus Walker and Keith Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2005  WHILE NO CRASH in home prices or consumption is expected, a slowing property market could be a drag on consumer demand, just when the euro-zone economy was starting to strengthen after four years of painfully slow growth. Consumers could also be discouraged by an increase in euro-zone interest rates; the European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 12 countries that use the euro, has indicated it plans to raise its key rate on Dec. 1 to stem inflation but also to try to take air out of some countries' housing bubbles. Britain isn't part of the euro zone.  French consumer confidence has started to weaken this year, while home-price growth has begun to slip. "We're not expecting a major correction, but the rate of increase in house prices should slow as interest rates rise," says Ken Wattret, chief euro-zone economist at BNP Paribas. He expects French domestic demand will no longer outperform that of other European countries. "We've seen the best of the news," he says.  The EU's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Joaquin Almunia, told reporters in Brussels last week that despite the EU's high current forecasts for Spain's economic growth -- 3.4% this year, 3.2% next -- there were "signs of exhaustion in the Spanish economy," with the real-estate slowdown playing a key role.
