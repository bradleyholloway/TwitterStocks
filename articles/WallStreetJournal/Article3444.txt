 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  A: The two services I reviewed, LifeClips and YesVideo, only accept video for conversion to DVD, not movie or still film, photos or slides. Both companies say that, to convert those formats to DVD, you first have to convert them to video, something many photo stores and developers can do. In fact, one of the home videos I converted to DVD as part of my research had been created by a local photo store from old family movies, some dating back to the 1940s.  After I wrote the column, I heard from a Cornelius, N.C., company, called GoDVD Inc., that claims it can directly convert home movies, prints and slides -- as well as videotapes -- to DVD. The company says it uses special film projectors that capture the movie images on computer chips. I can't evaluate this claim, because I haven't tested it. You can contact the company at 1-866-vhs-2dvd, or godvdinc@aol.com.
