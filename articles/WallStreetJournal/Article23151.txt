 Fewer Workers Have Health Benefits; Higher Insurance Premiums, Weaker Economy Are Cited; Options Are Less Attractive   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  The cutback in family benefits may help explain one of the sharpest drops in employer health coverage: The 5.3 percentage-point decline among low-income children, according to the survey. Such children also had the biggest increase in public health-care assistance, thanks to expansions in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. The share of children who enrolled in such programs rose to 49.3% from 37.9% between 2001 and 2003, a big reason why the survey's uninsured numbers didn't grow significantly.
