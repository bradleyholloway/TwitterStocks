 ...Sung by the Thinking Woman's Baritone   By By Anne Midgette, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  New York -- As Thomas Hampson worked his way through the title role of Massenet's "Werther" at the Metropolitan Opera recently, one realized how different traditional tenor and baritone roles really are. Massenet wrote the part for a tenor, but in 1902 he prepared an alternate version for the celebrated baritone Mattia Battistini. Dale Duesing performed the variant with the Seattle Opera in 1991; Mr. Hampson's portrayal marks only its second outing since Battistini essayed the part.  But changing one's spots is easier said than done, for those very stage characteristics that make Mr. Hampson a terrific Don Rodrigo made him problematic here as Werther. Massenet's young neurotic, drawn from Goethe's pan-European bestselling novel of 1774, is hard to take in any case. He falls in love with Charlotte, who is promised to another man, continues to upset her even after she is married, and then shoots himself when she finally sends him away. Werther has a serious case of "You'll be sorry when I'm dead," and he gets his wish -- she is. Very sorry. There are Freudian overtones here too: Charlotte looks after her many young brothers and sisters, and those maternal characteristics are what first attract Werther, who seems to be a bit in need of an all-forgiving mom himself. This adolescent egotist isn't very empathetic, either. When Charlotte sings movingly of her sorrow at her mother's death, his response is to exclaim how happy he is to have fallen in love with a deeply sensitive person. And Charlotte's growing response to Werther's insistent and inappropriate effusions is as motherly as it is loverlike.
