 Scientists Studying Mad-Cow Disease Say British Meat Industry Has Withheld Data   By By Marc Champion, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2001  So-called mechanically recovered meat, or MRM, is scraped or blasted from the carcass with high-pressure water jets after the better cuts of meat have been removed. The puree that results is used in pies, cheap hamburgers and sausages. MRM that was obtained prior to 1995 -- when recovery of meat from the spinal cord was banned -- is considered to have been high risk. That is because it could have included pieces of spinal cord damaged in the butchery process. Mad-cow disease mainly infects the brain and spines of cattle.
