 Personal Business: Cheaper Ways to Chill This Summer   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2006  Start by closing curtains -- especially those facing south and west -- during midday hours to minimize solar radiation in your home. And do chores such as washing dishes and laundry late at night when it's cooler, since those activities can emit extra heat into the home. (As an added incentive, some utility companies charge lower rates to residents who use electricity during "off peak" hours, such as after 8 p.m.) If you do perform these chores during the day, use cold water whenever you can.  Replacing incandescent light bulbs with "compact fluorescent" bulbs is another heat-reducing measure. Besides requiring less electricity than regular bulbs and lasting years longer, the bulbs emit less heat. While 90% to 95% of a standard light bulb's energy is emitted as heat, the figure is only about 30% to 40% for a CFL bulb, says Jennifer Amann, senior associate for the American Council for an Energy- Efficient Economy. Replacing five conventional bulbs with CFL bulbs can save about $60 a year in energy costs. The bulbs can cost $5 to $10 initially, but can save $30 over the life of a bulb compared with standard light bulbs.
