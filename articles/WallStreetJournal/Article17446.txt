 Valero Energy Says a Saudi Investor Agreed to Buy Stake as Large as 33.3%   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1985  SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Valero Energy Corp. said a Saudi Arabian investor agreed to buy as much as 33.3% of the company's stock for $100 million, but most of the money is conditioned upon Valero finding a new supply of low-cost oil for its loss-plagued Saber refinery.  In the second step of a proposed two-step transaction, TAG would pay $85 million for additional securities. Those securities, combined with the earlier preferred stock, would be convertible to a total 33.3% of Valero. TAG also would receive three seats on an enlarged, 13-seat Valero board. In return, TAG signed a standstill agreement under which it pledged not to buy more Valero securities for 10 years.  But the second step depends on Valero obtaining a low-cost oil supply that would allow its Saber Energy Inc. unit to at least break even on its refinery, which has been hurt by lower gasoline prices and higher prices of the feedstocks it uses. Valero executives are betting that TAG -- or its U.S. subsidiary headed by former Treasury Secretary G. William Miller -- can help locate cheap oil supplies from any of several Middle East countries.
