 Dan the Man   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2003  There's a view that battles between American and foreign spouses over their children are merely private custody disputes. That's long been the preferred lingo of the State Department, and it is exactly the language that Saudi spokesmen such as Adel al-Jubeir are careful to use when discussing these cases. The truth, however, is that most cases involve a Saudi father who married in the U.S., had children in the U.S., divorced in the U.S., and decided to take matters into his own hands when U.S. courts didn't give him what he wanted.  That contempt for American law is not merely a private affair. Saudi fathers who wish to spirit their children out of the U.S. need Saudi passports, which, as Mr. [Dan Burton] pointed out in a tart letter to Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Prince Bandar, have been authorized by his embassy. The passports have been provided even when, as in the case of Joanna Stephenson Tonetti, a U.S. judge had specifically notified the Saudi embassy of his order forbidding the children from leaving.
