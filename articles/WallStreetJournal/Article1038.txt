 Politics & Economics: Reversing Course on Electronic Voting; Some Former Backers of Technology Seek Return to Paper Ballots, Citing Glitches, Fraud Fears   By Cummings, Jeanne, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2006  Jan Brewer, Arizona's secretary of state, calls the lawsuit's allegations "unsubstantiated" and said electronic machines are needed to allow disabled voters to cast their ballots privately and efficiently. "I have referred this matter to the attorney general and have asked him to seek a dismissal as soon as possible," she says.  A North Carolina early voting test in the 2002 general election of six touch-screen machines made by Election Systems & Software Inc. uncovered a software problem that led to 436 uncounted votes. Local officials were further frustrated when a company representative acknowledged that they had seen the glitch before in a nearby county -- and hadn't shared the information. Ken Fields, spokesman for ES&S, of Omaha, Neb., said the problem stemmed from an "obscure technical issue" that made some machines function as if their memory was full. The glitch was solved by Election Day, he said.  "Perfect shouldn't be the death of good," says Mr. [David Bear], who contends there's plenty of evidence showing electronic machines perform far better than Florida's much-lampooned punch ballots and antiquated lever ballots. "There have always been issues with elections. Technology didn't introduce those issues," he said.
