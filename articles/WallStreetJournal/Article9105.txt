 UAL to Increase Coach-Class Legroom For Its High-Mileage Frequent Fliers   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1999  Acknowledging that legroom in coach class could be improved for high-mileage frequent fliers, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it plans to remove a row of seats from each of its domestic jets and add four to five inches of legroom to the front six to 11 economy rows.  Called "Economy Plus," the more spacious seating will be available to the carrier's Premier and Premier Executive frequent fliers on a first-come, first-served basis. Passengers who aren't members of the carrier's Mileage Plus loyalty program who are traveling on full-fare economy tickets, and high-mileage members of Star Alliance carriers' mileage plans also will get a crack at the roomier seats. Star Alliance is a global group of airlines, including United, Lufthansa and Air Canada, linked by marketing agreements.
