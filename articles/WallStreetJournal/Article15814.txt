 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Reforming Reform   By By Erica Schacter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1999  Last week, the Central Conference of American Rabbis -- the governing body of Reform Judaism -- issued a statement of principles defining what it means to be a Reform Jew in 1999. "This `statement of principles,'" declares the preamble, "acknowledges the diversity of Reform Jewish beliefs and practices" and "invites all Reform Jews to engage in a dialogue with the sources of our tradition."  With the usual gestures toward "diversity" and "dialogue," the rabbis' statement of principles appeared, at first glance, unremarkable. But the press seized on the word "tradition" -- seemingly at odds with one of American Judaism's more liberal branches. (And its largest, with 1.5 million Jews.) The headlines erupted: "Reform Judaism Embraces Tradition" (Washington Post), "Reform Jews Plan a Shift to Tradition" (Los Angeles Times).  It is true that the Pittsburgh Principles -- as they're known, since that is where the rabbis met -- suggested a closer look at traditional rituals, a focus that was not officially part of Reform Judaism before. And that is news. But the sweeping headlines were misleading. Reform Judaism was not so much resuscitating tradition by rabbinical fiat as accommodating the many Reform Jews who have already rediscovered meaning in old practices.
