 Letters to the Editor: Conventional Wisdom, Common Sense   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1997  In your Nov. 12 article, "Expo Hall Proposal Defies Conventional Wisdom" you address the Osceola County government's decision to choose a private partner to build a convention center using bonds backed by a penny from the county's bed tax on tourists.  Our company, Xentury City, is one of the original three bidders -- one has since dropped out -- responding to the county's request for a proposal. We believe our proposal best meets the county's needs. Yet we were relegated to one paragraph in the article, most of which was spent describing the World Expo joint venture that promises to build the world's largest exposition hall.  I know many Americans love owning the "biggest" of anything, but I must caution that in this case, owning the biggest is not the wisest decision for the citizens of Osceola County. Your article states that if the World Expo plan succeeds, Central Florida could end up hosting megatrade shows that otherwise go to Las Vegas, New York or Chicago.
