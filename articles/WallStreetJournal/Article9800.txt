 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2005  Economists aren't going into today's April jobs report with as high an expectation as they did a month ago. On average, they think 175,000 jobs were added to U.S. payrolls. Carlos Asilis, a portfolio manager with hedge fund Vega Plus Capital Partners, reckons that traders have been so shellacked by weak economic reports that they are prepared for even less.  No matter how the jobs report comes in, it could spark some furious trading. During the past 10 years, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has moved an average of a full percentage point on jobs-report days, according to Michael Panzer, head of sales trading for Rabo Securities USA. Considering the way the market's been thrashing about lately, today's move could be bigger.
