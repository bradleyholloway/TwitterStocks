 KKR-Led Group to Sell Georgia Marble To First Chicago's Venture-Capital Unit   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1989  First Chicago Corp.'s venture-capital unit agreed to buy Georgia Marble Co., a building and consumer products concern owned by a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.-led investment group. The price will exceed $325 million, a person close to the transaction said.  The banking concern, which wouldn't confirm the sales price, said it plans to keep at least half ownership in Georgia Marble, while recruiting some smaller investors. The venture unit has in recent years become one of the nation's biggest leveraged buy-out investors, having laid out about $660 million in equity investments it now values at about $1 billion. The total purchase price on those investments, financed largely by borrowings, exceeds $4 billion.
