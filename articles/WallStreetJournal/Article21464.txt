 Takeovers, Program Trading Lift Stocks, Enlivening Slow Session   By Torres, Craig; Wilson, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1990  The narrow breadth was reflected in the smaller rise of broader market measures. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.52 to 359.54, an advance equal to an 11-point gain in the Dow industrials. Stock-index arbitrage buy programs helped boost volume in a day of otherwise slow trading, reflecting the approach of the July Fourth holiday.  Some takeover excitement returned to the stock market with Forstmann Little & Co.'s $44.50-a-share, or $1.6 billion, buy-out agreement with General Instrument Corp. General Instrument's stock soared 8 7/8 to 45 1/8 on volume of 3.3 million shares. Also, Kay Jewelers received a $17-a-share, or $328.1 million, offer from Ratners Group of Britain. Kay Jewelers climbed 3 3/8 to 14 1/4 on 1.5 million shares. The two stocks were the largest gainers in percentage terms on the Big Board yesterday.  Ralston Purina closed 1 1/2 higher at 93 3/8. A Prudential-Bache Securities analyst, John McMillin, increased his earnings forecast for the stock to $1.40 a share, on a fully diluted basis, for Ralston's fiscal third quarter just ended; the company earned $1.18 a year earlier. He raised his full-year forecasts to $6.10 a share for fiscal 1990 ending in September, and to $7 a share for all of 1991. "Operating trends have been much more stable" at Ralston, Mr. McMillin said. He added that the company is an "aggressive" buyer of its own stock.
