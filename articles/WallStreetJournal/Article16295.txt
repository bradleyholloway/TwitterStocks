 Case for War Relied on Selective Intelligence --- Bush Administration Bypasssed Internal Disputes in Laying Out Evidence of Iraqi Weapons   By By David S. Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2003  There is no sign the issue is going away. Several congressional committees have announced inquiries into U.S. intelligence on Iraq. The CIA itself has brought back several former analysts to compare prewar intelligence reports with whatever is found in Iraq to assess whether there were flaws. Democratic presidential candidate Bob Graham said yesterday that President [Bush] should be held accountable if intelligence was exaggerated. "It would raise serious questions about the political leadership that engaged in that manipulation and the misleading of the American people," said Mr. Graham, former chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence.  Days after completion of October's formal assessment of Iraq's weapons programs, Mr. Bush himself glossed over a debate on whether the attempted purchase of aluminum tubes was evidence of an active nuclear program. CIA weapons experts insisted the tubes were suitable as rotors for gas centrifuges used in making nuclear-weapons material. But analysts from the Department of Energy's nuclear labs were dubious, according to officials involved. They argued that coatings on the tubes aimed at preventing corrosion were inconsistent with use in centrifuges. More likely, the tubes were intended for making rockets, some U.S. analysts argued.  Officials now conclude the U.S.'s ability to see inside Iraq's weapons programs was always sketchy. Analysts across the intelligence community were in rough agreement that Iraq probably had hidden stocks of chemical nerve agents. An unclassified version of October's report on Iraq's weapons activities asserted that "Baghdad has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents." Yet none have been found so far in more than a month of searching by Pentagon inspectors.
