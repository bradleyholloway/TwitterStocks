 OFF DUTY --- Design & Decorating -- My Favorite Room: The Lived-In Look --- Architect David Rockwell makes a pilgrimage to the antiquities-stuffed Sir John Soane's Museum in London -- and gorges on design tips in the breakfast parlor   By Renzi, Jen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2011  Chockablock with Renaissance bronzes, Egyptian artifacts and Medieval objects, the quirky institution honors the British architect behind the Bank of England building, the Dulwich Picture Gallery and other celebrated Regency-era masterpieces. Lending a lived-in look are overflowing bookshelves, a marble fireplace piled with busts and salon-style installations of framed artwork -- including colored engravings by Angelo Campanella and a watercolor of the Soane family tomb.
