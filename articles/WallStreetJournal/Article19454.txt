 Janus CEO Bailey to Sell Stake to Stilwell   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  Five senior Janus portfolio managers yesterday distributed a letter telling Janus fund shareholders that Mr. [Thomas H. Bailey]'s stock sale doesn't change their plans to manage portfolios at the company, with about $160 billion in assets. "You should feel confident that each of us on Janus's Executive Investment Committee remains completely committed to Janus, our clients and our shareholders," wrote Jim Goff, Helen Young Hayes, Warren Lammert, Blaine Rollins and Scott Schoelzel. They also said they aren't "planning to leave Janus in the foreseeable future."  After Mr. Bailey's sale, Stilwell will own 97.8% of Janus. Stilwell may have to take on new debt to pay Mr. Bailey and to pay convertible-bond holders who can put their securities back to Stilwell next April. Redeeming the converts could require Stilwell to take on new debt at 6.5% or 7% a year, compared with the current 1% on the converts, says Guy Moszkowski, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. Mr. Moszkowski estimates that scenario would push Stilwell's 2002 earnings to $1.79 a diluted share from a current estimate of $1.85. At 4 p.m., Stilwell's shares rose $1.35, or 6.8%, to $21.26, a reflection that the market had expected Mr. Bailey's sale.
