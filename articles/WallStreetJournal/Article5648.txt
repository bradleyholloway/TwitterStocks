 Online: A Flood of Web Patents Stirs Dispute Over Tactics   By By Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1998  But last June, Netcentives Inc., a San Francisco Internet start-up, received a patent for an online frequent-buyer program. Web shoppers who make purchases from merchants affiliated with Netcentives earn rewards, including American's AAdvantage miles.  Netcentives had found a hot and controversial new route to a patent: creating an online parallel for a familiar concept in the physical world. It may sound odd that putting something on the Web could make it more eligible for a patent. But a ruling in July by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that computerized "business methods" can be patented.  Earlier this year, Open Market Inc. of Burlington, Mass., was granted a patent for "shopping carts," a common feature of Web shopping. The company now says it is looking for licensing deals. In July, Priceline.com Inc., of Stamford, Conn., was awarded a patent on "reverse" auctions, in which buyers name their price for airline tickets.
