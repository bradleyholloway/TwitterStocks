 CFTC to Propose Rules That Prohibit Some Dual Trading   By By Sandra Block, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1993  The dual-trading ban would apply to all futures or options with daily volume of at least 8,000 contracts, unless the futures exchanges where the contracts are listed meet tough new standards for monitoring futures trades.  Congress included the prohibition on dual trading, which occurs when commodities floor brokers trade for their own accounts at the same time they fill orders for customers, in a futures-trading bill that was signed into law last year. The practice came under fire after the 1989 federal "sting" operation of fraud at the Chicago futures exchanges.
