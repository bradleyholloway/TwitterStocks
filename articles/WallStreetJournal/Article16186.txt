 Letters to the Editor: Airport Security Is No Laughing Matter   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2002  [George McGovern] expressed his dissatisfaction with the airline rules requiring passengers to check in 30 minutes before departure. In fact, the airlines have always made a point of requesting passengers to arrive one hour before scheduled departure for domestic flights to permit the airlines to do their jobs adequately and get all of us safely to our destinations.  As a British employee of a U.S. investment bank, I travel regularly to and within the U.S. On a recent trip I took 12 internal flights over a period of one week. I was subject to 20 additional "random searches." These random searches take place at check-in and at the gate. The check-in search was often particularly entertaining (not for me but for other passengers) as on several occasions it meant that the contents of my travel bag were spread out on a table in full view of the long line of bored fellow passengers.
