 `May I Show You Something I Can't Afford?'   By By Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2003  Robert Boleyn, a plaintiff in the complaint against Gap and a part-time employee at one of its Los Angeles stores, says he earned $300 working in December -- and spent $500 on clothes that month to fulfill the dress code. One day, Mr. Boleyn says in an interview, he was reprimanded for wearing a shirt from Banana Republic, a higher-end chain owned by Gap Inc. "You're on pins and needles when you walk in, because you don't know how the policy is going to be interpreted from one day to the next," he says. The complaint alleges that Gap store employees must buy "an up-to-date wardrobe of each season's product line."  Gap says its policy is simply that store employees must wear Gap-brand clothing or clothing similar to it. Alan Marks, a Gap spokesman, says the policy doesn't compel employees to buy Gap clothes. "We're very clear on our policy," Mr. Marks says. "It's aggressively communicated to our sales organization, and it's discussed on a regular basis as a part of senior staff meetings."  At Polo Ralph Lauren's higher-end stores, workers say they have to buy clothing that retails for as much as $400 for a sweater and $500 for a pair of pants, claims Toni Young, lead plaintiff in the Polo Ralph Lauren suit. She says the company offers employees a 65% discount off retail prices. Even so, to keep her job at the company's San Francisco store, Ms. Young says she spent more than $30,000 on Polo Ralph Lauren clothing since 1997. Ms. Young also has a racial discrimination suit pending against Polo Ralph Lauren.
