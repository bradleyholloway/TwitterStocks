 Ahead of the Tape   By By Jesse Eisinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2002  At MBNA Corp., charge-offs and delinquencies reassuringly have been falling for months. MBNA has among the lowest charge-off rates in the industry. Capital One Financial has lower current charge-offs, but since the company has been growing so quickly many are skeptical that Capital One's rates reflect the true state of its customers' liquidity.  Even the timing of the earnings announcement will receive scrutiny. Peculiarly, MBNA doesn't tell investors what day it plans to report or hold a conference call, despite pressure these days on companies to improve transparency. The regulators have been making consumer-finance companies tighten up their reserves. Given that, even a solid company like MBNA could suffer if there is perceived to be an unusual delay in the earnings announcement.
