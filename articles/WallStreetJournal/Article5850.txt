 Some Lehman Brothers Officials Ponder A More Formal Linkup With Fidelity   By By Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  A Fidelity-Lehman combination would more than hold its own against Wall Street's top players. Fidelity has 11.3 million retail accounts that could be a valuable distribution arm for Lehman stock and bond deals. At the same time, a Fidelity hookup would provide Lehman with some $885 billion in mutual-fund assets. (Lehman largely has been out of the individual-investor game since its retail-brokerage business was sold to Travelers Group, now part of Citigroup, in 1993.) This would give Lehman a steady stream of revenue, acting as a buffer in down markets, which have traditionally hurt the firm because of its heavy reliance on bond trading.  For Fidelity, the benefits seem less tangible, but people on both sides say the company would benefit by teaming up with a firm that has significant research, trading and investment-banking capability, something Fidelity currently doesn't have. And there could be other synergies growing out of the alliance. Officials at Fidelity are well aware of a basic fact in their business: Mutual funds are becoming less appealing to small investors, who want to own stocks and bonds outright. Lehman could be the supplier of product to Fidelity's growing retail-brokerage operations, one of the largest in the financial world.  Fidelity has participated in 56 Lehman-lead managed stock deals since the alliance was formed in June 1999. Lehman and Fidelity have jointly pitched IPOs and other securities offerings, bragging about Fidelity's ability to generate huge demand from its retail customers, who buy stock from brokers and over the Internet.
