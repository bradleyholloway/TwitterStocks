 Best Feet Forward: Kirov Ballet's Aim Is To Dazzle the U.S. --- Castigating Defectors of Past, Troupe Touts New Stars; Breathing Air of Nijinsky   By By Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1986  Russian ballet scouts from the legendary Vaganova school of the Kirov ballet were combing a Moslem area in Soviet Central Asia when they unearthed some unlikely gold: a long-legged, hooknosed, dark-skinned boy.  The boy, Farouk Ruzimatov, was pronounced worthy to enter training to become a great Soviet dancer. "They appreciated the way I moved," Mr. Ruzimatov recalls 14 years later. The scouts chose well. Mr. Ruzimatov's dazzling Don Quixote already has Leningrad locals comparing him with Mikhail Baryshnikov, who defected from the Kirov -- and the Soviet Union -- in 1974.  The Kirov's coaches say that Mr. Ruzimatov and a handful of other brilliant young performers are the best generation of Soviet dancers since the 1960s. As the Kirov nears the end of its first U.S. tour in 22 years, they hope the dancers will make U.S. audiences appreciate today's company and forget about past years' defectors: Baryshnikov, Valery and Galina Panov, Rudolf Nureyev and Natalia Makarova. Defections helped plunge the company into an artistic slump in the 1970s, and reviewers of U.S. performances say the company is still struggling to recover.
