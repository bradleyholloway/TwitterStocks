 Bird-Flu Cluster May Signal Spread In a Human Chain   By Zamiska, Nicholas, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2006  Officials of the United Nations health agency, together with local authorities, have been monitoring a village in Karo district in northern Sumatra where eight members of an extended family fell ill after a recent gathering. Seven of the eight have died, all but one of whom have tested positive for bird flu. The surviving member also tested positive for bird flu. Authorities haven't found any obvious source of infection in birds in the area -- the usual means by which a human would become infected by avian influenza.
