 Industrials Finish Slightly Lower As Some Focus on Weak Economy   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1985  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 4.48 points to close at 1310.93. The industrial index had set a record high Friday at 1315.41. Yesterday, stocks opened higher and the industrial index ran up about five points following an early surge in the bond market. But the gains melted throughout the session in profit-taking.  Some of the closely followed broader market averages such as Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index finished slightly lower. But there were more winners than losers on the Big Board -- 930 issues advancing and 691 declining. Volume also was strong, but the 125 million shares changing hands on the Big Board was down from 134.1 million Friday.  Analysts and traders said the very reasons that sent the bond market soaring could be holding the stock market down. Bonds rallied on expectations of a still more accommodative Federal Reserve Board monetary policy, implying further declines in interest rates. Recent statistics show that economic growth remains sluggish at best.
