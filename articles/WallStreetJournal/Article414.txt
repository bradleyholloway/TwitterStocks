 Northwest Hardens Line With Strikers   By Susan Carey in Chicago, Janet Adamy in Minneapolis and John D. Stoll in Detroit, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2005  No new negotiations with AMFA have been scheduled. Northwest is legally obligated to bargain with the union but also can make the replacement workers permanent hires, which would mean there would be few, if any, jobs for the strikers to return to if the strike ends, unless they cross the picket lines soon. Steve MacFarlane, assistant national director of AMFA, said in a bulletin to members yesterday that there are "no credible reports of our members crossing the picket line and going back to work." He said that every city where the union has members is reporting "strong support on the picket line from passengers and fellow workers."  Northwest said those concerns haven't been brought to its attention by the union. "We appreciate and support our flight attendants' responsibility to ensure that our aircraft cabins are properly maintained," the company said in a statement. "We continuously review maintenance records from pilots, flight attendants and technicians. We have not taken any disciplinary action against any flight attendant for submitting items for maintenance attention."  Joe Brancatelli, publisher of Joe Sent Me, a Web site for business travelers, has been analyzing the real-time status of about 100 domestic flights a day on Northwest's own Web site. He estimates Northwest's on-time rate averaged 49%, with Tuesday being the best with 58.5% of the flights he surveyed arriving within 15 minutes of the published schedule. Northwest derides his work as "an arbitrary, random study" that doesn't account for factors such as weather and air-traffic congestion.
