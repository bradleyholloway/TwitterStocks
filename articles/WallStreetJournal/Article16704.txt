 Health Costs: Don't Let Coverage Lapse   By McQueen, M P, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  Aside from Mrs. [Annette Ensley]'s maintenance use of an antidepressant and allergy medications, and Mr. Ensley's slightly elevated cholesterol, they had clean bills of health. "We are relatively healthy compared to a lot of people we know our age," Mrs. Ensley notes.  The Ensleys signed up for Cobra coverage, with monthly premiums set to increase next month to a steep $1,000, while pondering their next step. One key advantage of continuing their coverage for now: Under a 1996 federal law, you cannot be denied new coverage or have pre- existing health conditions excluded as long as you have not had a break in medical coverage of 63 days or more. Your insurer or employer must provide a "certificate of creditable coverage" to prove you were covered.  At small companies, you may have the option to convert to individual coverage with the same insurer that provided the group plan, which also will preserve your rights. "It is important to keep coverage for as long as you can, so you don't face situations from existing conditions," says Dr. Charles Cutler, national medical director for quality management at Aetna.
