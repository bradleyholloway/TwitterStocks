 Back to Biscuits: Old Flamboyance Is Out as Louis Gerstner Remakes RJR Nabisco --- CEO Builds Efficiency, Ends Infighting and Engineers Quick Cuts in LBO Debt --- Can He Stop Winston's Slide?   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1991  When Mr. Gerstner is intrigued by what he sees on the shelf, he lingers a moment to engage his strategy chief, Stephen Wilson, in rapid-fire dialogue about profit margins and market share. When Mr. Gerstner is unimpressed, he walks on, forcing Mr. Wilson to abandon all talk of that acquisition idea, flip ahead in his notes and start afresh.  But competitors, analysts and customers all say that today's RJR is a lot more efficient. Propelling all these changes is the 49-year-old Mr. Gerstner, a one-time McKinsey & Co. management consultant and the former president of American Express Co. Selected in early 1989 to run RJR Nabisco by its major shareholder, the buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Mr. Gerstner instantly got broad authority. "We're financial people," says KKR partner Henry Kravis. "Lou makes the long-run operating decisions."  When Mr. Gerstner took over RJR in March 1989, its executive suite was desolate. A host of top managers had quit in the wake of the failed bid for the company by Mr. Johnson, who lost out to KKR. Since then, Mr. Gerstner has filled these slots with his kind of people, bringing in a general counsel from American Express and a chief administrative officer from H.J. Heinz, and hiring as his head of tobacco operations a former RJR hand who had left during the mid-1980s for a post at Citicorp. Gone are the pranks and profanity that caused the company's old Atlanta executive offices to be known as the Fraternity. People now start work at 8 a.m., show an occasional sparkle of dry wit, and otherwise favor such a serious, collegial tone that executives now suggest that headquarters be known as the Seminary.
