 Wonder Land: Democrats Nuke Party Beliefs To Stop Women   By Henninger, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 2005  Surveying the Senate's nuclear-missile silos, Court TV's Fred Graham said that of course the Republican majority had the power to change the filibuster rule, and the Democrats would have to lump it: "What are they going to do," he asked, "appeal to the Supreme Court?" They didn't much enjoy their last visit to the high court after the 2000 election. But the nightmare lingers on.  On the [Priscilla Owen] and Brown nominations especially, the Democratic faith system falters badly. Yes, we know Priscilla Owen has ruled "in favor of corporations" and Judge Brown went the wrong way in a lead-paint decision and both are a threat to "privacy" concerns. And for latter- day Democrats all this matters. But I don't see how the Democrats get around at least some voters noticing that obliterating both Priscilla Owen and [Janice Rogers Brown] bears false witness to the party's foundational achievements.  In part it is about the lack of a program-based opposition strategy to which all the party's factions agree. Absent that, all that binds them is anger -- over 2000 and 2004, but especially Florida. As described almost daily in print or pixels, the [George Bush] wins were somehow false -- a function of "social conservatives," "the extreme right," "the religious right" and sketchy voter machinations.
