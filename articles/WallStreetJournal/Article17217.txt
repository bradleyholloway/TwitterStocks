 OFF DUTY --- Adventure & Travel -- In Search of... The Crescent City's Greatest Po'boys --- Seventy-two hours of gravy-faced, napkin-thrashing, French bread-crunching taste-testing of New Orleans' most beloved sandwich   By Garbarino, Steve, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2011  New Orleans just doesn't like change. [...] it's steeped in po'boy tradition, Parasol's new owner, John Hogan, 54, says. Since taking it over with his wife, a New Orleans native, he's left the rickety look intact, continued to allow smoking, and he's concocted his own roast-beef po'boy recipe, using an oven-roasted inside round and a gravy made from beef broth, drippings, flour and spices.
