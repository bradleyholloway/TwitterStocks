 Catalog Critic: The Long and Short of Miniskirts   By By Lauren Lipton, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2003  We wanted one, but we also wanted to keep our self-respect. We shopped at places such as Banana Republic and Ann Taylor with one overriding concern: to find choices appropriate for grown-ups. We didn't have a minimum length in mind, so we ordered skirts from just above the knee to midthigh, and in styles from sporty to dressy. Then we modeled our purchases for an impromptu panel of experts -- a dozen women colleagues from their 20s to 50s who, believe us, had plenty to say on the subject. To our surprise, some of the skirts deemed most appropriate were among the shortest we ordered. As for the one that looked most wrong -- length wasn't the issue.  Our winning streak ended with the Basic Skort from Boston Proper. This casual skirt-shorts hybrid was a bit longer than the bebe skirt, but seemed little-girlish. We chalked it up to the styling: basically a pair of longish shorts with an apron panel in front. (The company says its target buyers are between 35 and 55.)
