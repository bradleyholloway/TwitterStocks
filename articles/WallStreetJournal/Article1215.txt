 Following a Stroke, A Japanese Pianist Reinvents Himself; Izumi Tateno Embraced A One-Handed Repertoire; Inspiration in Rehab   By Hayashi, Yuka, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2007  "Many people have told me I should just take it easy," says the soft-spoken Mr. Tateno. "But I am not interested in taking it easy. I don't even know how to. I want to perform as I have done in the past 50 years, so I can share my music with others."  "I thought I would never play [Maurice Ravel] even if I were dead," Mr. Tateno wrote in a collection of essays called "The Sea of Sunflower" published in 2004. "I said, to hell with music for the left hand."  "When I play with the right hand, I get a gentle feeling similar to new leaves coming out in the spring," Mr. Tateno wrote in an introduction to his latest tour. "They are still delicate, but maybe in time, they will grow strong."
