 Gold Futures Tumble to Near an 18-Year Low   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1997  The price of the nearby-month gold-futures contract fell $5.10, or 1.8%, to $282.80 a troy ounce, the fourth new 12 1/2-year low that it has hit this month. If gold slips below the $282 level, it would be a return to late-1970s prices for the metal.  Falling gold prices have broken record after record this year, first hitting three-year lows, then four-year lows, then a 12-year low in July. Yesterday, in relatively light trading on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for delivery this month fell at one point to $281.50 an ounce before recovering slightly to finish at $282.80, down $5.10, or 1.8% on the day. In London, the spot-gold fixing was $283.25 an ounce, an 18-year low.  Yesterday's downward price movement in gold was triggered by increasing selling pressure applied by speculators at socalled hedge funds, as well as by gold producers. Nervous and defensive mining companies have continued selling future production, or are buying options, practices that effectively lock in a certain price for gold that is still in the ground. The strategies reflect continued nervousness about the possibility that prices will fall further, analysts say.
