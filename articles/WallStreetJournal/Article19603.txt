 The Economy: Delay on Jobless Benefits Takes a Clear Toll --- Senate-House Discord Over Extending Payments Intensifies Pain in Ohio and Michigan   By By Gary Fields, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2003  Mr. [STEVE SHOUSE], who is single and has no dependents, figures he's better off than most people left hanging over the holidays when the House and Senate adjourned without agreeing on how to extend emergency jobless benefits. Those federal benefits expired on Dec. 28, cutting off aid to 780,000. In addition, an estimated 95,000 people will exhaust their 26 weeks of state unemployment each week, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Even before the Dec. 28 cutoff, one million people had exhausted their 13 weeks of extra federal emergency help.  President Bush has added to the sense of urgency, scolding both the House and Senate in a radio address last month. "The last Congress left behind some unfinished business," he said. "The House and Senate passed different bills extending unemployment benefits. However, no final bill was sent to me extending unemployment benefits for about 750,000 Americans."  For Mr. Shouse and others who haven't been able to find new jobs, state unemployment rates aren't topmost on their minds. Mr. Shouse, a 45-year-old quality-assurance inspector at Tri-Star Refractory in Newton, Ohio, was laid off in April from a job that paid $682 a week. His unemployment benefit amounted to $303 a week. Over the months, he has drained his savings, and ended up selling his Ibanez guitar and Fender amplifier for $350. He says he'll sell his aluminum fishing boat in the spring, hoping it will fetch a better price than it will during the winter. "Maybe I'll get a house note payment for it," he says. "I see everything I have in terms of a house note payment or half a house note payment now."
