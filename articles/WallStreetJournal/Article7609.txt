 CBS Chief Is Said To Seek 17% Cut In News Spending   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1987  CBS Inc. is considering a major budget cutback at CBS News, sources close to the company said late last night.  Laurence A. Tisch, CBS's chief executive officer, however, strongly denied planning any cuts at CBS News.  Mr. Tisch said that an examination of CBS News that will likely lead to a "realignment" was under way, but called a $50 million budget cut "ludicrous."
