 PURSUITS; White Lies   By Dougherty, Conor, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2006  As ski season gets underway, there's a battle brewing in some key regions over who can make the best fake snow. From California to Maine, resorts are installing new tower-mounted guns designed so the fake snow descends in a trajectory more like the real thing. They're laying pipelines and building huge reservoirs to ensure a steady supply, and blanketing top-of-the-mountain runs once covered mainly in real snow. These massive systems now make snow so good that some hardcore skiers say they prefer it -- and resorts are starting to brag about it. Vermont's Killington, for instance, touts its "Signature Snow."  The first thing Nick Ward checks before he hits the slopes is what might be termed the fake-snow report: He goes onto the resort's Web site to see how much snow the mountain made the night before. And when he gets to the mountain, he follows up with ski patrol to get the details on which runs to hit when. "Did they start with the left or start with the right?" he says. "You're always scouting for intelligence."  The smaller resorts in states like Maryland and Pennsylvania likely wouldn't exist without artificial snow: Camelback Ski Area in Pennsylvania's Poconos Mountains has made snow on all of its runs for more than a decade. Western resorts use snowmaking mostly to ensure they open on time and to freshen up the most heavily skied runs. Vail, for instance, makes snow on about 7% of its mountain, Utah's Deer Valley, about 30%.
