 Classier `Casual Dining' Restaurants Are Expanding --- Owners Convert Eateries to `Chain' Status to Meet Change in Appetites   By By Udayan Gupta, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1994  New York restaurateur Ken Aretsky was in Florida last November when Boston Chicken Inc., a Chicago rotisserie-chicken chain, went public with the biggest opening-day leap of any initial public offering in two years.  So this May, he and several partners acquired Stick To Your Ribs, a tiny Long Island City, N.Y., rib joint that has less than $1 million in annual sales. What it does have is a clear identity that can be replicated. Mr. Aretsky wants to use Stick To Your Ribs as the launching pad for a regional chain of restaurants that offer Texas-style barbecue fare. If he ever wants to expand outside the Northeast, he says, "it's a concept that should travel well."  Like Mr. Aretsky, restaurateurs across the nation are busy converting their businesses into restaurant companies by building chains of look-alikes or "clusters" of restaurants of varying styles. "A lot of them are seeing the valuations that the public market is giving restaurant companies and saying, `I'm as good as that'," says Roger Lipton, who follows the restaurant industry for Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., a New York investment bank.
