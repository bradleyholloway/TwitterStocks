 Head of BNP Sees Lower 1993 Profit Amid Privatization   By By Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1993  Banque Nationale de Paris will show sharply lower profits this year than in 1992, when it reported earnings of 2.2 billion francs ($391 million), Chairman Michel Pebereau warned at an evening meeting with journalists and investment analysts to launch the bank's long-awaited privatization.  But BNP said it plans to build on existing cooperation agreements with Union des Assurances de Paris and Dresdner Bank as part of a strategy to restore acceptable levels of profitability by 1995.  In a complex operation likely to value BNP at between 40 billion and 45 billion francs, the French government is expected to sell its approximately 73% holding in BNP in several stages to institutional and corporate shareholders, private investors and bank employees.
