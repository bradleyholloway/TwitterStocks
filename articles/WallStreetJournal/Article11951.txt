 Baby Bells Expected to Announce Plans For Sale of Their Bellcore Research Lab   By By Leslie Cauley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1995  The seven Baby Bells are expected to announce plans to sell their jointly owned research arm, Bell Communications Research Co., in one of the most dramatic signs yet of their diverging interests.  The board of Bellcore, as the research consortium is known, was set to take a final vote last night, knowledgeable executives said. Barring any last-minute snags, the Bells are expected to announce as early as today their intention to sell Bellcore, considered one of the world's leading research labs.  Bellcore was created as a jointly owned lab when the seven regional Bell telephone companies were spun off from the old AT&T Corp. empire 11 years ago. But as local-phone monopolies gradually begin to open up for new competitors, and the Bells themselves target the "information highway" and new interactive services, the seven giants increasingly may compete more directly with one another.
