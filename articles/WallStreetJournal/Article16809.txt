 Siemens Fine Ends a Bribery Probe; Germany's Investigation Of Telecom Arm Is Closed; Other Inquiries Continue   By David Crawford and Mike Esterl, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2007  "Today's decisions are important steps in clarifying and coming to terms with the misconduct which occurred in the past. Siemens accepts full responsibility in this matter," said Siemens President and CEO Peter Loescher. "We will continue to strengthen compliance as a key element of Siemens's corporate and leadership culture."  Although it is one of the largest corporate penalties levied in Germany, yesterday's 201 million euro charge is unlikely to trouble Siemens financially. The company booked a net profit of just over 3 billion euros for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2006. European Union regulators hit Siemens with a much larger 400 million euro fine earlier this year for operating a cartel in electrical switching gear. Siemens is appealing that decision.  German police raided Munich-based Siemens's offices last November after flagging 20 million euros in questionable payments at the telecom unit, formerly the conglomerate's largest. Prosecutors suspect company managers funneled funds through sham consulting contracts to bribe potential customers abroad over several years. Earlier this year, Siemens transferred the bulk of its telecom-equipment business into a 50-50 joint venture with Finland's Nokia Corp.
