 Quiet Revolution: Under President Bush, Regulatory Rollback Has a Major Impact --- From Banks to Baby Bells, Corporate Donors Gain From Cutting Red Tape --- Case of the `Candy Stripers'   By By John Harwood and Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2001  For GOP donors and administration officials alike, regulatory rollback represents a major piece of unfinished business. Ronald Reagan set out to tame regulations in the 1980s. And even [George W. Bush], who took a more moderate approach to regulatory issues, named his vice president, Dan Quayle, to head a White House "competitiveness council" designed to curtail the reach of rules.  In the past few months, people familiar with the situation say, senior FCC officials have quietly directed that those efforts be shelved. Other top officials at the FCC are now drafting a memorandum cutting the agency's accounting requirements sharply, making it harder for potential fraud to be discovered. Such regulatory "streamlining" began under Mr. [William Kennard]. But now Mr. [Michael Powell] is pushing toward its formal adoption this fall, over the opposition of many state regulators, who argue that the changes would make it harder to protect consumers.  Mr. Bush's aides backed the successful effort in Congress to block the [Clinton] administration's "ergonomics" rules designed to prevent repetitive stress injuries. Now the Bush team is considering a new approach, which could include publication of "Best Practices" already used by industry.
