 Suspect in 9/11 Case Will Plead Guilty   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2005  The case has been marked by delays, protracted arguments over access to al Qaeda members in U.S. custody and erratic communications from Mr. [Moussaoui], who had tried to plead guilty in 2002 but rescinded the plea a week later. The indictment accuses him of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism, commit aircraft piracy, destroy aircraft, murder government employees and destroy property. Judge [Leonie Brinkema] met with Mr. Moussaoui yesterday, officials said.
