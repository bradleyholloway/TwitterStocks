 In From the Cold: He Was a Communist For Dutch Intelligence; Comrade 'Chris Petersen' Was Big in China and Albania; 'Project Mongol' Tell-All   By Higgins, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2004  Mr. [Pieter Boeve], who appeared on television in a recent documentary about the Dutch secret service while wearing a fake beard and Groucho Marx plastic nose and glasses, says his past exploits provide tips that could help con Islamist extremists, but he doesn't envy anyone who might try: "It's very dangerous," he says.  For the next decade, the fake party helped the Dutch secret police divide Holland's legitimate Communist movement, keep tabs on Maoist groups and gain access to China's elite. "[Chris Petersen]" issued regular communiques -- all drafted by the BVD -- denouncing real Communists as sellouts and urging voters to reject them.  Advancing age has finally slowed Mr. Boeve down. He walks with a cane and can't climb stairs. His involvement with China is limited to visits to a local Chinese restaurant. He draws giggles by humming the "East is Red," a Maoist anthem. "It's a very nice tune," he says.
