 PepsiCo Net Increased 31% In 4th Quarter   By By Sanford L. Jacobs, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1987  Strong sales of soft drinks and improved results from restaurants contributed to the company's higher fourth-quarter earnings. Net increased to $116.6 million, or 44 cents a share, from $89.3 million, or 33 cents a share, adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split in May 1986. Year-earlier net included $15.7 million of losses from two discontinued operations, Wilson Sporting Goods and Lee Way Motor Freight, both of which have been sold. Thus, profit from continuing operations in the quarter was $116.6 million, up from $105 million a year earlier.
