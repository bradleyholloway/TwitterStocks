 The search for a lost swing   By Costa, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2012  The repairs began on a field in San Pedro de Macoris, on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic. The pitcher, on this day of winter batting practice, was Jose Cano. The batter was Andres Torres, the Mets' new center fielder. Off to the side stood Robinson Cano, the Yankees second baseman. Together, the three of them began to rebuild a swing that failed Torres for much of 2011.
