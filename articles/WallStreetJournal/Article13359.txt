 PURSUITS; Picks -- Hit List / Moby: The electronic-music pioneer on some of his favorite albums   By McMullen, Troy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2007  "It's a gloomy rock sound that's also very musical," [Moby] says of this album, the band's second. He adds that the album's arrangements and production inspired some of his early work, which flirted with alternative rock.  Moby divides this Scottish band's music into two groups: records produced before and after it reached the top of the pop charts in 1985 with "Don't You (Forget About Me)." He prefers the band's earlier work, which reminds him of David Bowie "circa 1970," he says.
