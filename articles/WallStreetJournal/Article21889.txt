 Your ugly sentiment, not mine   By DiIulio, John J, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1994  John J. DiIulio Jr, the author of the Jan 26, 1994 editorial page article on crime policy, "Let 'em Rot," complains that the mean-spirited title the Wall Street Journal gave the article disgusted him, distorted his message and dishonored the paper. DiIulio expresses his belief about the difference between letting prisoners "rot" in jail and simply taking a populist view of locking up violent and repeat criminals.
