 AOL Chooses America Online Chief --- Former Cable TV Executive Jonathan F. Miller to Assume A Turnaround Challenge   By By Julia Angwin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2002  Last time AOL tried to fix the division, it sent an old hand, Robert Pittman, who had been president of America Online prior to the merger with Time Warner. Now, with Mr. Pittman gone, AOL is placing its bets on Mr. [Jonathan F. Miller], a longtime cable executive whose career has ranged from the National Basketball Association's cable operations to Nickelodeon and the Home Shopping Network.  Mr. Miller, most recently a top lieutenant to Barry Diller at USA Interactive, will be one of the first outsiders to join America Online in a senior position. The online unit has long been run by a group of close-knit, longtime staffers, and it is likely that one of Mr. Miller's first tasks will be to streamline the top-heavy organization.  "This is a guy who really understands how to build profitable e-commerce businesses, and that's what a lot of people think AOL needs right now," says David Fialkow, managing director at General Catalyst Partners, a Boston venture-capital firm. Mr. Miller had just agreed to join General Catalyst when the AOL opportunity arose.
