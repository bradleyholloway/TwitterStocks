 Work Longer, Not Forever   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  Dr. [Alicia Munnell] says about one-third of the population in coming years may not be able to work to age 65, including many individuals with lower incomes. But for the estimated two-thirds of employees who have the option to remain in the office, "working longer," she says, "is a powerful antidote to reductions in retirement income."  For households with "significant" 401(k) assets, an additional 28 months on the job would yield the same replacement rates that today's retirees enjoy. "Significant" depends on household income. A household with $40,000 in annual earnings would need about $100,000; a household with $80,000 would need about $200,000. The fact that two to three years of additional work might spell the difference in financial stability in later life means that "future retirees need not panic," the report states.
