 WMC Resources Posts Profit Jump On Higher Prices   By Bell, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2005  WMC has balked at Xstrata's A$8.4 billion, or A$7.20-a-share, offer, arguing that WMC's is worth more because of a "stronger for longer" commodity price cycle that places a greater value on its copper- uranium and nickel assets.  At a Canberra briefing, Australian Prime Minister John Howard reiterated that national interest issues would be part of the government's consideration of the Xstrata bid. Mr. Howard said the final ruling on the bid will be made by Treasurer Peter Costello following a report from the Foreign Investment Review Board. Mr. Costello could rule on Xstrata's bid as early tomorrow, but his office has declined to confirm a date.
