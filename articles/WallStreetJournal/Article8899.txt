 Europe's Big Investors Flock to Stocks, As Pressure to Earn Top Returns Rises   By By Robert Bonte-Friedheim, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1997  As European equity markets have fallen in line with the U.S. and Asia over the past two weeks, a number of continental European pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors have used the opportunity to boost their equity allocations.  "We have to be there when others start to get panicky," explains Robbert Coomans, head of foreign equity investments at the 265 billion guilder ($136.5 billion) Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds, the pension fund of the Netherlands's public-service workers. ABP is increasing equity holdings to 30% by 2000 from 20% now (and 9% two years ago), so Mr. Coomans used last week's stock-market fall to buy cheaply.  Falling bond yields and rising pressures to earn top returns are driving continental Europe's big institutions to increase the weight of equities in their portfolios. And it's investors like these who hold the key to tracking European stock markets. Unlike the U.S., where retail fund flows are seen as the say-it-all indicator of stock-market psychology, European small investors don't yet make up much of the market -- it is the savings institutions that boast real buying power. "Huge investors are buying more equities, which we consider a clear signal that the bull market will last," Mr. Fortuzzi says.
