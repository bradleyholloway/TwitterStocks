 Bush's Gambit for Hispanic Vote Fizzles; Immigration Proposal Is Victim of Presidential Inattention and Resistance in Both Parties   By Calmes, Jackie, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2004  The impasse clouded last week's visit at his ranch between Mr. Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has waited since Mr. Bush took office for some liberalization of U.S. border policy, only to have the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks complicate an already contentious issue. To a Mexican reporter's question on Saturday about the plan's prospects, Mr. Bush said, "There's no telling what's going to happen in an election year." But Republican leaders in Congress have made it plain to the White House that the issue won't come to a vote this year.  Mr. [Sergio Bendixen] counters that "we've seen some slippage" from past upticks in support for the president. A May 2002 poll that he conducted had Mr. Bush essentially even with a nameless Democrat among Hispanic voters, with 46% for a Democrat and 44% for Mr. Bush. But in a May 2003 poll, Mr. Bush trailed, 48% to 34%. The late January poll, which had a three percentage-point margin of error, showed Mr. Bush with just the 30% level.  Wooing Latinos? Despite his recent immigration proposal, President Bush's support among Hispanic voters appears stagnant.
