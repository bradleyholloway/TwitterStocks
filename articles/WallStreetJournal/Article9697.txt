 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2004  China's efforts to cool its economy are effective "in many respects," so Beijing doesn't need to raise interest rates in the short term, according to a think tank tied to the country's industrial-policy maker.  Jacqui Smith, minister for industry in the Department of Trade and Industry, said this review likely will finish by the end of the month, so the issue won't be shelved. Still, Ms. Smith told the annual meeting of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales that there is "no clear consensus" on whether there should be a cap on auditor liability. And while the government is "considering all the options . . . that includes the option of doing nothing too."  Mr. [Ralph Goodale], speaking after the first Cabinet meeting since the June 28 election, said he didn't have a specific date for releasing the policy blueprint on bank mergers, but added, "I'm beginning to pull all of the pieces together in order to respond as rapidly as I can." The plan was originally slated to be released by June 30, but was put on hold when Prime Minister Paul Martin called the election.
