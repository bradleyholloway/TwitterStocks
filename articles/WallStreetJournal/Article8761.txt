 Vietnam Faces an Internet Quandary: Desire for Data vs. Security Concerns   By By Reginald Chua and Carey Zesiger, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1996  As Vietnam edges warily toward allowing Internet access, local and foreign companies are rushing to stake out turf in the country's rudimentary cyberspace. Hardware has been installed. Networks are sprouting. Software is being peddled. Already much of the basic infrastructure is in place to open the doors to a freer flow of information across the nation. That, it seems, is sparking the caution.  Don't expect any sudden spasms of glasnost. Government companies still control which foreign books and magazines make it to local bookshelves. Visitors are expected to declare "cultural products" -- including videotapes, compact disks and books -- upon arrival at airports. Economic statistics are jealously hoarded and occasionally dribbled out. As for cyberspace, limited international electronic-mail service is available, but so far no one in Vietnam offers direct access to the full Internet. There's little incentive to change.  "Nobody wants to take responsibility" for the Internet, says Nguyen Quoc Nam, managing director of Grand Pacific Co., an agent for U.S. computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc., "because it is so new and so complex and has a profound effect if you make the wrong decision." Bureaucrats aren't comfortable even talking about it: Officials from the regulatory agency, Department General of Posts and Telecommunications, declined to be interviewed about Internet policy.
