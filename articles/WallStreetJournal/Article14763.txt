 ENTERPRISE   By By Barbara Marsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1990  Entrepreneurs selling everything from wristwatches to calendars that poke fun at Mr. Quayle say interest is still strong nearly two years after the election. "I saw the writing on the wall when he was elected," says John Wade, a conservative Republican and T-shirt merchant in Lenexa, Kan. His top seller: a T-shirt with the logo, "President's Prayer Club -- Keep George Healthy."  In Arlington, Va., entrepreneur Walton Sullivan gets about 40 orders a week for another hot T-shirt: It shows a ghoulish black and white screaming face taken from Edvard Munch's "The Scream," along with the words, "President Quayle."  In Chicago, Computronics Discount Radar Detectors' $29.50 Dan Quayle watches boost profits. Mr. Quayle's tie makes up the hour and minute hands amid misplaced watch-face numbers.
