 Entercom and Cumulus Media Rise, Delta Falls   By Hadi, Mohammed, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  Delta Air Lines led small air carriers lower after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to sell from neutral on an increased likelihood that the airline will file for bankruptcy-court protection, as well as a report that the carrier's pilots union postponed election of new officers, citing what it said was information that the company had tried to "interfere" with the election process. Delta (NYSE) fell 28 cents, or 13%, to 1.95. Also, Northwest Airlines fell six cents, or 1.5%, to 4.03, and Alaska Air slipped 26 cents to 33.43.  As for the Fed's statement after its rate move, "I don't see any surprises," said Barry Hyman, equity strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. He noted there was "a bit of concern that the Fed could get more aggressive and drop the 'measured pace' language. We did not see that occur." Still, he thinks more of a correction in stocks is warranted because of the breadth of gains in July and earlier.  Sotheby's Holdings (NYSE) added 1.29, or 8.3%, to 16.84. The New York auction house's second-quarter revenue and earnings from continuing operations rose, thanks to "significant improvements in auction commission margins," the company said.
