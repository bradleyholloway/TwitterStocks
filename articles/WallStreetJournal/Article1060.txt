 Wall Street Veterans Launch Advisory Boutique   By Berman, Dennis K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  Mr. [Stephen Crawford]'s redeployment will be watched on Wall Street, after his short and turbulent tenure in the uppermost ranks at Morgan Stanley. Last year, Mr. Crawford spent about 3 1/2 months as the firm's co-president, working alongside longtime ally, chief executive Philip Purcell. Mr. Crawford resigned soon after Mr. Purcell came under both internal and external pressure to leave his post. Mr. Crawford collected $32 million in compensation on his way out.  In an interview, Mr. Crawford said that he was eager to get back to advising clients. He will be doing it inside a firm far smaller than his past employer, which employs about 53,000. "We're going to see more focused private advice firms that don't want to be everything to everyone in the capital markets," Mr. Crawford said.
