 The Choice: Years on Dialysis Brought Joe Mole To a Crossroads; Treatment Kept Him Alive, But Always Exhausted; A Sister's Plea to Continue; Handmade Clocks for Nurses   By McCarthy, Michael J, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2005  Ms. [Pam Kimble] worried that her brother seemed weaker. Sometimes she'd pop into his shop to sweep up sawdust or hand him tools, and take the opportunity to check his blood sugar. "I'm getting sick, Pam," she recalls him saying. "I've got to finish these pews." Ms. Kimble's boyfriend, Mr. Phillips, quietly began lining up a replacement to finish the job if Mr. Mole couldn't.  He'd hinted at his intentions before, but never so forcefully. "You've got to keep going," Ms. Kimble said. "You've got to try." He said nothing. "You're not sick enough," she continued. "The big guy's not ready for you."  Sitting in Ohio, his other sister, Mrs. [Beverly Wingate], heard Mr. Mole's despair over the phone. "He would call me crying, saying, 'I can't take it anymore,' " she recalls. "He wanted to quit, but he didn't have the guts to." She wanted to stop his suffering, but couldn't bring herself to tell him to stop the treatments. She told him to pray, and to speak again with his nurses and doctor. "I knew it had to be his decision."
