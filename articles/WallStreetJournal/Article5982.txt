 Hong Kong Chief Visits a Wary Washington   By By Matt Pottinger and Gren Manuel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  In February, a week after Mr. [Tung Chee Hwa] first described Falun Gong as an "evil cult" and a potential threat to public safety, U.S. Consul General Michael Klosson delivered a speech in Mr. [Bush]'s home state of Texas in which he praised Hong Kong but cited multiple "concerns which highlight that Hong Kong's situation merits continued attention from the United States and other major partners." His concerns included the Hong Kong news media's freedom to report on advocates of Taiwan's independence from China and the surveillance of Falun Gong activity.  Hong Kong's economic well-being in large part rides on Mr. Tung's ability to continue winning U.S. confidence in his commitment to guaranteeing such freedoms. Under the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. president has the authority to strip Hong Kong of special trade rights if he deems the city insufficiently autonomous from the rest of China, although such a move is highly unlikely given the positive appraisals the State Department has issued on Hong Kong since the handover.
