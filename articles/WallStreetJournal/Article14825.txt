 Gillette Negotiates Venture With Soviets That Has Provisions for Hard Currency   By By Gary Putka, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1991  Gillette Co. said it negotiated terms of a Soviet joint venture from which it would receive substantial hard currency, overcoming a traditional stumbling block to such ventures for U.S. companies.  Gillette said it will be able to get $100 million in hard currency over five years under terms of its agreement to make shaving products in Leningrad for domestic Soviet consumption.  Mr. Levy described as critical Gillette's ability under the agreement to receive $20 million a year in hard currency in exchange for rubles received from Soviet consumers for the products. Some of the hard currency will be repatriated as profit, but Mr. Levy said it would also be used to buy raw-material imports, pay down dollar-denominated debt, and meet capitalequipment lease payments to Gillette. Gillette will exchange rubles at an "official" rate of six per dollar, Mr. Levy said.
