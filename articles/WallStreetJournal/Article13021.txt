 Hollinger Is in Talks to Sell Jerusalem Post to CanWest   By Cherney, Elena, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2004  A Delaware court order yesterday blocking ousted Hollinger International chief Conrad Black's bid to sell his controlling stake to the United Kingdom's Barclay brothers has allowed Hollinger International's bankers, Lazard LLC, to move "actively forward" with obtaining offers for the company and its assets, which also include London's Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times, Hollinger International said yesterday.  To comply with yesterday's Delaware court order, which followed on the judicial opinion issued last week, Hollinger International said it will cover a $7.4 million interest payment that its parent company, Hollinger Inc., is due to make on $120 million worth of senior secured notes. But the judge said Hollinger Inc. must first take "prompt steps" to require that Lord Black and his associate David Radler repay their 5.9 million Canadian dollars (US$4.4 million) in debts to Hollinger Inc.
