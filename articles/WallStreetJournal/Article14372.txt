 SHOP TALK: What's Seven Days When You're Sick?   By By Andrea Rothman, Paul Duke Jr. and David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1987  A radio commercial for Continental Airlines' MaxSaver fares begins with a phone conversation between a woman and her daughter in another city. When the mother hears her daughter's stuffed-up voice and learns she has a cold, her maternal instincts take over: "Don't worry for a minute," she says, "I can fly in." Happily recalling Continental's low MaxSaver fares, she says, "You can get into bed . . . I'll fix some soup and get the kids off to school."  There's just one problem: As a background voice notes -- in the radio equivalent of small print -- low fares require as little as seven days advanced purchase. So if the kids need to wait until their MaxSaving grandmother arrives, they're going to miss a week of school. And what sick person wants to wait seven days for soup?  It seems Oil City Petroleum Inc., a small Tulsa oil and gas company with plenty of headaches from the plunge in oil prices, cut a $3 million deal earlier this year to buy the Will Rogers Jockey & Polo Club Inc., which was building a horseracing track in nearby Rogers County.
