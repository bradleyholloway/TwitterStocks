 Love & Money: Thinking About Long-Term Care . . . Now   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2007  We both expect to be there for each other. But what if we can't be? What if one is gone, or neither can care for the other? It's not the happiest thought for a Sunday, but an important one. We all get old. And the daily activities we take for granted in our youth are the luxuries we mourn in our twilight. As I've written before, one of our goals for 2006 was to explore long-term-care insurance. We've finally completed that. The process took longer than anticipated, largely because long-term-care isn't the easiest insurance to understand. But buying it also isn't the easiest decision to make when you're 41 years old. Maybe it's smarter to invest our money and build a larger nest egg for our old age. And what happens if one day we can't afford the policy and have to drop it? We would have wasted all those dollars on premium payments.  I've struggled for months with this. I honestly didn't want long-term-care insurance. It's relatively expensive, costing us about $2,200 a year combined. That's money we certainly have better uses for -- such as saving for our kids' education, fattening our nest egg, or even a vacation.  The policies [Amy] and I have provide $125 a day in benefits for an unlimited number of years, and those benefits compound at 5% annually to help keep pace with some of the inflation that will occur. Over the next 35 to 50 years, we'll spend between $77,000 and $110,000 for policies likely to provide many times that amount in coverage. Yes, we risk never needing the policies, meaning we will have spent all that money for nothing. But that's what insurance is: Our house may never burn down, but that doesn't mean we don't spend money on a homeowner's policy.
