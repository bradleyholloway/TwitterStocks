 Taking Flak: At Procter & Gamble, Brands Face Pressure And So Do Executives --- Amid Harsh Public Criticism By CEO, Some Bail Out; Artzt Calls It Training --- Cutting Prices, Cutting Jobs   By By Carol Hymowitz and Gabriella Stern, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1993  Managers say meetings with their boss often turn into humiliating public hazings. At a meeting of beauty product managers about 18 months ago, Mr. Artzt berated the group for mishandling Noxema skin cream. With a severe tone of disgust, he said, "How could you people be so stupid to get into this mess?" says a former marketing manager. Mr. Artzt went on for half an hour, until someone reminded him that P&G had only recently acquired Noxema and they had been assigned the brand just six weeks before.  No wonder more than a dozen senior executives have jumped the ship that launched Ivory since Mr. Artzt took the helm in early 1990, taking with them years of advertising and product-development expertise. They include executives who headed P&G's health-care-products division, domestic sales and various overseas operations.  Mr. Artzt has responded to rising costs and the market-share threat -- which P&G says eased in some categories in March and early April -- by pulling out his machete. Anxious about what he says are "massive inefficiencies" inside the company and "brand-loyalty erosion" among customers, Mr. Artzt has hired Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. and assigned P&G managers to teams to help fashion a streamlining plan.
