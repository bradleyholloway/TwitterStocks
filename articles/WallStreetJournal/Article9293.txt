 Cox Faces Suit by Clients Alleging Imposition of Illegal Franchise Fee   By By Leslie Cauley, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2001  The Virginia lawsuit recounted those events, and alleged that Cox is trying to play it both ways. The suit noted that Cox has yet to file its rates with the Federal Communications Commission, as other telecom carriers do.  "In a curious shell game, Cox appears to adopt contradictory positions regarding the classification of cable-modem service as part of a relentless effort to avoid any government regulation and for its own financial benefit at the expense of its customers," the suit claimed. That "scheme" is "illegal," the suit says, alleging that Cox consumers "have been overcharged millions of dollars in franchise fees."  The plaintiffs in the case are listed as Kimberly and William Bova of Roanoke, Va., described in the suit as customers of Cox's cable-modem service. The couple's lawyer, John Fishwick of Roanoke, Va., said neither plaintiff would be available for comment.
