 Drilling Down to Find Stock Winners   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2005  Expectations for profit growth for a number of industries may be too high. In the first half of this year, earnings of all stocks in the S&P 500 rose 12% from a year earlier, a less-vigorous gain than the 17% of last year's second half and the 26% surge in 2004's first half, according to Steven Wieting, a senior economist at Citigroup's Smith Barney unit.  Thomas McManus, a strategist at Banc of America Securities, says that health-care stocks are a place to be. "Health care provides more sustainable growth at a more reasonable price than technology," he says. "It's not as cyclical as tech, and you don't have to worry about overcapacity as much."  "Management cautioned investors that it was unlikely that earnings could match second-quarter results in the third quarter," says Mr. [Richard Bove], who says the bulk of State Street's businesses will have difficulties during the rest of the year. He recently cut his rating to 'market perform' from 'buy.'
