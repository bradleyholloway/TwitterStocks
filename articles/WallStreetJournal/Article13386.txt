 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: Evangelical Separation Anxiety   By Instone-Brewer, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2007  As it happens, new scholarship supports a slightly less strict biblical understanding of divorce than the traditional one. Scrolls found near the Dead Sea, which confirm indications found in ancient Jewish authors like Philo and Josephus, show that the key phrase "any cause" was actually the formal name of a type of divorce. That is, [Jesus] did not reject divorce for any cause but rather, he rejected the "Any Cause" divorce.  This new scholarship may allow evangelical leaders to say what they have wanted to say for some time -- that divorce is permitted so long as there are strong grounds for it. A few, like Southern Baptist scholar Jim Denison, are already teaching that abuse and abandonment are valid grounds for divorce. Some leaders advocate a "covenant marriage" in which spouses agree not to divorce unless there is abuse, a felony conviction or adultery. Conservative Christian Mike Huckabee (former Arkansas governor and presidential hopeful) calls this "a positive pre-nup," and James Dobson of Focus on the Family promotes it as a way to oppose no-fault divorces. Evangelical preachers like T.D. Jakes emphasize a distinction between the victim and the marriage breaker.
