 Bin Laden Brings Iran and the U.S. To a Crossroad   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2001  MORE THAN ANY other country, Iran led the U.S. into the struggle with radical Islam that grips the world today. More than any other country, Iran now could help the U.S. find a way out of that struggle -- if only Iranian leaders would choose to do so.  Yet today, when the struggle between the West and Islam seems most acute, the U.S. and Iran actually find themselves on essentially the same side. Iran's leaders are no more fond of Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and terrorist leader Osama bin Laden than is the U.S.  There are religious differences: The Iranians are Shiite Muslims, and the Taliban and Mr. bin Laden are radical Sunni Muslims. The Taliban and Mr. bin Laden advocate an extremely strict, Sunni version of Islamic rule that Iran dismisses. The split has led to violent confrontations; when the Taliban was consolidating power in 1998, its forces killed 10 Iranian diplomats. Iran and the Taliban nearly came to war. Now, Iran helps arm the Northern Alliance trying to overthrow the Taliban.
