 Allied Bancshares Needs $253 Million In Takeover by First Interstate Bancorp   By By Leonard M. Apcar, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1987  First Interstate Bancorp would be forced to inject $253 million into Allied Bancshares Inc. to shore up the troubled Texas banking company if it completes its proposed acquisition.  The anticipated cash infusion, which hadn't been announced, was disclosed in Allied's lengthy proxy statement for a special meeting of Allied shareholders scheduled for Dec. 14. Both First Interstate and Allied say they expected that First Interstate would need to bolster Allied's capital, but the amount of the infusion wasn't known until they had assessed the full extent of Allied's losses in the six months since the takeover was unveiled in May.  Allied said it plans to take bad loans and property it originally valued at $378 million, mark them down to $250 million and place them in the separate bank for collection. Proceeds, if any, would be paid to Allied's current shareholders, who will receive one share in the new bank for each Allied share held.
