 Mutual Funds Quarterly -- Special Report: New Fund Flavors, New Risks   By Salisbury, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  Among the latest offerings: "BRIC" funds that target four fast- growing nations, Brazil, Russia, India and China; so-called 130-30 funds that hedge their investments by simultaneously making bets for and against the stock market; and exchange-traded notes, a variation on the popular ETFs designed to make it easier for people to bet on commodities and some other assets that can be hard to invest in.  The first BRIC mutual fund sold to U.S. investors, Templeton BRIC Fund (TABRX), which opened last year, posted a one-year return of 67% through Thursday. Goldman Sachs's own Goldman Sachs BRIC Fund (GBRAX) rose 79%, making it one of the best performing emerging-markets funds. State Street and Claymore Securities offer BRIC ETFs.  The 130-30 funds give ordinary investors a taste of an investing strategy that has been popular among hedge funds, lightly regulated investment pools for institutions and rich individuals. Like other "long-short" mutual funds, the 130-30 funds have traditional "long" holdings of stocks but also sell other stocks "short" in a bet that prices will fall. In a short sale, investors sell borrowed shares with the hope of repurchasing them later at a lower price.
