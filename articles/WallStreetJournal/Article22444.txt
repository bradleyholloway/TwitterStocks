 Blue Chips Fall 45.06 Points in Volatile Trading   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1998  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after being up 125.13 points at 1 p.m. EDT, finished the day down 45.06, or 0.58%, at 7782.37. It was the first session in five that the blue-chip index didn't finish with a triple-digit loss or gain. The index is now down 1.59% for the year. Trading remained frenetic: Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 891.6 million shares, its fifth-busiest day ever.  In a turnabout, however, small stocks posted strong gains. The Russell 2000 small-stock index rose 4.55, or 1.31%, to 352.65, though it is still down 19.3% for the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index, laden with both small stocks and technology issues, advanced 17.76, or 1.13% to 1592.85 and is up marginally for the year. The New York Stock Exchange saw 1,897 stocks advance and only 1,273 decline.  Traders said that a lot of the late-day decline was linked to futures selling by sophisticated investors, which by its nature hits large stocks harder than small ones. Bob Basel, head of listed-stock trading at Salomon Smith Barney, noted that at the day's high of 7952.56, the Dow industrials were 573 points above Tuesday's lows.
