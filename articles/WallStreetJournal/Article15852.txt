 `Anthill' Economics: How Natural Disasters Can Change the Course Of a Region's Growth --- In Pascagoula, Miss., Sales Surged, Jobs Multiplied; Then There's Galveston --- A Year of Living With Mom   By By Robert Tomsho, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1999  Hurricane Georges ripped into the Mississippi Gulf Coast on Sept. 27, 1998. The following month, Mr. (Jim) Estabrook's 48-year-old dealership set a sales record.  Afterward, retail sales soar as ruined goods are repaired or replaced, and construction is fueled by an influx of insurance money and federal disaster relief. Moreover, insured homeowners and businesses, already facing insurance-financed repairs, often seize the occasion to improve their properties. "They add extra stuff," says Douglas Woodward, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina. "We call it the Jacuzzi effect."  After Hurricane Hugo lashed Charleston, S.C., in September 1989, the local economy performed above expectations for seven of the next 10 quarters and was bolstered by an estimated $370 million in unanticipated income. Devastated by a 1997 flood, Grand Forks, N.D., now is in the midst of a rebuilding binge that includes a $350 million dike and $125 million in school construction, though local governments have had to raise taxes, take on debt and cut their operating budgets to help finance the projects. And the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, which killed 57 people and caused more than $20 billion in damage, barely registered in the economic data of the area, which was quickly rebuilt. "Something like this just doesn't destroy an economy," says Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
