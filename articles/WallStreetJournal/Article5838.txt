 The Circus Gets a Makeover --- Under the Big Top, Audiences Sip Champagne, Espresso; Where Are the Elephants?   By By Lisa Gubernick, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2000  But then a clown in a tuxedo rolled out a crimson carpet and ushered the guests into the reception tent. Mr. [Roger] Mitchell took in the circus wagons selling Caesar salads and espresso with hazelnut liqueur. Once in the big top, he sank back in a plush, red-velvet seat -- and stayed for the entire two-hour-and twenty-minute show.  It was 13 years ago that the Montreal acrobatic troupe Cirque du Soleil blazed this circus-marketing trail with its first U.S. tour. Now, a number of boutique circuses are competing for the high-end customer. The San Francisco troupe Teatro ZinZanni features a Kama Sutra-style trapeze act while the audience consumes a five-course meal below.  A family outing to a high-end circus can be breath-takingly pricey: "Teatro Zinzanni" charges $125 a ticket, entitling guests to a five-course meal (drinks and tip not included) while a contortionist wriggles out of a gauze candlestick at tableside. The VIP tickets to "Dralion" -- 200 out of the 2,800 tickets per show -- cost the VIP price of $150 apiece, roughly double what the highest priced regular seat costs. The top ticket for "Barnum's Kaleidoscape" costs $49, about 30% more than the most expensive ticket to Feld's Ringling Bros. show.
