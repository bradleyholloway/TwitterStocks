 Benetton Unveils Makeover Strategy; Italian Apparel Maker Aims To Revive Sales and Profits With Three-Year Overhaul   By Jennifer Clark and Cecilie Rohwedder, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2003  For years, Benetton's classic, colorful knitwear was popular with young shoppers across the globe. But since the brand's heyday in the 1980s, the clothing market has changed, especially with the arrival of lower-price and faster-growing fashion retailers such as H&M Hennes & Mauritz AB of Sweden and Zara, owned by Inditex SA of Spain. In addition, Benetton had moved beyond bright sweaters, selling a wide range of apparel now competing with less expensive items.  Benetton's new management, headed by former Fiat SpA executive Silvano Cassano, said the company wouldn't try to compete on price or make its goods more trendy. In a meeting with journalists and investors yesterday, Mr. Cassano said focus-group research showed that "our clients want us to be fresher, not more fashionable." He said Benetton also wasn't planning to reduce staff, move production to China or do a real-estate spinoff -- all quick fixes for clothing makers and retailers in the current business climate.
