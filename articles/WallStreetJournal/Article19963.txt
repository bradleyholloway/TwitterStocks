 The Economy; BUSINESS: Coke's Caution Makes Bubbly Times Go Flat   By Deogun, Nikhil, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2006  Coke takes in gobs of money selling soft-drink concentrate to bottlers, who add fizzy water and make sure the drinks are within Coke's proverbial "arm's reach of desire." The whole Coke system is geared to selling soda, which has been a great living for more than a century. The profit margins on selling other drinks pale in comparison.  IN THE MID-1990s, fizzy-drinks volume rose 3% to 4% a year in the U.S., and at even higher rates overseas, fattening Coke's bottom line. In this decade, carbonated-soda growth in the U.S. has been stuck at less than 1%, and the market share of fizzy drinks has slipped to 73% from 83% in 1999, according to Beverage Digest. Meanwhile, sales volume of noncarbonated drinks, such as juices, teas and sports drinks, rose 8% in 2004 alone. Bottled-water volume in the U.S. shot up 19% in 2004. By contrast, U.S. sales volume of Coca-Cola Classic, the flagship brand and Coke's money machine, has fallen 9% since 1999.  The management of Coke has for years been hobbled by endless internal debates. Even modest "line extensions" -- Diet Coke with Lime, for instance -- are considered huge accomplishments. Coke has counted on its distribution might to vault its new products to the top, not paying nearly enough attention to marketing. In some cases, this works. Coke has become a big player in bottled water, though that is a business where competition is cutthroat and margins are headed toward zero. In the more profitable "noncarbs" -- sports drinks, juices and teas -- Pepsi is it.
