Mr. Kohlhausen was quoted in a German newspaper last week as saying he expected to make progress on forming such an alliance next year. While there appears to be no talks at the moment, a Commerzbank spokesman suggested the heads of the four banks could meet informally at the annual World Bank meeting later this month.
