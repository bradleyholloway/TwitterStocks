 Health Care: What's on the Table, What's Ahead   By Mincer, Jilian, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2009  The House version would provide sliding-scale premium subsidies for families with incomes of up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or $88,000, but the Senate version tops out at $66,000, says Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit focused on health-care issues. A proposal from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, for instance, would require most employers to offer health coverage and pay 60% of premium costs -- or pay annual fines of $750 for full-time employees and $375 for part-time workers.
