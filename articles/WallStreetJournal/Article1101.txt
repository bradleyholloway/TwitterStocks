 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  If that person's basis was higher than the fair-market value on the date of the gift, "you cannot take a loss using the other person's basis as your basis," Ms. [Beth Shapiro Kaufman] says. In that situation, "you must use the fair-market value of the property on the date of the gift ($30 in your case) as your basis."  If there is any gift tax due, it's paid by the person who gave you the stock, Ms. Kaufman adds. The person would owe a tax if the individual's "total gifts to you during the year exceed the amount of the annual exclusion ($12,000 this year) and if the person already had used up the lifetime credit against the gift tax, which allows $1 million to be given away free of gift tax," Ms. Kaufman says.
