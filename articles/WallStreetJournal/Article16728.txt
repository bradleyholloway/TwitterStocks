 The Indian Giver   By Cohen, William S, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2007  India's military is the second largest in the world by number of members. As in the U.S., India's military is controlled by a civilian, democratically elected leadership. India has a transparent judicial system and insists upon a vibrant and free press, just as we do. India enrolls more than 100,000 students each year in U.S. colleges and universities -- and an effort is underway to grant more visas to provide even greater access in the future. Each day we see our economies working more closely together than ever before. Consistent with this convergence, the 2.2 million Americans of Indian origin are becoming increasingly influential in shaping the dynamics of the U.S. political stage.  That said, there is still far to go in terms of India developing first-world infrastructure and delivering world-class education and health care to all its citizens. These challenges can best be met by true partnership and U.S.-India cooperation. U.S. industry stands ready to commit massive investment in the form of public-private partnerships, converting these challenges into opportunity. Already, U.S. defense industry leaders such as Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics have committed to significant coproduction with Indian partners, recognizing India's engineering prowess. Likewise, U.S. companies have demonstrated a commitment to work with Indian partners to help India achieve a second Green Revolution. The public-private approach that has worked so well in the U.S., which has brought high technology to all aspects of the economy, can serve as a model for India as its farmers work towards achieving greater agricultural productivity.
