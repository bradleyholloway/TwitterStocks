 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2005; Real Estate Develops a Split Personality; Residential Market Cools As Rates Rise, Homes Sit, Commercial Sector Heats Up   By Haughney, Christine, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2006  The cool-down is expected to spread to all parts of the real-estate market in the coming year, although some acknowledge that such predictions haven't come true in the past. "I wake up every year and say 'it can't be this good again,' " says Steve Kantor, global head of real estate for Credit Suisse First Boston. "I find it hard to believe the robustness of the markets."  "It's signaling the onset of softer pricing environment and a reversion to a buyer's market from a seller's market," says David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch's North American economist. He says these conditions mirror the technology industry in 2000 before its fall, although he adds any decline in home prices will be far more gradual than the market declines that most recently hit the stock market or technology sector.  "History would suggest that REITS can't return 30%-plus a year over an extended period of time," Mr. [Keven Lindemann] says. But "they're still outperforming most other sectors in the investment world."
