 Norwegian Cruise's Parent Is in Talks To Merge With Star Cruises of Malaysia   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1999  Meanwhile, Carnival, of Miami, said it had received "informal approval" yesterday from the Oslo Stock Exchange to proceed with its tender offer for NCL at 30 kroner a share. The offer amounts to about $900 million for the equity of NCL, the world's fourth-largest cruise line, and the assumption of about $800 million in NCL debt. Carnival said it expects to begin mailing tender-offer documents to NCL shareholders by tomorrow.  "Our only response is, let {Star} make an offer," said Tim Gallagher, a spokesman for Carnival, the world's largest cruise line. Mr. Gallagher reiterated Carnival's stance that it has no intention of raising its offer for NCL. "As Micky Arison {Carnival's chairman and chief executive} said last Friday, if they have a party who wants to put an offer on the table that's higher than ours, we'll tender our shares."
