 Tip of the Week: Cut Gift List With No Pain   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2005  If you draw lots, you should discuss how much is appropriate to spend on each gift. "You don't want to have somebody get a stereo and somebody else get a pair of mittens," says John Danaher, president of TrueCredit, a unit of the TransUnion credit bureau.  Americans will spend nearly $750 on average for holiday gifts this season, according to a survey by Bank of America. Says Mr. Danaher: "We don't want to be a Scrooge or put a dampener on the holidays. But people need to ask the question, 'Can I afford this?'"
