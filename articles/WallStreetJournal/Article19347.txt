 The Pressure On Daimler Ratchets Up --- It Hires J.P. Morgan To Aid in Suit, Braces For S&P Downgrade   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Scott Miller in Frankfurt and Jeffrey Ball in Detroit, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2000  DaimlerChrysler's hiring of J.P. Morgan is part of a broad strategy launched to fight the suit by Mr. [Kirk Kerkorian], the company's third-biggest shareholder. Mr. Kerkorian's suit argues that DaimlerChrysler deceived shareholders by portraying the 1998 deal that created the company as a "merger of equals" rather than a takeover of Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz AG. Mr. Kerkorian seeks $8 billion, including $2 billion in damages that in part is compensation for a so-called takeover premium that he argues he would have gotten for his Chrysler shares if DaimlerChrysler had said from the outset that the deal was a takeover.  Critics say Mr. [Juergen Schrempp] has created a monster too big for him and his team to manage. Indeed, Moody's argued in its downgrade notice on Friday that Mr. Schrempp's "aggressive pace of acquisition" had contributed to the company's "narrowing of financial flexibility." Mr. Schrempp defended his strategy, saying: "You cannot always select the timing as it suits you. If you do that, and sit back and say I'll wait another year or two, somebody else will act and you are defeated."  Last month, in an effort to stanch the bleeding at Chrysler, he ousted the unit's head, James Holden, and replaced him with a management team from Stuttgart led by Mr. Schrempp's trusted lieutenant, Dieter Zetsche. In Friday's interview, Mr. Schrempp revealed plans to save billions of dollars by having Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler cars share more parts. He also said the company doesn't plan to buy back its shares in order to boost the price, even though shareholders have authorized the company to do so.
