 IBM, Wal-Mart and CSX Sink; Pfizer Among Rare Advancers   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2002  The market initially took a wait-and-see approach to the late-morning nomination of CSX Chairman John Snow as Treasury secretary to succeed Paul O'Neill. Traders were mixed about the appointment, considering Mr. O'Neill was also a veteran CEO.  CSX declined 42 cents, or 1.5%, to 28.08 as shareholders may have been a bit concerned about the rail carrier standing to lose its CEO. Mr. Snow has been chief executive of CSX for the past decade.  The session's best performers, drug makers, moved after shareholders of Pharmacia approved the company's merger with Pfizer, a deal that will create the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. Pfizer rose 23 cents to 31.23 after saying it will exchange 1.4 shares for each outstanding Pharmacia share in a deal expected to close in the first quarter. Pharmacia gained 22 cents to 42.40.
