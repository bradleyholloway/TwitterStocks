 Coke Shares Drop After Resignation Of No. 2 Executive   By By Ann Carrns, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  The beverage company announced Sunday that Jack Stahl, president and chief operating officer, resigned amid a reorganization of Coke into four global operating units. The restructuring, championed by Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas Daft, is aimed at reworking Coke into a network of different brands and businesses. But the change essentially eliminated Mr. Stahl's job, as the executives of the four units will report directly to Mr. Daft.  Coke shares fell yesterday, even as other blue-chip stocks rallied. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchanges composite trading, Coke shares were down $2.35 at $50.20.
