 Morgan Stanley Is Sued on `Break Points'   By By Tom Lauricella, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2003  The fees investors pay for different share classes can be substantial. On Sept. 28, 1999, a Morgan Stanley broker put $79,000 in the B shares of the Morgan Stanley Information Fund on behalf of one of the plaintiffs, according to the lawsuit. Using calculations from Morningstar.com and assuming an 8% return a year on the fund, after five years the investor would have paid $1,745 more in fees and expenses on B shares compared with the fund's C shares, which are best option for that time frame. Going out 10 years with the same assumed returns, the A shares would have saved the investor $5,085 more than the B shares. The break-point discounts are the same at all Morgan Stanley stock funds.  The lawsuit cites several examples of investors it says were sold B shares by Morgan Stanley brokers when they would have qualified for the break-point discounts on A shares or would have been better off as a short-term investor in C shares. One investor, in his 70s, was told by his broker to put $105,000 in the B shares of four Morgan Stanley stock funds and then less than a week later put an additional $26,000 into Class B shares of two additional stock funds, according to the suit. Another broker invested $199,000 in the B shares of five Morgan Stanley stock funds on behalf of a pair of retirees, the suit claimed.  The lawsuit contends that Morgan Stanley brokers often sell more of the B shares than other classes of shares because they generate bigger upfront commissions on the larger investments, as is typical of mutual-fund sales at most firms, industry experts say. For example, the lawsuit cites an instance where a Morgan Stanley broker bought $175,000 in B shares of Morgan Stanley Utilities Fund on behalf of a client in March 1999.
