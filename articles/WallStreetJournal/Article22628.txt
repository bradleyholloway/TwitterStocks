 Boeing to Continue Streamlining Inspection, Oversight, Officials Say   By By Jeff Cole and Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2000  OFFICIALS of Boeing Co. and regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration say a recent string of manufacturing problems at Boeing's commercial-airplane unit doesn't pose a safety hazard. An article yesterday incorrectly stated that both the company officials and the regulators see the problems as posing such a hazard. (WSJ April, 4, 2000)  During the past few weeks, Boeing has begun replacing substandard fuel-tank beams prone to cracking, and correcting suspect installation of certain wiring that could pose a fire hazard. Both were found in twin-engine 767 models. Since November, the company has acknowledged five other production problems affecting hundreds of planes. The company and federal regulators say the problems pose a safety hazard and they aren't aware of any resulting incidents or accidents.  Alan Mulally, president of Boeing's commercial-airplane unit, said he believes there is "absolutely no connection" between the effort so far to thin-out oversight procedures the company has seen as redundant and unnecessary, and the recent spate of quality problems. He called the recent errors "exceptions" in an otherwise-viable system. Mr. Mulally acknowledged that more reductions in inspection and certification procedures are part of long-term plans, but he said they will occur only as a consequence of Boeing finding ways to assure quality as broader "lean manufacturing" initiatives are put in place.
