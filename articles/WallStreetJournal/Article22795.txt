 Gold Club's Owner Pleads Guilty, Gets Prison Term and Fine   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2001  Steve Kaplan also agreed to give up the Gold Club, putting the federal government at least temporarily in charge of one of the nation's most profitable strip clubs. The plea deal was announced two days after an important witness began testifying against him.  Mr. Kaplan and six others were charged with obstruction, credit-card fraud, loan sharking, prostitution and other charges. Prosecutors said Mr. Kaplan funneled club profits to the Gambino crime family.
