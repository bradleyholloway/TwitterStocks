 Changing Code: For Policy Makers, Microsoft Suggests Need to Recast Models --- Agencies Scramble as Web Poses Good Monopolies, Skews Classic Economics --- Avalanche vs. Thermostat   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  The relentless push toward monopoly in today's economy is increased by something economists call "network effects." In information businesses, the desire for everyone to be part of the same network is intense. Schoolchildren like to use America Online Inc.'s instant-messaging service because their friends use it. Computer users like Microsoft's Word software because it makes it easier to trade files with their colleagues, who also use Word. In his speech in San Francisco, Mr. [Lawrence Summers] used the fax machine to describe this network effect. If there is only one, it "is best used as a doorstop." But if there are 100,000, "that is 10 billion possible connections."  Even the Justice Department was forced to acknowledge this new fact of life last month, in its antitrust case against Microsoft. Attorney David Boies told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that the government had decided against dividing Microsoft's Windows monopoly among three new companies because such a solution would be "unstable." The reason: Windows is a natural monopoly. Competition among the new companies would drive the price of Windows to zero, and destroy the business.  Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general for antitrust who brought the Microsoft case, argues that all the talk about the New Economy misses the point. Microsoft's crime lay not in having a monopoly, but in using illegal tactics to both protect that monopoly and extend it into new markets.
