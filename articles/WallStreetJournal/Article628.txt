 High-Tech Locks Keep Out Intruders -- And Sometimes Those Who Are Welcome   By By Edwin A. Finn Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1985  Despite such difficulties, eyeball-reader locks and other newfangled security devices are attracting growing attention because of rising concern about corporate and personal security. A recent study by Frost & Sullivan Inc., a New York consulting firm, indicates sales of high-tech locks will grow tenfold to $1.36 billion a year by 1990 from $127 million last year.  But not everyone who actually has to use the locks is so sure. Beyond the irritation of locks that don't function properly, some workers see the devices, which typically are limited to computers, as an unwanted Big Brother tracking their movements. And there have been instances of sabotage -- including cigarette packs and ashes jammed into the card slots of locks that read specially encoded cards.  Biometric locks aren't perfect, however. Barry Becker, vice president of EyeDentify Inc. which makes eyeball-reader locks, notes the gory possibility that a severed finger could be used to open a lock that reads fingerprints. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, experimenting with its own fingerprint reader, found a method that isn't so messy: a latex finger mold. Voice-identifying locks can be fooled with tape recordings; some locks that measure hand shapes can be defeated with the silhouette of a hand made on a copying machine.
