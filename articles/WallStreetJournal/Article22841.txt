 Democrats Try to Make Hay of Enron Fall --- Lieberman to Hold Hearings As Party Aims to Play Up Company's Ties to GOP   By By Michael Schroeder and Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2002  It remains to be seen if the issue will resonate with voters. For one thing, Enron's energy-trading business is extremely complex; for another, some Democrats also benefited from Enron's largesse -- though hardly as much as Republicans have. Since 1990, the company has given three-quarters of its campaign donations to GOP causes. Al Gore's presidential campaign against Mr. [Bush] received $13,700 from Enron executives during the 2000 campaign cycle; Mr. Bush's campaign got $114,000 and his party far more.  Meanwhile, Republicans have gone on the offensive. Last Friday, in answer to a reporter's question, Mr. Bush said Enron must be held accountable. "There will be a lot of government inquiry into Enron and what took place there," he said. "I'm deeply concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings."  In California, meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suggested that Enron may have contributed to the energy crisis that struck his state last year. "I take no joy in Enron's troubles," he said last month. But, he added in a swipe aimed at the company, "Some of the companies providing power were driving a very hard bargain, I believe taking advantage of California." Earlier this year, the state's Democratic attorney general, William Lockyer, subpoenaed Enron's electricity-trading records in an attempt to show that the state was a victim of price gouging.
