 Andersen Takes Different View On Shredding   By By Jonathan Weil and Alexei Barrionuevo, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2002  The broader Andersen defense strategy is significant because it likely will shape Andersen's rebuttal of all government evidence to come. David Duncan, the former lead partner on Andersen's Enron account, pleaded guilty last month to obstruction-of-justice charges for his role in destroying Enron-related documents. He has told congressional investigators that he interpreted an Oct. 12 e-mail from Andersen in-house lawyer Nancy Temple, reminding another Houston partner of the firm's document policy, to mean that he should begin destroying Enron-related documents that weren't needed to support the firm's audit conclusions.  Mr. [Andrew Weissmann] didn't follow up with questions about why Mr. [Benjamin Neuhausen] chose to delete only Enron-related e-mails, though Mr. Neuhausen did tell him he couldn't recall having received an advisory like Ms. Temple's before. Mr. Neuhausen further testified that no one at that point had advised him of threatened litigation or an SEC inquiry into the firm. He said he was advised by Andersen later in the year to retain all Enron-related documents.  Mr. [Rusty Hardin] accused the government of violating the same federal witness-tampering statute under which Andersen was indicted in March. Mr. Hardin said he feared that word of Ms. [Kate Agnew]'s decision to take the Fifth would intimidate other prospective witnesses with testimony favorable to Andersen. He added that he knew of at least two other similar situations involving prospective witnesses who work for Andersen.
