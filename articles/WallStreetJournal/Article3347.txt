 Gorman-Rupp Expects Record Full-Year Profit   By By Ralph Winter, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2000  In addition, Gorman-Rupp's Canadian unit is having a good year, he said. So is the Gorman-Rupp industries division, which makes small pumps for specialized applications ranging from dispensing drinks from vending machines to pumping fluids in film developing equipment and office copiers.  The Gorman-Rupp industries division has acquired a new line of pumps that handle viscous liquids such as fluids used in kidney-dialysis systems. That market may expand as medical-equipment concerns develop dialysis systems for use in the home, Mr. [Jeffrey S. Gorman] said. Currently, many kidney-dialysis patients have to go to a hospital or other medical facility several time a week for treatment.  Gorman-Rupp's foreign sales are strong this year, Mr. Gorman said, with rising volume in Mexico, the rest of Latin America and Asia more than offsetting some softness in Europe. The weak euro makes Gorman-Rupp's products expensive in Europe, he said. The company has a small operation in Ireland that assembles fire-protection pumps, but most foreign sales are direct exports from the U.S.
