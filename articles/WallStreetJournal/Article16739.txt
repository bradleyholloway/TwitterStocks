 Mutual Funds Play The Waiting Game; Emerging Markets May See Correction After China Selloff   By Maxey, Daisy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  That, says Mr. [Landesman], is what's going on in Wall Street offices and trading desks. "Everybody is taking a wait-and-see attitude," he said. "When that happens, markets go down."  Reiner Triltsch, co-manager of U.S. Trust's $625 million Excelsior International Fund, said he's expecting "a little correction" in emerging markets. He said he'll use any extended weakness to selectively increase his exposure to the markets, which is now at about 13.5%.  There are a "bunch of names" that Mr. Landesman said he'd like to buy. "I have a little bit of cash and could raise some more," he added.
