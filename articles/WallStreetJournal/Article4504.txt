 Beatrice Says It Now Seeks Acquisitions After 3 Years of Rapid-Fire Divestitures   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Beatrice Co. said it has begun looking for acquisitions, in a policy switch following three years of rapid-fire divestitures.  Beatrice was taken private in 1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. In a leveraged buy-out, a company is acquired with mostly borrowed money; it then seeks to pay down the debt by selling assets or generating cash from operations.  Mr. Carmichael said that as of Feb. 28, Beatrice had $809 million of common equity, compared with about $1.4 billion in debt. That produces a debt-to-equity ratio for the company of about 1.5 to 1. Immediately after the 1986 buy-out, Beatrice's debts were more than 10 times common equity. Industrial companies typically have debt to equity ratios of about 1 to 1, or slightly lower.
