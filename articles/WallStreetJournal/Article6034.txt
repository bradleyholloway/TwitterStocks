 Geron Gives Up Some Stem-Cell Rights --- Wisconsin Alumni Group In Pact Aiding Research And Commercialization   By By David P. Hamilton and Antonio Regalado, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2002  Geron of Menlo Park, Calif., funded the University of Wisconsin researcher who discovered and patented human embryonic stem cells in 1998 and has long insisted that it held exclusive commercial control over virtually all work done with the cells. In particular, Geron's licensing agreement with WARF gave it exclusive control over six types of cells derived from stem cells and options to acquire exclusive rights in other cell types as well.  Under the terms of the agreement, Geron's exclusive commercial rights will be limited to three types of derived human cells: heart cells, nerve cells and pancreas cells. Geron will retain nonexclusive commercial rights to develop products and diagnostic tests with three other cell types: bone, blood and cartilage.  In addition, university and government researchers will be able to conduct noncommercial research without paying patent fees or royalties to either Geron or WARF. The deal includes access to technology that Geron has developed internally, such as a method for growing stem cells without using a layer of mouse cells.
