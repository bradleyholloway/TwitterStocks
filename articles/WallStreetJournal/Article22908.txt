 Hutchison and Former Executive Polish Bids for Global Crossing   By By Henny Sender and Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 2002  Bermuda-based Global Crossing filed for protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy law in late January with $12.4 billion in debt, making it one of the largest bankruptcy proceedings in U.S. history. The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits and two U.S. government investigations into its accounting practices.  Both offers are valued at less than the $750 million tentative bid for 79% of Global Crossing from Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte. that accompanied the original Chapter 11 filing Jan. 28, according to people familiar with the process. At one point Mr. [David Walsh] is believed to have offered to put $300 million in cash in the company for a 60% equity stake. The [Hutchison] offer is valued at less than that, according to these people. That would leave creditors with no more than $400 million in cash and the remaining equity.
