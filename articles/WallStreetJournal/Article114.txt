 Takeover Bets Turning into Bum Risks   By Smith, Randall, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 1990  Investors bid up Paramount Communications Inc. shares this week, amid reports that Chris-Craft Industries Inc. Chairman Herbert Siegel is buying the stock and that a takeover may follow. Paramount shares surged $2.75 on Wednesday to close at $36.625.  This decline has inflicted a paper loss of $171 million on UAL's biggest holder, Coniston Partners, which paid an average disclosed price of $161 a share for its 2.5 million shares. Coniston's general partner, Paul Tierney Jr., said yesterday, "We still have our entire position and will do everything in our power to effect a positive resolution." But he wouldn't comment on the stock price.  Michael Steinhardt, a hedge-fund manager, placed a bet on a takeover of USAir Group Inc. during the heady days a year ago when the Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis was pursuing UAL and the real estate developer and casino owner Donald Trump was bidding for American Air Lines parent AMR Corp. Average cost of Mr. Steinhardt's 3.7 million USAir shares: $45. Yesterday's closing price of USAir stock: $14.25. "If I live long enough, it'll come out," Mr. Steinhardt chuckled ruefully.
