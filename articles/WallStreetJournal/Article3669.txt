 Telecom-Sector Debt May Claim More Victims   By By Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2003  Local and long-distance phone carrier Qwest has about $6.5 billion in debt due before the end of 2005, and Charter, the nation's third-largest cable company, must pay back more than $1.5 billion over that period, according to the report. Allegiance, a local-phone and data upstart, has $784 million due by the end of 2005. Of that, $555 million must be eliminated by the end of April, according to an agreement the company struck with its creditors late last year. Satellite company Loral has about $1 billion coming due between now and the end of 2005.  A key element of Qwest's plan to repay its most pressing debt is closing the $4.3 billion second part of the sale of its phone-directory business. Qwest, the smallest of the regional Bells, agreed to sell the business in two parts last year for $7.05 billion and is awaiting the necessary state regulatory approvals for closing the second part later this year. Some stock and bond investors have fretted that regulators would stymie the process, but Mr. [Oren Shaffer] says the company believes there's "a high degree of likelihood" the deal will close on schedule.  For Charter, which plans to restate revenue and earnings for the past three years amid investigations into its accounting by the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors, the key question is "what the restatements mean about their core business," S&P's Mr. [Richard Siderman] says. A recent offer by controlling shareholder Paul Allen to loan the company $300 million to ease a liquidity crunch is helpful, Mr. Siderman says.
