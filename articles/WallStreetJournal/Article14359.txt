 Trail of Money From the Iran-Contra Arms Sales Remains Murky Despite 6 Months of Investigation   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1987  The hearings are likely to get quickly into the money trail because the lead witness, retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, was deeply involved in it. Gen. Secord handled logistics of both the Contra arms supply operation and portions of the Iran arms sales. He was the business partner of Albert Hakim, the man who controlled some of the Swiss bank accounts through which the funds flowed. And Contra leader Adolfo Calero has said the rebels paid Gen. Secord $9 million for arms he supplied.  There are three large pools of funds involved in the scandal: private U.S. money raised since at least 1984, when the U.S. government terminated military aid for the Contras; funds raised from friendly foreign governments for the Contras during the same period; and money received from the secret sale of arms to Iran starting in 1985, some of which was diverted to the Contras.  Investigators believe that on both the Iran and Contra ends, millions of dollars of funds involved in the scandal may have been skimmed off for profits, commissions and kickbacks -- although there isn't any evidence that this happened. Still, Iranian officials are suspected of receiving some of the money, as are arms middlemen such as Manucher Ghorbanifar and Jacob Nimrodi. Investigators are looking into whether Gen. Secord, others who bought arms for the Contras, or Contra leaders themselves kept any funds. And Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh is studying whether any U.S. officials were enriched. All the figures involved strongly deny stealing any money.
