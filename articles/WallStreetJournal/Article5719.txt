 The Wonders of a Penny Saved   By By David R. Henderson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1999  I never thought it possible that a book could make startling claims about accumulating wealth -- lots of it -- without sounding hucksterish, trite or simply incredible. But two economists, Dwight R. Lee of the University of Georgia and Richard B. McKenzie of the University of California at Irvine, have managed to write one. "Getting Rich in America" (HarperBusiness, 221 pages, $25) offers eight rules for improving your lot in life. If you follow them all, the authors argue, and don't have a terrible illness or accident (and their rules should reduce your odds of both), then, at some point between ages 40 and 65, you will be rich.  What do they mean by "rich"? Having a net worth of $1 million or more, in today's dollars, by retirement age. To claim that such a figure is within the range of most of us may seem at first absurd -- but it's not. The recent best-seller "The Millionaire Next Door" punctured a lot of myths about the roughly four million millionaires in America, showing the typical one to be a high saver in an unglamorous job with nothing close to an extravagant lifestyle. "Getting Rich in America" is the how-to handbook for becoming the millionaire next door. At the very least -- for those who remain skeptical -- it offers practical advice that you can follow straightforwardly if you want to be much better off than you are now.
