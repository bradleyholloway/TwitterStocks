 Ford Is Set to Confirm It Will Build Crossover SUV With Car Features   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  The vehicle, which Ford is calling the "CrossTrainer" is designed to have a smooth car-like ride and a rugged sport-utility body. But Ford's answer to several such vehicles already fielded by rivals still won't be available for two years.  Speaking before a group of Ford's workers here as part of the Chicago auto show, Mr. [Nick Scheele] is expected to show off a sketch of the CrossTrainer and present the vehicle as a "unique" proposition to meet the needs of an emerging number of consumers who want the image and advantages of a sport utility, but don't necessarily need the off-road and heavy-duty towing capabilities of a truck or an SUV.  Ford officials this week have also confirmed they are preparing a major redesign of their top-selling vehicle, the Ford F-series pickup trucks. While Ford's plans to redesign the F-series were well known in the industry, Ford is under increasing pressure in the large pickup segment from General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and Japanese auto makers Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., which is preparing a large pickup of its own to be built in a new plant in Mississippi.
