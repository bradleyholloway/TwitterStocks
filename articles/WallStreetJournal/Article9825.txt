 Watching The Web: Training Wheels Online for Stock Traders   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2005  Although it's aimed largely at students, StocksQuest also lets individuals sign up and start trading. You can join contests or create your own contests, and run separate portfolios for each. The trading is simpler here than at some of the other sites: There's no options trading, or stop orders and limit orders, although you can "sell short." making a bearish bet.  You start with $100,000 and a depressingly low rank, such as "77,436 out of 87,534." Your aim is to trade your way to the top of the pile, a position currently held by a user called "Cheesman" who has amassed over $750,000. The site supports a wide range of stock and option trades, and a nice feature is the ability to learn the secret of Cheesman's and others' success by studying their full transaction histories.
