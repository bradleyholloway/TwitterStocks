 Office-Rental Markets Are Rebounding   By By Mitchell Pacelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1997  During the third quarter, the suburban office-vacancy rate dropped below 10% for the first time since 1980, slipping to 9.7% from 11.7% the year before, according to a survey of 54 metropolitan areas to be released today by CB Commercial Real Estate Group. The average downtown vacancy rate dropped to 11.7% from 14.4% a year earlier, the real-estate company said. National vacancies rates had risen as high as 22% in 1989 and 1990.  "In the early 1990s, people used to say there was enough space to last until the year 2001," said Raymond Torto, CB's director of research. "Now a lot of large tenants are feeling nervous out there. They're trying to grab space to grow into now."  Among the downtown markets where office space is becoming scarce are Boston, with a 3.7% vacancy rate; San Francisco, 3.8%; Seattle, 5.9%; midtown Manhattan, 7.1%; and Salt Lake City, 7.9%. The tightest suburban markets include San Jose, Calif., 1.9%; Minneapolis/St. Paul, 4.6%; Austin, Texas, 4.6%; St. Louis, 5%; and Nashville, Tenn., 5.4%.
