 Bids for Qwest, U S West Are Withdrawn --- Deutsche Telekom's Move Leaves Merger Partners To Salvage Strained Ties   By By Stephanie N. Mehta and Rebecca Blumenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2000  In a statement issued yesterday afternoon, U S West Chief Financial Officer Al Spies said the company would consider a deal that wouldn't "jeopardize or delay our ability to complete the U S West-Qwest transaction as currently provided for in our existing merger agreement." People close to the talks said the statement constituted a declaration that U S West didn't want to pursue any additional deals until the fall, when it expects to close its merger with Qwest.  Additionally, people close to the talks said U S West was unwilling to give up a handsome premium for its shares: Under the current deal with Qwest, shareholders of the Bell company are set to receive 1.73 shares of Qwest for every U S West share.  "We regret that U S West apparently wouldn't even consider an alternative transaction involving a major telecommunications company and Qwest, despite the possibility of greater value for U S West's shareholders," said Joseph P. Nacchio, chief executive officer of Qwest, in a statement. Qwest and U S West are both based in Denver.
