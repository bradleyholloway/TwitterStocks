 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Television: Life Sentences   By Rabinowitz, Dorothy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2007  It would be hard to find much to doubt in the court testimony given by [Jacob]'s brother Charles, four years older, who provided a detailed account of a boyhood in which every day brought apprehensions -- mornings lying awake wondering what was to come at the hands of his stepfather. Some of the film's most striking details -- striking because of their unmistakable aura of authenticity -- come from this witness, who escaped the house as soon as he turned 18, but not its memories. Among these was the daily dread that he experienced on hearing the garage door slam in the evenings, a sound signaling the arrival of that stepfather, home from work. One of his pleasures, evenings, was to chase the boys into the bathroom, smack them around, and then satisfy himself with sadistic sexual games.  Not all the subjects of this film have killed their parents, but all are where they now are thanks to Colorado's justice system, once considered advanced when it came to juveniles. All that ended thanks to an upsurge in violent crimes by youthful offenders in the late 1980s and '90s -- events that brought public demands for change, and the political will to oblige. The 1999 mass murders by two Columbine High School students did nothing to diminish that will. There is, indeed, something hauntingly familiar about the idyllic suburban houses that are home to so much family agony in this narrative. One parent, the venture capitalist father of Erik -- another teenager sentenced to life without parole -- notes that his family address too, is Littleton, Colo., the town adjacent to Columbine High. How this well-loved, loving and stable youth came to be in this pass is the whole point of this story -- a point, like that of every other portrait here, made with perfect and terrifying clarity.
