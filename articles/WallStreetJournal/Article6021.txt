 Enron Slashes Profits Since 1997 by 20% --- Partnership Dealings Cited As Dynegy Talks Go On; Debt Ratings an Issue   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles and Robin Sidel and Jonathan Weil in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 2001  The filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron's North America unit, in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited partnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn't associated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn't explain why the the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn't be reached to comment.  By having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing said.  LJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP, were formed in 1999 by Enron's then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and Mr. [Kopper], according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership documents. Enron's SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed.
