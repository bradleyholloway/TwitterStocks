 Plots & Ploys   By Michael Corkery, Thaddeus Herrick and Ryan Chittum, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2006  "It's a relief," Virgil Rizzo, head of a small state office that tries to settle the sometimes-heated disputes between condo owners and their condo-building governing boards, said after Gov. Jeb Bush's office told him to pack his bags last week.  Dr. Rizzo, whose office was the subject of a page-one Wall Street Journal article about its efforts to bring peace to Florida's condos, said his biggest battle was with the state's Department of Business and Professional Regulation, where the ombudsman is housed. "They didn't like that I didn't play the bureaucratic game," said Dr. Rizzo, a lawyer and retired physician who was appointed to the job in December 2004.  The department's secretary, Simone Marstiller, said the "former ombudsman refused to be held accountable." For example, she said her department had difficulty conducting an administrative review of his office. Dr. Rizzo said he cooperated with the review, but disputed the department's efforts to control his office.
