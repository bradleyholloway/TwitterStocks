 Spiritual Group Challenges Freedoms in Hong Kong --- Tolerance for Falun Dafa Ebbs as City Faces Pressure From China   By By Gren Manuel, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2001  Last month, the group held a conference in Hong Kong using government-owned facilities. While that conference appeared to underscore the city's independence from Chinese state policy, it also triggered accusations by Beijing's supporters in Hong Kong that Falun Dafa members were using the city as a base to attack the Beijing government. About 300 people in Hong Kong join Falun Dafa's public practice sessions, according to the group's own estimates.  A change in Hong Kong's treatment of Falun Dafa could draw international concern, including from the U.S., which in April issued a State Department report noting Hong Kong's tolerance of Falun Dafa with approval. Legislation governing U.S.-Hong Kong relations specifically states that human rights "serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity."  Enforcing a crackdown on Falun Dafa in Hong Kong could be legally difficult. One suggestion is that laws originally drafted against organized-crime groups known as triads be applied to Falun Dafa. But Philip Dykes, a Hong Kong lawyer specializing in human-rights cases, says he would expect that to be overturned by the courts, as Falun Dafa appears to pose no threat to public order or China's national security.
