 Constellation Sets $1.03 Billion Deal To Buy Mondavi   By Dennis K. Berman and Hae Won Choi, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2004  Constellation will pay Mondavi Class A shareholders $56.50 in cash, while the Mondavi family, which controls Class B shares, will get $65.82 a share. Constellation, based in Fairport, N.Y., also will assume about $325 million of Mondavi's debt.  With Mondavi, Constellation will have made 15 acquisitions since 1990. The deal comes just a year after Constellation took a big gamble on the premium-wine market by spending $1.4 billion to buy BRL Hardy, Australia's leading wine producer. "Distributors and retailers are consolidating," Constellation's chairman and chief executive, Richard Sands, said. "Your presence within the distribution channels is very important. We have presence not only through size but also through breadth."  Mondavi initially proved reluctant quarry for Constellation, saying only that it would "consider" a $970 million offer first made in a letter to Mondavi Chairman Ted Hall on Oct. 12. But after a meeting between the two parties in Napa Valley last Thursday, an agreement began to come together. The deal was clinched when Constellation increased its offer for Class A shares from $53 and Class B shares from $61.75.
