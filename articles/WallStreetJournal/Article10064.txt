 Bargains in Europe?; Funds See Opening in Selloff   By Jason Douglas and Peter Stiff, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2007  "We're now getting so caught up with the U.S. credit problem that we're forgetting the bigger picture," says Sonja Schemmann, who manages Schroder's Global Equity Income Fund, among others. "Now is the time to reassess, but there's been a lot of indiscriminate selling."  Standard Life Investments global-investment strategist Richard Batty said he didn't alter his strategy during last week's turmoil. The firm's fund managers have invested in companies such as ABB Ltd., Alstom SA, Man and YIT Corp., which are strongly exposed to the growth of Eastern Europe. ABB rose 1.4% in Zurich last week, and Alstom added 0.7% in Paris.
