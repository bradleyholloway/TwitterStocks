 Stock Prices Advance, but Volume Is Second Lowest of '86 on Big Board   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1986  Although stock prices edged higher, traders and analysts said they weren't excited about the advance because of the extremely light volume and because gaining stocks had only a 4-to-3 edge over decliners on the Big Board.  Lack of fresh economic news and positive leadership from the bond market also contributed to the lackluster session. Merger and acquisition talk, real or rumored, accounted for the big moves of the day, in USX Corp., Viacom International, Lucky Stores and Allied Stores, among others.  After a brief rally in the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average clung to a gain of five to seven points for much of the session. A flurry of buying activity in the final minutes gave a further push to the industrial average, which ended ahead 10.27 at 1784.45. The broader market averages also posted small gains.
