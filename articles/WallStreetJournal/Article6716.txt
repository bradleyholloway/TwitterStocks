 A Mother Takes On MIT; How University's Privacy Policy Complicated Sue Kayton's Search for Her Missing Son   By Bernstein, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  MIT's position "added to the anguish level immeasurably," says Ms. Kayton, who traveled to MIT's Cambridge, Mass., campus to search for her son, Daniel Barclay, herself. MIT's administrators "didn't want to deal with me."  School officials say they acted appropriately. "Privacy is important," says MIT Chancellor Phillip Clay. He says MIT protects student privacy not only because it's the law, but because it is central to maintaining students' trust. "Different students will do different things that they absolutely don't want their parents to know about," he says. "Students expect this kind of safe place where they can address their difficulties, try out lifestyles and be independent of their parents."  The last day Daniel's family heard from him was Sunday, April 8. He posted a cryptic "away" message on his AOL Instant Messenger program: "dan has to meet with some sketchy people he thought he'd never have to deal with ever again." When Daniel's sister asked him about the message, he told her that he had to go to east Cambridge to see "very sketchy" people.
