 GM Production Problems Hurt `94 Model Sales --- Ongoing Snags Complicate UAW Negotiations, May Last to November   By By Oscar Suris and Neal Templin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1993  GM's rough new-model launch comes at a particularly awkward time. GM's board yesterday debated what response the company should make to demands from the United Auto Workers union that GM accept the same terms for a new three-year national contract that Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have taken. GM directors are concerned the pact would lock in GM's uncompetitive labor costs.  UAW officials reiterated their opposition to breaking the Big Three labor pattern for GM, but indicated they will discuss giving GM some leeway to cut costs within the pattern.  As reported, production problems this summer have caused GM to fall more than 70,000 cars and trucks short of its original U.S. production goals for the third quarter. GM has been planning a major sales push this fall, particularly in California, with specially equipped and specially priced models. But now, GM dealers say they are losing sales because they can't get enough 1994 models, which began arriving late last month. GM officials conceded yesterday it may take until next month to sort out all the problems and crank up factories to full speed.
