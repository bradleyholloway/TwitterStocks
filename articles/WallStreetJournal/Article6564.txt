 Latest U.S. Mad-Cow Cases Are 'Atypical' Form   By Tomson, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2006  An internal USDA memo stated, "There is no evidence to justify any changes in surveillance methods, disease control or public-health measures already taken in the United States." Mr. [John Clifford] agreed, saying, "Until the science proves otherwise, we'll be treating all of these cases as BSE and the normal, typical BSE, and we still feel confident that the safeguards we have in place are effective."  This "atypical" form of BSE found in the U.S. might not be spread through feed. Mr. Clifford said he didn't know if the two U.S. cows were infected through contaminated feed -- as most normal cases are -- or whether they simply developed the disease spontaneously or by some other way.
