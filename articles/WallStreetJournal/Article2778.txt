 Gingrich Says White House Must Move Further Right to Win Accord on Budget   By David Rogers and Christopher Georges, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1995  "It is simply impossible," said Mr. [Newt Gingrich]. "There aren't 100 moderate and conservative Democrats, if you count the House and Senate together."  The political stakes were underscored in a letter from five top Republican pollsters that was circulated yesterday in the House GOP caucus. "Cutting government spending and reducing the deficit are not `ends,' but the means to an end. . . .," the pollsters wrote. "Without the middle-class tax cut, as currently configured, being part of the Republican budget proposals, Bill Clinton and the Democrats will have won a huge victory."  These priorities dovetail with the administration's, and while the measure won only 68 Democratic votes when first offered this year, it has won renewed interest as the framework for a final party position on the balanced budget. "I think their budget is very much in play," said Rep. George Miller, a liberal California Democrat. "What couldn't happen was that it would be a starting point."
