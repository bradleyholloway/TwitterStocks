 Unhappy Returns: Accounting Firms Face Backlash Over the Tax Shelters They Sold --- Suits by Users Being Audited Are Multiplying, and IRS Steps Up Its Regulation --- Bad End to a Big 1990s Push   By By Cassell Bryan-Low, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2003  KPMG partners sold a tax strategy, dubbed BLIPS, to at least 186 clients during 1999 and 2000, according to documents the IRS filed in a federal court as part of its enforcement action against the firm in July. The documents claim the strategy deprived the Treasury of about $1.28 billion in taxes. The suit says KPMG sold another strategy, known by the acronyms FLIP and OPIS, to at least 160 clients. The IRS has identified both as potentially "abusive" shelters. KPMG has maintained that the tax advice it marketed was appropriate.  PwC has scaled back its tax-shelter operations, partners say, and last summer paid about $1 million to the IRS to settle matters relating to tax-shelter registration. IRS rules require promoters to register shelters that the agency has identified as potentially abusive and to keep lists of investors; those can face stiff penalties of up to 1% of all sheltered funds. PwC says it doesn't currently sell any transactions the IRS lists as potentially abusive.  The IRS, knowing it can be years before audits identify a new type of abusive shelter, has focused increasingly on the promoters of the strategies. In a flurry of activity last year, the IRS sought tax-shelter-related information from 20 auditors and other promoters, issuing roughly 200 summonses. It has filed enforcement action against several accounting firms, including KPMG, BDO Seidman and Andersen, to force them to hand over documents -- which the firms consider privileged -- relating to transactions dating back to as early as 1995.
