 Banks Tighten Terms on Loans to Large Firms   By By Paul Beckett and David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1998  Banks on Wall Street and Main Street are tightening lending terms in an early sign the U.S. could be headed for a credit crunch.  Though the survey found little change in lending to small companies or in banks' willingness to make consumer loans, the Fed cited concerns about the abrupt change in banks' lending appetite as one reason it cut a key short-term interest rate earlier this week.  How severe any credit crunch may turn out to be is still unclear. Some small-business borrowers say their banks are being as aggressive as ever about lending. Others argue the tightening is sensible because regulators have been warning for almost a year about lax lending standards.
