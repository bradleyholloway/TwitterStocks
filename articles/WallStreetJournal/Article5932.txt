 NBA May Find A Rich TV Pact Is No Slam Dunk   By By Stefan Fatsis and Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  The NBA also no longer seems as invincible as it once did. Since the last contract was signed four years ago, regular-season NBA viewership has sunk 38% on NBC and slightly less on Turner's TNT and TBS. Mr. [Michael Jordan]'s former team, the Chicago Bulls, have an embarrassing six wins and 42 losses this season, and the Washington Wizards, where he is a part owner and the president of basketball operations, are 12-37.  NBA Commissioner David Stern maintains that in an increasingly fragmented TV world, ratings don't matter as much as they used to. He notes that the NBA still attracts the male viewers that networks crave, and that good teams are emerging to energize such forgotten NBA markets as Sacramento, Calif., Dallas and Milwaukee. "We're actually feeling pretty good in this postlockout, post-Jordan era," Mr. Stern says, referring to the labor dispute that interrupted the 1998-99 season.  Mr. Stern says he'd like to renew with NBC and Turner, but he wouldn't mind if ABC and its sister cable network, ESPN,made a competing offer. An ESPN spokesman says the network would be interested in adding live NBA games to its schedule of WNBA games and NBA classic reruns if the opportunity arose. An ABC Sports spokesman declined to comment.
