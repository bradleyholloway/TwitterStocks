 Capital Chronicle -- Havana Diary: What Is Cuba Up to This Time?   By By Suzanne Garment, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1985  Fidel Castro's official representatives in Washington know all about the neo-imperialist politics of The Wall Street Journal's editorial page. Yet when I asked them last month if I could travel to Cuba, they gave me quick and cordial permission. Like all of Mr. Castro's recent signals of friendship toward the U.S., this one raised the question: What were they trying to put over on us this time?  In my short stay in Cuba I did not travel far from Havana or talk to many uncensored ordinary folks. Still, I saw a fair number of Cuban leaders, from high-school administrators to members of the foreign-policy inner circle. They often spoke obscurely, as people do in unfree political regimes. But soon I began to recognize words and phrases used over and over in different contexts, pieces of Cuba's particular Rosetta Stone. The question of why the Cubans are approaching us now came to seem slightly less unanswerable.  The two most important Cuban foreign-policy makers I saw were Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon and Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, who plays something of the role of our secretary of state. I met Mr. Alarcon for a four-hour lunch in a restaurant high up in a downtown Havana office building, with a panoramic view of the beautiful, dilapidated city and its ever-fresh coastline. He proved to be a bright and funny companion. Until the mid-1970s Mr. Alarcon was Cuba's bitterly anti-American ambassador to the United Nations. Last year he led the Cubans in the U.S.-Cuba negotiations to return some of the Mariel refugees; Americans who saw him there have praised his pragmatism.
