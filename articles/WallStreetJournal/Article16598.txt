 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; Growth Funds Pull Into the Lead; Value Stocks' Streak Could Be Near End; Time for Large Cap?   By Johannes, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2006  "Value's done well. It's time for the tide to change. Valuations of growth stocks look better than value," Mr. [Preston G. Athey] says. He adds that he has been giving shareholders a heads-up because he doesn't want them to be disappointed if their value holdings do not do as well as they have in the past. "Investors are always looking in the rearview mirror," he adds.  "In 2000 a lot of the biggest tech companies were trading at multiples of 40, 50 or 60 times earnings. Now 25 is a big multiple for tech companies and a lot of them trade in the mid-teens," says Legg Mason's Mr. [David Nelson]. In addition, fewer executives are giving themselves big options packages, which dilute share prices. "It's a much more attractive proposition for the prospective buyer," Mr. Nelson says.  "In the late 1990s growth investing meant tech investing and value investing meant financial services," Morningstar's Mr. [Don Phillips] says. "Today, growth opportunities are a lot more diverse."
