 Funds Closed at Brisk Pace in 2003   By Hayashi, Yuka, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2004  "Do we need 10,000 mutual funds?" asked Geoffrey Bobroff, a fund- industry consultant in East Greenwich, R.I. "It's eminently clear we don't."  "I don't see a huge abatement in the amount of liquidations and mergers" even if the stock market continues to rally, said Jeffrey Keil, vice president of Global Fiduciary Review at Lipper, the Denver fund research unit of Reuters PLC.  Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors, the fund unit of Morgan Stanley, eliminated seven funds from its retail lineup last year by merging them into portfolios. Those disappearing included Morgan Stanley 21st Century Trend Fund, a large-cap growth fund launched in 2000; All Star Growth Fund, a large-cap growth offering from 2001; Next Generation Fund, a midcap growth fund born in 1999, and Technology Fund, another large-cap growth offering from the class of 2000.
