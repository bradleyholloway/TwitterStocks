 Cavallo, Argentina's Economic Bulldog, Takes On Crisis --- Fiscal Chief Shreds Taxes, Glowers at Bureaucracy; Recession Stares Back   By By Matt Moffett and John Bussey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2001  Mr. [Domingo Cavallo] recently took over as Argentina's economy minister following a crisis of confidence that rocked emerging markets and prompted the resignations of two of his predecessors within two weeks in March. He quickly got Argentina's Congress to approve a "competitiveness law," which gives him special powers to try to turn around the economy.  Can Mr. Cavallo save Argentina? The country is stuck in a bitter recession and burdened by a $125 billion foreign debt. It will be a tough fight, even for a man with a reputation as a keen economic tactician. In a previous stint as economy minister in 1991, Mr. Cavallo introduced the convertibility plan, a strategy that whipped Argentina's chronic inflation by pegging the peso 1-to-1 to the dollar. Later, in the wake of Mexico's 1994 currency devaluation, Mr. Cavallo united Argentines in a staunch defense of the peso.  For example, this past weekend, President [Fernando] de la Rua signed a decree changing the antitrust law of Argentina. A multinational corporation that came to purchase a company in Argentina, if that corporation had more than $2.5 billion of world-wide businesses, for that very fact it had to go through a procedure that would take six months to authorize the purchase of this very small company in Argentina. That we have eliminated.
