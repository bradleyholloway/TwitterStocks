 Advertising: Networks nix ads featuring rival TV stars   By Beatty, Sally Goll, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1997  In a slick new Cadillac commercial, General Motors plays a little joke with actor Dennis Franz, who plays a policeman on ABC's hit series "NYPD Blue." Franz pulls out a notepad and warns a Mercedes driver he's going to write him up for "driving a luxury car without enough power." The bewildered motorist in the commercial asks Franz if he is a cop. Franz replies "Something like that," as he winks at the camera. NBC and CBS get the joke--and say they're refusing to run an ad that promotes a rival's show.
