 Insurer Faces $3.1 Million Interest Bill   By By Jeffrey Krasner, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1997  Did Republic Western Insurance Co. leave itself vulnerable to a surprise interest charge because of two errant lines in a standard policy for a rented U-Haul truck?  The long and winding road to the pending appeal began on June 4, 1985. On that day, according to court filings, a worker for American Drywall Co. who was driving a rented U-Haul truck veered into a construction site on Interstate 295 in Cranston, R.I., striking Joseph Fratus, a state inspector overseeing the road crew. The accident left Mr. Fratus a paraplegic.  Mr. Fratus sued the driver and American Drywall, as well as the U-Haul leasing agent and the truck's owner, in U.S. district court in Providence, R.I. In 1988, a jury found in favor of Mr. Fratus and awarded him $2.9 million. In addition, his wife and daughter were awarded a total of $270,000 for his diminished ability to fulfill his roles as a husband and a parent.
