 Union Carbide Says Plant Safety System Wasn't Geared to Track Gas That Leaked   By By Terence Roth and Frederick Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1985  The disclosure on the computer system problem raised further questions about how extensive were the safety improvements that Union Carbide made to the Institute site in the wake of December's poison-gas disaster at its Bhopal, India, plant. The company said Monday that some sophisticated warning and detection equipment installed at Institute's methyl isocyanate facility wasn't added to other parts of the plant.  Even as officials were discussing safety questions at the Institute plant, a leak of a chemical substance, believed to be nontoxic, was reported at Union Carbide's south Charleston, W.Va., chemical plant late yesterday. Authorities reported some complaints of burning eyes and nausea, but no one was hospitalized or evacuated. The south Charleston plant is several miles from Union Carbide's Institute plant. A company spokesman wasn't able to elaborate on the south Charleston leak.  Earlier yesterday, at the Institute plant, Thad Epps, a Union Carbide spokesman, conceded that aldicarb oxime, which is used to make pesticides, wasn't one of the chemicals programmed into the plant's SAFER meteorological computer system. "I would not automatically assume that if aldicarb oxime were programmed into it that the result would have been better because it confirmed the visual (judgment). But obviously the chemical should have been programmed in." He added that predicting the direction of the gas cloud was made difficult because of low cloud cover and near-zero wind velocity on Sunday.
