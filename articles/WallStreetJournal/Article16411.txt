 Dollar Weakens Against Yen, Euro Amid Oil-Price Jitters   By Steven C. Johnson and Tom Barkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2004  "I think [yesterday's] trading action is symptomatic of something other than just squaring ahead of payrolls data," said Lara Rhame, senior economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. "Something's distracting the market and it doesn't seem to be anxiety over payrolls but anxiety over oil."  Ms. Rhame said "a pretty solid number is already baked into the cake" and predicted an increase of 200,000 to 250,000 likely will produce a "knee-jerk reaction" on currency markets before they settle back to "listless trade."  "In the meantime, investors are happy to remain on the sidelines tending increasingly sizable cash positions until market uncertainty abates," Michael Woolfolk, senior currency trader at Bank of New York, said in a research note.
