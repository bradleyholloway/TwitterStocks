 Computers Threaten Another Tradition: The Glory of France --- French Techies Use American Instead of Gallic Jargon, And Linguists Fight Back   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1985  While other European nations peacefully accept U.S. terminology like "byte" and "networking," France is fighting back. Adopting such foreign computerese "is submitting to the language of the conqueror," says Gen. Becam. As president of the Association of French-Speaking Computer Specialists, he is championing pure French jargon instead.  Despite snickers from the industry, the purists have made surprising progress. Over the past few years, bureaucrats have drawn up lists of approved French computer terms, outlawing the English originals. They have financed computer societies like Gen. Becam's to get the message across. Ultimately, they believe, the very survival of French culture is at stake.  Unfortunately for the purists, France is full of collaborationists these days. "There's a certain snobbism attached to using English jargon," complains Yves Noyelle, a professor of data processing at l'Ecole Superieure d'Electricite. Most French computer scientists learned their trade on American-designed computers, and American products still dominate the French market.
