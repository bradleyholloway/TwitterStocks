 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; The Year of Living Scandalously; Year-Old Probe Buffets Operations, Regulation; Full Impact Is Unclear   By Maxey, Daisy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2004  "I think [the scandal] posed a risk that the industry at large would be tarnished, but I don't think it has tarnished the industry at large," says Paul Schott Stevens, president of the Investment Company Institute, the mutual-fund industry's trade group. "Some of the individual firms that have experienced the problems will have to work hard to recover their footing with investors and, by the same token, firms that have kept their reputations intact have found that there's a benefit in the marketplace."  "The momentum is building toward fee reductions, but it's still in the early innings," says Michael Porter, a senior research analyst at Lipper. The scandal, the resulting exposure and expectations for lower returns have combined to put downward pressure on fund fees, he says. "It's a question now that people are asking, whereas in the past, no one really said to their broker, 'What is the management fee on this fund?' "  Fund Reform SEC rules that go into effect over the next 18 months include: -- Funds must have compliance chiefs, who report to the board. -- Independent directors must make up at least 75% of fund boards and thechairmen must be independent. -- Funds must describe the reasons supporting their directors' decisions toapprove advisers' contracts. -- Steering a fund's trading business to brokerage firms that sell acompany's funds, known as directed brokerage, is prohibited. -- Funds must disclose incentives given to portfolio managers, the level oftheir investment in the funds and potential conflicts involving other fundsthey manage.
