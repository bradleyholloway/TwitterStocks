 Moving the Market: Buffett Assumes Blame for Drop In Berkshire Hathaway's Profit   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2005  The source of Mr. [Warren Buffett]'s guilt is the company's change in book value -- assets minus liabilities -- a measure he uses to gauge Berkshire's performance. In 2004, Berkshire's book value gained 10.5%, shy of the S&P 500-stock index's 10.9% return and a performance Mr. Buffett characterized as "lackluster."  Some of Mr. Buffett's legions of fans think he was too hard on himself. "Berkshire's corporate performance was awesome," said Glenn Tongue, managing partner at T2 Partners LLC, a hedge fund in New York that owns Berkshire shares and options to buy shares. Mr. Tongue praised Mr. Buffett's ability to nearly keep pace with the S&P 500 despite having "$40 billion sitting in cash earning virtually nothing."  Mr. Buffett took issue with some critics who questioned the independence of Berkshire's board, which features Buffett family and friends, including Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates. He argued that board members' significant holdings in their companies' stock aligned them with other shareholders. Citing a biblical passage, Matthew 6:21, in which [Jesus Christ] says, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also," Mr. Buffett added: "Measured by the biblical standard, the Berkshire board is a model."
