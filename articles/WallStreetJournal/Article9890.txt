 The Middle Seat: Airline Discord May Hurt Travelers; After Industry Turnaround, Top Executives Get Rewards While Employees Fume   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2006  At American, CEO Gerard Arpey's salary of less than $600,000 pales compared with Mr. [Glenn Tilton]'s compensation. Mr. Arpey hasn't had a bonus since 2000 and personally opted out of the incentive pool that will pay out on April 19 to American's top 1,000 managers.  Mr. Arpey has pushed open dialogue and collaboration with the unions, and union leaders say this "Working Together" initiative has vastly improved labor relations, historically troubled at American. They also give management high marks for continuing to fund pensions with $310 million in contributions last year and keeping jobs in-house rather than outsourcing them. But the cash bonuses due in April to American managers still sting. The payouts come through a "Long-Term Incentive Program" that has been in place since 1988 and rewards executives when AMR stock outperforms that of competing airlines. In 2004, Mr. Arpey collected $130,000 under it.  To workers, it's a question of what's appropriate. "It's a cash bonus when we've been trying to protect cash," says Capt. Denis Breslin of the Allied Pilots Association.
