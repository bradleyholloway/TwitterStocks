 Ahead of the Tape   By Eisinger, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2003  There is the nagging little problem that there is little economic evidence to support the optimism fetishists' view -- yet. It's too ominous to think of what happens if rates rise sharply and we don't get a big economic recovery. Thursday's unemployment figure was another piece of disappointing data (though the marginal ISM survey of the service sector did come in strongly).  Says Mr. [Sung Won Sohn]: "The next three months to me are very crucial. If this massive stimulus doesn't do the job, what would? At that point -- maybe it's premature now -- you'd have to wonder if this was no longer a cyclical problem but a structural problem."
