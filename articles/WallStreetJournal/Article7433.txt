 Moncor Defaults On Loan; 3 Banks Seized by Creditor   By By William Celis III, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1985  ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Moncor Inc. said that it defaulted on a $4.7 million loan from Albuquerque Federal Savings & Loan Association and that under terms of the loan agreement, Albuquerque Federal seized control of three of Moncor's five banks.  Tom W. Kerl, president and chief executive officer, said that the company will assess its options but that currently "we're trying to figure out the impact of all of this." Mr. Kerl also said the recent events raise questions about Moncor's "ability . . . to remain a going concern," but he wouldn't comment on whether the company will consider Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection from creditors.  Moncor borrowed the $4.7 million to establish an employee stock-ownership plan. The default doesn't affect the ESOP since Moncor will contribute 600,000 of its common shares to fund the plan. The shares were returned by Albuquerque Federal to Moncor, which used the stock as partial collateral for the loan.
