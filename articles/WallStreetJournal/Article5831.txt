 Biotech Industry's 1st-Quarter Profits Are Expected to Climb, but Not Sharply   By By Beth M. Mantz, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2000  Industry bellwether Amgen Inc. is expected to post solid results, but growth in its first-quarter sales from the fourth quarter was probably limited after customers hoarded products as a result of the year2000 computer-bug concern. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expect earnings of 25 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier 23 cents, adjusted for a stock split.  S.G. Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt and CIBC World Markets Corp. analyst Matthew Geller aren't concerned about Amgen's future sales growth, however, saying the company boasts one of the best latestage pipelines in the industry, with four products scheduled to launch in the next 12 to 24 months.  As in previous years, fewer prescriptions for the drug were issued in the U.S. during January and February, while March sales then rose, analysts say. First Call estimates Biogen will post earnings of 43 cents a share, compared with the yearearlier quarter's 29 cents, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split that occurred in June.
