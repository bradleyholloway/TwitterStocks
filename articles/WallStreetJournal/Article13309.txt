 On Investing: Be Cautious About Shifting to Bonds   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  Still, most bond specialists don't advise rushing to shift dollars from these short-term instruments into bonds, which allow people to lock in a yield for a longer time. They say bonds with maturities of two years or longer generally don't pay high enough yields now to compensate for the risk they pose.  Although the economy has slowed somewhat in response to the Fed's rate-boost campaign, most forecasters don't expect a recession. U.S. growth could continue to get a lift from stronger foreign economies. Thus, worries about inflation, or rising consumer prices, will persist.  That means bond yields -- which are influenced mostly by inflation expectations -- aren't likely to drop much. They could even edge higher over the year or so after the Fed is done raising short rates. And since bond prices move in the opposite direction to yields, higher bond yields would mean falling prices for existing bonds.
