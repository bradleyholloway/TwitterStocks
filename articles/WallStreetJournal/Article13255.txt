 Drug Reckoning   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2006  That Erbitux worked in head and neck tumors was fairly obvious from early trial results even at the time it was first rejected for colon cancer. Dr. Mark Thornton, one of the FDA medical reviewers who finally helped push Erbitux through in 2004, tells us there was "extremely compelling" data on Erbitux for head and neck cancer as early as 2000. He adds that "it was hard to argue against providing it to patients" at the time it was first rejected.  Another man for whom the latest news on Erbitux is bittersweet is Frank Burroughs, who founded the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs in honor of his daughter, who died of head and neck cancer while trying to obtain Erbitux and other treatments. "This news serves as yet another reminder that the biggest 'ImClone scandal' of 2001 had nothing to do with [Martha Stewart], but instead resulted from the FDA's failure to approve a drug that had been proven safe and effective for thousands of patients," the Alliance said in a statement.
