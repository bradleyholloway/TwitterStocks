 Unconscionable Moral Equivalency   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2006  Thanks for the insightful "Editorial Board: Munich" by Bret Stephens (Dec. 31) about Steven Spielberg's film. So many on the left in the arts, unfortunately including a number of liberal Jews, have a bias against Israel. They see moral equivalency between mass murders of women and children by suicide bombers and the reprisal killings of those who organized, planned and sent the bombers. When suicide bombers killed 3,000 innocent Americans on 9/11, we retaliated by bombing and killing the Taliban Muslim extremists and occupying Afghanistan. Why is it wrong for Israel to do the same? Why was it wrong for Israel to seek out the Palestinians who murdered at Munich and destroy them? To do so was not vengeance or revenge -- it was justice.
