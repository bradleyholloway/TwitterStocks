 Comeuppance and Causation: Requiem for the Thrifts   By Ferguson, Tim W, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1990  Retribution for the savings-and-loan debacle is a tornado on the political horizon. An outburst might even sweep some incumbents from the U.S. House of Lords in November. Come 1992, when the full dimensions of this taxpayer rout are better grasped and the father of Silverado Savings director Neil Bush presumably stands for re-election, the full storm may hit.  A bailout totaling hundreds of billions of dollars will cause dramatic interstate shifts of federal revenues. This magnifies the opportunity for smooth demagogues like Mario Cuomo of New York to contrast the tab for the salvage of Sun Belt thrifts with the familiar miseries of his own welfare state -- as if making good on deposit insurance were some new discretionary expenditure by Washington in place of feeding the hungry.  But journalists can sympathize with how difficult it is for Rep. [Bruce] Vento's staff to discover much about Uncle Sam's wards. Raw data finally have been coughed up and must be analyzed. Earlier, it transpired that the conservator of Franklin Savings in Kansas, John Carr, is getting $225,000 for six months. When I poked into Franklin a few months ago, Mr. Carr was unavailable for any inquiries. Same with officials of the hundreds of other taken-over thrifts.
