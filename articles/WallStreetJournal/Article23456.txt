 Asia's Banker Invasion; Buyouts, IPOs Jump And So Do Paychecks; No Longer 'Siberia'   By Linebaugh, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2007  That's no longer the case: Last month, Mr. [Paul Calello] was promoted to be chief executive officer of the company's global investment bank, underscoring Asia's growing financial muscle world-wide.  Other banks have promoted their star bankers in Asia to bigger global posts. In January, Societe Generale SA promoted Daniel Truchi to global head of private banking after the 55-year-old had spent a decade building the French lender's Asian operation. Merrill Lynch & Co.'s global head of fixed income, Osman Semerci, came from running debt markets in Asia Pacific. Goldman's Asia chief, J. Michael Evans, was a contender for a top job at the firm last year, though he ultimately lost out.  Last year, Credit Suisse embarked on a huge expansion in India after mending ties with authorities there. Two outsourcing centers were set up in Singapore, lowering the firm's costs as it cut higher-paid jobs in the U.S. and Europe. Over the time that Mr. Calello has been in Asia, the bank's pretax profit has doubled every two years from 2002 to 2006, though Credit Suisse won't disclose the figures.
