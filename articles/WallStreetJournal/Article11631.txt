 Summer Olympics 1992: The Kings of Rhythm and Schmooze --- Sponsors' Favorite Band Has Corporate Message: Everyone Into the Pool   By By Craig Forman and Roger Thurow, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1992  Place: Pool deck on the Vistafjord cruise liner. Time: 2 a.m. Band: Nik and the Nice Guys. Song: Hot Tubbin'. Event: Sports Illustrated/Time Inc. Olympic schmooze marathon.  "Hey, somebody's just gone into the pool!" says Donald Barr, Time's executive vice president. He rushes to take a look. Sure enough, a middle-aged man is backstroking, fully clothed. A woman, also fully clothed, jumps in. More people -- ad executives, car salesmen, models -- take the plunge. A man pulls off his shoes and dives in, socks and all. He's the Sports Illustrated executive who arranged the party.  "Enjoying the party?," she asks a man in a smart blazer. "You bet," he says. "The band's great." It turns out he's a top executive at Audi. He asks if the Nice Guys could play at one of his corporate gatherings, maybe in Maui or Monte Carlo. "Any time, any place," says Ms. Herring. They'll talk soon. She adds his card to a growing stack of contacts for potential gigs.
