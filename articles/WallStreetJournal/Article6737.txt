 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Picks -- Hit List / Holland-Dozier-Holland: The acclaimed Motown songwriting team on their favorite musicals   By Jurgensen, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  During a historic hit streak in the 1960s, the songwriting team of [Brian Holland] and Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier created signature songs for a wide range of artists, including the Four Tops, the Supremes and Marvin Gaye.

Now, the trio known as Holland-Dozier-Holland has reunited to bring to the stage a musical version of "The First Wives Club," a novel and movie from the 1990s. Below, five of their favorite musicals.
