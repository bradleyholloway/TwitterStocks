 Railroads Try New Legal Tack To Foil Strikes   By By Christi Harlan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1989  The U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 ruled 9-0 that workers covered by the Railway Labor Act -- which applies to unions at airlines and railroads -- have the right to post pickets at other employers covered by the act. But the railroads' lawyers seem to have found a way around that explicit ruling, at least temporarily, by obtaining court orders restraining their own employees from honoring secondary pickets by Eastern machinists.  The challenge for Mr. Bergen and the other railroads' lawyers will be to oppose the boycotts without contradicting the 1987 Supreme Court ruling in Burlington Northern Railroad Co. vs. Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees. In that case, the court ruled that because the Railway Labor Act didn't expressly prohibit secondary strikes, such labor actions are permissible and -- in a crucial point for the current situation -- cannot be blocked by court order. The Supreme Court's decision was a victory for unions at the railroads and airlines but meant little to the majority of the nation's unions, governed under the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits secondary picketing.
