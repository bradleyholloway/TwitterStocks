 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 1999  "When we discuss issues, they get panicky," Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col says of the Bush camp. Bauer strategist Jeff Bell says, "Every front-runner tries to postpone the moment of truth." Responds Bush strategist Karl Rove: "We will debate at the appropriate time." But Bush won't attend an October candidate forum at Florida's GOP convention.  Gore plans to skip an Iowa Democratic event Sept. 11. "He does not want to appear with Bill Bradley," gibes Bradley strategist Anita Dunn. The Gore campaign says the vice president never agreed to attend. Gore hasn't decided whether to join Bradley at the Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner on Oct. 9. A Reform Party panel is due to decide by Sept. 1 on requirements for seeking the party's nomination. A new Schroth & Associates poll suggests Buchanan is the strongest potential nominee.  But Pope John Paul II appears committed to going ahead with plans for a trip this fall. The Vatican says it will be part of a series of visits to holy sites around the Mideast to celebrate Christianity's third millennium. The U.S. frets because the pope has been a critic of U.S.-backed United Nations sanctions against Iraq. So far, though, Iraq hasn't sent an invitation to the outspoken pope, U.S. officials say with some relief.
