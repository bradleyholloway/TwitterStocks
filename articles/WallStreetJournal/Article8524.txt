 Forest-Product Concerns Are Expected To Post Much Higher 3rd-Period Results   By By Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1994  Paper and forest-product companies are expected to post sharply improved third-quarter results, reflecting a surge in prices for pulp and paper products.  "Street estimates are going to have to come up," predicts Chip Dillon, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. He expects average third-quarter earnings for 20 companies tracked by Salomon to nearly double from the second-quarter level.  Champion International Corp., Stamford, Conn., is "comfortable" with estimates by some analysts that it will post net income of five cents to 10 cents a share for the third quarter, a spokeswoman says. That compares with a year-earlier loss of 40 cents, before a charge, and would end a string of losses that began with the 1991 second quarter. The improvement reflects rising prices for uncoated business paper, coated paper, newsprint and pulp.
