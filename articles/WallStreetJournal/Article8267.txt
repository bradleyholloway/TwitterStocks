 FORM + FUNCTION   By By John Pierson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1992  StarMark's seat is made of reinforced nylon. It goes from empty to full in about a minute and a half with a pump powered by a car cigarette lighter. The Air-Filled Car Seat deflates quickly to less than the size of an attache case. It weighs 2 1/2 pounds, substantially less than the 17-pound average for rigid models.  StarMark says its seat, which it hopes to roll out in the fall, should appeal to two-car families, car-rental agencies and grandparents who transport children only part of the time. The company says it's also talking with an airline, which could store the seat in overhead racks.  The seat is "close" to meeting federal standards, but needs "a few more things," says David Roberts, head of safety research at Calspan, a testing laboratory in Buffalo, N.Y. The top of the StarMark seat has a tendency to fold over in a front-end collision, Mr. Roberts says, so it may require a lightweight frame.
