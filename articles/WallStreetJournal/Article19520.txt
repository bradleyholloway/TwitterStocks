 Government Takes Strong Case Into Andersen Trial --- But Even With Solid Evidence And Aggressive Prosecutors, The Jury Is Always a Wild Card   By By Richard B. Schmitt and Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2002  Andersen already is in a bind, of course. The government's March indictment has crippled the firm, which has lost scores of partners and clients; just yesterday, UAL Corp. and Harrah's Entertainment Inc. dumped Andersen for rival Deloitte & Touche LLP. Also yesterday, Paul Volcker, who had been tapped to reform Andersen, formally acknowledged that his role was over and that the oversight body he had appointed to oversee those changes would "disband."  To win, prosecutors must show that Andersen "corruptly persuaded" or engaged "in misleading conduct" with the intent to induce its personnel into destroying Enron-related documents in the face of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. On paper, all the government has to prove is that Mr. [DAVID DUNCAN] was acting within the scope of his employment when he ordered the destruction, at a time when he was anticipating that the SEC's Enron inquiry ultimately would turn its focus to Andersen itself.  The government also has evidence that some Andersen employees besides Mr. Duncan were aware of allegations of accounting irregularities at Enron months before the shredding occurred. This came in the form of a letter from Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins. In addition, Andersen lawyers anticipate that the government will attempt to introduce prior auditing debacles that have touched the firm in recent years, including work it has done for Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp.
