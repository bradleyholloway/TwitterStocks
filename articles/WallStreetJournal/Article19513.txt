 Falun Gong Takes Fight With Beijing to U.S. Court --- Lawsuit Alleges China Seeks To Restrict Civil Rights Of American Adherents   By By Charles Hutzler, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2002  The civil suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington yesterday, brings into the legal realm complaints long made by U.S. adherents of Falun Gong: that the Chinese Embassy and consulates are out to defame the group in America. China's diplomatic missions, police and spy ministries and government broadcaster China Central Television are named as defendants. These groups, the lawsuit alleges, pressured American mayors and media to shun Falun Gong and orchestrated menacing acts, such as threats, car break-ins and assaults, against U.S. followers of the group's slow-motion exercises and mixed Eastern philosophies that are said to promote health and peace of mind.
