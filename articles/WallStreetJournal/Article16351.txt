 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2003  While having some success with Jordan and Lebanon, talks with Syria are at a tense impasse. The U.S. argues $250 million deposited there is Iraqi property needed for rebuilding; Damascus says it is money from the prewar oil-for-food program and Syrian creditors have first call on it. Separately, Iraq's delegation told OPEC that oil output is up to 2.1 million barrels a day. U.S. soldiers are conducting raids on smugglers to deny funds to insurgents. Six Iraqis were hurt in shelling of a Ramadi police station. Powell urged NATO to consider taking an active role in Iraq.  The chief U.N. inspector said Iran still hasn't signed an accord on more-intrusive scrutiny of its nuclear program. The U.S. signaled impatience.  A Chinese general sounded a bellicose note before the premier's U.S. visit, saying world opinion wouldn't sway a decision on attacking Taiwan.
