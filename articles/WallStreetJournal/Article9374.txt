 Rosenthal Resigns Top Job at Inquirer In Philadelphia   By By Patricia Callahan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2001  In a memo to his staff, Mr. [Robert J. Rosenthal] said: "There is no easy answer to the question of what direction the Inquirer should take. I have tried my best to follow my instincts and lead the newspaper in a way that was true to my beliefs. Rather than let discussions about the Inquirer's future grow rancorous, I hope my departure leads to the Inquirer becoming an even better newspaper, one that its readers and our community value even more."  The Inquirer's circulation was falling sharply when Mr. Rosenthal became editor in January 1998: Average daily circulation dropped 18%, to 428,895, during the six months ended September 1998 compared with the same period in 1990. That slide continued during Mr. Rosenthal's tenure. The paper's daily circulation during the six months ended this September was 365,154.
