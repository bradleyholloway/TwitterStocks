 U.S. Asks That Japan Take New Steps To Open Its Market for Semiconductors   By By Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1988  The Reagan administration asked the Japanese government to take new steps to help U.S. semiconductor producers gain access to more Japanese buyers.  U.S. efforts to penetrate the Japanese market so far have concentrated on the six or more electronics giants in that country that both manufacture and use semiconductors. But officials in Washington believe U.S. sales could improve sharply if other Japanese companies, including auto makers and office equipment producers, are reached.  The plan, which will be discussed here by U.S. and Japanese officials next week, is an evident U.S. attempt to finesse the resistance of the Japanese electronics giants to Tokyo's commitment to increase the U.S. share of the country's huge market. Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. are among Japan's largest semiconductor users, but since they also produce the devices, U.S. officials doubt their willingness to cooperate in opening up the country's market.
