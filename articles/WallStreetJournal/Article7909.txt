 Recent Firming of Oil Prices Isn't Expected to Last As Effects of Hostage Crisis Yield to Fundamentals   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  The softening in petroleum prices that was interrupted last week by the hostage crisis in Lebanon is expected to resume this week.  Similar developments a year ago led to a plunge of $4 a barrel in four months in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. But despite the similarity, few expect a repetition of the price break that dropped the U.S. benchmark crude to less than $13 a barrel in 1988.  Before the recent slide began in July, West Texas Intermediate was near $20 a barrel. In futures trading last week, the September contract for the crude oil closed at $18.03 a barrel. Also on Friday, some refiners reduced their field-price postings 25 cents a barrel to $17.25.
