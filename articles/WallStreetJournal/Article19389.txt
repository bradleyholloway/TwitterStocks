 Fannie Mae Would Answer to Fed Under Legislation to Be Unveiled   By By Nicholas Kulish, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2001  Republican Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana, chairman of the House financial-services panel overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, plans to unveil the bill today. The measure follows last year's failed effort by Rep. Baker to pass legislation reining in the two companies. This year, Mr. Baker dropped his earlier insistence that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shed their $2.25 billion conditional credit lines from the U.S. Treasury.  Mr. Baker faces many obstacles in getting his bill passed, especially since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac historically have enjoyed strong support on Capitol Hill. Still, a series of hearings and votes could spook investors and the capital markets.  Talk of severing the $2.25 billion conditional credit line, which authorizes the Treasury to buy Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae's debt, roiled markets last year. Last fall, Mr. Baker and representatives of the companies agreed on a set of voluntary initiatives to provide greater safeguards and more public disclosure of information.
