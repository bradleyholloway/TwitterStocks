 Changes in Funding for SBICs Creating Pinch in the Industry   By By Steven P. Galante, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1986  SBICs get their initial capital from private investors, such as banks, corporations and individuals. But their financial strength has come from their ability to "leverage" that money by borrowing from the Federal Financing Bank, a U.S. government entity. Until recently, the Financing Bank could lend an SBIC up to $4 for every $1 the SBIC raised privately. Moreover, the Small Business Administration guaranteed repayment of these loans, permitting the Financing Bank to lend to SBICs at low interest rates. The leverage and SBA guarantees have helped SBICs provide $6 billion to some 70,000 businesses over the past 28 years.  But in April, during House-Senate budget negotiations, the Financing Bank lost its authority to purchase SBIC debentures. As a result, SBICs lost their access to low-cost, leveraged financing.  CONGRESS DID PROVIDE for a new SBIC funding mechanism. Under the arrangement, the SBA would help SBICs borrow money at favorable rates in the private capital markets. But setting that up has taken longer than the 60 days anticipated in the legislation. The first funding under the new mechanism isn't expected until September.
