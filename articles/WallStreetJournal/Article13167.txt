 The Economy; THE OUTLOOK: India Comes of Age, As Focus on Returns Lures Foreign Capital   By Sender, Henny, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2005  India hasn't managed to replicate China's astounding record of sustained annual economic growth. But then, corporate India hasn't had many of the advantages of China, notably cheap capital and supportive government policies. Fears that India would be marginalized by China instead have proved a catalyst for India's private-sector awakening. The enthusiasm for India reflects the country's strong management culture. "Indian companies are very return-focused," says Jim Walker, chief economist for Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia in Hong Kong. "By contrast, China is just market-share driven."  What the world is discovering is that India's handicap of high-cost capital has become a blessing; it has forced companies to become efficient. Indian companies "couldn't waste money," says Chip Kaye, co-president of Warburg Pincus LLC, one of the earliest U.S. private- equity funds to invest in India. "They became good at managing because of the bad years." Warburg has deployed nearly $1 billion in India and has taken more than it has invested in profit, with another $1 billion in value that hasn't yet been realized.
