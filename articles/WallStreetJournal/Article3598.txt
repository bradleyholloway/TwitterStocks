 Research in Motion Files Suit   By By Mark Heinzl and Elena Cherney, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  Research in Motion says keyboard features of Treo models k180, 270, and 300 infringe on Research in Motion patents. A Handspring spokeswoman said the Mountain View, Calif., company hasn't yet been served with the suit and had no comment on it. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, the Canadian company said.  In June, Research in Motion launched a patent-infringement suit against Good Technology Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif. Good Technology makes an e-mail system that runs on the BlackBerry. Anticipating Research in Motion's action, Good Technology had previously taken legal action to bypass its competitor's patents, and it said it wouldn't comment on Research in Motion's suit.
