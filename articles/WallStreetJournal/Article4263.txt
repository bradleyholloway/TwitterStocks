 McDermott Stake Of 5.4% Is Bought By Simmons Group   By By Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1987  A partnership led by financier Harold Simmons said it acquired 5.4% of McDermott International Inc. and plans to acquire "a significant equity interest" in the engineering and oil-field services concern.  In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, McDermott closed at $29.75 a share, unchanged, on volume of 2.8 million shares. However, the company's stock price has climbed from a price of about $26 since a week ago, when Mr. Simmons disclosed that he had purchased about 5% of a company but didn't identify the company.  Analysts have speculated that Mr. Simmons was investing in an oil-field services concern that could be meshed with the oil-field services segment of NL Industries Inc. to make NL a more profitable investment. Mr. Simmons acquired 51% of NL in a bitter takeover battle last year.
