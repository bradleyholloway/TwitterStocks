 News Corp. Seeks to Expand MySpace Into Asia   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2006  Asked about that report, Mr. [Rupert Murdoch], News Corp's. chairman and chief executive, said "all sorts of things, like putting MySpace on mobile," will be up for discussion when he meets Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. Mr. Murdoch was speaking on the sidelines of an international conference in Tokyo.  "If we do anything with him, which I hope we will in new media, it certainly won't be on an exclusive basis," Mr. Murdoch said. He added that finding partnerships is the preferable way to enter new markets, especially in Asia, for MySpace services.  "MySpace is seen as having a high potential in Japan," said Atsuo Takahashi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. "If Softbank can offer MySpace exclusively, it could be an effective differentiation strategy," he added.
