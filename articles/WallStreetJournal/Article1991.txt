 LAW   By By Christi Harlan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  DEFENSE LAWYERS know that when an elderly person files a lawsuit, delay may be the best defense of all. But legislation pending in Illinois would give a hand to plaintiffs over the age of 70 by granting them expedited trial dates for their civil suits.  The proposed law would allow judges to grant special scheduling requests made by the elderly. The same privilege could be claimed by other plaintiffs who show "good cause" that a special trial setting would be "in the interest of justice." Those plaintiffs would include the terminally ill and anyone "in dire financial straits because of an injury," Ms. Marcus says.  But this doesn't account for the entire salary gap between the sexes, says Elaine Weiss, staff director of the ABA commission on women in the profession. A separate study by the commission shows that women are reaching lucrative partnership status in law firms later than men who graduated from law school in the same class. And women account for only 6% of the partners in law firms nationwide, according to Ms. Weiss.
