 Business and Finance [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1987  THE WHITE HOUSE SENDS its fiscal 1988 budget to Congress today, setting the stage for a battle over the deficit. Reagan's budget meets the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $108 billion, but has many proposals Congress has opposed. Congressional budget writers may drop the deficit target and seek a package of spending cuts and tax increases.  The U.S. economy will expand further this year, with interest rates falling in the first half and rebounding slightly in the second, a Wall Street Journal survey of 35 economists finds. Most expect the Fed to face intense pressure soon to cut rates.  Stock and bond prices surged on the first day of trading in 1987. The Dow Jones industrials closed up 31.36 points, at 1927.31. One analyst said the rebound wasn't a surprise because stocks and bonds had been artificially depressed by tax-related selling.
