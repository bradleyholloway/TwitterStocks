 The Men Who Came To Dinner, and What They Said About Email   By Gomes, Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  Mr. [Buchheit] said he started working on Gmail after observing that other email programs were getting worse, not better. Microsoft's Mr. [Kevin Doerr] said that at his company, Gmail was a thunderbolt. "You guys woke us up," he told Mr. Buchheit. Yahoo's Mr. Diamond, then at a startup with its own hot, new email program, said Gmail was the final impetus that Yahoo needed to buy his company.  The evening wasn't all a Gmail love-in, though. The Microsoft and Yahoo representatives said their many millions of users might not accept some of Gmail's departures from email norms, such as the way the program groups messages into "conversations." The two men also razzed Mr. Buchheit a bit, saying that it had been easy for [Google] to promise a lot of storage to its users because it carefully controlled how many users Gmail would have by requiring an invitation to get an account.  At one point, Mr. Doerr wondered when the new Yahoo mail program would have the whimsical touch of other Yahoo products. "It's not Yahoo yet," he said to Mr. Diamond. "It's not fun."
