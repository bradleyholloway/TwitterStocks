 More Andersen Clients Abandon Firm   By By Cassell Bryan-Low and Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2002  The client losses made for one of the accounting firm's worst days since its indictment on March 14, with International Paper Co. dropping Andersen and Halliburton Co. announcing its intent to consider alternatives. Oracle Corp. and Walgreen Co. also said yesterday they were ditching Andersen, bringing its year-to-date total of lost clients to about 160.  Oracle, which has employed Andersen for 15 years, said it had appointed Ernst & Young LLP as its independent auditor. The Redwood Shores, Calif., maker of database and applications software said the decision didn't arise from disagreement with Andersen's practices. Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley said in a statement, "Unfortunately, we believe we are forced to change auditors given the breakup that started to occur within Arthur Andersen's global practices in the past few weeks."
