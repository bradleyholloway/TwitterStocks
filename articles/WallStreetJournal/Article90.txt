 Fugitive Banker Loses Ruling on Extradition   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1989  A federal magistrate ruled that fugitive banker George Koskotas can be extradited to Greece to stand trial on charges that he embezzled more than $250 million.  The allegations at home against Mr. Koskotas helped topple the government of former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, partly because Mr. Koskotas said the money he moved may have been diverted to Mr. Papandreou's party.
