 Politics & Economics: Nuclear Industry Plans Ad Push For New Plants   By Fialka, John J, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2006  The campaign, based around a theme of "nuclear renaissance," is timed to support President Bush's nuclear-energy initiative, set to be unveiled with his 2007 budget request today. The plan will sponsor research in technology to safely reprocess spent nuclear fuel so that long-term storage space for waste might be reduced.  According to the industry, nuclear-power plants operated at 89.7% of their capacity in 2005, just under the industry's record. As costs for coal and natural gas rise, the cost of nuclear-generated power is attractive to utilities. The fact that nuclear energy doesn't generate carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" believed to be warming the atmosphere will be featured in the campaign.
