 The Button Dilemma; Classic Look Returns to Suits: Assessing the State Of Your Closet   By Hwang, Suein, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2005  Some clothing designers have almost entirely eliminated three-button suits from their lines. "There's been a return to the power suit, and the power suit was never a three-button suit," says designer John Varvatos, who isn't offering any three-button suits this year.  With a two-button, the risk is in the other direction -- buttons too far south. "A low two-button is definitely indicative to me of a suit being old," says Mr. Mitchell, the Connecticut retailer. "If you can see your pants -- if your button is below your navel -- that's definitely not a good sign."  A three-button suit can still be perfectly acceptable from a fashion perspective, provided it doesn't look too much like one. Barneys touts a three-button made by Isaia: When the top button is left undone, the jacket "creates an elegant roll that looks like you're wearing a two- button," a Barneys spokesman says.
