 Dollar Overcomes Early Weakness, Rises On Trader Optimism for U.S. Economy   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1985  In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 3.1850 West German marks, up sharply from the late Wednesday quote of 3.1300 marks. The British pound eased to $1.2172 from $1.2315.  Traders said most of the day's activity was concentrated in New York, because European markets weren't in full swing after Wednesday's Mayday holiday. Trading abroad also was sluggish because of coming national holidays: the Tokyo market is closed today and Monday and London banks will be closed Monday.  Audrey McNiff, an assistant vice president at Irving Trust Co., New York, said that, on closer inspection, traders "realized these weren't significant problems" and didn't pose a threat to the U.S. financial system. According to Ms. McNiff, the fact that "the market digested the rumors so easily" was a positive sign because it showed that stability had returned to foreign-exchange markets. The dollar took a beating after the Ohio thrift crisis in March because foreign banks and companies feared a broader financial debacle.
