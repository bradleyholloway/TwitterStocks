 Tom Herman's Tax Tip: Don't Miss This Tax Break   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2006  A study by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found many people who were eligible for the sales-tax deduction didn't claim it on their 2004 returns, filed last year.  One obstacle: Late passage of the legislation in 2004 prevented the IRS from including details in its Form 1040 instructions for the 2004 tax year, the report says. Instead, the information was placed in a separate IRS publication.  The IRS has revised its instructions for 2005 to include details about the sales-tax deduction. It also recently issued a fact sheet (FS-2006-9) available at www.irs.gov.
