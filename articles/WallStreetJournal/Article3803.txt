 Mitsubishi Motors to Unveil Plan; Restructuring Blueprint Includes $4 Billion Bailout, Elimination of 10,000 Jobs   By Norihiko Shirouzu, Jathon Sapsford and Ginny Parker, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  It is unclear how much of Mitsubishi Motors' aid will come from the venerable Mitsubishi industrial group, founded over 130 years ago. A shutting down or a selloff of Mitsubishi Motors would damage the reputation of the entire group, which includes trading house Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.  Mitsubishi Motors also will reduce its world-wide work force by 22% to about 40,000, including a 30% cut in white-collar workers to 18,400. The plan also calls for slashing the number of employees at its head office and relocating it to Kyoto -- a move Mitsubishi Motors said will likely result in savings of two billion yen a year. The company will cut to six from the current 15 the number of vehicle architectures it builds and slash material costs by 15%, or 120 billion yen, in three years.  Grim the prospects for Mitsubishi Motors, many say a complete shuttering is unlikely. As in many countries, Japan's auto makers are sources of national pride and one of its biggest industries. The implications of a shutdown would be enormous for Japan's economy, which is just beginning to recover from a decade-long slump.
