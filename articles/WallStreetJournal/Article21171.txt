 Economic Data, Prime-Rate Cut Depress Dollar --- Traders Focus on Refunding By Treasury for Signals On Currency's Outlook   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1988  The dollar's decline followed three days of advances that some dealers said set the stage for yesterday's backsliding. "People were getting very bullish on the dollar and probably bought too many dollars," said Ryohei Takashima, chief corporate trader at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s New York office.  Traders also watched closely for signals about the dollar's outlook from the Treasury's three-day refunding auction of $27 billion in securities, which began yesterday. Perceiving strong demand at yesterday's sale of three-year notes, especially from foreign investors, some traders were encouraged about the dollar's near-term health.  Mr. McGroarty said he believed that foreign demand at yesterday's sale of three-year notes was strong, giving a bullish signal for the dollar. Although Japanese investors tend to favor the longerterm securities, which are to be auctioned today and tomorrow, he said he expected these issues would also be embraced by other strong foreign demand. "Talk of the dollar falling to 100 yen and 110 yen has really dissipated. It's not that they've turned bullish, but they're looking at the attractive yield spreads between the U.S. and Japan," Mr. McGroarty said.
