 Annexation Faces Losses In 2 States   By By Jeffrey Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1998  In North Carolina and Tennessee, where rural property owners long have griped about cities' broad power to expand by forcibly grabbing land on their fringes, the foes of annexation are gaining ground.  Two weeks ago, a little-noticed bill was introduced in the North Carolina General Assembly that would take the biggest bite in 15 years out of the state's annexation law, one of the most permissive in the country. The day before that, Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist signed into law the most sweeping overhaul yet of the state's 43-year-old annexation law.  Among the restrictions in the Tennessee measure: Cities must wait 15 years after annexing an area to start collecting all the taxes from it. That's an effort to stop "tax-grab" annexations, which have prompted bitter fights, notably around Knoxville. The North Carolina bill would, among other things, bar cities from taxing farmland that's part of a larger annexation until the agricultural acreage is developed.
