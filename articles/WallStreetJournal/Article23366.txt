 The Buzz: Three IPOs Hit the Market, Feel Chill From Vonage   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  Town Sports, which runs urban fitness centers such as New York Sports Clubs and Washington Sports Clubs, opened up 2% from its IPO price of $13 a share, but its stock finished nearly flat, at $13.25. Luna, which invents molecular technologies and sensing technologies, opened flat with its $6-a-share IPO price, and closed there. Alphatec, which makes surgical products used to treat spinal disorders, also opened flat and finished two cents under its $9 offer price. All three debuted on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Medical-device companies and drug makers haven't received warm receptions from investors this year, so Alphatec's troubles on its first day aren't unusual.
