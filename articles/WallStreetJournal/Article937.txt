 Pact Set by Bank Of Montreal For Brokerage   By By Jacquie McNish, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1987  Bank of Montreal and Nesbitt, Thomson Inc. signed an agreement allowing the bank to acquire as much as 75% of the Toronto-based securities dealer for about 292 million Canadian dollars ($219 million).  Under terms of its agreement, Bank of Montreal intends to launch a public tender offer for all of Nesbitt Thomson's 12.3 million Class A common shares outstanding for 22 dollars each. The Bank is offering to pay 2.75 times Nesbitt's current book value of eight dollars a share. The tender offer is expected within two weeks and is contingent on Bank of Montreal receiving a minimum of 90% of Nesbitt's shares.  If the takeover offer is successful, Nesbitt has agreed to issue an additional 2.8 million new common shares to Bank of Montreal and 2.8 million common shares to Nesbitt's employees. The new shares will be sold at Nesbitt's book value at the time of the issue. The transactions would lower Nesbitt employees' stake in the company to 25% from the current 61%.
