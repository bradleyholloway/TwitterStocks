 Goodyear Expects To Post 25% Decline In Second-Period Net   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1985  Robert E. Mercer, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the quarterly drop largely to reduced demand for the company's private brand replacement car tires. He said increased supplies of imported tires also are affecting that market. Goodyear reported a 22% decline in profit for the first quarter, reflecting, in part, the declining replacement tire market.
