 Aznar Raises Spain's Profile, at a Price   By By Carlta Vitzthum and Keith Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  Mr. [Jose Maria Aznar], who joined the U.S. and Britain in calling for an end to United Nations sanctions against Iraq, wants to enhance Spain's standing within the European Union, which has been dominated by France and Germany. He is betting that the eight Eastern European nations slated to join the EU next year share Spain's vision of a stronger trans-Atlantic relationship in the wake of the Iraq conflict.  Mr. Aznar, who was himself the target of a failed terrorist attack in 1995, knew he was taking a big gamble domestically when he aligned himself with President Bush. Leading up to the Iraq war, polls showed 90% of Spaniards opposed the conflict, and antiwar protests continued long after the fall of Baghdad. "No a la guerra" banners still flutter on balconies in Madrid. But Mr. Aznar insists the experience in Iraq will contribute to Spain's remarkable but incomplete transformation into one of the most dynamic countries in Europe. "Spain can no longer be just a nice country," he told reporters in April. "It has to assume its responsibilities."  After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S., Mr. Aznar linked his anti-ETA campaign to Mr. Bush's fight against terrorism. He then tried to drum up diplomatic support for the U.S. position on Iraq, making dozens of phone calls this winter to European, Arab and Latin American leaders. When Germany and France moved to block Washington's Iraq policy in the U.N., Mr. Aznar countered by enlisting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy in writing an open letter in praise of a strong U.S.-European relationship. Five other European leaders signed the missive.
