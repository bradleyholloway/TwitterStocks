 Forecast Is Dim For New York's Office Market --- With Employment Falling, Commercial Real Estate Unlikely to Revive in '02   By By Janet Morrissey, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  Currently, there is about 12.1 million square feet of sublease office space in the New York market, or four times the amount of sublease space the city held at the end of 2000, according to Ms. [Maria Sicola]. The glut of space, combined with corporate layoffs, is a recipe for falling rents. Hardest hit will be downtown Manhattan, which is struggling to recover from the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.  Ms. Sicola predicts asking rents in Manhattan in general to be flat to slightly down in 2002, with the exception of downtown Manhattan, where rents will fall by as much as 20% from their current levels. This doesn't take into account concessions, such as free rent and tax incentives, that also will be part of the mix.  Vacancy rates will jump. Midtown Manhattan's vacancy rate, which stands at 7.9%, will run up to 8.95% in 2002, 8.99% in 2003 and 10.07% in 2004, Ms. Sicola predicts. Downtown Manhattan's vacancy rate will fare much worse, climbing to 12.48% in 2002, 13.5% in 2003, and 13.09% in 2004, from its current level of 6.4%.
