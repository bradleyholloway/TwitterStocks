 Mortgage Rates Rise but Remain at Low Level   By By Darren McDermott and Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1999  Fears of inflation are pressuring the bond market and pushing mortgage rates higher, but rates on home loans are still near longtime lows, and many analysts don't expect a significant slowdown in home purchases anytime soon.  The national average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate rose to 7.1% Friday from 7.02% the week before, according to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., financial publisher that tracks mortgage rates. The latest average is the highest since March, but it is little changed from six months ago and slightly lower than the 7.19% monthly average HSH calculates for May 1998.  The increase could put a further brake on what had been a slowing trend in refinancing existing mortgages. Refinancing applications last week fell 20% from year-ago levels, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. David Lereah, chief economist with the mortgage-bankers trade group, said with rates flat or up slightly in recent months, refinancings have fallen to 35% of mortgage originations from 48% at the beginning of the year.
