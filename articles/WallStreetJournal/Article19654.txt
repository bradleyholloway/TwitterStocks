 U.S. and Europe Signal That Rates May Be Cut Soon --- Greenspan and Duisenberg Hope to Boost Economies, Avert Threat of Deflation   By By Greg Ip and G. Thomas Sims, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2003  Mr. [Alan Greenspan], speaking via satellite from Washington, emphasized the importance of keeping the U.S. from sliding into deflation while acknowledging that there is still little evidence of the economic rebound he has been expecting. Though deflation, or generally declining prices, is unlikely, he said the Fed will "lean over backwards" to prevent it and the issue will be "discussed in detail" when Fed policy makers meet June 24 and 25.  "Overall, not least due to the appreciation of the euro, inflationary pressures have declined significantly over recent months," Mr. [Duisenberg] said. "This assessment will be reflected in our deliberations on monetary policy." The euro's strength is hurting European exports by making their products more costly to foreign customers. It has, however, been welcomed by the Bush administration because it helps U.S. exporters. A European rate cut should tend to restrain the currency's rise, but the effect could be muted if the Fed cuts rates again.  Mr. Greenspan's comments on deflation were among his most extensive yet, and he returned repeatedly to the point that even though deflation is unlikely, its consequences -- should it happen -- are serious enough to merit consideration of preventive action now. That argument would let the Fed cut interest rates again without contradicting its often-stated belief that deflation is unlikely and the economy is likely to pick up. "We perceive [deflation] as a low probability . . . but the cost of addressing it is very small indeed," he said. He compared the need for insurance against deflation to a "firebreak" -- a strip of cleared land used to prevent the spread of forest fires.
