 BankAmerica To Buy Remains Of Oregon S&L   By By Charles McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1990  Benjamin Franklin is based in Portland, Ore. The price compares with the 3% to 5% of core deposits that the Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency that handles dead thrifts, has been able to command in other sales of its wards. Several analysts had predicted that the premium paid for Benjamin Franklin would be in that range as well. The higher premium BankAmerica paid means that it could take the bank holding company five or six years to earn back its investment -- more if the Oregon economy stalls as it did in the early 1980s. But several analysts applauded the move as a sound strategic step.  BankAmerica said it purchased $2.7 billion of Benjamin Franklin deposits and about $3 billion of assets. However, the RTC estimated that only about $2.4 billion of the deposits are so-called core deposits, which are local, relatively inexpensive retail deposits that are considered highly stable. The RTC retained $500.7 million of Benjamin Franklin assets. If BankAmerica doesn't want to keep any of the assets it acquired, it can transfer them back to the RTC any time in the next three months.
