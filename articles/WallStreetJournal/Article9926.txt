 Bluefly, Evergreen Solar Gain; New Frontier, Brightpoint Slide   By Cordeiro, Anjali, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2006  Some small caps in the semiconductor sector managed to eke out gains, taking their cue from Transmeta. That stock gained 13 cents, or 8.2%, to $1.72 on news that large cap Advanced Micro Devices will market a certain microprocessor designed by Transmeta in emerging markets. Zoran gained 84 cents, or 3.3%, to 26.09; Silicon Storage Technology gained 11 cents, or 3%, to 3.78.  New Frontier Media fell 1.27, or 15%, to 7.41. The Boulder, Colo., adult-entertainment company's fiscal 2007 revenue guidance didn't meet analyst estimates.  Brightpoint, a provider of wireless mobile products and services, fell 3.67, or 18%, to 16.22. Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the stock to hold from buy, saying that the wireless carriers Brightpoint supplies the most aren't growing as much as others.
