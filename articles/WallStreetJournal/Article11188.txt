 Carla Hills, Former HUD Chief, Called A Leading Contender for Trade Position   By By Gerald F. Seib and Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1988  Carla Hills, former secretary of housing and urban development, has emerged as a leading contender to become special trade representative, according to government aides and officials close to President-elect Bush.  Ms. Hills is a well-known Washington lawyer who led HUD during the Ford administration. Officials involved in Mr. Bush's transition said she is under consideration for several top-level jobs.  Mr. Bush may announce his choice for special trade representative as early as this week, officials said. By picking Ms. Hills for the job, Mr. Bush would not only fill one of the most sensitive economic and foreign-policy jobs in his administration, but also would begin to make good on his promises to appoint women and minorities to influential jobs.
