 Insiders of Soft-Drink Technology Company Pour Out of Stock, Raising Some Questions   By By Roger Lowenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1991  PepsiCo, which has world-wide rights to American Business Computers' technology and owns 15% of the stock, says the technology "will be the future of soda dispensing." Gray Seifert Securities, an institutional boutique and a booster of the stock, praises the technology for yielding "virtually perfect drinks with minimal foam."  Robert Cutting, president, says he sold 45,000 shares, leaving him with about 10,000. And last week it was disclosed through regulatory filings that the wife of director Steven Smolev sold 736,500 shares, valued at $6.7 million. Counting his wife's shares, Mr. Smolev was the biggest known individual holder. Herbert Luxenburg, another director, sold 100,000 shares this year and last, or about 86% of his reported stake. And Joseph Shannon, chairman, sold 100,000 shares within the past year.  What do insiders know, or think they know? ABC's patented dispenser, known as the Omnitron, and a four-ounce-per-second version known as the Minitron, have been repeatedly delayed. A January 1990 company report cited "delays in the market rollout of the Omnitron" but anticipated results "within the next six months." A year later, ABC's earnings release again cites "a delay in the market rollout of Omnitron." Whitman Corp., designated to manufacture the Minitron, dropped out in February. American Business Computers says it is negotiating with potential replacements.
