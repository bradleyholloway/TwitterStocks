 Bidders Face New Game For French Soccer Rights   By Mullen, Jethro, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  Last week, the French league announced a broadcast-rights structure that includes three "premium" packages for the prime-time games as well as three "fan" packages comprising the rights for games of particular clubs. Various rules determine which broadcaster gets the rights if a match falls into two different packages.  It can't relax its grip too much, as soccer remains a key subscriber-retention tool. A survey by market-research company Ipsos SA published last month in French newspaper Les Echos found that 24% of Canal's 3.5 million subscribers who watch soccer would "certainly" cancel if Canal lost the football rights. A further 19% would "probably" cancel, the survey said.  Meanwhile, France's free-to-air broadcasters, including state- controlled France Televisions, which currently has the rights to the league's Sunday highlights package, Television Francaise 1 SA, and M6 Metropole Television SA could also bid for some of the less expensive packages, such as the highlights packages or the multiplex package. France Telecom's two rival broadband providers, Iliad SA and Neuf Cegetel, and cable company Numericable could also be interested.
