 Potentate Jr.   By By Claudia Rosett, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2002  Interviewing Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev, during his recent trip to Washington, was almost that bad. The 40-year-old Mr. Aliyev is not a dictator -- not yet. But in the murky politics that bedevils most post-Soviet states, he occupies an intriguing niche. In a country ranked by Transparency International as one of the most crooked on earth, worse than Egypt, Russia or Haiti, Ilham is a dictator-in-training, the only son of Azerbaijan's autocratic president, 79-year-old Heydar Aliyev. While post-Soviet rulers from Tbilisi to Tashkent have rarely shrunk from family involvement in politics, the Aliyevs have the distinction among this crowd of pioneering a path toward an actual dynasty of despotism.  Ilham is easy to talk to. Tall, mustachioed, soft-spoken and clearly at ease with his tailored suit, gold watch and camera-toting entourage, he is fluent in English, French and Russian. He sees himself as working to build a modernized Azerbaijan, a place, he says, "where people will live free and without fear." Certainly, Mr. Aliyev is working hard, though whether a free and modern Azerbaijan will be the end product is debatable. Since his father became president in a quasi-coup in 1993, Ilham has become prime mover and first vice president of the lucrative state oil company; a member of parliament and first deputy of the ruling party; head of the national Olympic committee; and leader of Azerbaijan's delegation to the Council of Europe. "It's very difficult to have so many responsibilities," he says, but "I'm a very responsible person."
