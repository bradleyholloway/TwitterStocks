 Moscow Nights: All the New Money Has Clubs Jumping --- Nouveau Riche Businessmen And Mafiosi Are Partying Like There's No Tomorrow   By By Neela Banerjee, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1994  It looks at first like a slow evening. The highest -- and only -- bid for the long-stemmed pink rose is a measly $12. But watching the proceedings from a table cluttered with black caviar and salmon, Gennady Logvinenko decides he wants the flower. With the $12 bid standing, he pipes up: "$300."  When a woman delivers the flower to his table, Mr. Logvinenko pulls out a roll of bills as thick as his fist and peels off a hundred for her. "I really wanted that rose for my friend -- it's her birthday -- and I didn't want to get into a bidding war," Mr. Logvinenko says, beaming at his date, whose last name he doesn't know. "I spend about $500 to $1,000 when I go out. But that's nothing. I wouldn't call myself rich."  The night life is bizarre, particularly the evenings spent going from strip show to strip show. A lot of the male patrons look as if they have done time; many of their dates look like call girls. The clubs themselves resemble the gaudiest of high-school proms. "The poshest nightclubs are very expensive, very Mafia. They're totally unhip," says Artemy Troitsky, a local pop culture critic. "Liza Minnelli went to them when she was in town. What other proof do you need?"
