 Japan's Closing Of Toho Mutual Signals Focus On Insurance   By By Bill Spindle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  The Japanese government's decision to shut down Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co. is one of the first results of efforts by the country's new financial-industry watchdog to turn its attention to the life-insurance industry.  On Friday, an FSA spokesman said the agency plans a series of inspections at life insurers to evaluate their capital provisions and business operations. The agency, which has taken over many of the supervisory functions the Ministry of Finance once handled, has proved itself more aggressive in forcing banks and brokers to deal more swiftly with their problems or close down if they can't. The FSA also has conducted a series of inspections recently of foreign financial firms, including a long-running investigation of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.
