 U.S. Agency Orders Pentagon Official Fired for Harassment of an Employee   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1985  The board, which hears federal employees' appeals, ordered the dismissal of Mr. Starrett, director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and fined him $1,000. The board also ordered demotions and fines for two other audit agency officials. A spokesman said it was the first time the board, established in 1978 as part of the Civil Service Reform Act, ruled that a federal official be removed from office and fined the maximum amount.  The decision was a victory for George Spanton, a former agency manager. In 1982, he reported to his superiors that Pratt & Whitney Corp.'s government products division, in West Palm Beach, Fla., was charging the government for excessive spending on travel and entertainment and was paying its top executives excessive salaries -- a problem he called widespread among defense contractors. Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Corp.  Mr. Spanton asserts that his complaints and his call for a nationwide investigation of such practices by defense contractors were ignored by agency officials. Mr. Spanton, who managed the agency's West Palm Beach office, said he was given a reduced performance rating, threatened with a transfer to California and, in 1983, pressured into retiring, after he disclosed the problems to congressional committees and news media.
