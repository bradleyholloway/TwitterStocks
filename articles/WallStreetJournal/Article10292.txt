 MarketWatch: Spice Up the Index-Fund Formula   By Burton, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2009  From January 1990 through June 4, 2009, the equal-weighted S&P Equal Weight Index posted a 9.1% average annualized gain, including dividends, outperforming the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 index's 7.5% average yearly return, according to S&P. Equal weighting lost its edge in 2007 and 2008, as large stocks lost less than small stocks. Among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that follow the equal-weighted index, the Rydex S&P Equal Weight ETF is up about 17% so far this year and Morgan Stanley Equally Weighted S&P 500 Fund has risen around 17%, according to investment researcher Morningstar.
