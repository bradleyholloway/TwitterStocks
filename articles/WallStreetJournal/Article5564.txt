 Letters to the Editor: The Case for Minimalist Government   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1998  From Bill Clinton's "dialogue" on race to Arthur Schlesinger's latest defense of the interventionist state ("Government Isn't the Root of All Evil," Jan. 30), one thing is abundantly clear -- the advocates of big government either do not know or choose to ignore what their critics are saying. Mr. Schlesinger's piece is so filled with strawmen and misconceptions that no other conclusion is possible.  I am aware of no serious free-market critic of interventionism who argues that government is the root of all evil. Rather, we contend that the root of nearly all our socio-economic ills is coercive conduct by the government that violates the rights of the people it is intended to serve. When private parties engage in similarly unlawful behavior, be it theft, fraud, pollution of that which does not belong to them or other actions that violate the rights of human beings, the government can and should respond. This is the Jeffersonian concept of government. To argue in favor of a government limited to the defensive role envisioned by the Founders is not, as Mr. Schlesinger puts it, to "delegitimate" government.  Utopia is not a policy option. Those of us who advocate a minimalist government have never claimed that free markets are a titanium shield against all wickedness or incompetence, but simply that government regulation is nearly always counterproductive. The savings and loan debacle is a marvelous case in point. Mr. Schlesinger cites this as evidence against the market, but this waste could never have occurred without government intervention in the lending industry going back to the New Deal.
