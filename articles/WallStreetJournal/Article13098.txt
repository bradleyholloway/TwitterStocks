 Finishing in Fallujah   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2004  This is hardly the moment for Mr. Bush to take a victory lap. Elections in Iraq have been promised by January, and as Mr. Bush claimed his new mandate Wednesday, Marines near Fallujah mourned the loss of eight of their colleagues in a weekend car bomb attack. Those deaths were in part the result of the commander-in-chief's decision -- one of the few inarguable mistakes of the war -- to stop last April's offensive there just days shy of taking control of the city, which has since become headquarters for the jihadists and Baathists who are terrorizing Iraq.  Signs are that this may be about to change. The Marines have had a cordon around Fallujah for a couple weeks now, and U.S. warplanes and artillery have been striking insurgent positions. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that American and Iraqi troops will be able to take the city, and with minimal loss of life on the coalition side. But if the coming battle rages for more than a few days, political fissures could erupt in the interim government -- President Ghazi Yawer, a Sunni, was among those crying foul during the April offensive -- leading to pressure for another "third way" illusion like the now defunct Fallujah Brigade that leaves legitimate authorities with something less than full control.
