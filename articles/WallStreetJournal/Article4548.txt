 Race for the Late Claude Pepper's House Seat Is Spiced by Miami District's Diverse Ethnicity   By By James M. Perry, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1989  But the legendary Mr. Pepper, a Democrat who represented this teeming, multi-ethnic district for more than 25 years until his death at the age of 88 on May 30, was a lifelong liberal. Years ago, they called him "Red" Pepper. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen, who stepped down from her state senate seat to make this race, is a dedicated anti-abortion, anti-Castro, anti-tax conservative.  Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen -- her husband is Dexter Lehtinen, the U.S. attorney here -- won the Republican primary Aug. 1 with an astonishing 83% of the vote against three opponents, avoiding a runoff. The Democrats weren't so lucky. In a seven-way race, super-lawyer Gerald Richman, 48, edged City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy, 28% to 27%. Finishing third, out of the running, was Mr. Pepper's niece, Jo Ann Pepper, a probation officer. She is now supporting Mrs. Kennedy in the Aug. 15 runoff against Mr. Richman.  Leading Democrats had hoped the 44-year-old Mrs. Kennedy would win the nomination without a runoff and go on to neutralize Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen's ethnic appeal. Like Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen, Mrs. Kennedy was born in Havana. They both fled Cuba with their families when Fidel Castro seized power.
