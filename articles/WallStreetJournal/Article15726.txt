 Letters to the Editor: A Farewell to Bloated Arms Budget   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1998  In his Sept. 22 editorial-page article "Washington Tightwads Are Creating a Hollow Military," Gen. Gordon Sullivan argues that the major reason for reducing military spending after the Cold War was to reduce our budget deficit. No, the major reason was that the Cold War threat from a massive Soviet military machine bristling with modern nuclear and conventional weaponry and with strong Central European allies had disappeared. For decades, our military prepared for a massive land war in Europe. When that threat disappeared earlier in the decade, our military appropriately shrank.  Gen. Sullivan is incorrect to argue that our military budget is $250 billion; in fact, it is more than $270 billion. He neglects to total all three military bills -- defense appropriations, military construction, Department of Energy military -- $20 billion is not a negligible figure. There is no doubt that the U.S. faces threats from such countries as North Korea and Iraq. With a budget of more than $270 billion, the U.S. should be able to confront a North Korea with a military budget under $3 billion and an Iraq with a military budget under $2 billion.
