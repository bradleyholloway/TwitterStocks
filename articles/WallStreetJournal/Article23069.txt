 French Soccer at Last Shows Signs of a Comeback   By Curtin, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2003  Mr. [Jean-Francois Lamour] has commissioned studies on how the government can make life commercially easier for soccer, from private financing to possible social-costs exemptions and tax breaks -- exactly the measures French clubs have been clamoring for. "Listing isn't a magic wand," says Philippe Dialo, director of French soccer's employers' association, the Union des Clubs Professionels de Football. "It's only one measure among many, but it would give clubs different options, not prohibit them from particular courses of action."  French soccer crowds may be smaller than elsewhere in Europe, but they have doubled in the past decade to around 20,000 on average for France's L1, the premier league. Crowds watching the top clubs, such as Olympique Lyonnais, PSG, Marseilles, Nantes and Bordeaux, are now often above 30,000. That is still a long way off from the 67,000 that watch the U.K.'s Manchester United or even higher numbers at Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain, but it also means French clubs haven't been caught up in the transfer-fee and wage frenzy that has driven some major clubs to the brink of bankruptcy.  While the financial status of France's clubs is also generally fragile -- the 18 top-tier clubs made an aggregate operating loss of 166 million euros ($199 million) in the 2001-02 season, the latest data available -- people in the industry agree that the clubs have cleaned up their act in the past year or so. The French clubs have negotiated a bigger share of television revenues with the organizers of L1, and gate receipts are on the up. A fan wanting the best seat at Olympique de Marseille's Velodrome has to pay around 70 euros, the same or more as at other top European clubs.
