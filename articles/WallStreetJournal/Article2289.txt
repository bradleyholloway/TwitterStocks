 Asian-Pacific Profit Outlooks Hold Steady   By By Steven E. Levingston, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1991  Corporate earnings-growth forecasts for Asian-Pacific nations were largely unchanged in September, although analysts' uncertainty was high for some countries.  The latest survey by Institutional Brokers Estimate System, or IBES, showed that profit forecasts for Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia were unchanged. Thailand and Australia had two-percentage-point increases, while South Korea recorded a one-percentage-point gain. Projected earnings growth for Japan and New Zealand slid one percentage point. The survey's forecasts refer to the 12 months to September 1992.  IBES, a unit of Lynch, Jones & Ryan of New York, arrives at its projections by combining per-share earnings estimates for companies' current fiscal year with forecasts for the coming year. Its calculations are based on earnings projections from thousands of analysts' company and market reports. IBES doesn't provide estimates for Taiwan and Indonesia because of insufficient data.
