 Getting Going: In Defense of My Contrarian Advice   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2007  David Wray, the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council's president, says the chance to take loans encourages employees to participate. "For most, it isn't a decision to save in the plan or save outside the plan," he says. "It's a decision to save, period. If people weren't in the plan, they'd have zero."  To be sure, if you had earlier borrowed, say, $3,000 for an emergency from your 401(k), you would have $3,000 less when you got laid off and cashed out your 401(k). But that doesn't make the 401(k) less attractive. After all, if you had opted for the emergency reserve instead, the $3,000 would have been withdrawn from your reserve, so the 401(k) would still come out ahead.  Allan Roth, a financial planner in Colorado Springs, Colo., understands people's aversion to cashing out their 401(k) and paying the tax penalty. "It's psychological," he says. "People want the cash in the bank."
