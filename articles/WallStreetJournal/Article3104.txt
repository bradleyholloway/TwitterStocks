 Food-Safety Panel Wants One Person To Handle Outbreaks   By By Otesa Middleton, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1998  The group, mandated by Congress and comprising members of the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council, is recommending changing laws and appointing one person to manage outbreaks and set standards to improve food safety. The panel also cited a "fragmented federal structure" for dealing with food safety.  Dr. John C. Bailar III, chairman of the committee and head of the University of Chicago's department of health studies, said U.S. agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Agriculture, need to answer to a central person on food-safety issues.
