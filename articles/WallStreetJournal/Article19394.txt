 Janitors' Union Plans East Coast Campaign --- Organizing Drive Targets Those Working for Contractors   By By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2001  The SEIU has tailored its strategy to reflect the janitorial industry's new reality: a work force increasingly composed of immigrants toiling for huge contractors that clean buildings owned or managed by multinational corporations. Such property companies tend to outsource janitorial services instead of maintaining their own cleaning staffs, weakening links between janitors and their employers. Fierce cleaning-contract price wars have led many contractors to hire part-time workers for low wages and no benefits, even as property companies and their building tenants prospered from the recent economic boom.  Besides wooing new members, the SEIU will press the janitors' contractor-employers to agree to improve worker salaries and benefits. The union also will pressure major building managers and owners to go along, including real-estate investment trust Mack-Cali Realty Corp., of Cranford, N.J., and New York financial-services concern Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which has extensive property holdings.  As more janitors join, Mr. [Stephen Lerner] says, the union will be able to ratchet up pressure on its corporate adversaries, first with pickets, then one-day work stoppages and longer strikes along the East Coast. The goal: full-time hours, with salaries between $7.50 and $10 an hour, depending on the market, as well as health and pension benefits. Currently, hourly pay for janitors range from the minimum wage of $5.15 to about $8.
