 Movie Results Lift Viacom Net; Cable Unit Adjusts Ad Strategy   By Shira Ovide And Merissa Marr, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2007  Viacom has been hurt by poor TV ratings, particularly at MTV. New programs introduced this fall have brought improved audience numbers, a development Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman called "very encouraging."  The studio could continue to provide a boost to Viacom's bottom line, with a strong slate of movies on the horizon, including an "Indiana Jones" movie next summer and the revamp of the "Star Trek" series. Key DreamWorks executives have indicated they may leave the studio when their contracts allow next year, but Mr. Dauman said recently that would have no impact on Viacom's financials.
