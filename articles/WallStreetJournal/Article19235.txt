 Review / A Surfer's Guide to TV: Ho, Ho; Ha, Ha   By By Barbara D. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1999  In this animated holiday special, after little Adam's beloved toys fall from the moving-truck taking them from Ohio to New York City, Snowden the snowman (Peter MacNichol), Tiny the elephant (Kathy Najimy), Footloose the bunny (Rosslyn Taylor), and Drummer the windup bear (Michael McKean) set off on a perilous journey to reach their boy in time for Christmas. Can you spell "`Toy Story' knock-off"?  Still, kids wowed by the "Toy Story" movies and clamoring for more adventures of old-fashioned playthings could do a lot worse than this warm-hearted special, which shows that the new-fangled computerized animation of the Pixar folks hasn't knocked all the stuffing out of tried-and-true stop-motion methods and latex foam.  The first five or so minutes -- covering nine centuries -- are a surprisingly slow slog; Dennis Miller should leave matters medieval and early modern to Rowan Atkinson's Blackadder. But the real focus of this comedy special is on our current century. And when Mr. Miller, decked out in the duds of each era, takes on such subjects as World War II and hippies, his incisive comic riffs and rants, which play off old slang and jaundiced hindsight, merit raves.
