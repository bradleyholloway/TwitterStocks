 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2001  The Senate recently approved expanded benefits for victims' families and others affected by acts of terrorism or other major disasters. Employers would be allowed to make tax-exempt payments to employees for various types of expenses, such as personal, living, home-repair or funeral costs, in connection with the terrorist attacks or other "qualified disasters." The bill also would make it easier for charities to make disaster-relief payments to victims' families and others affected by Sept. 11 or by anthrax attacks, staffers say.  First, some background: Subtract $100 for each casualty. Then deduct unreimbursed losses that exceed 10% of adjusted gross income. These rules effectively eliminate most people from deducting anything. But the IRS also issued a reminder about a special rule for taxpayers who do qualify and who live in places the president has declared a federal disaster area, as President Bush did after Sept. 11 for New York City and Arlington County, Va.  He backs legislation to prevent those taxes from being imposed. Mary B. Hevener, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie, says the IRS plan is unlawful because "these amounts clearly are not taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code." Treasury officials disagree. "While we are sympathetic with the concerns of employers offering these options, our job is to make policy decisions within the bounds of the law Congress passes. In this situation, our hands were tied," says Mark Weinberger, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.
