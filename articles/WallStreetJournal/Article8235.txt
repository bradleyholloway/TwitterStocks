 Economy: economic activity increases across U.S. but conditions 'uneven,' the Fed finds   By Harper, Lucinda, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1992  The Federal Reserve Board will meet May 19, 1992 to set interest rate policy based on reports of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Overall trends include improvements in manufacturing (especially car and steel production), home building, and retailing. Commercial real estate is still languishing. Improvements are "very slow" in the San Francisco District, the problems in the Boston District are turning around, and optimism is notable higher in the Richmond and Cleveland Districts.
