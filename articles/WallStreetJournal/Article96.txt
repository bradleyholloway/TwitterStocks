 IBM's Plan to Reduce VDT Radiation Fails to Impress Most Computer Makers   By By Laurence Hooper and John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 1989  Digital Equipment Corp. was the only major computer company reached on Wednesday that said it had plans to expand its offerings of low-radiation VDTs. Digital said these plans predated IBM's announcement on Tuesday that all future models of its VDTs will meet or fall below the stringent standard agreed on last year by management and labor in Sweden.  A Digital spokeswoman added that Digital isn't convinced that VDT radiation presents a safety problem -- a comment echoed by most other manufacturers.  In addition to Digital, Data General Corp. said it has a policy of reducing electromagnetic fields generated by VDTs, but it volunteered no specific plans for doing so. A spokesman for the company, which is based in Westborough, Mass., said it has sold two terminal models for the past 18 months that meet the Swedish standards.
