 How Many Toy Stores Can Squeeze Online Before the Web Is Full?   By By Thomas E. Weber, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1999  SHOPPING FOR A TOY? The Web offers a gaggle of options. There's eToys.com. And Toysrus.com. And ToyTime.com, toysmart.com and a lot of others.  Going into the holiday season, more Web stores are selling toys than you could possibly imagine will succeed. They're the most visible example of the crowd mentality gripping e-commerce. You can buy dog food at Petsmart.com, Petopia.com, Petstore.com or Pets.com. Shopping for a gift? RedEnvelope.com, Send.com, Gifts.com and others can help.  ToyTime is perhaps the ultimate expression of dot-com optimism. The company didn't even exist last Christmas, when eToys was busy filling orders and establishing its reputation. As if going up against eToys weren't daunting enough, ToyTime must also compete against Amazon.com, which added a toy store to its site earlier this year, and Toys "R" Us, which has had problems at its online store but remains a powerful competitor.
