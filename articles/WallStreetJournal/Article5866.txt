 Mexico Plans Antitrust Probe Of Coca-Cola   By By Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2000  It also comes as Coke is challenging Mexican regulators' definition of its market strength. In an appeal filed last week with the Mexican Supreme Court, the beverage company argued that a definition used by the Mexican antitrust commission to consider its proposal to buy the Cadbury brands was too narrow, according to these people. Coke said that its market share should be measured against a broad beverage market that includes waters and juices rather than only carbonated soft drinks. Coke holds a 68% share of the carbonated-soft-drink market in Mexico, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication.
