 Politics & Economics: Credit-Rating Oversight Measure Is Supported by a Senate Panel   By Burns, Judith, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2006  The SEC currently has designated only five firms as "nationally recognized" ratings companies, and two of them -- Standard & Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., and Moody's Investors Service, a unit of Moody's Corp. -- control about 80% of the ratings business. Critics say the SEC has been too slow to allow new competition and fault ratings firms for giving top ratings to Enron Corp. and some other companies just before they collapsed.
