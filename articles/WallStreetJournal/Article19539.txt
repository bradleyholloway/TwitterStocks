 Company Finds Joint Ventures Ease Transitions   By By Janet Whitman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2002  The company will have the right to acquire the remaining 49% interest in KBI Norcal after two years. The two founders of Sanburn, Robert Garcia and John Volckman, will have a corresponding right to insist that Building Materials purchase the stake after four years. Building Materials didn't disclose more details of the contract, including whether there is a formal clause to opt out of the deal.  The company's latest acquisition, which will provide a slight boost to its earnings this year and help expand its house-framing operations, is similar to the company's purchase of Knipp Brothers Industries LLC, Mr. [Robert Mellor] said. Building Materials agreed to buy a 49% stake in that framing company in March 1999 then bought the remaining stake in May 2001.  Building Materials took a similar view with its latest purchase. Mr. Mellor said that buying a stake in a company rather than making an outright acquisition gives the parties an opportunity to work on problem areas. "Rough spots have a chance to get smoothed out," he said
