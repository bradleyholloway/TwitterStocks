 Watchdog Group In Turkey Seeks Banking Reforms   By By James M. Dorsey, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1997  A Turkish banking watchdog has urged banks to dramatically improve inspection systems in a bid to shore up the industry's image.  The International Banking Advisory and Research Group, a private Turkish monitoring agency, warned in a report published this week that Turkish banking needs to confront its structural problems, including inadequate capitalization and weak international competitiveness.  One way of doing so, the report said, would be to improve inspection systems to allow banks to track more closely their assets and liabilities. "Changes must be made in the inspection systems of the banks and the image of inadequate inspection must be erased," it said.
