 Getting Going: Sometimes the Magic Can Just Fade Away   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  To be sure, the system wisely compares each fund's performance to others in the same category and it factors in risk and fund sales commissions. Still, as the Chicago investment research firm says on its Web site, the stars are "a useful tool for identifying funds worthy of further research, but shouldn't be considered buy or sell signals." Many investors, unfortunately, don't seem to have gotten that message.  Meanwhile, over the past 80 years, stocks have climbed from 10 to 17 times earnings, boosting returns by some 0.7 percentage point a year. The market's earnings multiple can't climb from 10 to 17 again -- unless, of course, we get a huge crash first. The bottom line: Even in the long run, 10% a year isn't guaranteed, especially given today's lofty valuations.  Becoming a landlord can indeed be a good way to build wealth. But don't kid yourself: It isn't low risk. You may not be able to look up your rental property's value every day, the way you can look up the price of a stock. But that doesn't mean your property isn't fluctuating in value.
