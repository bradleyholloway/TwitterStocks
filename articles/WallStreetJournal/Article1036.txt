 Can Burger King Serve Big IPO?; Maintaining Growth Got Harder With Departure of Key Executive; Private-Equity Firms Cash In   By Janet Adamy and Ian McDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2006  Burger King's impressive turnaround is looking harder to sustain since the chief executive who engineered that revival left the company last month. Long-term investors also might be turned off by the huge payouts Burger King's private-equity owners have pocketed in advance of the initial public offering, even as the chain's comeback remains a work in progress. A Burger King spokeswoman declined to comment, citing the "quiet period" in advance of the IPO.  Mr. [Greg Brenneman]'s departure will "make investors more cautious because there is the uncertainty as to whether the new management can deliver," says Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill., which has $1.1 billion under management and owns shares of McDonald's. She said the firm doesn't plan to buy Burger King shares during the offering.  The largest was a $367 million dividend paid in February that the Burger King board approved partly because of the chain's "strong business performance . . . and cash generation in excess of our business needs," according to a filing with the SEC. The payout came during the quarter Burger King recorded the $12 million loss. Also, Burger King had to amend its credit facility and borrow $350 million to help make the payment. The company had $1.35 billion in debt as of March 31, a recent SEC filing shows.
