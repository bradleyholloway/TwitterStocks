 Hunting Cartels: U.S. Trust-Busters Increasingly Target International Business --- But Assaults Such as One On Japanese Paper Firms Are Stirring Criticism --- An Overlap With Trade Talks   By By John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1997  At that meeting of Japanese-owned paper makers five years ago, executives shared details about prices, new products, major orders, even gossip about their big customers. The purpose, the memo boasted, "was fully achieved." Soon, Kanzaki, Mitsubishi Corp. and several other Japanese fax-paper companies raised their American prices as much as 10%.  The memo became U.S. exhibit 167-T in one of several federal-court cases arising from the alleged conspiracy, part of a wave of what U.S. prosecutors contend is a rising tide of criminal price-fixing and collusion as the economy increasingly goes global. The paper case has brought a string of guilty pleas so far, and an unprecedented 22 U.S. grand juries now are looking into other international antitrust cases -- the most aggressive effort since the U.S. broke up Japanese and German industrial cartels in the 1940s.  Washington sees it differently. In a global economy, the government must be able to prosecute those whose deeds harm American consumers even if the deeds occur abroad, U.S. officials argue. Indeed, they say international cases will account for an even greater share of antitrust enforcement. "We'll attack these cartels whether the conspirators are in the U.S. or beyond our borders," says Joel Klein, who is the Justice Department's acting antitrust chief and is expected to be nominated to fill the post.
