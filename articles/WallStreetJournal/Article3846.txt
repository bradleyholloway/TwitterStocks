 Going Global: Dollar Gets Bogged Down; Weak Data and Trade Gap Hurt, but Oil Prices Hold the Key   By Sesit, Michael R, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2004  If there is a common thread running through the various factors behind the wobbly dollar, it is -- in a word -- oil. In the U.S., Lawrence J. Greenberg, chief international economist at Ried, Thunberg ICAP in Jersey City, N.J., says that the University of Michigan consumer-sentiment index's decline to a 19-month low suggests that "the relentless rise of oil prices is squeezing discretionary household purchasing power." Rebecca Patterson, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase in New York, adds that the damping economic impact of high oil prices "is also a reason why many investors believe the Fed will raise interest rates only gradually, and that's bad for the dollar."  David Hale, head of Chicago consultants Hale Advisors, says a Fed study concludes a large dollar depreciation -- 30% or more -- would result in higher U.S. bond yields, which would hurt consumption and housing. "But such a large devaluation would produce an export boom large enough to offset the losses in domestic demand and sustain total output growth at high levels," he says. While Mr. Hale says the Fed has no official forecasts, "it recognizes that a large devaluation is a clear possibility during the next two years."  The Morgan Stanley economist predicts that pricey oil will be negative for the yen. "Japan imports every drop of oil it uses," he notes. "And if the rest of Asia is hurt by high oil prices, Japan will be adversely affected as well."
