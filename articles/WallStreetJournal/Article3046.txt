 Taxes 1998: Schedule M for Migraine: Tax-Law Differences Make This April 15 Tougher Than Usual for Many Filers   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 1998  Some of the trickiest new twists lie in store for investors. Although the new law reduced the top capital-gains rates, it also changed the minimum holding period required to qualify for those rates. Also, the new rules apply only to part of 1997, not the full year. Thus, the capital-gains rate you pay depends not only on how long you held an investment but also on what day you sold it.  Last year's law created a bewildering variety of capital-gains tax rates. Generally, the law cut the top, long-term capital-gains rate to 20% from 28%, although the rate is only 10% for gains that would be in the 15% income-tax bracket. The law also increased the holding period to qualify for the most-favorable tax treatment to more than 18 months. Previously, you had to own an asset for more than 12 months to qualify for the most-favorable rate.  Still with us? There's more: The new law included special transition rules. For most sales after May 6, 1997 and before July 29, 1997, the new lower rates apply to gains on property held more than 12 months. For transactions after July 28, 1997, a 28% rate continues to apply for assets held more than one year but not more than 18 months. That's also the rate on gains on all collectibles held more than 12 months. For most transactions after July 28, 1997, the new 20% and 10% rates apply only to gains on property held more than 18 months. For further details, such as how to offset gains and losses, see IRS Publications 17 and 550.
