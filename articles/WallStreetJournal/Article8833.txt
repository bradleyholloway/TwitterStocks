 SEC Economist Opposes Rule On Derivatives --- Disclosure Won't Reduce Risk and May Mislead Investors, Official Says   By By Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1997  The Securities and Exchange Commission's chief economist opposed major elements of an SEC rule on company derivatives' disclosure, arguing that investors could be misled and a company's risk exposure misrepresented, according to an internal memorandum.  Erik Sirri's concerns were taken into account but didn't materially change the rule before it was passed in late January, SEC officials say.  Among the criticisms in the Jan. 7 memo, Mr. Sirri said the proposed rule "has the potential to create misleading representations of market risk" and would not "significantly decrease the risk to investors in public firms of significant losses in derivatives positions."
