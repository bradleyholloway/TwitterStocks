 India May Allow Foreign Stakes In Media Firms --- Concern Over Competition, Influence on Viewers May Slow the Process   By By Suman Dubey, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1994  The recommendations, which government officials say could be approved as regulations by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's cabinet later this month, would open the way for proposed Indian publishing joint ventures involving Time Warner Inc. of the U.S. and the Financial Times of London, a unit of Pearson PLC.  The recommendations, submitted last month by two groups of ministers commissioned by Mr. Rao to chart out a new media-investment policy, haven't been made public. But government sources say the ministers have cleared foreign investment in the print media, provided the following conditions are met: An Indian publisher would have to hold at least 51% of the equity of any publishing joint venture; the board would be required to have a majority of Indian nationals, and the editor of any joint-venture publication must be Indian.  If approved by the cabinet, the measure would brighten prospects for at least two major collaborations that have awaited approval since last year. Time Warner has asked to set up a joint venture with Delhi-based Living Media India Ltd., the publisher of India Today, Business Today and several other magazines. Living Media is part of a group that owns high-quality printing plants, which the venture would use to print Time magazine for subscribers in India, who currently number about 30,000. The venture also could print copies for export to Persian Gulf countries, which currently receive magazines sent from Europe.
