 Small-Stock Focus: For Some Short-Sellers, the Right Size Is Small   By By Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2002  The advance of small-caps followed the swoon they have been in since peaking last month, a downturn that hasn't gone undetected by the "shorts." There is no denying you would have done fine if you shorted small caps during the past month; both the Russell 2000 Index and the Standard & Poor's 600 SmallCap Index have fallen around 10% from peaks they made in May.  Defensive smokestack industries were strong, with land-transportation equipment in the lead. Among small caps, Cummins Engine (NYSE) frustrated short-sellers by rising 22 cents to 34.20; Stewart & Stevenson Services gained 77 cents, or 4.5%, to 17.83; and Wabash National (NYSE) added 46 cents, or 5.8% to 8.36.  Chemical stocks were also strong, with small-caps Lyondell Chemical (NYSE) rising 47 cents, or 3%, to 16.24, and Wellman (NYSE) adding 35 cents, or 2.3%, to 15.35.
