 A New Model in Bidding for Aid; Vietnam Hopes Help for Displaced Will Draw Donors to Dam Project   By Cohen, Margot, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2004  Si Pa Phin, Vietnam -- COMPARED WITH OTHER farmers in Vietnam's impoverished northern highlands, [Dieu Van Nhieu] Luyen is rolling in it. Nineteen months ago, he and his family moved to a spacious new home that resembles a Swiss chalet on stilts, complete with wrap-around balcony, shiny peach floor tiles, electricity, running water and satellite television. Instead of walking all morning to reach his crops, Mr. Luyen now can zoom off on his new motorcycle and get home in time for dinner and a movie on his new DVD player. "I have everything," says the 40-year-old father of six.  The government wants to raise $2.5 billion for the hydroelectric dam in Son La province -- at 2,400 megawatts, the largest single power project Vietnam has ever attempted. The nation's leaders claim the dam is crucial to meeting the country's future energy needs and maintaining Vietnam's 7% annual economic growth; the nation just announced a 7.24% rate for 2003. They say it also is a vital bulwark to protect the capital, Hanoi, from annual floods. Construction is supposed to begin by late 2005, but the government still doesn't know how it will foot a large portion of the bill. Officials project that some 30% will be financed from external sources.  For all the trouble the government is going to, the $2.5 billion question remains: Will donors come? Some are dubious. "It's very difficult to carry out that project," concludes Nishimiya Koji, program coordinator at the Japanese government's International Cooperation Agency in Hanoi. "The relocation issue is very, very critical."
