 Next: A Lower-Cost Reverse Mortgage   By Tergesen, Anne, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2011  On a $500,000 home, for example, a 75-year-old New York resident would receive about $237,000 with a fixed-rate Saver, versus $303,000 with a comparable traditional reverse mortgage, according to MetLife Bank. [...] some lenders charge slightly higher interest rates on Savers, in part because -- with lower loan balances but the same servicing and administrative costs -- they are potentially less profitable than conventional reverse mortgages.
