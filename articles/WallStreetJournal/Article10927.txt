 Toddling Trend: Child Care Near the Office   By By Cathy Trost, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1986  PLEASANTON, Calif. -- A child-care center that opened last week in a business park here warms babies with radiant heat, stimulates them with a "tactile crawl area" and expands their world with windows placed low to the floor.  Parents working at AT&T Communications, Viacom Cable Television, General Electric Credit Corp. and the park's other white-collar corporate tenants can ride a shuttle bus to the center to visit children on breaks, or watch them hiking and playing outside. "It's going to humanize this business park," says Michael VanPelt, the center's director.  So far, the center at Hacienda Business Park here is unusual, if not rare. Few office complexes offer child-care facilities, and few of them match the standards set by Hacienda. But developers and corporate executives predict child care at the office will become much more common in years ahead, as developers, builders, architects, businesses and even cities address the needs of a changing work force.
