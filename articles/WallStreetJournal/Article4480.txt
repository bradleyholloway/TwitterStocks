 Business world: Ponzi was a piker compared to 'troubled thrifts'   By Melloan, George, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1989  The thrift industry, long a pet of Congress, is in trouble that keeps getting deeper due to regulators' assertions that it is cheaper to merge insolvent institutions than to shut them down (contrary to a McKinsey and Co. report that says mergers cost 40 percent more). Congress has long supported regulators' claims. Furthermore, closings are proceeding slowly while the liabilities of the worst-off institutions are growing apace, due to deposit insurance. Ultimately the bill for the mess will be paid by taxpayers.
