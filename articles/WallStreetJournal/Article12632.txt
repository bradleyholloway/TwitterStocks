 Merck Selects Biologist from MIT As Head of Research Operations   By By Gardiner Harris, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2000  Mr. [Peter S. Kim] soon will succeed Edward M. Scolnick, the longest-serving and arguably most successful research chief at any big pharmaceutical company, who directed the discovery and development of the arthritis drug Vioxx, among others. Until then, Dr. Kim will be in charge of all of Merck's internal drug discovery and development operations, the company said. Bennett M. Shapiro will continue to preside over Merck's external research collaborations and agreements. For now, both will report to Dr. Scolnick.  Dr. Kim's hiring is part of a long tradition at Merck of bringing in brilliant academics and expecting them to adapt quickly to the needs of the commercial marketplace. In 1975, Merck lured renowned biologist P. Roy Vagelos from Washington University in St. Louis to head up its research operation. In 1985, Dr. Vagelos picked Dr. Scolnick to succeed him only three years after Dr. Scolnick, a top molecular biologist, had been recruited from the National Institutes of Health. Both men's scientific expertise was crucial in expanding Merck's research direction.  Drs. Scolnick and Kim both said that Dr. Kim has a lot to learn about Merck. "I'm going back to school with open eyes, open ears and an open mind," Dr. Kim said. Dr. Scolnick said Dr. Kim's expertise in the study of protein structures didn't signal a push by Merck into the hot area of gene and protein science. "Honest, there's no signaling here," he said. "We're going for raw talent with the right background, personality and knowledge."
