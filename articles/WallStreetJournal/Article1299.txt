 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Books: Five Best   By Waugh, Alexander, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2008  Jeal senior, a member of a bizarre Christian sect called Order of the Cross, was literally a tree hugger -- "sometimes he placed his arms around an ancient trunk as if embracing an old and trusted friend" -- and a vegetarian who lay long hours in womens' bathing costumes paddling in a river and saying things like: "Be not merely in the river, but become part of it, through its penetration of one's whole being." Power, guilt, pride, love, money, jealousy, honor . . . this little book deals with all the themes that still bedevil fathers and sons today. 5.
