 Martin Ebner's Purchase of HSBC Stake May Be Only First Step for Swiss Investor   By By Margaret Studer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1998  Mr. (Martin) Ebner, who made the investment through his BZ Group Holding AG, bought 0.4% of the banking company's shares. Mr. Ebner's previous financial-services investments had been in Switzerland.  Kurt Schiltknecht, an associate of Mr. Ebner, said the BZ Group considers several other banks outside Switzerland as "potential targets," but he declined to name them. Financial analysts speculate that Mr. Ebner could see opportunities in the restructuring of financial services in Germany by taking a stake in Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG or Dresdner Bank AG.
