 Royal Dutch/Shell Posts 32% Jump In Quarterly Net   By By Bob Hagerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1991  Royal Dutch/Shell Group said net income leaped 32% in dollar terms in the fourth quarter on the strength of higher oil prices.  Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of the Anglo-Dutch company's British arm, said oil prices seem likely to weaken once the Persian Gulf war ends, but then rebound to a range of about $17 to $20 a barrel within a few months. Oil has been trading this week at around $17 a barrel, down sharply from the peak of $40 hit briefly last October.  Per-share earnings of Royal Dutch Petroleum, the Dutch arm, were equivalent to $2.63, up from $1.78. For the British arm, Shell Transport & Trading, per-share earnings rose to $1.45 from $1.08.
