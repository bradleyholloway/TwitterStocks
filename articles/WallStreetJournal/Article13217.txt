 Investor's Calendar   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2005  Tepid Job Growth: U.S. payrolls increased by 56,000 jobs in October, showing a recovery from the 8,000-job decrease in September but still well below economists' expectations. Average hourly earnings edged higher, and the unemployment rate went down to 5%.  Round Two to Merck: A New Jersey state-court jury found Merck wasn't liable for the heart attack of an Idaho man who took its Vioxx painkiller. The win follows a multimillion-dollar loss in Texas.  Mixed Results: Time Warner posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit from a year earlier and confirmed talks to sell an AOL stake; UAL reported a record $1.77 billion loss, as bankruptcy expenses offset cost cuts and a shift to more-profitable routes; Viacom swung to a profit as growth in cable and film offset a decline in broadcast TV.
