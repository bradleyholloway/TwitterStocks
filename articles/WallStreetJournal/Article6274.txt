 Spitzer, SEC Open Probes Into Grasso's Pay; NYSE's Former Chief Also Took $10 Million Retirement Payment; Ketchum Comes In on a Mission   By Susanne Craig, Kate Kelly and Deborah Solomon in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 2004  There may be even more problems on the [Dick Grasso] pay front. Yesterday, one former director with knowledge of Mr. Grasso's pay packages said that in 1999, just before renewing his employment agreement, Mr. Grasso took $10 million out of his retirement-savings plan. This amount, which hasn't been previously disclosed, is in addition to the $139.5 million in deferred retirement pay and benefits he already received, and the additional $48 million he agreed to forgo just before his departure. Mr. Grasso's lawyer didn't return a call for comment.  Meanwhile, SEC officials said it isn't yet apparent what, if any, rules or laws were broken. But securities-law experts said the SEC could make a case if it finds that the board awarded the pay package in exchange for favors from Mr. Grasso. Much of the NYSE's board during Mr. Grasso's tenure was composed of executives from big Wall Street firms, which were also members of the NYSE.  That said, such a case could be complicated to prove. SEC attorneys and securities experts said Mr. [Eliot Spitzer]'s office may have more luck bringing a successful case under New York's not-for-profit law. As for the new NYSE chief regulatory officer, the 53-year-old Mr. [Richard Ketchum] joins the exchange from Citigroup Inc., where he had been the general counsel of Citigroup's investment bank. He is a former senior executive of the exchange's archrival, the Nasdaq Stock Market. He will receive $1.2 million in annual compensation, $600,000 of it a base salary and $600,000 an expected bonus.
