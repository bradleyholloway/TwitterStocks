 Style: Ask Teri   By Agins, Teri, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  The short answer is: It depends. We've come a long way from the denim shirts and pleated khakis that were the business-casual uniform dating back to the early 1990s. There is now a wide array of elegant sportswear to choose from, and a versatile wardrobe of jackets with good-looking tops can do double duty at the country club, as well as the office. Long-sleeved shirts in bold shades, bright stripes or subtle patterns look good without a tie. Knitwear doesn't have to look sloppy. Opt for body-conscious turtlenecks, polos and T-shirts in fine gauge knits in silk, rayon or cashmere.
