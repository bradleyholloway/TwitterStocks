 PURSUITS; Books: An Imperial Divergence; To discover why Mexico is not Massachusetts, look to Spain and England   By Ferguson, Niall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  "If [England's] Henry VII had been willing to sponsor Columbus's first voyage," he writes, "and if an expeditionary force of [Englishmen] had conquered Mexico for Henry VIII, it is possible to imagine a . . . massive increase in the wealth of the English crown as growing quantities of American silver flowed into the royal coffers; the development of a coherent imperial strategy to exploit the resources of the New World; the creation of an imperial bureaucracy to govern the settler societies and their subjugated populations; the declining influence of parliament in the national life, and the establishment of an absolutist English monarchy financed by the silver of America."  Finally, both empires experienced crises in the late 18th century. The increased regulation of transatlantic trade and the high cost of the Seven Years War (1756-63) paved the way for colonial revolts. Those that broke out in Britain's American colonies in the 1770s had their counterparts in Peru (Tupac Amaru's Andean Rebellion of 1780-82 and the "Comunero" revolt in New Granada in 1781).  Perhaps my favorite vignette has the Bostonian Samuel Sewall breakfasting with the Massachusetts colony's lieutenant governor on "Venison and Chockolatte": "I said," recalled Sewall, "Massuchuset and Mexico met at His Honour's Table." In truth, they could scarcely have been further apart in both politics and culture than they were at that moment in 1697. But to read Mr. [JOHN ELLIOTT] is to recapture the startling taste of that long-forgotten breakfast -- and to sense that, even then, the venison of the North had the advantage of the chocolate of the South.
