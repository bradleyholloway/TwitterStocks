 Letters to the Editor: Let's Not Stifle New Investment   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1985  U.S. real interest rates, according to Kristol, are high because of the Fed policy of "tight money" over the past three years. On this issue, Kristol is wrong. Real interest rates are determined in the real sector. More specifically, the real interest rate on financial investments is equal to the post-tax return on capital minus some amount that reflects the superior liquidity of financial instruments. Monetary policy does not affect real interest rates, except to the minor extent that it may affect the pre-tax return on capital, the effective tax rate, or the liquidity premium. Moreover, it is very difficult to conclude, as does Kristol, that " . . . one can say with absolute conviction that, over the past three years, the Federal Reserve has exercised too severe a degree of monetary restraint." Over this period, M1 has increased at a 10% annual rate and market interest rates are now lower than in mid-1982.
