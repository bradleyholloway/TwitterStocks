 Brazil Claims Victory Over EU in Sugar Battle   By Scott Miller and Geraldo Samor, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2004  Brazil and the other nations lodged a multipronged attack against the EU. They charged that EU domestic-support subsidies were so high that they covered farmers' fixed costs and allowed them to grow additional sugar at very low cost. Brazil also argued that the EU was exporting more subsidized sugar than allowed under existing export- subsidy agreements. The EU has long said its sugar exports are within permitted limits.  The WTO ruling is likely to give a lift to EU agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler, who last month proposed extensive changes to EU sugar subsidies, including cutting support prices and exports. Mr. Fischler's plan has run into resistance from some members of the 25-nation block, most notably France, which fears the loss of thousands of jobs.
