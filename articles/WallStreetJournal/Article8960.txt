 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1998  CHRYSLER'S DIRECTORS approved a $38.3 billion merger with Daimler, while the German company's management board also ratified the accord. News of the deal boosted their stocks, along with those of several foreign auto makers, as industry executives said the merger could force more combinations in the global auto business. Chrysler shares rose $7.38 to $48.81, a record close.  Citicorp and Travelers named James Dimon president of Citigroup, the company to be created by their pending merger. The move makes Dimon, currently second in command at Travelers, a possible heir apparent.  Eli Lilly said CEO Randall Tobias will retire by year end, and will be succeeded by Sidney Taurel, Lilly's president and chief operating officer.
