 Glasnost in Order on Regional Clashes   By By Paul Wolfowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1989  Amid all the "new thinking" in the Soviet Union, there's a lot of "old policy" on regional conflicts. Some of the same areas that were problems in the '70s -- Afghanistan in particular, where the largest airlift of arms and materiel in Soviet history goes on at the rate of $250 million a month -- remain significant sore points today.  The whole world, including the U.S., applauds Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's condemnation of the war and the secrecy of the decision-making process that brought it about; yet, at the same time, the details of this massive, continuing Soviet military assistance to Afghanistan remain unpublicized in the U.S.S.R. The Soviets and their allies also continue to supply sophisticated military equipment to countries like North Korea, Nicaragua ($500 million a year) and Libya that threaten their neighbors and support international terrorism.  This pattern raises some fundamental questions about the extent to which "new thinking" truly guides the Soviet approach to regional conflicts. Does the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and other countries reflect a recognition that these countries are entitled to governments of their own choosing? Or does it simply reflect a decision to pursue the same ends by less costly and less controversial means?
