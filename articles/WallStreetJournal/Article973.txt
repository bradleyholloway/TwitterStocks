 Frenetic Pace of Campaigning and Risk Taking Leads to Fears of Another Round of Air Scares   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1987  Four years ago, most of the major presidential contenders ran into air-safety problems serious enough to give Secret Service agents sweaty palms. Walter Mondale's jet skidded sideways down a runway. John Glenn's plane nearly slammed into a control tower during a blizzard. An engine on Gary Hart's plane burst into flames during flight. Jesse Jackson's plane was buffeted so violently by heavy winds that passengers got sick.  As the political barnstorming accelerates for 1988, some campaign veterans fear there will be another round of air scares. "I have this queasy feeling in my stomach that because of the frenetic pace, and the tremendous pressures to reach places, even through blizzards, that sooner or later a campaign plane is going to run into serious trouble or go down," says Patricia O'Brien, a former political correspondent for Knight-Ridder Newspapers and former press secretary for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, one of six Democratic presidential candidates.  "I think if your safety is endangered you ought to act on it," says Clark Hoyt, Washington bureau chief for Knight-Ridder Newspapers. "Someone shouldn't be risking his or her life to cover the presidential campaign." In 1972, Mr. Hoyt and another reporter assigned to the presidential campaign of the late Sen. Henry Jackson refused to get on a charter plane that was leaking a steady stream of oil.
