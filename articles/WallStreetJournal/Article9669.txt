 Europol's Antiterror Role Muted by Limited Powers   By Shishkin, Philip, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2004  After Sept. 11, the U.S. also scrambled to unify its counterterror efforts by improving information-sharing among its various federal and state agencies and creating the Homeland Security Department. Europol's task, however, is tougher because it must navigate a maze of 15 sovereign countries. Europol can't even launch its own operations, but always must seek approval from the 15 governments. "That is what the founding fathers of the European Union wanted," says Cyrille Fijnaut, a professor of international criminal law at the University of Leuven in Belgium. "A move toward giving Europol executive powers is far away because it presupposes a federal makeover of the union, and that is still unacceptable."  A former Europol official recalls constantly asking national counterterrorism investigators for data and frequently being refused, because of the sensitivity of intelligence sources and concerns about leaks. Particularly difficult is real-time access to address books and names of terror suspects obtained by national investigators, both key elements for spotting pan-European terror networks. "At the moment, it's very difficult to detect a new network because Europol doesn't receive all the necessary information," the former official says. Even inside Europol, access to data files is limited to a small group of analysts, cutting out other experienced investigators and national liaison officers posted to the agency.
