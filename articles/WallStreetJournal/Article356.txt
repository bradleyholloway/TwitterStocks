 Letters to the Editor: Future Masters of the Universe Preschool   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2002  The most disturbing element of this story is not the arrogance and selfishness of one [Jack Grubman], but the thought that we are witness to one man's disrobing where so many of others have escaped with their privacy and dignity preserved. Is it an isolated incident of capitalism's excess, or, rather, business as usual at the 92nd Street Y and every other business entity where demand exceeds supply? Is the 92nd Street Y to blame, Jack Grubman and his ilk, someone, no one, everyone?
