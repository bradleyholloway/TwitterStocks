 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 2, 1999  Army and Marine officers grumble that the Air Force oversold air power. Air Force officers say the air campaign is too limited in scope and size, with no ground-troops element. A Capitol Hill military expert agrees, deriding the campaign so far as "Desert Fox Lite" in comparison with last December's airstrikes against Iraq.  Some military officers wrongly claim the Joint Chiefs of Staff warned that a limited air campaign wouldn't succeed. At Senate hearings, only Marine Commandant Krulak expressed doubts. Says one top U.S. diplomat: "I never once in all the discussions" heard the defense secretary's office or the Joint Chiefs "say, 'Bombing won't work without ground troops.'" "We're in it now whether we like it or not," says one Army general.  The GOP may take advantage of a recent court ruling by funneling cash through the Colorado GOP, two Republicans involved in fund raising say. The court ruled that the state party isn't bound by federal limits on "coordinated" spending. Lawyers reason the state GOP now is free to pump unlimited sums into congressional races nationwide.
