 GTE Corp. Scraps Negotiations to Buy Unit of Thorn EMI   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1990  A Thorn spokeswoman said GTE ended the three-month-old negotiations after being unable to reach agreement on sales terms. The Thorn division, valued by analysts at about #350 million ($671.3 million), is a struggling player in a tough market that Thorn was eager to exit. GTE had coveted the Thorn business, the world's fifth largest light-bulb maker, to expand its own, far-bigger world lighting business.
