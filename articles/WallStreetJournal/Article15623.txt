 Vtel Offers the Prospect of Growth Once It Emerges From Transition   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1997  In the five months since Vtel bought Compression Labs, investors have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward the Austin company. But the wait might soon be over.

But, thanks to the acquisition, Vtel is essentially the only game in town at the high end of the market with its PC-based systems.
