 Mellon Bank said ready to leave Mesa lending pool   By Cohen, Laurie P; Hertzberg, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1985  Mellon Bank plans to drop out of Mesa Petroleum Company's 12-bank lending pool. Mellon accounts for about $150 million of Mesa's $1 billion oil and gas credit line, but its departure will not affect Mesa's bid for Unocal Corporation until after that transaction is completed. Three other banks have defected: Security Pacific Corp., Citibank, and Swiss Bank Corp., purportedly because their customers did not want them to finance Mesa's takeover bids. Unocal sued Security Pacific, charging it knowingly made loans to Mesa Partners II, which planned to use the money to buy Unocal shares.
