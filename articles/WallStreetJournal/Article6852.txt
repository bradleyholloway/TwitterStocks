 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Books -- Review: Giving Till It Works   By Riordan, Richard J, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2008  PHILANTHROPCAPITALISM By Matthew Bishop & Michael Green (Bloomsbury, 298 pages, $27) A MONTH ago -- just ahead of the financial crisis -- it was calculated that the Internet, hedge funds and oil, among other sources of income, had resulted in more than 1,000 world-wide billionaires.
