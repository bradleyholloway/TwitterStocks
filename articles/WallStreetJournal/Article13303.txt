 Common Sense: With Right Fed Moves, Investors Should Rethink Cash Positions   By Stewart, James B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2006  After a month in which the market seemed preoccupied with the dreaded prospect of "stagflation" -- little or no economic growth coupled with high inflation -- the Fed's words were reassuring. Economic growth "is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year." In other words, the economy is still growing (which is good), and it's not growing at an unsustainable and inflationary pace (also good). Nor is inflation out of control. "Inflation expectations remain contained," the Fed said. That's good. "Moderation in growth . . . should help to limit inflation pressures over time." Also good. In other words, there's no evidence to support the stagflation pessimists.
