 They Say They Want a Revolution   By Rosen, Gary, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  Marx would fume at the postmodernist gibberish of "Multitude." As Messrs. Hardt and Negri see it, Empire is very different from the imperialism of yore. Today's oppressors rely less on coercion and capital than on the "biopower" with which they dominate every aspect of life, from genetics, finance and security to the ideas and images that form our social world. Under these insidious new techniques of "discipline and control," exploitation is the lot not just of hapless "worker monkeys" and "robot soldiers" but of everyone whom Empire tries to transform into an "obedient social subject."  For Messrs. Hardt and Negri, what the world needs now is, well, love, sweet love: love in a "public and political conception," extending beyond "the claustrophobic confines of the nuclear family." Nor is that all. We must also strive "for the radicalization without reserve of both freedom and equality." And don't forget "absolute" democracy on a global scale: "the rule of everyone by everyone, a democracy without qualifiers, without ifs or buts," through which we someday may be blessed to witness "the very becoming divine of humanity."
