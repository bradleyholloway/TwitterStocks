 Financing Small Business: Venture Funds Sidestep 3rd Quarter's Financial Turmoil   By By Michael Selz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1998  Venture capitalists bet $3.15 billion on 461 small companies during the period, a 2% increase from last year's third quarter, according to VentureOne Corp., a San Francisco research firm. While the growth rate of such funding slowed significantly, it continued to be propelled by a massive pool of capital being held by venture-capital partnerships.  For the quarter, venture capitalists put their money in slightly fewer investments -- 461 compared with 465 -- but boosted the size of the average outlay by 1.5% to $6.8 million, VentureOne says. Venture capitalists continue to bet more money on fewer deals partly to increase the efficiency of their wagering. The trend also reflects companies' greater reliance on venture capitalists for additional rounds of financing that such firms might have obtained previously from public markets. With demand for initial public offerings slumping, venture capitalists are having to "put more money in to sustain more mature companies," says Jean Yaremchuk, VentureOne's research director.  Meanwhile, in a reflection of the weakness in the IPO market, the value of initial stock offerings by companies backed by venture investors fell 25% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.2 billion, while the number of deals fell 50% to 19, VentureOne reports. Companies able to pull off IPOs "were of high quality," Ms. Yaremchuk says. As a result, the median amount the IPOs raised rose 28%, while the median valuation investors gave such firms before going public more than doubled.
