 Congress Clears Funds to Resume Farmer Payments   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1986  Congress sent President Reagan a $1.49 billion supplemental appropriation allowing Commodity Credit Corp. to resume payments to farmers after a disruption this week.  The measure, adopted by voice vote in both houses, will keep the corporation funded at least until Congress returns from the annual Washington-Lincoln recess Feb. 18. But further action will be needed soon after because of the immense cash pressure on the agency.  The latest supplemental measure brings Commodity Credit appropriations for fiscal 1986 to nearly $14.6 billion. But the administration estimates that it will need as much as $21.9 billion before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Part of this increase stems from new requirements moving some income-protection payments to farmers to this fiscal year from fiscal 1987. But even without these funds, the total is twice what the president's budget called for a year ago.
