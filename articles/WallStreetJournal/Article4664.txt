 World Wire [5]  By Compiled by William Mathewson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1990  "Japan needs immediate action, or its economy could be easily destroyed by drug-trafficking," Giuseppe di Gennaro, executive director of the U.N. Fund for Drug Abuse Control, said in Tokyo. The amount of intercepted cocaine smuggled into Japan in the first six months of 1990 was 137 pounds, up from only three pounds in the same period in 1989, Japanese police said.  Brazil's Health Ministry said smoking would be prohibited on domestic airline flights of two hours or less. The new rule will take effect after a public-education campaign by the airlines and the Department of Civilian Aviation, the ministry said. It said it also was considering creating special shuttle flights for smokers. Three months ago, the government approved a package of anti-smoking measures including a ban on cigarette sales to minors and prohibition of cigarette ads on television between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.  North Korea effectively rejected a South Korean proposal to open the Korean border to unrestricted travel for five days next week. By repeating its longstanding demand for the repeal of Seoul's anti-communist national security laws, the North appeared to have squelched any last-minute chance to set in motion the procedures to allow inter-Korean exchanges. The North also imposed two other conditions unlikely to be met by South Korea: that the South allow a North Korean "consolation" team to visit jailed dissidents in the South and that it permit South Korean dissidents to attend a unification rally at the border on Aug. 15.
