 Number of Stocks Doing Vanishing Act Surges Following October Market Crash   By By Priscilla Ann Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1987  Since the October market crash, these vanishing acts have become epidemic. By one count, 138 of the pre-crash Nasdaq listings have disappeared. Some of the companies were acquired, others left for stock-exchange listings and a few changed their name and symbol. But most slid silently away.  "Like a lot of stocks, we were hit on Black Monday," explains Nand Khanna, Univation's chairman, who is filing to get the issue back into Nasdaq trading as quickly as possible. Univation's stock price was driven below three cents in the market collapse. The lowest price quotation a trader can transmit over a Nasdaq terminal is 1/32, or 3.1 cents a share.  Univation disappeared into the dealers' Pink Sheets, which brokers use to quote prices privately among themselves. "We're now back up to seven cents a share," says Mr. Khanna. Thus, Univation, and other stocks that slid below 1/32, may eventually reappear on Nasdaq as quietly as they departed.
