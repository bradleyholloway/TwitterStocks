 Clinton's Pick to Head SBA Is a Champion in the Field --- Bowles Built Successful Bank by Boosting Fortunes of Small Businesses   By By Udayan Gupta, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1993  This week, Erskine Bowles will face congressional confirmation hearings in Washington, D.C., for the post of SBA administrator. Previously, he helped build Bowles Hollowell Conner & Co. into a successful investment bank in the burgeoning Southeast by serving an unglamorous side of American business: smaller, low-technology firms with extensive but often overlooked needs.  Having extensive experience working with small business sets Mr. Bowles apart from recent SBA administrators, whose prior experience has mainly been political. The banker's supporters believe this experience could give Mr. Bowles a significant advantage in handling the problems of small-business owners.  If confirmed, the 47-year-old banker will sell his major stake in the investment firm to his four partners. The 60-employee firm probably will remain the region's pre-eminent investment-banking specialist for small and medium-sized enterprises. The firm derives much of its identity from Mr. Bowles, who left Morgan Stanley & Co. in 1973 to co-found it -- and later persuaded several other New York bankers to join him in Charlotte.
