 SEC to Propose Funds Reveal Their Managers   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1989  Information about fund managers and past performance is clearly vital for investors. But many funds don't routinely publicize it, leaving shareholders and potential investors in the dark.  The SEC tried to force funds to publish the names of portfolio managers three times in the past two decades. But each time -- in 1972, 1982 and again in 1984 -- the plans were scuttled in the face of fierce opposition from the fund industry.  Such fund-manager disclosure "places undue emphasis on the `cult of the personality,' which ignores the actual basis on which funds generally hire advisers," the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, said in a letter to the SEC. That letter refers to a pending proposal that would force such management disclosure only among publicly traded, or "closed-end" funds. But the SEC now wants to extend the disclosure to all funds.
