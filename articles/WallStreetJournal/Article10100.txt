 Dump This House: Unloading Your Property in a Slow Market   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2007  To make matters worse, "prices could be lower a year from now," Mr. [Charles Farrell] warns. "There's also the risk of owning a physical asset. I'm thinking about things like fire, broken pipes, theft."  "If there are 2,000 houses on the market and 200 houses sold last month, that means it's taking 10 months to sell a house," Prof. [Chris Mayer] says. "That's pretty simple math, but nobody ever does it. If you price your house like everybody else, it might take 10 months to sell it."  "The best scenario is that prices fall through the spring and then stabilize," Prof. Mayer says. "But I'm more pessimistic than that. I would sell now."
