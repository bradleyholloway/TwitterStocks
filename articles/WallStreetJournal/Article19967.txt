 Dollar Rises Amid Jobs Data But Gives Back Some Gains   By Norman, Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2006  Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2021, from $1.2098 late Thursday. The dollar was at 118.89 yen from 118.50 yen and 1.2950 Swiss francs from 1.2851 francs. Sterling was at $1.7621 from $1.7802. Against the yen, the single currency was at 142.88 yen compared with 143.34 yen.  Mr. [Steven Englander] said it is still a very "yield hungry market," and if Treasury yields were to rise in coming weeks because of price pressures, U.S. and foreign investors would be enticed by the higher premium.  Barclays remains dollar bearish for 2006, but Mr. Englander said "it's certainly becoming a risk" that the dollar could enjoy protracted strength if inflationary pressures persist.
