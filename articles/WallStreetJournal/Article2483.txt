 Senator Gridlock or the Consummate Legislator? GOP Leader Dole Tries to Have It Both Ways   By By John Harwood and Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1993  The talks soon collapsed. But after GOP Finance Committee member John Danforth went ahead on his own to draft a compromise with Democrat David Boren, Mr. Dole went on television and the Senate floor yesterday to praise their effort as "moving in the right direction."  Mr. Dole's reversal underscores his often contradictory roles now that he's no longer forced to carry water for Republican presidents. As the national GOP leader and a potential 1996 presidential candidate, he faces strong pressures from his right flank to battle Mr. Clinton at every turn. Yet as a consummate legislator, he's still eager to help shape policy even with a Democrat in the White House.  For the 69-year-old Kansan, decision-time may be nearing. Having already engineered the demise of Mr. Clinton's economic stimulus proposal, he nonetheless still holds out hope that he can bring a majority of Republicans along behind some sort of compromise with the administration on health care. But already, Senate GOP conservatives have splintered off from the task force Mr. Dole appointed to craft a Republican alternative; the conservatives seek to sharpen the contrast with Mr. Clinton by relying on a free-market approach.
