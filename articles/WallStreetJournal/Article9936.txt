 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: Mugs on Mugs   By Schorr, Melissa, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2006  Snapfish's Web site had a good array of editing choices, but it also had the image printed opposite from the handle. (On the placement, a Kodak spokeswoman says it's printed that way to allow others to see the photo while you drink, while Snapfish general manager Ben Nelson says, "It is rare for anyone to say, 'I really wanted the photo somewhere else.'")  The mug from PhotoWorks placed the photo next to the handle, for easy viewing. (Assuming you're right-handed, that is. For lefties, only Sony's ImageStation offers a template to place the photo on the opposite side.) Though the image looked good enough, Mr. [Rob Resing] thought the black and white photo had a bit of a purple tint to it -- and while every black and white image will have a tint, he said that warmer tones, closer to red or orange, tend to look more appealing than cooler tones. We were also disappointed that the site didn't offer clear guidance on photo-resolution requirements, and the mug arrived several days later than promised, due to a production glitch.  STORE/PRICE/PHONE: Kodak EasyShare Gallery 15 oz. photo mug $14.99 800-360-9098 kodakgallery.com QUALITY: Site didn't have as many editing effects as the others, and image, printed on the opposite side of the handle, was crooked.

PHONE/WEB EXPERIENCE: Other mugs are available, on this and other sites. Kodak has one "magic" model: The image appears when you pour hot liquid in it. COMMENT: Handwashing is recommended for this mug. On the crooked image, a spokeswoman says Kodak will replace any products with errors.
