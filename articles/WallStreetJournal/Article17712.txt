 Senate, Ignoring President's Personal Plea, Overrides Veto of $87.5 Billion Highway Bill by Vote of 67-33 --- Ballot Viewed as Watermark In Receding Authority Of Reagan White House   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Ellen Hume, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1987  The president heightened the stakes of the veto-override vote by rejecting the concerns of some of his advisers and journeying to Capitol Hill yesterday morning to urge 13 members of his own party to switch their votes and support his veto. When the roll was called early in the afternoon, none had changed their minds, and the president's position was rejected by a vote of 67-33, exactly the two-thirds margin necessary to override.  Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas told the president that the odds were "10-to-1 or even greater that it (the visit to the hill) wouldn't change anything," and that the odds might be as high as 100-to-1. Sen. Dole then checked with a few Republican leaders about the wisdom of the president's visit. They agreed that the vote would be "an uphill fight," but said the president should come if he wanted, in order to show his gutsiness.  Republicans tried to put a good face on the override vote by saying that at least the president proved he was a hands-on chief involved in the operation of government. After the vote, Sen. Dole asserted that the president had shown his serious intent to fight "budget-busting" measures, and his presidency would benefit from this aggressiveness.
