 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; Hunting for Returns: Picking a Rocket Ship Carefully; On a Wild Bond Ride, Many Scared Investors Quit With Bad Timing   By Pollock, Michael A, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  Investors have little patience for investments that don't do well. According to numbers from AMG Data Services, of Arcata, Calif., many exited bond funds by early summer. Their timing couldn't have been worse. Inflation fears eased in August as energy prices fell, sparking a big rally in bonds. Some funds then saw big inflows -- too late for the year's best gains.  "Trying to time any market isn't a good game to play, but folks do it anyway," says Brian White, a mutual-fund specialist at brokerage Ryan Beck & Co., of New York. "We preach a long-term approach."  It is also important to understand what bonds can and can't do. Having some money in bonds can reduce volatility in a diversified portfolio. But bond gains will lag behind those of stocks in a strong stock market. "Bonds that are yielding 4.5% can't deliver double-digit returns," says Mary Miller, head of fixed-income investments at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.
