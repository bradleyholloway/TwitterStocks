 Reality: TV by Cellphone   By Fuscaldo, Donna, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2005  "People are really looking at entertainment in very broad ways," said Peter Skarzynski, a senior vice president at Samsung Electronics Co.'s Samsung Telecommunications America. "It's just not going home and sitting in front of your TV. It's TV on the go."  According to market research firm Strategy Analytics, TV cellphones will make up 1.8% of the world-wide handset market in 2007. That is expected to increase to 5% by 2009. "I don't think users are crying out for it yet. I think manufacturers and developers are saying, 'Yeah, we can do this,' " said Stuart Robinson, an analyst at Strategy Analytics.  "There's been a taste of a lot of this technology already on the market in the form of video, imaging, gaming and audio," said Charles MacFarlane, a technical marketing manager at Philips. "The biggest 'wow' factor is one chip can do all the different technologies."
