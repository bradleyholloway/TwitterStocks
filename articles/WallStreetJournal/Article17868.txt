 Dukakis Releases Medical Records To Dispel Rumors   By By Ellen Hume, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1988  Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis released medical data to refute unsubstantiated rumors about a previous illness, after a remark yesterday by President Reagan highlighted the issue.  At a news conference in Boston last night, Mr. Dukakis's physician released medical information and answered reporters' questions to dispel the rumors, which have been circulating in conservative circles and in leaflets distributed by followers of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche.  Dr. Gerald R. Plotkin, who has treated the Massachusetts governor since 1971, declared: "He has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and has been in excellent health." He gave a history of Mr. Dukakis's minor aches and pains, colds, a pulled tendon, his hay fever allergy, and his hoarseness in 1981 from giving speeches.
