 Gore Runs Neck and Neck With Bush, Trails McCain in General-Election Poll   By By Gerald F. Seib and Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2000  Republican challenger John McCain prevails by a small margin, 46% to 41%, when matched up against Mr. [Al] Gore. That lends some support to one of the remaining arguments Mr. McCain offers for his candidacy: That he could be a stronger general-election candidate than would Mr. [George W.] Bush. The national survey of 1,231 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.  Still, Mr. McCain's popularity among political independents and Democrats isn't yet translating to core GOP voters, and there is a growing sense that today's primaries will set the stage for a Gore-Bush general-election contest in the fall. The new poll supports that notion. On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore appears set to vanquish challenger Bill Bradley, and the survey shows Mr. Gore with commanding leads among Democrats from every region and nearly all segments of the party.
