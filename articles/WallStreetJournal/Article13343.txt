 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; The Dimensions of a Pioneering Strategy; Two Classmates Paired To Test Academic Ideas; Investors' 'Boot Camp'   By Ossinger, Joanna L, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2006  In an interview, Mr. [John Bogle] says he has "great respect" for Dimensional, calling its approach "a good plan." But it isn't "a perfect plan" because "those kinds of advantages [for small and value] don't prevail [over the long term]. . . . Markets are great arbitrageurs" and will correct imbalances.  The pair focused on a fund that would own shares of tiny companies. By then, Mr. [David Booth] says, S&P 500 funds "had gotten to be reasonably popular." (Vanguard's flagship fund for the masses opened in 1976.) The two former classmates observed that "institutional investors weren't holding stocks of small companies in a meaningful way," so their microcap fund was "initially a diversification argument," Mr. Booth says.  They believe an advantage they hold over index-based funds is that they don't rush to buy or sell when an index kicks a company out of the lineup and adds a new one. Mr. [French] says Dimensional has about 300 stocks it plans to buy. The traders react "to what's available in the marketplace," he says. "We sit around and wait to see what's there. . . . Frankly, it's just fun to be able to tackle the problem in a way that you know you can add value."
