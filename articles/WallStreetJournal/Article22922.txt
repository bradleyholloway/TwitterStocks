 Strike Averted, Baseball Teams Try to Woo Fans   By By Sam Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2002  ARRIVING AT the ballpark Friday just hours after baseball settled its labor dispute, Houston fan Charlie Singletary saw something new: Astros pitcher Octavio Dotel standing at the turnstiles in full uniform. "Thank you for coming," said Mr. Dotel, who shook hands for about 20 minutes before the game.  For years, baseball teams were considered marketing pioneers, largely because they had so many tickets to sell. But ever since the National Football League and National Basketball Association began to command giant national television contracts and set up marketing staffs at the central office, baseball's local approach has started to look pokey by comparison. The result: While other sports churn out slick ad campaigns with celebrities, produce television shows and turn special events like the Super Bowl into marketing extravaganzas, baseball's profile among some important fan groups continues to slide. Among the glaring problems, Mr. [Dean Bonham] says: the sport's failure to tap into a burgeoning Hispanic market. "Much more needs to be done," he says.  As for Mr. Singletary, he believes the Astros made a good start by stationing 15 players at the gates before Friday's game. It also helped, he says, that the team staged the largest fireworks display in ballpark history the same night. "The kids had a phenomenal time," says Mr. Singletary, who attends about five games a year but has never met a player up close. "They ought to be standing out there every night."
