 Deals & Deal Makers: IPOs Defy Assumptions, Keep Soaring   By By Raymond Hennessey, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2000  That theory, like so many others on Wall Street, hasn't panned out. In a fairly volatile Nasdaq environment, initial public offerings continue to soar. Through last week the average IPO in 2000 was up 131% in after-market trading, according to figures from Thomson Financial Securities Data. Most of those gains reflect first-day pops from the offering price. The Nasdaq, while ending at a record Friday, has a 4.3% year-to-date gain.  There are two main reasons for this phenomenon. For one thing, many hot IPOs tend to come from two sectors nowadays: communications and Internet infrastructure. In both areas, investors "continue to buy on promise and potential," said Irv DeGraw, research director at WorldFinanceNet.com in Sarasota, Fla.  Recent data-traffic figures, mentioned in the prospectus for one of last week's hottest offerings -- for fiber-optics-equipment maker Avanex Corp. of Fremont, Calif., which opened 386% ahead of its $36 offering price -- are one of the reasons investors continue to believe in the potential, Mr. DeGraw said. Telecommunications market-research firm Ryan Hankin Kent Inc. estimated that Internet traffic, which stood at 350,000 terabytes, or trillions of bytes, per month at the end of 1999, will rise to 15 million terabytes per month in 2003.
