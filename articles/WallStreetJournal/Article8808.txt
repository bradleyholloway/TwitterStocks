 NBA Pay Doesn't Always Add Up to Performance --- Our Dollar-Wise Index Shows Why Dominique Wilkins Is a Better Buy Than the Big Shots   By By Stefan Fatsis and Allen Barra, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1997  First, we asked our computer, Mad Max, to take his measurement of all-around per-game player performance, Max Points. (See "Max Factors.") To be sure, the All-Stars in Cleveland rate well. Through the first half of the 1996-97 season, the first-name syndrome rules: Shaq, Karl, Charles, Michael and Hakeem, in that order, sport the gaudiest Max Points ratings.  But is Mr. O'Neal's dollar-for-dollar on-court performance statistically worth the $10,714,286 the Los Angeles Lakers are paying him this season? Max Points don't reflect which players give their teams the best dollar value on the hardwood. So we devised The Wall Street Journal Max-a-Million Index, which divides a player's Max Points by his 1996-97 salary in millions of dollars.  We concede this isn't an entirely fair measurement. The league's best players appear to be lousy investments. Why? Because the gap between the top salaries and the rest of the pack far outstrips the possible statistical gap; the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan can make 15 times more than the league average but even His Airness can't put up 15 times the stats of the average player. So Shaq's 43.2 Max Points divided by his $10.7 million salary yields a Max-a-Million rating of just 4.0. Even more dramatically, Mr. Jordan (36.8 Max Points, $30.14 million) registers a microscopic 1.2 Max-a-Million rating, placing him dead last in our rating of the NBA's top 120 players.
