 Finding Out How Your Car Will Hold Up in a Crash   By Parker-Pope, Tara, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  I've been checking out minivans, and was surprised to see that the Hyundai Entourage and Kia Sedona were the only two top IIHS picks in the category. The site ranks cars as good, acceptable, marginal or poor in various tests. I searched the Honda Odyssey, which posted "good" scores for front and side crash tests, but make sure you hit the "compare" button at the bottom, which lets you compare a car with others in its class. The Odyssey only scored "marginal" on rear crash tests. The Toyota Sienna and Nissan Quest, received poor rankings in rear tests.  Another feature allows you to click on Front, Side or Rear to look at even more detailed crash test analysis. The Nissan Quest and Ford Freestar both had a "good" overall score on front crashes, but scored only "acceptable" for head and neck injuries. The Odyssey had a good overall score for side impact, but rear passenger safety in a side impact was only "acceptable" for torso injuries.
