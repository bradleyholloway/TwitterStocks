 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Books: Prophet With the Voice of Gold   By Grant, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2006  "God grant that I may use it wisely," prayed [WILLIAM JENNINGS Bryan] as he realized the power of his own speaking voice. On the authority of Mary, his whiney wife, Bryan's voice carried for three city blocks. He earned $2,000 a week on the summertime Chautauqua circuit, holding forth on religious and political topics to small-town audiences across America. "He invested nearly all of it in government bonds and real estate," Mr. [Michael Kazin] relates of these plutocratic honoraria. "Speculating in the stock market was, of course, out of the question."  Bryan, and everybody else in turn-of-the-century America, was paid in dollars as good as gold; you could exchange $20.67 for an ounce of bullion (now an ounce will set you back by $570). Bryan hated hard money. How much better, he mused, if the "producing classes" could discharge their debts in the cheaper, more inflation-prone paper kind. "Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world," he famously thundered at the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, "supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." After the crazed delegates regained their composure, Gov. John Altgeld of Illinois turned to his friend Clarence Darrow and said: "I have been thinking over Bryan's speech. What did he say, anyhow?"
