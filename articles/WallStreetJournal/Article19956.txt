 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Hit and Miss: Mutual-Fund Manager Looks for Staying Power; Jensen's Bob Millen Scores By Picking McGraw-Hill; Sends Bud Back to the Bar   By Vuocolo, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2006  Jensen's criteria give Mr. [BOB MILLEN], who turns 59 years old later this month, and his team only about 170 companies to choose from. They winnow down that universe to a working list of 50 -- and then buy, and mostly hold, exactly 25 stocks from that group. Endless debate about the wisdom of holding a small number of stocks versus diversifying over a great many shares aside, the number of stocks in Jensen is small enough that Mr. Millen can meet with management of the companies whose shares his fund holds.  Jensen's focus is long-term, and investors interested in the fund also need to have a long horizon: The fund's most recent one- and three-year records are near the bottom of fund tracker Morningstar's performance data, but Jensen ranks near the top in five- and 10-year snapshots. By definition, the fund's performance is less volatile than those that buy newer stocks, and Jensen often bests the field in down years. The fund lost a little more than 1% in 2005, compared with a 3% gain by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.  WHY HE BOUGHT IT: Mr. Millen says McGraw-Hill is a brand leader in both the educational and financial-services markets, including businesses such as BusinessWeek magazine and McGraw-Hill Education, and has strong management. He also was looking for the company's financial branch, which includes ratings service and financial-data giant Standard & Poor's Corp. to benefit from developing debt markets in countries like Brazil and India.
