 SHOP TALK: Work for Ivan, Ask for Trouble   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1985  Why did Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the prestigious Wall Street law firm, ever represent the arbitrager Ivan Boesky, potential arch rival of many of its blue-chip corporate clients? That's a question a lot of lawyers are asking these days.  The problem is that Cravath has long represented CBS, most recently in its libel battle with retired Gen. William Westmoreland. And, it now turns out, the firm has also done some $300,000 of legal work for Mr. Boesky, who last month bought an 8.7% stake in CBS. When the network sued Mr. Boesky in federal court for failing to disclose attempts to coerce the company into buying back CBS shares, Mr. Boesky's regular law firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, moved to have Cravath disqualified because of an alleged conflict of interest. That motion is pending.  A lawyer at another Wall Street firm said he found it "quite peculiar" that Cravath would risk "obvious conflict-of-interest problems" by representing Mr. Boesky. He said his firm had declined to represent the arbitrager on several occasions for just that reason.
