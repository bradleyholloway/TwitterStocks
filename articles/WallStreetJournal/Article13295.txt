 Quest Software Will Restate Results After Options Probe   By Levitz, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2006  Quest, an Aliso Viejo, Calif., maker of software to help companies manage databases, said a special committee of independent directors found that "administrative approvals" required for many of the company's stock-option grants from fall 1999 into 2002 were "actually obtained subsequent to the measurement dates used for financial reporting purposes." That language suggests the options were backdated, since the measurement date for financial reporting is the date the option becomes effective.  Opsware said Ms. [Sharlene Abrams]'s issues at Mercury relate to practices at Mercury including those "involving the timing of stock-option grants." Ms. Abrams didn't return a message seeking comment, and an Opsware spokesman said she wouldn't be available.  The SEC's contemplated charges against Ms. Abrams don't involve Opsware or Ms. Abrams's actions at the company, Opsware said. Opsware "reviewed this matter and does not intend to make any change to Ms. Abrams' status as CFO at this time," Opsware said in a statement.
