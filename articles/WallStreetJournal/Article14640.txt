Details of the criminal probe into the activities of division were reported by the Wichita Eagle Beacon; the existence of the investigation was confirmed independently by this newspaper.  The government, according to the Eagle Beacon, contends Boeing overcharged the Air Force $11 million in the past decade on contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the KC-135. The newspaper quoted Defense Department sources as alleging the Boeing division improperly charged the government as much as 13% more for aluminum than the division was paying its suppliers.
