 Meadow Physics: We Test Spring Seed Mixes --- Some Prefab Pastures Don't Make Your Garden Grow; Still Just `a 50-50 Chance'   By By Eileen White Read, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2000  That was Shirley Kerins's conclusion after she tried to create an "instant" flower meadow in her Altadena, Calif., yard with a premixed package of wildflower seeds. "The plants all came up at different times, so I never got that lovely tapestry of color," she says.  Ms. Kerins admits she should have known better: She manages plant production at the 200-acre Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif. Yet she's hardly alone in buying instant seed mix as a quick garden fix. About 6.1 million American gardeners bought wildflower seeds in 1998, a 42% increase since 1993, according to the National Gardening Association. Especially popular are prefab meadows on a mat -- blends of different seeds embedded in a roll of biodegradable fiber that you roll out like a carpet. With the approach of spring, companies that make premixed seeds and meadow mats are reporting strong sales.  Still, a 50-50 chance didn't seem like bad odds to Weekend Journal during a frigid February day last year, when we slipped into a Southern California garden boutique and were dazzled by the labels on meadow mats and canisters of wildflower seed mixes. One $18 meadow mat boasted 10,000 seeds; we figured if just half of those grew and blossomed, we'd have the beginnings of a beautiful garden. So we decided to conduct a backyard horticultural test.
