 Taiwan Defends Moves to Support Stock Market, But Critics Argue Prices Should Adjust Freely   By By Russell Flannery, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2000  Yet tension with China hasn't been high recently. Instead, industry executives say, concerns about the direction of tax, infrastructure and other policies under Taiwan's new government have played a big role in driving share prices lower. The island's stocks also have been falling on worries about declines in the technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market in the U.S. and the outlook for profits at the island's own high-tech companies.  State intervention in Taiwan's stock market isn't new. Government-backed funds regularly support prices when Beijing engages in saber rattling. The public largely supports the moves as a reasonable umbrella for small investors. Because state-owned companies still play a large role in key Taiwan industries such as finance, telecommunications and petroleum, many here have a paternalistic view of the government's role in the economy.  In TOKYO, the Nikkei 225 index fell 391.75 points, or 2.4%, to 15814.44, taking its cue from sharp selling in the Nasdaq Composite Wednesday. Technology stocks were mostly lower. Tokyo Electron fell 780 yen to 12,420 yen, despite its announcement Wednesday that it now expects stronger-than-expected demand for semiconductor-making equipment to boost consolidated revenue and profit to record highs for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2001. Fujitsu declined 100 yen to 2,890 yen after announcing late Wednesday that its e-commerce software solutions unit, ICL, has suspended its planned float on the London Stock Exchange indefinitely due to volatility in the information-technology industry and the company's poor financial performance.
