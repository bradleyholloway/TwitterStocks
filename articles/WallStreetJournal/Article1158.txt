 Encore (A Special Report); Profiles In Retirement   By Essick, Kristi, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2007  "We wouldn't come back to the Bay area for anything," Mr. [BILL RUMFORD] says. "Here, there are no memos, staff meetings or board meetings. It's been a complete change of life for us, and we are very happy."  "I didn't want to stay in the middle of the Snow Belt and the high- tax belt," Mr. [Gordon Black] says laughing. Looking for sun and a place where his windfall would go further, he settled on the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. "I came down here because it's gorgeous, but it also happens to have an attractive tax situation, so I immediately started thinking of setting up a new company."  "Sometimes I can't believe I'm doing this," she adds, "because I'm living a dream." She notes that she spends hours in her studio almost every day. "When you get older, there are so many things you have to stop doing. But in my art, things are opening up for me rather than closing down."
