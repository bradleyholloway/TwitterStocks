 Theater: Sondheim Meets Pirandello   By By Donald Lyons, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1998  The premise of the musical is that, on the eve of the destruction of the Follies Theater where they shone some 30 years before -- in the early 1940s -- a gaggle of (mainly) female vaudeville stars are gathering to review their old stomping grounds, to renew old acquaintance and to rue misspent lives. In the fantasy-within-fantasy world that Mr. Johanson has conjured up on the big, glitzy Paper Mill stage, the old stars are mostly played by actual old stars; Sondheim's nostalgic veterans are incarnated by veterans with rich careers of their own.  Vaudevillian Solange, now a perfume spokeswoman, tells us about her travels in "Ah, Paris"; Liliane Montevecchi, star of Broadway's "Nine" sells the song with oomph and a red boa. Rialto veteran Hattie looks back over her career knocks ("making the rounds all afternoon, eating in a greasy spoon"); gruff Kaye Ballard, a star of musicals since "The Golden Apple" in 1955, puts it over with authentic grit. Diva Carlotta has suffered the slings and arrows of Hollywood fame but insists that "I'm Still Here"; lovable, blue-clad tapper Ann Miller, who was the sunshine in Golden Age MGM musicals like "On the Town" and "Kiss Me Kate," gives the song special warmth, even though once-trendy lyrics as "been called a pinko and even a commie" sound odd on her crimson but apolitical lips. Glamorous Phyllis Newman leads a chorus of 12 women, six representing the earlier selves of the others and surprised to discover what they will become in 30 years. As often in "Follies," Mr. Sondheim here seems to pale before -- to turn away in disgust from -- the facts of aging, particularly in women. Yes, yes, one wants to say, people get old, women get old, even women in show business get old. Get over it.
