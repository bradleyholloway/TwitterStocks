 Monthly Mutual Funds Review: For Most of the Big Fund Companies, The Name of Their Game Is Retain --- The Critical Mission Now Is To Cut Down the Changes In Investor Portfolios   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2000  UNIONDALE, N.Y. -- For six years, database-marketing guru Prasanna Dhore worked at Time Warner trying to convince magazine readers not to let their subscriptions run out. More recently, Dreyfus hired him for a new challenge -- discouraging investors from shifting money out of their Dreyfus mutual funds.  All of the stress on retention is a big change from before Mr. Dhore joined Dreyfus in 1996. In the new senior vice president's first months on the job, Dreyfus Chief Executive Officer Christopher "Kip" Condron wanted to slash the firm's relatively high stock-fund redemption rate of 17% of assets a year. "Dreyfus used to advertise and then wait for the phone to ring," Mr. Dhore recalls his boss telling him about asset-gathering in the past. "Now, we need to call them," Mr. Condron instructed Mr. Dhore.  Mr. Dhore says his customer-retention methods are closely scrutinized by Mellon's chief privacy official, Enid Miller, who continuously monitors the data-miner's latest dig. "She's very strict," says Mr. Dhore. "Like my worst nightmare," he adds jokingly. Ms. Miller and Mr. Dhore meet a few times a month and discuss any new data that the group is collecting. Ms. Miller also makes sure investors' private information doesn't leak out to other parts of the firm.
