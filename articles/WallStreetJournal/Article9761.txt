 Scrushy Seeks HealthSouth Data   By Dan Morse and Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  Mr. [Richard M. Scrushy]'s defense is expected to contend that he wasn't aware of the fraud, among other things. If Mr. Scrushy can get access to profit and loss statements for more than 60 HealthSouth facilities over an eight-year period, as his attorneys are seeking, he could claim to the jury that he couldn't possibly keep up with all the financial details. The requested documents include personnel records of 33 former or current HealthSouth employees. Among the former employees are William T. Owens and Weston L. Smith, former chief financial officers at HealthSouth who have pleaded guilty to federal criminal-fraud charges.
