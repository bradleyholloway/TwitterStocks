 Ex-Engineer Wins With Bets In Technology --- Thayer Capital's Rickertsen Takes Optimistic View Of Long-Term Returns   By Burns, Johnathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2001  For Mr. [Rick Rickertsen], it happened in a clinically cleaned and scrubbed lab at the storage products division of International Business Machines Corp., where the white-coated technicians flittered about making aesthetically beautiful but unromantic, large discs.  The firm, which specializes in buyouts, has 19 portfolio companies, eight of which are "realized" -- now publicly traded or sold. On the realized companies, [Thayer]'s return on capital is more than 74%. That includes bulletin-board traded Aegis Communications Group Inc., Classic Vacation Group Inc., ePlus Inc. and SAGA Systems Inc., which Thayer sold back to parent company Software AG after helping fund a 1997 management buyout.  As a venture capitalist, you have to stick to what you know. At Thayer, Mr. Rickertsen and founder Fred Malek stayed the course despite the dot-com mania.
