 Lose Weight! Get a Free Massage! The Perks of Becoming a Lab Rat   By By Tara Parker-Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2003  The range of benefits on offer may come as a surprise given the common belief that clinical trials are for desperate patients seeking experimental therapies. But clinical trials represent a remarkable opportunity for the rest of us to gain access to top doctors and care that might not otherwise be available.  To be sure, any patient thinking about taking part in a clinical trial needs to assess the risk of the study and the credibility of the researchers involved. Participants in trials should be given detailed informed-consent statements and have the opportunity to ask as many questions as they like. Credible research studies are conducted in obvious health-care or university settings. Any trial that uses experimental treatments, drugs or seems to carry even a minimal risk should be vetted by a trusted health professional who doesn't have a personal stake in the research.  Another downside is that patients who sign up for clinical research may end up in the control group, meaning they get the basic health evaluation and access to top doctors, but they won't always get all the perks of the trial. In addition, clinical trials may also require a bigger time commitment than traditional care, so researchers can get all their questions answered, notes Stephanie O'Malley, Yale University psychiatry professor, who conducts stop-smoking and alcohol-dependency research.
