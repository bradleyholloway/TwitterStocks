 In the Fray: An Inflated, Ossified Memorial   By Catesby Leigh, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2008  (The stone will retain a "natural" finish to the height of King's trousers, which morph into broad geometric planes in the current sculptural design; the transition to a fully sculpted finish takes place between the hem of his suit jacket and the pocket above.) A skillful portrait could rescue the concept from banality, but very few contemporary artists grasp the monumental approach required here. Nor did it require that a full-scale model of the Stone face with the King relief, cast in a lightweight material like epoxy resin, be erected on the memorial site for review.
