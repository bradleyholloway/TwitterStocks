 Cingular Posts Mixed Results   By Nuzum, Christine, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2004  Analysts said the results cause concern about the $41 billion merger between Cingular and AT&T Wireless. "Only AT&T Wireless and its pending merger partner Cingular are national wireless carriers posting [revenue per user] declines," wrote Jefferies & Co. analyst Richard Klugman. He sees the merger heightening these problems. "Both companies have been losing market share . . . combine them, they will lose market share faster."
