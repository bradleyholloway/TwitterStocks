 Show of Hands: In Drive to Unionize, Casino Dealers Defy A Las Vegas Tradition --- Their Old Bosses Took Care Of Them; Then, Sin City Became a Corporate Town --- Less `Juice' and Fewer `Tokes'   By By Christina Binkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  Now, some Las Vegas dealers, frustrated by low pay and a lack of job security, are waging a high-stakes campaign to unionize their profession. So far, the results have been mixed. Since the campaign began last fall, dealers at three casinos have voted to organize, opening the door to chartering a union local. Dealers at seven casinos have rejected the union. Elections are scheduled this weekend at one more casino -- MGM Mirage's Treasure Island -- and dealers and labor organizers are busy at others gathering petitions for a vote.  It wasn't just the fear of dealers striking that made casinos so intent on controlling them directly. The compromise assured casinos that they could continue to hire, fire and reassign dealers as they liked in the lightning-fast world of gambling. Some casinos, for example, consider certain dealers lucky for the house and try to slip them into games with customers who are on a hot streak. "You cannot have to go to the union and ask for permission every time you want to move dealers around," says Henri Lewin, who ran the Las Vegas Hilton, Flamingo and Sands casinos in the '70s and '80s.  For much of Las Vegas's history, dealers held a special place in town. They tracked the bets and kept a sharp eye out for cheats. Good dealers knew the big players and kept them gambling. In turn, casino managers took care of the dealers. Bosses showered them with such perks as special parking spots and private dining rooms.
