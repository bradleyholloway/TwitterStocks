 Cablevision Gains Control of Home To the Rockettes   By By Leslie Cauley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1997  Cablevision Systems Corp. acquired Radio City Productions, which operates Radio City Music Hall, from Rockefeller Group Inc. in twin deals together valued at about $400 million, with plans to spend another $25 million to turn the New York landmark into a digital-TV production center.  The Woodbury, N.Y.-based cable operator also signed a 25-year lease for Radio City Music Hall, leaving it with a virtual lock on the venerable theater and all of its operations, including the famed Rockettes and their annual Christmas show, for the next quarter-century. Both transactions, which were announced yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, were handled through Cablevision's Madison Square Garden subsidiary, which operates the New York icon of the same name.
