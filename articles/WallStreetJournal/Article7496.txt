 White's Directors Reject Electrolux's $711 Million Offer   By By Ralph E. Winter, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1986  White Consolidated Industries Inc. rejected as inadequate a $45-a-share, or $711 million, takeover offer from AB Electrolux, and said it will explore alternatives to the bid.  The board decided that if White were to agree to be bought, "more than $45 per share should be obtainable for stockholders." Electrolux, the big Swedish appliance maker that owns Tappan Co., Mansfield, Ohio, made the tender offer for White's 15.8 million shares Monday.
