 Health Crisis: Chinese Doctors Tell Patients To Pay Upfront, or No Treatment; Parents of Boy With Leukemia Scramble for Cash to Cover New Chemotherapy Round; Threat Seen to Social Stability   By Browne, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2005  Xie Jing, the chief doctor responsible for [Dejie]'s ward, defends her hospital's insistence that patients pay for treatment ahead of time by putting money into a hospital-controlled account. "If the patients have no money to refill their hospital accounts, we have to stop giving them medical treatment," she says. "It's a national problem."  The hospital's Dr. Xie says doctors' income would be affected if they don't "push patients hard enough" to settle their bills. "Nowadays, doctors don't just treat patients. They've also got to chase for payment," she says.  The next day, Mr. [Cui] made the long road trip to Beijing and stood meekly by his wife as one of the doctors scolded them for getting behind on their payments. "We warned you about this at the very beginning," the doctor said, barely glancing up as her fingers tapped out a message on her mobile phone. "Now you've lost all your money and you'll lose the boy too." Mr. Cui stared down at his feet. His wife said nothing, but her eyes filled with tears.
