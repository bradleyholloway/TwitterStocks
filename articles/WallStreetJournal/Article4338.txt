 Mexico Plans To Buy Stocks To Aid Market --- Price Plunge of 50% Triggers Steps to Add Liquidity With Banks, Brokerages   By By Matt Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1987  The Mexican government is working with a group of banks and brokerages to prepare an investment package that would inject liquidity into the sagging local stock market, brokerage officials said.  The Mexican market was the fastest-growing in the world during 1987's first nine months, rising 330%. But it has plummeted about 50% in the three weeks since the plunge in world stock prices began last month. The crash in Mexico has been unusually severe because the market's stunning growth had attracted as many speculators as long-term investors. Now that the market has soured, there are very few buyers.  A spokesman for the stock exchange said that investment and government officials were meeting to discuss ways to stabilize the market, but he wouldn't confirm that they were preparing an investment package. "The government and brokerages recognize . . . that current levels of the market aren't representative of the actual values," the spokesman said.
