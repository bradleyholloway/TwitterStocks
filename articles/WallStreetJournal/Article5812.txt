 Ford, Cisco Team Up to Speed Wiring Of 40,000 Suppliers and Dealers for Web   By By Fara Warner, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2000  Cisco is taking an equity stake in Ford's supplier exchange, auto-xchange, in which software maker Oracle Corp. already has an equity stake. As part of the arrangement, Cisco will create customized kits for suppliers and auto dealers to buy at a discount.  The kits could include networking software and equipment such as routers and switches but will depend heavily on what systems the suppliers need and what they already have, said Sue Bostrom, vice president of the Internet business-solutions group at Cisco, which makes computer-networking equipment.  Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. But Cisco spokesman John Earnhart said his company has never done a deal on this scale, noting that the Cisco-Oracle-Ford tie-up to help old-line industrial companies such as auto suppliers with the Web "is a huge proof of the fact that companies want to gain efficiencies using the Net."
