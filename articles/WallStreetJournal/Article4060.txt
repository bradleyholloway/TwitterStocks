 American Hospital Said to Be Setting Big Line of Credit   By By John Koten, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1985  EVANSTON, Ill. -- American Hospital Supply Corp. apparently plans to add a multibillion-dollar line of credit to its defenses against an unwanted takeover by Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc.  Sources close to the company said American Hospital is completing arrangements for the line of credit, which, they said, may total as much as $3 billion.  An American Hospital plan could involve such actions as a stock repurchase, a financial restructuring or an acquisition of another company. "The pressure is clearly on the American Hospital board to come up with something that is as attractive as the Baxter offer," said Larry Feinberg, a health-care analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
