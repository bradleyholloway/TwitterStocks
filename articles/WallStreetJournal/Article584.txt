 Students May Be Searched if School Has 'Reasonable Grounds,' High Court Rules   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1985  The Supreme Court ruled that school officials may search a student whenever there are "reasonable grounds" to think the student may have violated the law or school rules.  The justices ruled that students are still entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures." But the court said the amendment provides less protection to students in school than it guarantees to people in other places who are searched by police. The decision, written by Justice Byron White, said school officials may search a student without a warrant and without "probable cause" to believe the person may have evidence of a crime.  The high court reversed the ruling of the New Jersey Supreme Court, which said the search of a 14-year-old girl's purse in 1980 by an official at Piscataway High School was unreasonable. A teacher found the girl smoking a cigarette in a school bathroom, a violation of school rules. The girl denied to an assistant principal that she was smoking, so the official searched her purse, finding cigarettes and also marijuana.
