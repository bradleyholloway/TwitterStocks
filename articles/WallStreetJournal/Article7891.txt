 Eastern Talks With American On Route Sale   By By Christi Harlan and Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1989  Eastern Airlines is negotiating to sell its South American routes to American Airlines, a move that would accelerate American's aggressive international expansion.  Details of the negotiations, including the price American Airlines would pay, weren't available. But Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., has in the past put the value of the South American routes at $350 million to $500 million.  American is known to be especially interested in assets that would bolster its presence in the Southeastern U.S. and continue its non-domestic growth. Even though purchasing the Eastern routes wouldn't put it directly head-to-head with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., it would provide more business for American's new Miami base. The routes, originating in Miami, serve Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and other countries.
