 Scientist's Death Spurs Criticism of Blair, BBC   By Marc Champion and Charles Goldsmith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2003  The BBC yesterday confirmed in a statement that the weapons scientist, David Kelly, 59 years old, had been the "principal source" for a May 29 story broadcast on BBC Radio 4's "Today" program. The story alleged that the government had "sexed up" intelligence to exaggerate the case for war in Iraq. Because it aired on "Today" -- a show that holds unique influence even in Britain's extremely competitive media market -- the story instantly caused controversy and sparked a high-stakes battle between the government and the BBC that thrust the quiet Dr. Kelly into an unwanted limelight.  With the BBC's acknowledgment that Dr. Kelly was its main source, the focus swung to the corporation. Several legislators questioned the veracity of the BBC's story, and Mr. Kelly's local member of parliament called for the BBC's two top executives to resign. The BBC said it "believes we accurately interpreted and reported the factual information obtained by us during interviews with Dr. Kelly," adding that "we continue to believe we were right to place Dr. Kelly's views in the public domain."  The chain of events that led to Dr. Kelly's death began on May 29. Mr. [Andrew Gilligan], the "Today" show's defense correspondent, reported that a senior British official involved in drafting a dossier of evidence on Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs last September had told him that Mr. [Tony Blair]'s office "sexed up" the intelligence assessments to make the dossier more persuasive.
