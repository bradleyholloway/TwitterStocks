 Tokyo Share Prices Again Reach Record Level; London Exchange Sags, but Frankfurt Rallies ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1989  Tokyo share prices closed broadly higher at another record Monday, drawing support from the market's continued interest in construction-related stocks. Shares fell sharply in London but rose strongly in Frankfurt.  In Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose 142.97 points to close at 31828.75. It followed the index's first record-setting finish in five sessions Friday, when it gained 187.48 points.  As during most of last week, many construction stocks closed higher, indirectly providing support for cement producers and shipbuilders. All these issues are considered closely tied to domestic demand and government spending. Brokers noted the current rush to buy construction shares has been triggered by talk about a series of plans for large government and private projects, including construction of a nine-mile, trans-Tokyo Bay highway bridge.
