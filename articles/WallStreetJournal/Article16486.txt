 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Futures & Options: Winter Festivals Without Walls   By Cashill, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2005  THE INTERNATIONAL Garden Festival at Chaumont-sur-Loire in France was the seed of inspiration for this first gallery-style garden in the United States, nestled in 9 acres near wine country. Opened last July, Cornerstone set landscape architects and designers to work on 1,800- square-foot parcels of land. Tom Leader's "Break Out" is a maze of screen doors that the artist says "draws on the vernacular culture of rural California," while Martha Schwartz's "The Usual Suspects" employs a miniature-golf-course setting. Admission is $9 for adults, $7.50 for seniors (age 65 and over), $6.50 for students, and $4 for children (ages 6-12). The gardens are currently open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily; summer hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.  SINGER-SONGWRITER [Tift Merritt] never considered herself a musician. "I come at all of this as a writer," she says, having studied creative writing at the University of North Carolina. The songs on her two albums, "Bramble Rose" from 2002 and the recent "Tambourine," have a real storytelling bent, detailing the rise and fall of relationships with an author's eye. "Eudora Welty is a real influence," she says. "She said so much in a few sentences."  "Tambourine" was produced by George Drakoulias, who has produced records by the Jayhawks and Tom Petty, among others. He elicits from Ms. Merritt a more rough-and-tumble sound than her first record has. This one reflects her live shows, "which are a little more rock and roll," she says. The song "Stray Paper" has gotten a lot of radio play, and the first single from the album, "Good Hearted Man," has a soulful 1960s feel.
