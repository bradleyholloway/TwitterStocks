 Rugby's Rugged Appeal Is Catching Fashion's Eye   By Meichtry, Stacy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2007  Earlier this year, Italy's Giorgio Armani designed the off-field formal attire for an Australian rugby team co-owned by actor Russell Crowe, and gave rugby players front-row seats at a fashion show in Milan. Italian suit maker Lebole, owned by Valentino Fashion Group SpA, this year designed off-field uniforms for the Italian national rugby team and cast players from the national squad to model its suit in its 2007 advertising campaign. "Their different physiques are the perfect example of our ability to dress the most demanding of customers elegantly," said Alberto Damian, director of Valentino Fashion Group's fashion division.  "What's interesting about rugby at the moment is that it expresses the new man. It's distinct from the pampered beast that is today's soccer star," says Rita Clifton, chairwoman of the British unit of Interbrand, a global branding consulting firm that is part of ad holding company Omnicom Group Inc. The often-battered faces of experienced rugby players, Ms. Clifton says, have the charm of what fashion watchers refer to as jolie laide, or "beautiful ugliness."  Ahead of the championship tournament, the French edition of fashion magazine Elle published a feature on rugby that explained the game's rules and picked out its "sexiest" players. Colette, an exclusive fashion boutique in Paris, in September began carrying Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.'s "Rugby" label, a collection launched in 2004 that includes long-sleeve rugby-style shirts and peacoats. Ralph Lauren also created a limited edition of 200 rugby balls for the boutique, priced at 50 euros, about $72.
