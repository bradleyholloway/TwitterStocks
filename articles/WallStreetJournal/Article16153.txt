 US Airways' Siegel Installs New Team, Seeking Profitability   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2002  Succeeding Ms. [Michelle V. Bryan] in the human-resources position is Jerry Glass, who was president of J. Glass & Associates, a consulting firm specializing in airline-labor relations. The appointment of Mr. Glass, 47, also is important as US Airways is hoping to reduce its labor costs, possibly by opening its existing labor contracts or seeking voluntary concessions from employees. Moreover, the carrier and its pilots union are deadlocked over the issue of adding regional jets to the fleets of US Airways' commuter affiliates. As a consultant and negotiator, Mr. Glass has concluded 60 labor agreements for a variety of airline clients.  Mr. [David Siegel], 40, joined the nation's sixth-largest airline last month, filling a vacancy created when the former CEO, Rakesh Gangwal, abruptly quit last November after six years at the Arlington, Va., company. Stephen Wolf, now US Airways' nonexecutive chairman, had been filling in as CEO when he recruited Mr. Siegel from Avis Rent A Car System Inc. Mr. Siegel has worked for both Northwest and Continental Airlines.
