 Euro Gains on Dollar on ECB Rate-Move Outlook   By Steven C. Johnson and Steven Vames, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2006  That helped the euro grind higher, as did Mr. [Jean- Claude Trichet]'s pledge that the central bank will remain "vigilant" in maintaining its goal of price stability and leaning against upside inflation risks.  Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2098, up from $1.2061 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 118.50 yen from 118.02 yen and at 1.2853 Swiss francs from 1.2895 francs. Sterling was at $1.7801 from $1.7739. Against the yen, the euro was at 143.34 yen compared with 142.28 yen.  "I don't get the sense the market wants to be long dollars at this stage. There are just too many uncertainties out there," Mr. [Michael Woolfolk] said, pointing chiefly to ambiguity surrounding the future direction of U.S. interest rates.
