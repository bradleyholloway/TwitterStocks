 Downsize Danger: Many Firms Cut Staff In Accounts Payable And Pay a Steep Price --- They Find Their Computers, Unlike People, Can't Spot A Lot of Errors and Fraud --- But New Systems Can Help   By By Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1996  "Replacing personnel with computers in a payables department never works as well as top management thinks it will," says Ronald Loder, president of Loder Drew & Associates, an Irvine, Calif., payables-consulting firm.  In the past two years, for instance, the Occidental Chemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp., of Los Angeles, has cut its payables staff by one-third, to 40 employees. Occidental Chemical slashed labor costs, but duplicate vendor payments or missed discounts on its purchases have doubled, to at least $500,000 annually, says John Blandin, the Dallas-based unit's payables manager. "With staff reductions, we can't always check paperwork face-to-face with the department head ordering the goods or services," he adds.  In the past three years, General Electric Co. has also pared its payables staff, to 180 from almost 400, substituting electronic checking for manual checks by clerks. As a result, GE has had to drop an important procedure. It used to compare invoices and purchase orders "at the front end before they are actually paid to vendors," says Robert Longbottom, a GE payables official in Fort Myers, Fla. Now, he says, it checks payables only after the money has been disbursed. Payroll costs are down, but GE's duplicate payments and overpayments to vendors are up, he says.
