 Data Show Qwest Loses Market Share   By By Robert Gavin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2000  According to the UTC, rivals to Qwest, including Electric Lightwave Inc. of Vancouver, AT&T Corp. of New York and WorldCom Inc. of Clinton, Mo., now have 36% of business customers in Seattle; 38% in Bellevue; 41% in Vancouver; and 45% in Spokane. The analysis, based on a survey of 31 competitors identified by Qwest in its UTC filing, looks at market share in cities where Qwest is seeking price deregulation.  Competitors for business accounts say Qwest remains too dominant to be cut loose from UTC oversight. For one thing, it owns nearly all the basic telecommunications infrastructure -- the network of lines that carry voice and data transmissions -- in Washington. That means other business-service players must rent space on Qwest lines. And, those players claim, Qwest isn't very obliging when it comes to negotiating rental deals.  UTC staff members who worked on the analysis say there is evidence that for certain types of customers, services and locations, Qwest has no competitors. For example, a Qwest rival might run fiber-optic lines to a high-rise building in downtown Seattle because the concentration of customers there makes it easy to recoup its investment. It would be unwilling, however, to do the same for a small business with few phone lines on the outskirts of the city. Such a customer would be part of a so-called captive market of businesses. The UTC is trying to determine how many customers are in such a position, since they would have no alternatives available if Qwest raises prices.
