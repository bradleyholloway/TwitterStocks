 Media & Marketing -- Advertising: Making Sure the Work Fits the Bill; Marking Shift, Advertisers Are Using Outside Firms To Audit Agency Practices   By White, Erin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  BRIEFS: Masterfoods USA, a division of Mars Inc., will consolidate media buying and planning accounts related to its snack, food and pet- care businesses at Publicis Groupe's Starcom MediaVest Group. The move was first reported on AdAge.com. The account is estimated at more than $325 million. Brands include Snickers, Uncle Ben's and Whiskas. The accounts were spread across Publicis's MediaVest and Zenith Media; Omnicom Group's OMD; WPP Group's Mediaedge:cia; and Grey Global Group's MediaCom.  Mr. [Brocklehurst] says mistakes often aren't the result of any sinister intentions. Rather, errors can result from the increasing financial pressure faced by agencies. Sometimes agency owners create problems by paring back an agency's financial-department staff, even as clients demand more financial accountability from their ad shops. Problems also can arise when an agency network wins a client's world- wide business by agreeing to provide services at a lower rate. This revenue squeeze can be especially hurtful at the network's smaller shops, which don't have as many other big clients to cushion the shortfall.
