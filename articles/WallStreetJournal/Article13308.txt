 Love & Money: In an Emergency, Who You Gonna Call?   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  "I shop there for the service, even though it's more expensive," she says. "I stopped to talk to the owner because he knew me and because he'd been in the area awhile and might have some advice for me. He informed me that the first call I needed to make was for a cleanup crew [to pump the water from the basement], and advised me to call a housing contractor, since they likely would be overwhelmed with calls from other flood victims."  "During the days after my evacuation," my friend says, "my neighbor [who had stayed close by to monitor the situation] had been calling me regularly to keep me updated, and he was the one who alerted me when the water receded and I could get into my house. If it hadn't been for his phone call, I would not have gained access until the next day, and having that advance notice made all the difference in getting myself back home quickly."  "The next day, though, was just amazing," my friend says. "The cleanup crew cleared out my basement down to the concrete. The electrician came over an hour after I called him and fixed my fuse box and called the inspector so I could get my power on." A plumber, the son of another neighbor she had befriended, arrived to repair some broken pipes and the water heater.
