 Cisco, Juniper, Broadcom Rise, As Blue Chips and Nasdaq Rally   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2001  A host of other stocks in the telecommunications-gear market also rallied, on the presumption that good news from Cisco would translate into broader recovery. Juniper Networks climbed 3.10, or 16%, to 22.58, while Broadcom added 2.41, or 6.4%, to 40.26, and Ciena gained 1.83, or 12%, to 16.92, all on Nasdaq.  Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) added 62 cents, or 5.4%, to 12.06, after J.P. Morgan H&Q added the stock of the computer-systems maker to its focus list of stocks. Meanwhile, Microsoft (Nasdaq), which rallied last week on plans for a settlement with the government of the landmark antitrust case, moved higher again, adding 1.87, or 3%, to 63.27, though some state antitrust enforcers said they found serious flaws in the details of the settlement plan.  Cytyc (Nasdaq) dropped 3.21, or 12%, to 23.81 on concerns that a competitor to the Boxborough, Mass., maker of medical-testing products is going to present data about the quality of a product that rivals a Cytyc product. That rival, TriPath Imaging (Nasdaq), Burlington, N.C., climbed 1.35, or 21%, to 7.80. In a research note, Thomas Weisel Partners said it didn't worry that Cytyc would lose market share to TriPath, but it did say it considered Cytyc fully valued at its current price.
