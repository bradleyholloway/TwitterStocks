 Top Reagan Aides Signal New Unease Over Deficit-Reduction Bill in Congress   By By Paul Blustein and David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1985  Top Reagan administration officials signaled new unease over potential effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction legislation pending before Congress.  Mr. Miller and White House chief of staff Donald Regan said the administration wants to be allowed some discretion in apportioning the automatic spending cuts envisioned under the Gramm-Rudman bill -- at least in the defense area. The officials' comments reflect rising concern about the defense-spending issue at the White House, which has been back-pedaling from its endorsement of Gramm-Rudman as Congress has changed the measure.  But even if the Gramm-Rudman bill dies, some of its parts may live on. Mr. Miller told a group of public-policy analysts at the American Enterprise Institute that the budget the administration plans to submit to Congress early next year will meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $144 billion for the fiscal year starting next Oct. 1 -- whether or not the Gramm-Rudman measure passes.
