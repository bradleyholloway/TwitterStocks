 Key Barometer Of the Economy Remains Steady --- Index of Leading Indicators Is Unchanged for April; Factory Orders Decline   By By Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1994  The government's chief gauge of future economic activity held steady in April, suggesting the economy is sticking to a moderate rate of growth.  The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators was unchanged after rising 0.7% in March and holding steady in February. The index remains at 101.2, the highest since the department began reporting it in 1948.  The latest figures are consistent with the view of many economists that economic growth is continuing to slacken but with no danger of either a downturn or, as some market participants have worried, a jump in inflation. Analysts emphasized the 0.2% increase in the department's index of coincident indicators, which they said is a good gauge of current economic activity.
