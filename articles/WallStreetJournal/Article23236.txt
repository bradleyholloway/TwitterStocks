 Body and Spirit: Why Attending Religious Services May Benefit Health   By Helliker, Kevin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2005  It isn't simply that people showing up for church are healthier; they also are more likely to improve their health habits. When compared with nonweekly attendance, "weekly attendance was associated with a statistically significant improvement in quitting smoking, becoming often physically active, becoming not depressed, increasing the number of individual personal relationships and getting married," said one of the examined articles, which was published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine in 2001. That study gathered health and mortality data over a period of 30 years on 2,676 Californians, 26% of whom attended religious services weekly.  the studies supporting a link between religious-service attendance and health come from such secular institutions as the universities of Texas, Michigan and California at San Francisco. And their authors don't necessarily go to church or perceive the mortality benefits of doing so as the handiwork of God. "Being religiously involved can confer certain health benefits, and I don't think there's any divine intervention involved," says Robert A. Hummer, a nonchurch- going University of Texas sociology professor whose studies have shown a health benefit for regular religious-service attendance.  Moreover, Dr. [Lynda Powell] says that she and her colleagues excluded from their review any study that failed to control for the social benefits of church attendance as well as the healthier habits of those who go regularly. Even after excluding those factors, they found a significant health and mortality benefit from regular attendance. "There's an unknown mechanism" contributing to the benefit, she says, adding that she doesn't believe that that mechanism is God.
