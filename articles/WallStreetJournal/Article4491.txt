 Texas Air Posts Losses of $244.4 Million For 4th Quarter, $718.6 Million for 1988   By By Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1989  Yet in the short term, Texas Air faces legion operating problems that will put profits even further out of reach, at least at its troubled Eastern Airlines unit. After months of coyly refusing to say whether it would support a looming strike by Eastern's militant machinists, the powerful pilots' union at Eastern gave some indication that it might.  In a videotape distributed to its Eastern members, the Air Line Pilots Association urged members to honor machinist union picket lines if the pilots' executive council formally calls for them to do so. Eastern officials have been counting on the pilots' continuing to work through any strike by the machinists, which could occur as soon as March 3.  Texas Air's fourth-quarter loss was slightly narrower than the $265.6 million posted a year earlier. The consolidated loss included a deficit of $99.2 million at Texas Air's low-cost Continental Airlines unit and a $101.7 million loss at Eastern. Revenue in the quarter fell slightly to $2.02 billion from $2.12 billion a year earlier.
