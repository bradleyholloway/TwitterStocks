 Health & Medicine (A Special Report) --- Talking About HMOs: Has managed care been a failure? A prominent economist argues that it did a lot of what it was supposed to do   By By Scott Hensley, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2001  So instead of saying HMOs are dead, I would say no, they will come back and actually be much more prevalent than they are now. They were dead only when health-care premiums didn't go up at all in the mid-'90s and preferred-provider organizations [PPOs] became as cheap as HMOs. [Preferred-provider organizations, or PPOs, are relatively wide networks of doctors and hospitals that provide service to an employer or insurer at a negotiated discount.]  Eventually, the free-choice insurance models will cost more. But what you will be buying is not necessarily higher-quality care, just more choice. The middle and upper-middle class will be in HMOs with point of service, meaning patients can go outside the HMOs for care but pay substantially more out of pocket for the freedom of choice or for PPOs -- which are loosely managed. And then, of course, there is emerging boutique medicine for the moneyed elite. Well-to-do people -- of whom there are now quite a few -- will probably keep forever the open-ended, fee-for-service, "Disneyland" health-insurance policy most Americans had before the 1990s.  Dr. [Uwe Reinhardt]: HMOs will reinvent them, if they can be shown to hold down costs. Some experts have argued that gatekeepers actually didn't save money in the 1990s. But talk about an injudicious name. Rather than saying "gatekeeper," HMOs should say: "This primary-care doctor is your ombudsman." Better still, call them "medical account executives." These are the people, who, like your broker, you go to for advice. The HMO gatekeepers should try to function so that they come across like that, which means they should not be too fanatical about disallowing visits to specialists.
