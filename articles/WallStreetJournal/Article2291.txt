 Business and Finance [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1991  TAX RELIEF MEASURES including a $300 credit for each child in a taxpayer's family and liberalized rules for individual retirement accounts were proposed by Democratic Sen. Bentsen. A 5% cut in defense spending would offset the plan's $72.5 billion cost over five years. Bentsen's plan could compete with Bush's promise of a capital-gains tax cut.  Stock and bond prices rallied. The Dow Jones industrials climbed 24.15 points to a record 3077.15. Long-term Treasury bonds rose nearly a point.  McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics posted solid third-quarter results. McDonnell reiterated its intention to bolster its commercial aircraft lines while General Dynamics said it will still focus on defense.
