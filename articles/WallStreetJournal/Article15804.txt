 Strained Relations: A Software Star Sees Its `Family' Culture Turn Dysfunctional --- PeopleSoft Made Its Work A Cause, but a Slump Is Shaking the Faithful --- The Sting From Red Pepper   By By Quentin Hardy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1999  Most people thought layoffs "could never happen at PeopleSoft," recalls Tina Cox, PeopleSoft's manager of employee communications, who was at the meeting. "We are a family." Three weeks later, President and Chief Executive Officer David A. Duffield announced to employees that layoffs were coming -- in a company-wide email headed with his initials, DAD.  They fed, too, off the exploits of Mr. Duffield, a sometimes flamboyant, goodtime guy who has lately given more than $200 million to help stray dogs and cats. PeopleSoft, Mr. Duffield preached, was about more than money -- it was about having fun and having a heart.  Yet there are signs Mr. Duffield's commitment may be tempered by growing outside interests. During an interview, his nearby spokesman blanches at Mr. Duffield's mention that board member Edgar Codd, another old friend, will also resign, and that Mr. Duffield is selling his house near Pleasanton in order to spend more time at a mansion near Lake Tahoe. Both were news to the spokesman. Besides establishing a $200 million foundation to end the euthanasia of stray dogs and cats in America, Mr. Duffield has in the past four years adopted five children, to go with three kids of his own.
