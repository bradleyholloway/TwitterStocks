 AT&T Records $1 Billion Charge, Mostly Due to Cutting 10,000 Jobs   By By Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2002  AT&T had said in October that it would take an unspecified fourth-quarter charge. The $1 billion charge is primarily associated with layoffs, though some of it is for facility closings and contract terminations, said an AT&T spokeswoman. AT&T said it will report fourth-quarter results near the end of this month.  Analysts cautioned that quarterly restructuring charges may become commonplace for AT&T. "With AT&T's revenue continuing to decline in both business and consumer, AT&T may have to continue to cut costs, which means more and more layoffs over the next few years," said Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport & Co. in Richmond, Va. "The charges will continue to erode shareholder equity." The worsening situation may force AT&T to eventually sell its business to a regional Bell or another company, he said.
