 Automakers to Build Total of 151,511 Cars This Week, Down 3%   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1987  The eight major U.S. automakers are scheduled to assemble 151,511 cars this week, down 3% from the year-ago total of 155,498 cars.  As expected, General Motors Corp. shut down its Framingham, Mass., plant this week for an indefinite period. GM also said it will close its North Tarrytown, N.Y., plant, starting next week, to install new paint equipment and to reduce unsold inventories of the Pontiac 6000 and Buick Century cars built there. GM earlier said it plans to resume output at North Tarrytown in early February.
