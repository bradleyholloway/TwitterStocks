 Anti-Nuclear Movement in Australia Impedes Efforts to Mine More Uranium   By By Geraldine Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1986  DARWIN, Australia -- Chained to the wharf in Darwin's harbor, the 38-foot ketch Vega seems like a mouse harassing an elephant as it attempts to block the giant British cargo ship Forthbank from docking to take on cargo of uranium ore.  The Vega is owned by the international environmental group Greenpeace. In the past two years, disruption by Greenpeace and other protestors has delayed uranium shipments here by as much as six days. This time, they manage only 14 minutes. But within hours of the Forthbank's departure, the Vega crew was meeting to discuss how to delay the next shipment.  The uranium industry's critics argue that mining and exporting uranium contributes to increases in radioactive waste and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. What's more, many of Australia's richest uranium deposits lie in Kakadu, a major national park and an area of great cultural significance to the country's Aborigines.
