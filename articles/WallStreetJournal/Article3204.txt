 Technology (A Special Report) -- Power Tools --- Death of the Off-Line Salesman: Today's salesperson has a huge amount of information -- about customers, inventories and trends -- just a few mouse clicks away   By By Megan Doscher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1999  Over the past few years, a technological revolution has swept through sales forces across the country, fundamentally remaking the job. Many salespeople are now linked via computer to headquarters, streamlining the process of placing orders and getting information -- from inventory data to reports on who's buying what. Web sites pull in clients and generate sales leads for salespeople. Meanwhile, cellular phones, pagers and e-mail let those salespeople be accessible round the clock.  What it all amounts to is this: a huge volume of new information that salespeople can use to prospect for clients, pitch a sale and then close it. But how do you apply all the sales, trend and inventory data that are just a few clicks away? And how do you find time to return the calls from customers who expect service at all hours? Salespeople are learning that having information simply isn't enough; they must learn to manage it, whether with ever-smarter technological packages or new approaches to doing their jobs.  In Touch allows directors to check on inventory -- finding out if a product is out of stock or if it has been recently discounted -- which cuts down on delayed orders and customer-service complaints. Headquarters sends out news flashes through In Touch regarding special promotions and discounts, which lets directors change their sales strategies on a dime. And a daily online business update helps directors monitor trends and keep tabs on their staff in a way that the old method -- a monthly paper update -- clearly never could.
