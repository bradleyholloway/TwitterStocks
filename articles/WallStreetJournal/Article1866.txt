 Film: On Film: Something Old and Something New   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1988  Briefly, the patriarch of a wealthy immigrant family living in Southern California objects to his favorite daughter's marriage to a clean-cut American boy. World War II is a backdrop to the events, but the battles abroad seem like popgun play compared with the rages within the Larraneta family.  Given the vaguely incestuous attraction between old man Jorge and his loving child Josie, the picture at the beginning promises something darkly interesting, "East of Eden" maybe. Soon, "Falcon Crest" seems a better bet. Yet even the latter was too much to ask from this saga. The film makers managed to trip across every cliche of the genre while side-stepping all hints of irony. The only really interesting thing is William Hurt's bizarre, tic-a-minute performance as a weak, vengeful son, and it seems to be his own private little tour de force.  The picture isn't sloppy, just humorless and apparently unconscious of its own simple stereotypes. In fact, director and screenwriter Gregory Nava ("El Norte") has made a film that is a kind of feat. He's managed to get his crew of fine actors to resuscitate stereotypical characters that for years have risen only at night, on the late show.
