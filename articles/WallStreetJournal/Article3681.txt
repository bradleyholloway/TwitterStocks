 Who Needs Congress? You Can Avoid Taxes Just by Picking the Right Funds   By By Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  For instance, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) plan is set to increase from $12,000 this year to $15,000 in 2006. If you are age 50 or older, you can also make catch-up contributions, which means you could invest as much as $14,000 this year and $20,000 in 2006.  Similarly, the maximum annual contribution to a regular or Roth individual retirement account is slated to rise from $3,000 today to $5,000 in 2008. Those age 50 and older can invest an additional $500 this year and an extra $1,000 starting in 2006. Meanwhile, if you are saving for college, you can take advantage of two tax-free accounts, the Coverdell education savings accounts and 529 college-savings plans.  If you are hunting for new stock funds for your taxable account, pay attention to each fund's realized and unrealized losses. A fund can set such losses against gains and thereby avoid capital-gains distributions. That's good news for taxable fund shareholders, who have to pay taxes on any distributions they receive.
