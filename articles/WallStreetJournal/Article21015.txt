 Letters to the Editor: Readers Study Article, Lose Patience   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1986  Regarding Ted Roberts's article "Wife Studies Nursing and I Lose Patience" (editorial page, Sept. 16), this is to let offended female readers know that not all the male readers share Mr. Roberts's views on the proper place for women in society.  Perhaps 20 years ago there was a market for jokes about men discovering that dishes didn't wash themselves, garbage pails didn't empty themselves, beds didn't make themselves, and so on. At one time, no doubt, there was also a market for jokes about white people discovering that buses didn't drive themselves, fields didn't plow themselves, and shoes didn't shine themselves.
