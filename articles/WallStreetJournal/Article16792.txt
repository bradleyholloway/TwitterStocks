 SmartMoney: Investment Pros' Choices   By Machan, Dyan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  Being the perennial world's greatest investor doesn't mean life is easy for [Warren Buffett], Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive. "If I had less money, it would be easy to make money right now," he said wistfully at the firm's annual meeting earlier this year.  Berkshire shares are up 19% over the past year. Since 1965 they've returned 21.4% a year. "Years ago I had too many ideas and too little cash," laments Mr. Buffet, 76. "Now I have too much money and few ideas." Still, that doesn't mean he doesn't have any.  Even more impressive is that [Brian Rogers] has done so with low volatility. When the S&P plunged 47% in 2000-2002, his investors lost 6%. How: He doesn't overpay. "Don't get emotional if prices get whipped around by market gyrations," he says, adding, "We'll see more of it."
