 Dean Gets Boost From Support Of Labor Union   By Schlesinger, Jacob M, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2003  If Mr. [Howard Dean] wins the endorsement of the 1.5 million-member government workers union -- the federation's second-biggest union, which will decide Wednesday -- he essentially will have united backing of the country's organized service workers. AFSCME spokesman Ethan Rome declined yesterday to say which way his union was leaning. But he said AFSCME and SEIU are trying to coordinate their efforts, noting they share "similar issues" and adding: "Clearly, the more unified the labor movement is behind a particular candidate, the better."  Indeed, the SEIU held off making a formal announcement of its endorsement until AFSCME could join it. But the SEIU left no doubt it has endorsed Mr. Dean.
