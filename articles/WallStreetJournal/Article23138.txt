 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / TV: Mission Deadly   By Rabinowitz, Dorothy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 2004  This summer you'll be privileged to witness an airline employee's proposal to his girl before an audience of people waiting for their flights. A large woman with a jolly laugh has a problem getting bottles of booze aboard, while another, a lot less cheery, has mislaid her ticket. Now and again, you get a serious moment, as in the confrontation between a customer mad with frustration over delayed flights and a Southwest Airlines representative sent out to deal with him. The representative, it's clear, has taken advanced studies in the discipline of passengers -- and is taking no guff, particularly none involving bad language. Hearing that the passenger in question has again used profanity before finally boarding his flight, she hunts him down. We'll leave the outcome of the ensuing exchange a secret. Suffice it to say, it's been a while since a reality show has offered a pair so well matched, pathologically speaking.
