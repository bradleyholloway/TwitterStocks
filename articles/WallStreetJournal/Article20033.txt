 Retail Sales Rise, Easing Concerns A Drop-Off Looms   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2006  Meanwhile, discount rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its same-store sales rose 2.4%, noting that shoppers are focusing on necessities. "Our customers continued to prioritize spending on food and consumables," which include paper towels and other pantry items, said Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer of Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark. Customers also flocked to early discounts for back- to-school supplies, he said.  In the coming weeks, back-to-school shopping begins in earnest, testing customers' willingness to pay full price for new goods. "What I'm anxious to see for August is how much is attributable to consumer electronics spending as kids get back to school," said Janet Hoffman, managing partner of North American retail at consulting firm Accenture.  Retail Forward Inc., a retail consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio, said parents will continue to open their wallets for back-to- school purchases, but it projects slowing sales growth in August. "Weaker job gains, a volatile job market and higher home-cooling bills are creating heightened uncertainty among consumers," Retail Forward economist Steve Spiwak said.
