 QUARTERLY REVIEW & OUTLOOK: Brevard's Space Coast Banks On Its High-Tech Savvy   By By Peter Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1996  Not many places are as vulnerable to the federal government's spending cuts as Brevard County's Space Coast. So when local economic-development officials surveyed area manufacturers in May, few expected upbeat results.  True, the steady stream of tourists and retirees who drive the service sector for much of Florida contribute some of the buoyancy. But something else is at work in Brevard, with deep implications for this cluster of beach towns transformed in the 1960s to send rockets to the moon: A proliferation of high-tech start-ups catering to niche markets, many of them run by refugees from the big contractors that are cutting back.  Failure could send Brevard back into its former orbit as a downscale sun spot for discount vacationers. That's especially true closer to Kennedy Space Center in north Brevard, which has been slower to diversify away from the big NASA and military contractors. The southern part of Brevard has done a better job of diversifying so far; engineers from Harris are behind a bunch of start-ups in the Melbourne area.
