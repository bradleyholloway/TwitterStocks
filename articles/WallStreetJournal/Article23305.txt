 Bush to Confront Difficult Dialogue At Latin Summit; U.S. Influence at Low Ebb Since the Invasion of Iraq; Free-Trade Zone Is 'Stalled'   By Moffett, Matt, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2005  Mr. [Bush] was philosophical about polls showing resurgent anti- Americanism in the region. "There's people who disagree with the decisions I've made all over the world," he said. "And I understand that. But that's what happens when you make decisions."  "It seems they're trying to revive the FTAA," Mr. [Hugo Chavez] said on his Sunday TV program. "The FTAA is dead. It will have to be buried."  Johns Hopkins University Latin specialist Riordan Roett calls the Mar del Plata meeting "the summit of lame ducks." Between now and the end of 2006, there will be elections in a host of key countries, including Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. "Commitments made -- if there are any -- will not be recognized in most cases by the lame ducks' successors," he says.
