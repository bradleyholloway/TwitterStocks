 Shamir Agrees to Mideast Talks --- But Assent Depends On Who Will Speak For the Palestinians   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 1991  Mr. Shamir's statement, which his aides described as a "yes in principle" on joining the peace conference, came after he and top cabinet officers met here with Secretary of State James Baker. His statement moves the U.S. one big step closer to arranging direct negotiations aimed at producing Arab-Israeli peace and settling the festering Palestinian issue.  But the condition attached by Mr. Shamir means that disputes over Palestinian representation still could doom the conference, which President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced on Wednesday that they want to convene in October. The problem of finding Palestinian negotiators acceptable to both Israel and the Arab world has scuttled peace efforts before, most recently when the U.S. tried to arrange much narrower negotiations between Israel and a group of Palestinians last year.  Last night, Mr. Shamir said in an interview on Israeli television that the U.S. has agreed to exclude Palestinians who are unacceptable to Israel because they come from East Jerusalem or live outside Israeli-occupied territory or have links to the Palestine Liberation Organization. U.S. officials refused to discuss what arrangements they are negotiating, but such conditions could make it more difficult to persuade Palestinians to attend the conference.
