 Deflation Is Latest Threat to Mutual Funds   By By Karen Damato and Theo Francis, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2001  For starters, financial advisers say, most individuals shouldn't obsess on the inflation-deflation scenarios. "Trying to predict [inflation] and position your portfolio ahead of time is incredibly difficult," says Bryan Olson, who runs Charles Schwab & Co.'s Center for Investment Research. "Economists and financial experts aren't too good at it, so as an investor, it's going to be a tough game to master." Fundamentally, diversification is the key to surviving bouts of inflation and deflation alike, Mr. Olson and others say.  Also known as Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, they carry a fixed interest rate (the yield is currently about 3.5% a year on bonds maturing in 2011), but that percentage is applied to a principal value that is periodically adjusted for inflation. Investors' overall returns will be a combination of that set rate and actual future inflation.  A curious side effect of the TIPS structure can even provide a measure of protection if deflation should reign for several years, Pimco's Mr. [John Brynjolfsson] notes. Deflation eats away at the bond's principal for the purposes of calculating interest, but the government promises that, at maturity, bonds will have at least their original face value -- deflation can't erode that. As a result, he says, they make a sort of minimal hedge against sustained deflation.
