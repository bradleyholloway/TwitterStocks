 Cullinet's Hiring Of Goldman Sachs Prompts Rumors   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  Cullinet Software Inc. has hired Goldman Sachs & Co., prompting speculation that the troubled software concern may be seeking a buyer.  Officials with the Westwood, Mass., company declined to comment on whether Cullinet is for sale. John Cullinane, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company hired Goldman Sachs to help evaluate new sources of funding.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Cullinet closed at $5.50 a share, up 25 cents. Robert Weiler, Cullinet president and chief operating officer, said, "I don't think the rise was due to buy-out rumors. Other high-technology stocks rose Friday and we were just caught up in that bullish wave."
