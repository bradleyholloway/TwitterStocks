 Trade Center Jury Will Resume Deliberation of Key Form Issue   By Dean Starkman and Alex Frangos, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2004  In any event, Mr. [Daniel Bollier] agreed on July 26 to increase Swiss Re's coverage using preliminary documents to its current level of $877 million. Mr. [Larry Silverstein] contends that in doing so Mr. Bollier in effect agreed to the new form, which he had in his possession, especially because he had raised multiple objections to WilProp previously. Swiss Re says Mr. Bollier already had explicitly agreed under the much-negotiated Wilprop and that opening an e-mail attachment is a meaningless event.  During the trial, Mr. [Paul Blackmore] acknowledged initially sending out the so-called WilProp insurance form that defines the attack as one occurrence and committing Swiss Re to coverage by July 18 without discussing any other form. But, he testified that on July 23 his assistant sent Mr. Bollier a new form, known as Travelers, that leaves open the possibility that the attacks could be considered two occurrences. He testified that he told Mr. Bollier in a phone call that day that the Travelers form prevailed.
