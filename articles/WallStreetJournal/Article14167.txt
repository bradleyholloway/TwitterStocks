 Bookshelf: The Curious Case of Ruth Rendell   By By Joanne Kaufman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1985  In her past novels, notably "Speaker of Mandarin," Ruth Rendell has more than fulfilled the minimum obligations. But lately she has become something of a tease of a mystery novelist. She grabs the reader by both hands -- not that the reader puts up much of a fight -- keeps the pages turning swiftly and serves up enough red herring to make a large salad. But in the case of her 27th mystery, "The Tree of Hands" (Pantheon, 271 pages, $13.95), and her 28th, "An Unkindness of Ravens" (Pantheon, 245 pages, $15.95), terrific buildups lead to an awful letdown. No matter how beguiling Ms. Rendell's prose, no matter how likable her protagonists, particularly the sardonic Inspector Wexford who returns once again in "An Unkindness," the denouements have all the force of a water pistol.  "The Tree of Hands" protagonist is Benet nee Brigitte Archdale, a single mother with a best-selling novel (ironically, its title is "The Marriage Knot"), an enchanting infant son James and a crazy mother Mopsa nee Margaret who has just come to London for an unwelcome visit.  Benet has good reason to be wary about this mother-daughter reunion. She has not forgotten the time Mopsa unaccountably tried to stab her with a carving knife years earlier when the two were alone in a train compartment: "In her teens, Benet used sometimes to say over and over to herself, I must not hate my mother. The injunction had not always been obeyed."
