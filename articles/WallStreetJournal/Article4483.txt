 On Sports: Niners Were Finer in 'Bears' Weather'   By By Fred Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1989  Chicago -- Among Joe Montana's many talents is the ability to read a calendar. Having consulted one before his San Francisco 49ers met the Chicago Bears in frigid Soldier Field here Sunday, and sniffing the arctic breeze that made ordinary football manuevers chancy, the Niners' quarterback informed receiver Jerry Rice that a seasonable change of sport might be in order.  The fleet, sleek Rice went up and got five passes, two of them for lengthy touchdowns, and the Niners thumped the Bears, 28-3. Their prize in the National Football League's National Conference title game couldn't have been more appropriate -- a trip to Miami. There, on Jan. 22, they'll meet in Super Bowl XXIII the Cincinnati Bengals, who survived an ice bowl of their own earlier in the day at home against Buffalo. Their toes should be thawed by then, too.  And, afterward, everybody talked about the weather first and the score next. "It started off cold and seemed to get colder," winced Niners' running back Roger Craig. "I played once in Green Bay, and it was cold there, but that was no comparison to this," said Rice. "Are you sure Chicago isn't farther north than Green Bay?"
