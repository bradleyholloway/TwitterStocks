 Leading the News: Senators Say War With Iraq Likely, But Debate Needed   By By Gerald F. Seib and Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2002  The two congressional leaders spoke yesterday amid rising speculation about renewed conflict with Iraq and stepped up discussions within the Bush administration exploring options for ousting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Still, senior administration aides say privately that a decision about how to approach Iraq hasn't been made, and war planning within the Pentagon still is at a relatively early stage.  Privately, some administration aides also are worried that the administration hasn't made a sufficient case at home or abroad for action. That task may actually get harder because Iraq last week asked for talks with the United Nations on how U.N. weapons inspectors might be allowed back into Iraq. Movement toward the return of weapons inspectors would create new international pressure on the administration to hold back on other moves against Iraq while the inspection debate unfolds.
