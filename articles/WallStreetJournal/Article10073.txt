 Business Technology: Best of the Business Tech Blog / Excerpts from Recent Entries at WSJ.com's Tech Blog   By Worthen, Ben, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2007  That's because you can never make something 100% secure, since there's no way to think of every possible security threat that might arise during the upfront design. The trick is to account for this uncertainty upfront by designing security procedures that are flexible and adaptable. "You don't establish security directly," Mr. [Jeffrey Miller] says. "You do it by developing business processes that can be improved."  The Business Technology Blog also hates the term "users," and we grit our teeth every time we resort to it (three times yesterday, once the day before). We also hate the term "solution." IT people often say that they have a customer-relationship solution or a supply-chain solution. The word "solution" not only doesn't tell you what it does, but also doesn't tell you what it is. A supply-chain solution might be software, but it might be a storage rack in a pickup truck, or it might be a cardboard box.  This blog also hates "end-to-end" and "scalable," which vaguely suggest that something is much more versatile than it probably is. And also "agile," as in "this solution will make your company more agile." And "space," as in "the aging-golfer-social-networking space," as if some fallow market awaits there by dint of calling it a space. And there are others. Many others.
