 Encore (A Special Report); Giving and Receiving: More investors are finding that gift annuities can meet two financial needs at once   By Hube, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2007  While charitable annuities are regulated by states, and rules vary somewhat, in most states you have some flexibility in how you structure your annuity. For example, you typically can arrange to receive payments over both your lifetime and your spouse's, in case you predecease your spouse. You may also be able to create a gift annuity in someone else's name, or create a gift annuity today and wait to start taking payments later.  Don't let the simplicity of these products prompt you to jump into one too quickly. "Be sure you're doing it for all of the right reasons -- No. 1, that you have charitable intent," says Tom Spychalski, a partner at Weiser LLP, an accounting firm in New York. "The fact that you get an annuity payment shouldn't be your main reason for choosing one of these."  Would-be donors also should be wary of offers with unusually high annuity rates. To calculate your annuity payments, most nonprofit groups use interest rates proposed by the American Council on Gift Annuities. The rates are intended to leave charitable groups with an average of 50% of the donations they receive through charitable gift annuities. But if you are offered a rate that exceeds the council's recommended rates by more than a percentage point or so, be careful, Mr. [Larry H. Mayfield] says. If the rate is too high, there may be virtually nothing left for the charity upon your death, and the IRS may declare that the amount given through the annuity wasn't, in fact, a gift. "Then it may not allow your tax deduction," he says.
