 Real-Estate Finance: Nordic Housing Bucks Trend; Sweden, Norway See Prices Climb on Strong Economies While Global Market Falters   By Sherwood, Joel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2007  In Sweden as a whole, home prices rose 8.6% in the first six months of the year, while in Norway they were up 10%, the two country's national statistics agencies report. Those continue strong trends -- in 2006, prices rose 11.3% in Sweden and 13.3% in Norway. Erik Olsson Fastighetsfoermedling, a leading real-estate agency in Sweden, expects Swedish prices continuing to rise at this pace through 2008.  A host of factors point to continued strong demand in the two Scandinavian countries. Both have booming economies -- led by manufacturing exports in Sweden and oil exports in Norway. Sweden's second-quarter economic growth came in at 3.6%, beating expectations. Norway's unemployment level is at its lowest level in 20 years, and wages in both countries are rising fast -- at about a 4.5% clip in Sweden and 6% in Norway.  The two countries' interest-rate policies are also boosting housing prices. Although rates have been rising in recent years, to 3.5% in Sweden and 4.75% in Norway, they are still about one percentage point below what the Swedish and Norwegian central banks see as neutral. "Nordic rates are still low," which is "still buoying demand," says Dominic Bryant, a London-based economist at BNP Paribas.
