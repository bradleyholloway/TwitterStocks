 Pregnant? Skip Teeth Whitener   By Zimmerman, Rachel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2004  Each year about 40 million Americans try whitening their teeth, either in the dentist's office or at home using an over-the-counter product. Teeth whiteners work by either bleaching the teeth with various concentrations of carbamide or hydrogen peroxide or by simply removing surface stains with lesser concentrations of the same chemicals. Methods include whitening strips, paint-on whiteners and whitening trays, which hook on and allow teeth to soak in a chemical bath. In laser bleaching, done in a dentist's office, a highly concentrated peroxide solution is applied and a laser is shined on the teeth to speed bleaching.  The leading over-the-counter whitening product, Crest Whitestrips, which posted $300 million in sales last year, doesn't have a warning on the label against use during pregnancy. Procter & Gamble Co., which sells the strips, says there is "no evidence of any problem." But spokesman Brian McCleary says Procter & Gamble encourages pregnant women "to check with their doctors before starting."
