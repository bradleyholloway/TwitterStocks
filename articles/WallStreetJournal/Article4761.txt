 Banks battle for mortgage customers   By Choi, Audrey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1991  Mortgage holders are rushing to refinance their loans at fixed interest rates below 10%. Banks are trying to keep their own mortgage customers while wooing their competitors' with: 1) special rates for the most credit-worthy customers; 2) fast service guarantees; 3) financial counseling and processing assistance; and 4) reduced or eliminated processing fees. Banks heavily cross-sell a variety of products to new mortgage customers. Commercial banks now make more first mortgages than savings and loan associations, which emphasize adjustable-rate loans.
