 This Government In Exile Is Poles Apart From Warsaw --- A Retired Accountant Keeps The Polish State Alive -- And Free of Communists   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1990  Overthrown in 1939 through the connivance of Hitler and Stalin, the legitimately elected government of Poland packed up its state seals and the handwritten original of its constitution and decamped to Romania. After a stop in France and some complications involving communism, it established itself here, in a posh corner house with a cream-painted portico at 43 Eaton Place. It is still at the same address 51 years later, and in no hurry to move home.  Mr. [Bohdan] Wendorff, who is 86 years old, sits at his desk in the front office on a quiet Tuesday, finishing a cheese sandwich. (The government meets on Mondays and Wednesdays.) On a table behind him, the day's mail awaits opening: Polish newspapers from the United States and Australia, the phone bill, an official-looking envelope marked, "Urgent Reply Requested. Open Now. #5,000 Cash Prize."  When war broke out, Mr. Wendorff was a county clerk in Poland's Interior Ministry. He escaped to join Poland's Army in France, then served under British command and in 1945 became aide-de-camp to the first president of the Polish Government in Exile. His 18 fellow ministers and undersecretaries all fled, too, and suffered the war's ordeals -- imprisoned in Siberia, embattled at Tobruk -- and the indignity of its outcome for Poland. As a point of honor, they vowed never to set foot in their homeland until it was free.
