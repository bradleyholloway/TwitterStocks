 Senate panel votes Farm Credit bailout, approves forming new market for loans   By Ingersoll, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1987  The Senate Agriculture Committee has unanimously approved a $4 billion Farm Credit System bond market bailout and a $6.4 billion Farmer Mac secondary ag loan market. The Reagan administration objects that the officially titled Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. will raise competition for farm loans. Farmer Mac will get a $1.5 billion Treasury line of credit, desperately needed by the Farm Credit System, which stands to lose nearly $8 billion in the 1985-1991 period.
