 WMD in Iraq   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  This is another illustration of how our enemies in Iraq reveal themselves in plain sight -- even if many prefer not to see. Many of the same human-rights activists who urged the West to act against Saddam Hussein's use of poison gas against the Kurds now keep silent as chemicals are used by the terrorists who want to restore Baathist rule in Baghdad. There's not much doubt that the terrorists would employ far more destructive WMD if they could. If they prevail using such tactics in Iraq, their method and damage will spread.
