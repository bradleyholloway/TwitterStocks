 Edison Is Dealt School Setbacks In Two Key States   By By Robert Tomsho, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2002  Serving kindergarten through eighth grade, Wintergreen marked an early bid by Edison to prove that its methods could succeed in the public school arena. Edison has run the 590-student school since 1998, when it was opened by a consortium of four New Haven-area school districts under the auspices of Area Cooperative Educational Services, a regional education agency, known as ACE. ACE's governing board is expected to vote on the Wintergreen recommendation June 13.  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia school-reform commission selected one of its own administrators to manage 19 so-called reconstituted schools, wherein management has the right to broadly restructure staff in a bid to spur achievement. The commission announced last month that Edison was unlikely to be chosen to provide any services to the 19 reconstituted schools. Mr. [Adam Tucker] said Edison will "remain focused" on the Philadelphia schools it has been chosen to manage.
