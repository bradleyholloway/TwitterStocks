 Nucor Lifts Prices Of Its Sheet Steel Another 2% to 3%   By Norton, Erle, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 1996  Nucor's increase raises the price of hot-rolled sheet to $320 a ton, cold-rolled sheet to $460 a ton, and coated sheet to $470 a ton. Hot-rolled is the least processed sheet steel, while coated is the most processed. Sheet steel is used in a wide variety of applications ranging from 55-gallon drums and pails to electric motors and metal buildings.  Nucor's move came just four days after a 3% price increase by several other major steelmakers, including USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group and LTV Corp., on sheet steel went into effect. Analysts said that price increase is sticking, and some expect that other major steelmakers will follow Nucor's latest increase soon.
