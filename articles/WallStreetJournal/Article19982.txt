 Buying the Returned Home; As More People Walk Away From Contracts, Some Builders Cut Prices; How to Spot Deals   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2006  In Virginia, Brookfield Homes Corp. is running a "FastMove" special with discounts on roughly 60 homes that are completed or will be ready in 30 days. Among the recent offers: a reduction of nearly $100,000 on a five-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath home in Lansdowne, originally priced at $997,925. "A lot of those properties were originally sold to someone else," says Gregg Hughes, a general sales manager in Virginia for Brookfield.  Unless you have a compelling need to move, "it's better to be prudent and wait," says Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst with Credit Suisse. "It seems as if the builders are going to get more aggressive and offer more discounts that will make it more compelling for buyers." In some cases, she notes, buyers who thought they had nabbed a good deal have been surprised to find their builder offering a similar home at a lower price a few months later.  It doesn't hurt to ask, either. Some builders, such as Pulte Homes Inc., based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., "are very private about their incentives," says Rick Murray, a housing analyst with Raymond James & Associates. "You are only aware of them upon taking a look at the community."
