 ATA Replaces Its Airline Unit's CEO   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2002  The executive added that ATA is committed to expanding its charter business, which it expects will generate $300 million in revenue this year. Last year, the company produced about $360 million in charter revenue, down more than 17% from 2000 levels. Last year, ATA produced $820.7 million in scheduled revenue, up 8.9% from 2000. But in scheduled service, the pricing environment has been weak since Sept. 11. And that problem has prompted Mr. [George Mikelsons] to take the pruning sheers to ATA's costs at the same time he realigns the company's structure, he said.  Mr. Mikelsons said Mr. [John Tague] resigned to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Tague, 40 year old, couldn't be reached for comment. This was the second time he resigned from ATA. He quit as president in 1995 and divided his time as CEO of two, money-losing carriers, Vanguard Airlines and Air South. Mr. Tague returned to ATA in 1997 as president and CEO. Last year, he earned $512,885 in salary, according to the ATA's proxy statement.
