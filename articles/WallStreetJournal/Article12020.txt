 Daiwa's Travails Ripple Through Japan's Banking Sector --- Sumitomo in Merger Talks; Union Would Create World's Largest Bank   By By Jathon Sapsford and Robert Steiner, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1995  Sumitomo Bank Ltd. executives said they are in discussions with their counterparts at Daiwa Bank Ltd. about the possibility of merging the two banks into what would be the world's biggest bank, based on loan assets.  Japanese regulators are also playing a role in the deal, people in the banking industry said. The Finance Ministry has asked Sumitomo to help Daiwa pull out of the U.S. Nomura Securities Co., the world's biggest brokerage concern, which has long historical ties to Daiwa, has also been asked to assist Daiwa in unwinding its U.S. operations.  A Daiwa-Sumitomo combination would create a Japanese banking colossus bigger than the new bank to be created in April 1996 by a merger between Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., whose combined loans outstanding total $719 billion. Sumitomo and Daiwa have combined loan assets of $773 billion.
