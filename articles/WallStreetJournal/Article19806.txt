 Holders of Fannie's Bonds Say: No Worries!; Even as Stockholders Run Away, The Debt Side Finds Comfort In U.S. Backing, More Oversight   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2004  As with most bonds, traders and professional investors track the Fannie bonds' movements in terms of the yield they pay relative to super-safe Treasurys. On Friday, the yield on Fannie's 10-year notes was 0.565 percentage point above the 10-year Treasury note. The bigger the difference, or spread, between the interest rate on U.S. Treasurys and other issuers' debt, the bigger the perceived risk of the issuer.  That spread is up 13% from 0.50 percentage point Sept. 21, the day before Fannie's regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, issued its report alleging accounting improprieties. The spread initially widened out to 0.54 percentage point, then narrowed to 0.535 after Fannie's pact with Ofheo a week ago to increase its capital requirements, among other changes, before expanding again on news of the criminal probe.  Asian investors -- mostly institutions and central banks that are restricted to holding triple-A-rated debt -- hold 17% of Fannie Mae's benchmark securities, while Europeans hold about 12% and U.S. investors have 68%, according to data from a July presentation posted on Fannie Mae's Web site.
