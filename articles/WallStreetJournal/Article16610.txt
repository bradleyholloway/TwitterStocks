 Travel Watch: Minimize Charge-Card Fees on Trips Abroad   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2006  American Express, which issues most of its own cards, charges a 2% fee. Banks that issue American Express cards may add additional fees. Discover cards don't charge a currency-conversion fee, but they are accepted in a limited number of countries outside the U.S., mostly in North America.  A few credit-card issuers charge no currency conversion fee at all. Cards issued by Capital One -- the fifth-largest credit-card issuer -- charge no currency-conversion fee and don't pass along Visa and MasterCard fees, a spokeswoman says. Many smaller banks and credit unions also don't charge a fee.  It may make sense to use a debit card rather than a credit card. Some banks charge a lower currency-conversion fee, such as 1%, on their debit cards or a flat fee on ATM withdrawals. Citibank charges 3% on credit-card purchases and 1% on debit-card purchases, a spokesman says.
