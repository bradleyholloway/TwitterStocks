 Soccer Is Still the Stepchild of the Sports World   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2000  If we can't raise a home audience for the best soccer has to offer, what chance does the MLS have, thought I. I thought that thought Saturday night in the press box of the Cotton Bowl here, watching the MLS's Dallas Burn and Los Angeles Galaxy have it out in a midseason game. Before and beneath me was the crowd of 19,644 that had paid to witness the contest. The venerable stadium in the Texas State Fairgrounds holds 67,700 people for football, but for soccer its end-zone and upper-deck seating areas are closed off, scaling down the house to a capacity of about 22,500. A bit of quick math suffices to show that Saturday's turnout filled about 85% of that.  The figure was well above average for the MLS this year, but that's not entirely good news for the league. Founded in 1996 off the momentum of the U.S.'s wildly successful hosting of the 1994 World Cup, a 10-team MLS drew an average crowd of 17,406 in its inaugural season, but that fell to 14,619 the next year. The circuit expanded to its present 12 teams in 1998, but average-crowd figures dipped again, to 14,312, and to 14,282 in the succeeding campaign. This season's average of 13,453 before Saturday has continued the decline, and if the slope isn't steep, it still heads downward. Our increased familiarity with the game of the foot hasn't made us love it better.  Lacking domestic candidates even though 40 of the 53 players in the U.S. national team pool are under contract to MLS clubs, the league has looked abroad for such standouts. Alas, without the resources of world soccer's established national circuits (mainly those of England, Italy, Germany and Spain), most of the few "name" foreign players it's been able to attract are superannuated. In this category are such current MLSers as Germany's Lothar Matthaeus, Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov and Columbia's Carlos Valderrama.
