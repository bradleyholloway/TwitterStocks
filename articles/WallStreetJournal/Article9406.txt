 The Return of `Good' and `Evil'   By By Michael Novak, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2002  Nearly 20 years ago, President Reagan caused a firestorm (one of many) when he called the Soviet Union an "evil empire." "Manicheanism," snorted expatriate Americans in Paris and London, distancing themselves from a lowbrow president. "Incendiary!" worried the diplomatic set. Tony Dolan, White House speechwriter extraordinaire of those days, used to say that every office that reviewed President Reagan's speech before he gave it -- State Department, National Security Council, etc. -- struck out the offending phrase; the president kept writing it back in. The president knew just what he was doing. No one else seemed to. The logic Ronald Reagan used then now seems to be working for George W. Bush. But in reverse.  Some wracked their brains with thoughts of missile defense, perpetual shortages of everything from soap to vodka, the U.S. military buildup. The general banged his fist again. "That damn speech about the evil empire! That's what did it!" The general was standing now, and to the questioning eyes of one American he added: "It was an evil empire. It was."  President Bush, like President Reagan before him, has returned us to the moral framework of good and evil, where our founders began all thinking. There is evil in the world, and it coagulates, it gathers force, and if it bursts its bounds endangers everybody. "Axis of evil"? Yes, there can be such things. How could we ever have doubted it? What dream were we living in, what sort of mist, what fog?
