 Winter Wheat Crop Forecast From U.S. Will Show Effects of Dryness, Many Say   By By Scott Kilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1988  Daniel Basse, an analyst at GNP Commodities Inc., Chicago, said he expects the government to trim its yield forecast for Kansas, a major winter wheat state, to 34 bushels an acre from its May forecast of 38 bushels an acre. The yield in Kansas last summer was 37 bushels an acre.  However, soybean and corn futures prices soared Friday amid growing speculation that a continuation of the unusually dry weather could weaken the young crops. On Friday, several meteorologists called for below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures for much of the Midwest through this week.  In trading Friday, the prices of six soybean futures contracts set life-of-contract highs by closing up 30 cents a bushel, the daily limit permitted by the Chicago Board of Trade. Five corn futures contracts rose the daily limit of 10 cents a bushel and set life-of-contract highs.
