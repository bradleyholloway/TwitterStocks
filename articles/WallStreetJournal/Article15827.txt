 Nasdaq Enters Correction Territory As Internet Stocks Keep Tumbling   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1999  Key measures of Internet-related stocks sank below their mid-June lows, dragging the Nasdaq Composite Index into what is considered "correction" territory. The selling came despite a rally in bond prices and a big merger announcement involving Union Carbide that spared the Dow Jones Industrial Average similar damage: The industrials edged down 2.54 to 10674.77.  The biggest Internet leaders were clocked for a fifth straight day on Nasdaq: Yahoo! sank 4 3/8 to 121, Amazon.com fell 6 7/16 to 88 7/16 and eBay lost 8 5/8 to 75 3/4. America Online fell 1 3/8 to 87 7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. All are off 50% or more from their highs.  There was no particular news driving the online plunge, other than the continued collision of enormous supply of new issues and a slackening appetite among small investors trading the stocks online. Among yesterday's initial public stock offerings, Fairchild Semiconductor International, a well-established non-Internet company, edged up 1/4 from its offering price on the Big Board to 18 3/4 and the American depositary receipts of Internet Initiative Japan rose 8 5/16 to 31 5/16 on Nasdaq.
