 Organized Crime Begins Using Canada as a Base For Operations Ranging From Drugs to Car Theft   By By Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1998  Attracted by comparatively weak laws governing their activities, mobsters in the past decade have made Canada "one of the most important bases for the globalization of organized crime," says Antonio Nicaso, a Canadian authority on global crime. Adds Jack Ramsay, a member of the Canadian Parliament: "The laws say to the professional criminal that Canada is an easy mark."  Canada's organized-crime wave directly affects the U.S. Police say drug smuggling into the U.S. from Canada is rampant. In recent years, Canada has become a key entry point for Asian heroin headed for North American markets, and Washington Attorney General Chris Gregoire said in May that his state is "worried about the high-quality, high-potency marijuana which is moving from British Columbia into Washington."  Jim Fisher, a Vancouver, British Columbia, police officer on temporary assignment with Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, adds: "Canada is one of the main centers in the world" for counterfeit credit-card technology. "We've seen over and over again in the U.S. when Los Angeles and New York had a lot of problems with it, it was Canadian-Asian criminals that were running the operations," says Mr. Fisher, an expert on Asian organized crime in Canada. Not surprisingly, Visa International's Canadian unit says its credit-card fraud rate jumped 31% last year from 1996, more than double the increase world-wide, and a Visa Canada official places the blame on growing organized-crime groups.
