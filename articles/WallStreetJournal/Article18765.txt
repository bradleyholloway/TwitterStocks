 Mercedes Sales In U.S. Climbed 15% Last Month   By By Nichole M. Christian and Robert L. Simison, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1996  Mercedes-Benz AG, the auto-making unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, posted a 15% increase in December vehicle sales in the U.S. and forecast substantial sales growth in the U.S. over the next two or three years.  Mercedes-Benz was one of several auto companies operating in the U.S. to report December sales yesterday. Nissan Motor Co., No. 5 in the U.S. market, said its light-vehicle sales in December rose 4.5% from a year earlier to 33,236 cars and light trucks. While several of the smaller-volume auto companies also reported sales, the Big Three U.S. auto makers and other leading importers are expected to announce generally unimpressive December sales today.
