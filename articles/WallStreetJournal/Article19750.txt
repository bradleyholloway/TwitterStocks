 Readers Forum: "In an election year, nothing will be done"   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2004  No radical surgery. In three words, that's what Wall Street Journal Sunday readers say they want for the Social Security system after reading our Personal Business article, "How 'Fixing' Social Security Might Hit You," by Greg Ip (March 28). You responded in droves, and letters are still coming in.  Change the name "payroll tax" to some term that reflects what the deduction/contribution really is for. Just changing the name from a tax will make any increases more palatable to politicians as well as individuals.  Social Security needs to go away. Our whole retirement scheme needs to be reworked. I favor a single retirement account handled by a mutual-fund-type company like Fidelity or Vanguard with administrators of Social Security regulating these revamped "retirement security companies."
