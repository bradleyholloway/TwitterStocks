 Researchers Report Preliminary Success Using Immune Booster to Treat Cancer   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1985  Scientists at the National Cancer Institute reported preliminary success using the immune system booster interleukin-2, or IL-2, in a new, two-step treatment for otherwise untreatable cancer patients.  Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of the institute's surgery branch, said that in 11 of 25 cases, tumors shrank by more than half in patients with melanoma, colon, kidney and lung cancer that had spread beyond the reach of chemotherapy and radiation. One patient's tumor regressed completely. Patients with sarcoma and cancer of the esophagus didn't respond.  IL-2 is a naturally occuring immune booster known as a lymphokine. Dr. Rosenberg used synthetic IL-2 manufactured by Cetus Corp., an Emeryville, Calif., genetic engineering company. In addition to Cetus, a number of other gene-splicing companes are working on IL-2, including Biogen N.V. of Cambridge, Mass., and Geneva, Switzerland; Immunex Corp. of Seattle; Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and several Japanese concerns.
