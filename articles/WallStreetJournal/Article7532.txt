 English Education: State Schools' Decay Is a Big Issue in Britain As a Generation Suffers --- More in Middle Class Attend The Independent Schools, Deepening Class Divisions --- The Risk of a 'Yob Society'   By By James M. Perry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1986  Teachers have been striking spasmodically -- some days they work, some days they don't show up -- for more than a year. Extracurricular activities have been canceled. Athletic contests with neighboring schools have been dropped. There are 1,300 students, aged 11 to 18, at the state-maintained school, located across the River Mersey from Liverpool. Last year, 18 out of a senior class that had dwindled to 80 students went on to a college or university.  So is Sir Keith Joseph, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's oldest and closest adviser. He has been replaced as secretary of state for education. In an interview before packing up, Sir Keith insisted that conditions in the schools would get better when the reforms he initiated -- a new curriculum, a simpler examination system and improved teacher training -- begin to take hold.  There is a painful paradox here, for Britain is world-famous for its schools. Eton, Harrow, Rugby and Winchester are ancient and hallowed. But these are Britain's best-known "public" (meaning, of course, private) schools, and only 6% of the student population attends independent schools of any kind.
