 Personal Business: Solar Power Isn't for Tightwads   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2006  That $2,000 tax savings won't shave much off the sky-high price tag of installing solar panels. A system of photovoltaic panels that convert solar radiation into a home's electricity often costs about $8,000 per kilowatt before incentives. That's a total investment of anywhere from $16,000 to $64,000, considering that most homes need between a two- and an eight-kilowatt system to replace most or all of their electricity needs. (The higher end of the range may include homes that use electricity to power their heating systems.)  The credit makes a bigger dent for people buying a solar thermal water heater, which uses a special solar panel to heat a home's water supply. These usually cost about $7,000, so the $2,000 credit shaves about 30% off the price. (The federal tax credit can't be used if the solar water heater is primarily being used to heat a swimming pool or hot tub.)  Ideally, the panels are placed on a large swath of roof that faces south or southwest and isn't obstructed by trees or buildings. "Shading is going to reduce your energy [production] quite a bit," says David Hochschild, executive director of PV Now, a consortium of solar-panel manufacturers. A south-facing roof gets 12% more solar radiation on average than one facing north, he adds.
