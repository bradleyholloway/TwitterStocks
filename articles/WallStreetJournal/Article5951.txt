 Bumpers on Some Pickups and SUVs Show Poor Performance in Crash Tests   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  The vehicles tested included four pickup trucks: General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Silverado, the Ford F-150, Toyota Motor Corp.'s Tundra and the Dodge Ram, a DaimlerChrysler AG product. In addition to the Escape, the institute tested two more SUVs, Hyundai Motor Co.'s Santa Fe and the Toyota RAV4.  Of the small SUVs tested, the institute said Toyota's RAV4 earned the worst mark. Toyota said in a statement that both RAV4 and Tundra "meet or exceed all federal requirements for crashworthiness."
