 Former Unit Of FleetBoston Receives Fines --- Total of $33 Million Is Levied Over IPO Deals, Stock Research; SEC Sees Violation by Analyst   By By Randall Smith and John Hechinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2003  Mr. [Paul E. Johnson]'s attorneys, Mark Pomerantz and Eric Goldstein of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP, said in a statement, "The SEC's complaint is not supported by the facts or the law. Mr. Johnson's conduct is consistent with the SEC's rules and regulations as they then existed, and he will litigate this case aggressively."  In a separate focus of the regulators, Robertson Stephens executives formed a series of limited partnerships to invest in private companies, including Corvis Corp., an optical-networking firm. Mr. Johnson invested $90,000 in two of the partnerships. After Corvis conducted an initial public offering in July 2000, Mr. Johnson repeatedly rated it a "buy." But, in January 2001, Mr. Johnson privately told executives running the partnerships that the stock was worth only half its then-market price of $24.50 per share, the SEC said. The partnership then sold its Corvis shares, and Mr. Johnson reaped a profit of $127,987, the agency said. Mr. Johnson later sold additional shares in the open market for an average price below $20, while maintaining his "buy" rating," the SEC said. Corvis shares now trade below $1.
