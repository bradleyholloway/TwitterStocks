 Chinese Stock-Brokerage Firms Offer Details of $3 Billion Merger   By By Karby Leggett, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1999  The entity formed by the merger of Guotai Securities and J&A Securities steps instantly into the top position in China's fledgling brokerage and investment banking industry. With 120 trading outlets and 5,000 employees nationwide, Guotai-J&A Securities becomes the largest securities broker and underwriter in China.  The company will be based in Shanghai and run by Jin Jiandong, the former head of Guotai Securities. Yao Gang, the former chief regulator of China's futures market, will be second in charge at Guotai-J&A Securities, company officials said.  The Guotai-J&A tie-up also appears to mark the official conclusion of a scandal that shook China's nascent securities industry. Zhang Guoqing, J&A Securities' former chairman, and Yang Jun, its former president, came under investigation a year ago for privatizing J&A. China prohibits the privatization of financial firms.
