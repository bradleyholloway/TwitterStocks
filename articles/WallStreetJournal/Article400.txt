 Capgemini Posts Full-Year Net Loss; Margins Improve   By Lagrotteria, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2005  In the second half, however, Capgemini's margins improved from the first half. Tighter cost control under recently named Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Dufourcq helped to lift its operating margin to 2.35% in the second half, and Capgemini predicts a margin of 3% to 3.2% for 2005.  Five years after buying Ernst & Young's consulting services in the U.S., Mr. [Paul Hermelin]'s stewardship has failed to make the company profitable, despite more than 1 billion euros in charges and 17,000 job cuts. [Capgemini] hasn't paid a dividend since 2001.  Last month, though, Standard & Poor's said the management changes weren't enough and cut Capgemini's debt to junk status, potentially raising its financing costs just as it tries to win more investment- heavy outsourcing contracts.
