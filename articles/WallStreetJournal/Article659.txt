 Bookshelf: Conversations With the Fuehrer   By By Walter Laqueur, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1985  But there is no doubt about the authenticity of the material in "Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant" (Yale University Press, 333 pages, $29.95), translated from German by Ruth Hein and edited by Henry Ashby Turner Jr., a history professor at Yale University.  Mr. Turner is the leading expert on the German economy during the Nazi period, and his previous work, "German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler," published earlier this year, has received wide acclaim. It has also been the target of some peculiar criticism, such as a recent mention in Publisher's Weekly that said Mr. Turner "attempted to absolve German industry from backing Hitler." Actually, Mr. Turner dealt with the role of big business before Hitler's seizure of power, and did not try to absolve anyone.  Born in 1888 in southern Germany, Wagener served as an officer in the First World War, and subsequently with the Free Corps of the extreme right. He was a company director in 1929 when he first met Hitler, who appointed him chief of staff of the storm troopers, the SA. At the same time he acted as head of the economy section of the Nazi Party. For a few months after the Nazis took over he was even state commissar for the economy.
