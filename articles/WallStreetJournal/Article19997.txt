 Politics & Economics: Mad-Cow Case Frustrates Officials; Fruitless Alabama Search Is Cited by Regulators Calling for ID Program   By Kilman, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2006  The 10-year-old Alabama beef cow, which was diagnosed in March and didn't enter the food chain, was breeding stock and most likely contracted the disease by eating contaminated rations in the first year of its life. Investigators were trying to find the infected cow's birthplace to track down other cows that probably ate the same feed.  The Bush administration didn't put the idea of a national identification system on the front burner until after the first U.S. case of mad-cow disease was discovered in December 2003 on a Washington state dairy farm. In that case, U.S. regulators were able to locate the sick animal's Alberta birthplace only because it carried an ear tag issued in Canada.
