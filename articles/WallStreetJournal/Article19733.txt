 Ford Looks to Jump-Start Stalled Mercury Brand   By Shirouzu, Norihiko, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  Ford is expected today to announce plans to build a new Mercury sports wagon -- a derivative of the Ford Freestyle sport wagon due out this fall. In a speech on the first day of the Chicago auto show's two-day media preview, Chairman and Chief Executive William Clay Ford Jr. is expected to tout the Mercury wagon as evidence of his company's commitment to the Mercury brand and to Chicago, where the vehicle's production is expected to begin in 2007, according to individuals familiar with Ford's plans.  Ford's rush of new Mercury products comes at a time when not-quite- luxury Detroit brands such as Mercury and General Motors Corp.'s Buick are getting hammered by premium European and Japanese brands such as Mercedes, BMW and Lexus, as well as second-tier luxury brands including Ford's own Jaguar and Volvo.  Mr. Ford's predecessor, Jacques Nasser, who was ousted from his CEO position in 2001, tried to kill the Mercury brand in order to focus resources on revamping Lincoln, Ford's other upscale brand. Mr. Ford, the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, reversed that strategy shortly after he fired Mr. Nasser. Mr. Ford told subordinates to come up with an affordable strategy to revive both Lincoln and Mercury as part of a five-year restructuring plan that began in 2002.
