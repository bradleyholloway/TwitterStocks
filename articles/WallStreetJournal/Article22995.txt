 AstraZeneca's Exanta Proves Effective for Heart Patients   By By Daniel Rosenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2003  In the European trial, patients treated with warfarin suffered 56 strokes or embolic events during the study period, compared with 40 strokes among Exanta patients, said Jonathan Halperin, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center, who spoke on behalf of investigators. Exanta also caused less bleeding than warfarin. Overall, patients in the 3,407-patient trial who took Exanta suffered a stroke, major bleeding or death at a rate of 4.6% a year compared with 6.1% for patients on warfarin.
