 Letters to the Editor: Cool, Clear Water   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2002  I was disappointed to see you portray the bottled water industry as inappropriately recommending the widely regarded guidance to drink eight, 8-ounce servings of water each day ("Health Experts Question Role of Eight Glasses of Water a Day," May 23). We did not invent that guidance, which pre-dates the rise of bottled water products, nor do bottled water companies wrongfully promote the "eight-by-eight" recommendation.
