 U.S. Hopes to Spur Gas Drilling in Gulf   By By Alexei Barrionuevo and Chip Cummins, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2000  The U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service, which oversees leases in the Gulf, is worried that the shallower depths most producers have been targeting don't contain enough reserves to substantially increase U.S. supply. Despite frenzied drilling for natural gas in recent months, production from shallow-water gas fields in the Gulf has declined by 13% since 1996. Overall Gulf of Mexico gas production was down 6% through April of this year from 1999.  To try to reverse the trend, the Minerals Management Service's new royalty relief scheme allows producers to be freed from royalties for the first 20 billion cubic feet of production from wells drilled 15,000 feet or more below sea level. Producers also will be encouraged to drill more so-called subsalt wells -- those that extend below the thick, horizontal salt sheets that cover much of the Gulf floor.  Drilling in deeper depths on the shelf is risky and challenging. Only 140 wells have been drilled below 18,000 feet on the shelf, and the success rate of those wells is poor. "These are expensive wells, perhaps three times as costly as other wells on the shelf," said James Stone, an analyst at UBS Warburg LLC.
