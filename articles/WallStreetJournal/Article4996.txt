 Giant Worms Drew Tourists to Village, But Lure Is Gone --- Now Travelers to Australia Visit A Museum to Experience Something `Wormderful'   By By James P. Sterba, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1993  To the astonishment of local dairy farmers, their local worm, the Giant Gippsland Earthworm, or GGE for short, turned up in Geneva, Switzerland, on a list of the world's endangered invertebrates -- bugs, mostly. The Melbourne zoologist who nominated it for the list argued that the worm, reputed to be as big around as a garden hose and as long as 10 feet, was "vulnerable" in part because it was getting too much publicity.  Until then, the publicity came mainly from Korumburra's annual, weeklong giant worm festival, which attracts thousands of visitors and their badly-needed cash each March. The endangered bug list, published by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, only added to the worm's fame. Faraway museums pleaded for specimens of the GGE, which makes loud gurgling and sucking sounds as it slithers through its muddy burrows. Rumors of a worm-smuggling underground spread. Alarmed environmentalists called for the creation of the world's first worm preserve -- out of thousands of acres of prime pasture, thus potentially endangering the local dairy farmers.  Meanwhile, at the Victoria Museum in Melbourne, Beverley D. Van Praagh, a 29-year-old zoologist, has been studying the GGE for her doctoral thesis full time since 1987 despite articles in the tabloids dubbing her "worm woman." She says the worm's size has been exaggerated: It averages only about three feet in length, and its habitat seems to be much smaller than the 250,000 acres of South Gippsland surveyed earlier, says Ms. Van Praagh. Digging around Bill Green's dairy farm near Poowong every two weeks or so, she says the worm's range appears limited to within 100 feet or so of a water source. Most live in stream banks, she says.
