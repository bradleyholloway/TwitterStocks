 Brierley Concern Seeks to Control Board of REIT   By By G. Christian Hill, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1987  Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., an investment firm controlled by New Zealand financier Ronald Brierley, said it plans to launch a proxy fight to oust the board of Consolidated Capital Income Trust, a once-financially troubled real estate investment trust that is slowly liquidating its assets.  But Industrial Equity's interest indicates that Mr. Brierley believes the market may be undervaluing the trust's assets. Mr. Brierley has made a fortune for his shareholders in pursuing companies with undervalued shares in his own country, in Australia, and in the United Kingdom. In the 1980s he has expanded into the U.S., starting with his purchase of the Higbee Co., a department-store chain based in Cleveland. According to estimates, the New Zealand equivalent of $580 invested in Mr. Brierley's first company 26 years ago would now be worth more than the equivalent of $5.2 million if dividends and other proceeds were fully reinvested.
