 Policy of Appeasement Is a Policy of Doom   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2004  Marty Peretz's Oct. 4 editorial-page commentary "Kerry Haters for Kerry" did a good job of justifying the "hate" and nothing to explain the "for." While I would rather not use inflammatory terms like "hate," I must say that I am now even more convinced that President Bush is the better choice.
