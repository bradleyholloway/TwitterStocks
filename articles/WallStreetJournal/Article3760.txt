 Another Italian Scandal Feared With Fraud Probe at Finmatica   By Brian Lagrotteria and Elena Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2004  Finmatica said prosecutors were investigating its statements detailing cash available on its books, as well as its earnings statements for the full year 2002 and individual quarters of 2003. It said it is confident the investigation will prove Finmatica's innocence.  Finmatica, which develops software for the supply-chain management, finance, health-care and information-security sectors, has cash equal to about 60% of its gross debt. This financial position has raised the same questions that concerned Parmalat investors for the past year: If there is that much cash, why isn't Finmatica using the money to reduce debt, and why is it seeking to issue more debt?  Finmatica's main auditor is Italaudit SpA, formerly Grant Thornton SpA, the erstwhile Italian unit of Grant Thornton International. Grant Thornton's former Italian unit audited the accounts of Parmalat's subsidiaries, and two of the auditor's executives, Lorenzo Penca and partner Maurizio Bianchi, have been arrested for alleged complicity in the alleged Parmalat fraud.
