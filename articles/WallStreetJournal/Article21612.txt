 Chrysler Offering Got a Large Boost From Kerkorian   By By Bradley A. Stertz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1991  HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Enigmatic California investor Kirk Kerkorian gave Chrysler Corp.'s stock offering this week a big boost by deciding to buy 17% of the auto maker's new shares himself.  Bear, Stearns & Co. disclosed yesterday that Chrysler's largest stockholder bought six million of the new shares sold late Tuesday. The purchase didn't raise Mr. Kerkorian's stake in Chrysler, which stands at about 9.8%. But his presence as a buyer was deemed so important that the Wall Street firms underwriting the offering urged him to authorize quickly the public statement confirming his role.  The company was originally wary of Mr. Kerkorian when he rapidly accumulated his Chrysler holdings last December. In response, it immediately toughened its anti-takeover defenses to be triggered when any investor acquired more than 10% of its common stock. But the success of this offering was paramount to Chrysler, and the company appeared glad to have Mr. Kerkorian increase his investment this time. Chrysler officials declined to comment on the stock offering or Mr. Kerkorian's purchase.
