 Oliver North, Businessman? Many Bosses Say That He's Their Kind of Employee --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1987  A poll of the general public reflected the bullishness on Col. North. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken Sunday, 56% of those surveyed said they would hire Col. North; 35% said they wouldn't hire him and 9% weren't sure.  Mr. Kariotis says he would put Col. North on a "panel for special projects. You occasionally have problems with customers -- good and bad -- and people like North would be good for dealing with them. He's got a nice manner about him, and I would feel comfortable about dispatching him for that kind of duty."  Nelson Skalbania, chairman, Ponderosa Ventures Inc., a Vancouver holding company, says he would hire Col. North, "if I had a dirty job to do and didn't want to do it myself. It sounds like he knows how to improvise to get the job done, without dirtying the hands of those who asked him."
