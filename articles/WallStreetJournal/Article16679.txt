 Clear Skies: Behind Easing of Airline Rules, KLM's 20-Year Urge to Merge; Dutch Carrier's Various Links Pushed Legal Boundaries; Inventing Code Sharing; Mr. Van Wijk's Cigar-Box Plan   By Michaels, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2006  As a student in Amsterdam, Mr. [Van Wijk] played baseball as well as youth soccer for Ajax, one of Europe's top teams. Realizing he wouldn't make it as a pro, Mr. Van Wijk joined KLM after earning a master's degree at Amsterdam University. By the mid-1980s, he was a rising star. He joined KLM's board in 1991, continuing to play soccer and tennis on the side.  After intense lobbying by Northwest and KLM, Washington and The Hague signed the first bilateral "Open Skies" pact in 1992. It was a revolutionary deal. Lifting travel restrictions between the U.S. and the Netherlands opened the door for KLM and Northwest to collaborate on schedules, fares and marketing in ways previously considered collusive. KLM put its flight numbers on Northwest flights, expanding the Dutch airline's schedule in markets previously off-limits. Northwest did the same on KLM flights.  Mr. Van Wijk now feels comfortable enough about KLM's future to joke about it. "We considered having one CEO," he recently told an audience of executives at a Dutch business school near Rotterdam. "But we couldn't decide if it should have [Jean-Cyril Spinetta]'s brains and my legs, or vice-versa."
