 Boesky Took Half Of Federal Penalties As Tax Deduction --- Ex-Wall Street Speculator Paid $100 Million to Settle His Insider-Trading Case   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1990  Mr. Boesky, who was was cross-examined for a second day by defense lawyer Thomas Puccio in the trial of John A. Mulheren Jr., admitted that he was forced to give up only a portion of the profits he derived illegally as a result of the November 1986 plea-bargain agreement in his insider-trading case. He said, however, that he couldn't recall how much money he had left after paying the penalties.  But Mr. Boesky said he remembered "very well" a March 1986 trade he did with Mr. Mulheren that he said was "designed to help repay an obligation Mr. Mulheren's firm had to our firm," money owed as a result of illegal trades. Mr. Boesky also said he recalled receiving inside information from former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond wizard Michael Milken. Mr. Milken recently pleaded guilty to six felony counts in connection with fraudulent securities trades done with Mr. Boesky and others.  Mr. Boesky completed his testimony against Mr. Mulheren yesterday without seeming to have helped the government's case much. Mr. Boesky is unlikely to ever take the witness stand again in a criminal case, since virtually all of the individuals he has implicated have pleaded guilty to crimes. Mr. Mulheren is the only individual he has implicated who has chosen to fight the charges against him at trial.
