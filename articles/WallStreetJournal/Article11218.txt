 Soviet Union Confirms Reduction in Oil Exports, Joining Other Producers in Bid to Support Prices   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1989  Although the Soviet Union is the world's biggest oil producer, its contribution to efforts of non-OPEC exporters to help the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tighten supplies will be modest -- probably less than 100,000 barrels a day. But some analysts said the Soviets may already have done their part. An unconfirmed report last Thursday concerning the Soviet cut triggered a burst of buying in U.S. crude futures, adding at least 30 cents a barrel to the price of West Texas intermediate.  The futures price for the U.S. benchmark crude for April delivery dropped 16 cents a barrel Friday to settle at $18.56, but gained 49 cents for the week, nevertheless. And the market was closed when the Soviets confirmed their participation in the coordinated move by independent producers to trim exports to support prices during the seasonally weak second quarter.  According to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, the Soviet Union currently produces 12.5 million barrels a day and exports some 1.9 million barrels a day. A 5% cut thus would equal only 95,000 barrels a day. Analysts suggested Soviet exports probably have already dropped that much this year because of production troubles, including disruptions from earthquakes.
