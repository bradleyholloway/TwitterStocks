 Bridges Falling Down   By Lewis, Al, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2012  Bridge expert Barry LePatner has just launched a Google map marking 7,980 bridges that could fall like the I-35W Mississippi Bridge at any moment. "Every bridge engineer I talk to around the country acknowledges that this will happen on every one of these bridges that's not being remediated," says Mr. LePatner.
