 Reagan Says Gorbachev Must Attend '86 Summit or Forget Future Parleys   By By Albert R. Hunt Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1986  President Reagan threw down the gauntlet to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on a summit: Show up this year or forget about subsequent summits.  After explaining that the U.S. still is waiting to hear something specific from the Soviets, Mr. Reagan added: "If it does slip through our fingers, I've got news for them: There won't be an '87 summit in Moscow." The Soviets were hoping for a summit there next year, and it's unlikely that any summit would be held in 1988, President Reagan's last year in office.  Much of the session focused on the president's controversial request for $100 million in military and other aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua. Mr. Reagan forcefully defended aid for the Contras and took some sharp swipes at critics in Congress, where the request faces strong opposition in the House. Asked if he equated opposition with support for the Marxist regime in Managua, he replied, "It's hard not to."
