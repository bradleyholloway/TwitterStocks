 A Marine Officer Dispenses Her Legal Advice in Kosovo   By By Glenn Burkins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1999  CERNICA, Kosovo -- For Elizabeth Crail, an Ally McBeal in combat boots, it is time to dispense some quick legal advice.  Here in Kosovo, where the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit is part of a NATO peacekeeping force, legal advice often comes in the form of Ms. Crail, a 29-year-old captain who sports a Demi Moore haircut and a 9mm pistol strapped to her chest. Her official title is Marine Corps JAG, short for "judge advocate general."  In such matters involving international law, Ms. Crail's legal opinions are often just that: opinions. The real decisions usually rest with her superiors. And indeed, after listening to Ms. Crail's reasoning, higher-ranking officers decide to keep the suspects overnight and then turn them over to even higher officials in NATO.
