 Weapons Hunters Haven'T Found Proof Of A Banned Hussein Arsenal.   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2003  Stressing the picture could change as the search continues, chief weapons searcher David Kay told Congress Iraq's ability to produce chemical weapons was "reduced -- if not entirely destroyed" since the 1991 Gulf War due to sanctions and U.S. bombing. The interim report says there is no evidence yet that Iraq had made big steps to build nuclear arms after 1998 and indicates a biological-warfare programhad been curbed. Ranking Senate intelligence panel members said they were disappointed in the findings.  The Justice Department sent "do not destroy" letters to the Defense and State departments in the expanding investigation of a CIA agent's leaked name. The White House said it hasn't been subpoenaed. Schumer urged Ashcroft to step aside to let an outside counsel handle the probe.  Israel announced plans to build 565 homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Powell said the U.S. has "concerns" about the expansion. A Sharon adviser said Israel doesn't have to meet obligations under the peace "road map" if Palestinians aren't disarming militants.
