 Prohibition Died in a Bootlegger's Car Trunk   By By Ned Crabb, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1987  The Kansas Legislature voted the state county-option wet earlier this summer, which means that any Kansan of legal drinking age now has the opportunity to walk through the swinging doors of his local saloon in a wet county, slap down his money and ask the barman to pour him a shot of 86-proof Old Badgerfoot. For the 107 years before July 1, only private clubs could administer to dry throats.  As I read the stories and saw the photographs of exuberant Kansans in party hats whooping it up with their favorite anesthetics, I could nearly sense the shudder wracking prohibitionists' collective soul. But the temperance folks should realize by now that not only does prohibition not work, it customarily intensifies consumption of the prohibited dreaded substance. Humans are like that; deny them something and they'll want it, even if they didn't want it before they were told they couldn't have it.  The business cards were the standard little 2-by-3 1/2-inchers, with "Al" or "Red" or maybe "Evert and Duane" printed in the middle and then phone numbers in each of the two lower corners. On the backs of the cards were lists, with prices, of about two-dozen brands. The cards were meant for adults who wanted stocks of quality spirits in their homes or for big parties. Most bootleggers delivered to your home -- at night and at the back door. Inevitably, the cards trickled down to delighted youngsters. Liquor that was illegal even in the adult world had a special allure of romance and danger.
