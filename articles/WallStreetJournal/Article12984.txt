 InterActiveCorp Swings to Profit, Falls Short of Own Expectations   By Angwin, Julia, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2003  Barry Diller, chief executive of InterActiveCorp, said the company will end its two-year old practice of disclosing its internal- financial targets, which it calls budgets. "The easiest thing for us to do would be to set budgets that we can exceed," Mr. Diller said. Mr. Diller also said the company will shift its strategy to "de- emphasize" acquisitions. "This area is getting hot again -- we think overheated," he said. He said InterActiveCorp has made 70 acquisitions so far, and the prices are "less compelling right now."
