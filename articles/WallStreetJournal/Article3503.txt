 Conductors Flirt and Preen for a Job in Indiana   By By Barbara Jepson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2001  So it was that Jahja Ling, who led an inspiring program of Mozart and Strauss here recently during the final round of the ISO's three-year head hunt, was scrutinized as he fielded postperformance questions from the audience and vetted at a postconcert dinner hosted by Christel DeHaan, the philanthropist who heads the search committee. For Mr. Ling, named director last year of the Blossom Festival -- summer home of the glorious Cleveland Orchestra -- it was all in a day's work. Highly regarded by musicians and critics, and a frequent guest conductor with major U.S. symphonies, he's had several orchestral flirtations of late.  Which brings us back to Mr. Ling, who has an affinity for the late-19th-century and early-20th-century repertory, as do several other candidates. An affable man who is reportedly meticulous in rehearsals, he communicates seriousness and expressivity onstage. Donald Rosenberg, classical-music critic of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, called his "Verdi Requiem" at the Blossom Festival last summer "music making of thrilling power and humanity." Mr. Ling's concert with the ISO showed he can also lead Mozart with transparency and grace. Although the opening "Haffner Symphony" remained interpretively earthbound, the program gathered steam in an expansive rendering of Richard Strauss's "Burleske in D Minor," with the Russian pianist Lilya Zilberstein as the dazzling guest soloist. Capable of pinpoint articulation and the softest pianissimos, she nonetheless proved a trifle heavy-handed in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 12 in A Major, which followed intermission. Mr. Ling's accompaniment in both works was adroit, filled with lovely touches. In the andante of the Mozart, the strings bowed and swirled like dancers.  The highlight of the evening was the concluding performance of Strauss's "Rosenkavalier" Suite, which had sweep and excitement. Mr. Ling elicited a strong performance from the musicians, vanquishing periodic ensemble problems in the strings that were evident earlier in the evening. He captured the shifting emotions that intrude on the glittering Viennese froth: "The Arrival of the Rose Cavalier" was bittersweet but knowing. The repetitions of the famous waltz theme were sweet or buoyant one moment, sardonic or frenzied the next. If the ISO doesn't engage Mr. Ling, someone else will.
