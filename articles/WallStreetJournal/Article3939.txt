 AT&T's Profit Surges on Cost Cuts   By Young, Shawn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2005  AT&T, which now focuses on serving businesses, last year wrote off $11.4 billion in assets and largely stopped marketing long-distance service to consumers. Those moves aided earnings by sharply reducing depreciation and sales expenses. But AT&T's second-quarter earnings were dented by a loss of $206 million, or 15 cents a share, related to debt repurchases -- and $59 million in merger-related expenses that reduced per-share earnings by six cents. In addition, the company incurred restructuring and other charges of $36 million, or three cents a share. Excluding these items, the company's results were better than many analysts had expected.
