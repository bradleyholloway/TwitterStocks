 Heard on the street: Analysts don't expect Time Warner alliance to add much glitz to US West stock for now   By Carnevale, Mary Lu, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1993  Some analysts say that shares of US West will see only a relatively modest rise from the 43 7/8 of May 20, 1993. The view is based on the assumption that it will probably be a few years before US West sees any significant return from its $2.5 billion investment for a 25.51% stake in Time Warner Entertainment.
