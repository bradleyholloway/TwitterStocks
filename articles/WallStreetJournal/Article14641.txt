 Amax Withdraws From Plan to Buy Falconbridge Ltd.   By By Lynne Kirkpatrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1989  Amax Inc. allowed its 2.85 billion Canadian dollar ($2.42 billion) offer for Falconbridge Ltd. to expire, leaving the way clear for a competing bid by Noranda Inc. and Sweden's Trelleborg AB.  "We didn't consider it would be in our shareholders' best interest to raise the bid," said a spokesman for Amax, which had faced a choice between dropping out or sweetening its C$36.125-a-share offer to match the C$37 offered by Noranda and Trelleborg. "We offered what we felt was full and fair value for Falconbridge."  Bruce Bone, Noranda's vice president and treasurer, said the Amax decision "was a bit of a surprise. It would seem to be the end as far as Amax is concerned." William James, chairman, president and chief executive of Falconbridge, wasn't available for comment.
