 Dollar Is Mixed In Thin Trading; Pound Advances --- Poll Result Aids British Unit As Quiet Market Awaits Start of 5-Nation Talks   By By Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1987  Public opinion polls in Britain that showed the ruling Conservative Party widening its lead over its rivals caused the British pound to rally in otherwise dull foreign-exchange trading yesterday.  The dollar was narrowly mixed in thin trading, and traders said the market could be quiet for the rest of the week while finance ministers from major industrial nations meet in Washington. They cautioned that the calm could be disturbed at any time, however, by leaks or disclosures about the talks.  The Bank of England was rumored to have stepped in to limit the pound's advance yesterday by selling sterling and buying dollars and West German marks. In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6183, up 0.4% from $1.6120 Friday. Sterling also rose against the West German currency to 2.9547 marks from 2.9416. In intraday trading, the pound reached as high as $1.6240 and 2.96 marks, traders said.
