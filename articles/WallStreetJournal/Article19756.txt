 Politics & Policy; POLITICAL CAPITAL: There's No Need For U.S. to Subsidize Broadband Access   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2004  Nevertheless, I'm skeptical. Perhaps it's because I spent the previous weekend trying to exorcise the one computer in my house that has a broadband connection. It had been taken over by digital spirits, which kept it clicking and whirring day and night, and responding to even the simplest commands at a speed that made the Senate look like Smarty Jones. A dialogue box appeared every few minutes, asking if I'd like a particular part of my body enlarged. Pop-up boxes repeatedly offered "savings" on mortgages and auto insurance.  YES, WE LIVE in an information society, and the access to information that broadband provides is awe-inspiring. I spend much of my life in front of a broadband connection, soaking up the latest news. My daughters use it as a research tool, discovering remarkable information about ancient Greek banquets or modern Chinese customs (in between swapping instant messages, playing Clickamajig on Nickelodeon.com, and downloading songs). We've all become more effective consumers, finding new products that meet our needs -- Baja Bob's low-carb margarita mix is my latest discovery -- and checking prices to be certain the store down the street isn't overcharging us.  There's also no need for subsidizing "rural" access to broadband. While broadband use is more common in cities and suburbs, it is spreading rapidly. Rural users may have to pay more, but so what? The government doesn't intervene to ensure I can buy a house in Washington, D.C., at Montana prices. Why would it intervene to ensure Montanans can buy broadband at Washington, D.C., prices?
