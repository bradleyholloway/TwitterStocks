 Web Company Helps Computers Do Business With Each Other   By By Andrea Petersen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1999  WebMethods' goal is to make its software part of every one of those lucrative transactions. While the company won't comment on its future plans, its backers believe that Wall Street may soon be ripe for initial public offerings from business-to-business e-commerce companies like webMethods.  WebMethods' software solves a critical problem for companies wanting to do business over the Internet. Many have proprietary back-office software systems that don't easily "talk" to each other. The webMethods technology allows companies to exchange key bits of data, such as inventory information, pricing and delivery status, regardless of the type of computer systems used.  The software rides on a computer language called XML, or eXtensible Markup Language. XML, which has been adopted by a computer-industry standards body, is a way of identifying bits of data. It works like this: If a company sends a purchase order to a supplier for a shipment of sneakers, XML will place a tag that identifies the different bits of information on the form, such as the price of the product and the quantity desired.
