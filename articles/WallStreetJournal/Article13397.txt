 Get a Human On the Line   The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  For some companies, like Alamo Rent A Car, the site simply gives a phone number that should connect "direct to human." Other firms require special codes. To reach employees at MetLife Bank, for instance, users are instructed to "press 000 rapidly and repeatedly, ignoring messages." To talk with people at the Federal Trade Commission, callers are told to "press 450 at each prompt, ignoring messages."
