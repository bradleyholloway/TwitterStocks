 Lott Says Clinton-Starr Standoff Hurts Government and Urges Both Sides to Act   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1998  Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the standoff between President Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr is hurting the government and needs to be ended by both sides.  Having lectured Mr. Starr to "show his cards" last week, the Mississippi Republican yesterday turned his guns on the president, whom he accused of "stonewalling" and running a White House "spin-doctor operation like I have never seen in my life."  "Nobody knows the whole truth but the president," Mr. Lott said of the controversy surrounding Mr. Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. "Why doesn't he come out and tell us what happened?"
