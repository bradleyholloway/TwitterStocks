 The Economy -- The Outlook: Fed Girds for Interest-Rate Cuts as War Scenarios Unfold   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2003  Another cut in the federal-funds rate would add urgency to deciding on what to do when that rate hits zero. Mr. [Alan Greenspan] last fall said the Fed could simply start buying bonds to force down longer-term, not just short-term, interest rates. At the time, it seemed a theoretical concern, and Fed policy makers say they haven't spent much time discussing how such a shift would be implemented. One option would be to announce targets for two-, three-, five- or 10-year bond yields, then buy enough bonds to bring the yields down to that level. Mr. [Ben Bernanke] and Mr. Greenspan note the Fed did just that during World War II. But some officials worry that such targets would be hard to hit in today's much larger, more sophisticated markets. A more manageable alternative would be to announce the Fed will henceforth buy and sell bonds in an effort to influence long-term interest rates, then leave the implementation to the discretion of the open-market desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The model would be currency intervention: The Fed doesn't set a target when it intervenes on the Treasury Department's behalf but by its actions demonstrates where it wants the dollar to go.
