 Ask Encore / Focus on Retirement   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  Finally, on your tax return, you would report your entire IRA distribution for the year on line 15A of the 1040 form. Then, you subtract the amount that went to charity and enter the difference on line 15B, and follow with the initials "QCD." If your entire $10,000 distribution went to charity, you would enter $10,000 on line 15A and 0 "QCD" on line 15B, says Mr. [Ed Slott]. If you withdrew $50,000, with $10,000 going to charity, you would put $50,000 on 15A and $40,000 "QCD" on 15B, he adds.
