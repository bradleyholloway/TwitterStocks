 Family Finances: Don't Price Your Tag-Sale 'Junk' Too Low   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2004  Used clothing, depending on its condition and brand, may warrant a higher price than you'd expect. A set of Army combat fatigues recently sold for $20 online, with five bids. Well-known brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren's Polo tend to sell best. A used girl's size-3 Gymboree windbreaker recently sold for $27, with 15 bids.  Moreover, just because it sells for $100 on eBay doesn't mean it'll sell that well in your front yard. If you don't have time to sell goods online at auction, try printing out the auction price you saw on the Web. Tuck it underneath your item at the tag sale -- priced for less.
