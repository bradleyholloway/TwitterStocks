 Brilliance China Polishes Image; Car Maker Cuts Prices, Alters Sedans in Bid To Jump-Start Sales   By Qin, Juying, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2007  Brilliance, which listed shares in New York in 1992 and Hong Kong in 1999, has good prospects in that scrimmage. Citigroup rates its stock a "strong buy," with a 12-month price target of three Hong Kong dollars (38 cents) a share. Standard & Poor's Corp. has maintained its rating of "strongly recommended," with a target of HK$2.50.  The company's unusual pedigree -- its Web site says Brilliance is "the first company with all its assets in the [People's Republic of China] listed on the New York Stock Exchange" -- suggests a degree of stability. Currently, Brilliance is the only Chinese auto stock with a Big Board listing. It has been listed in the U.S. longer than some of its scrappy Chinese peers have existed.  In the first quarter of this year, Brilliance sold more than 28,000 Zhonghua sedans, a year-on-year increase of more than 500%. The company's estimated sales volume for 2007 for the sedans is 120,000 units, which it says would make it profitable. And Brilliance's Jinbei light-bus business, which contributes half of its revenue, still has a 37% market share in the country's minibus sector, holding steady at No. 1.
