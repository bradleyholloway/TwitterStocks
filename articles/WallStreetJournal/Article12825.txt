 Stock Options in Asia Face Change   By By Phillip Day, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2002  Like their counterparts in the U.S., employers in Asia saw awarding stock options as a cheap way to attract and keep talent, and employees saw them as a way to get rich quickly while company stocks were going through the roof. But in Asia, as in the U.S., new questions are emerging about whether options have been accounted for properly to show their true costs to companies.  Asia by no means took to options as enthusiastically as the U.S. CLSA Emerging Markets studied 11 Asian blue-chip companies and 11 similar U.S. companies with an eye toward how they might be affected by changes to the accounting treatment of options. Under the changes now being considered, U.S. companies would see their earnings fall an average 14% but earnings at the Asian companies would fall just 6.8%, the study concluded.  In TAIPEI, the Weighted Price Index closed down 5.8%, or 284.22 points, to 4636.67 after President Chen Shui-bian said over the weekend that "there's one country on either side [of the Taiwan Strait]," defying Beijing's position that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest dedicated chip foundry, lost 3.40 New Taiwan dollars to NT$46.50. AU Optronics, Taiwan's largest flat-panel maker, declined NT$2.10 to NT$28.20.
