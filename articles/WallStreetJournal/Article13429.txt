 Braving the Subprime Storm; Tough to Avoid Trouble, As More Parts of Market Start to Move Together   By Justin Lahart, Alistair MacDonald and Joanna Slater, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2007  "When you can't sell your assets that are going bad, you sell assets that are good," says Kim Catechis, who manages $3.8 billion in emerging-market stocks at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. "We've seen some evidence of that."  Aoifinn Devitt at Clontarf Capital in London, who advises family firms and institutions on alternative investments, says most of the commodities funds she sees marketed hail the benefits of not being correlated to other markets. Many investors put money into commodities precisely because they offer diversification. At the end of last year, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund with $245 billion in assets, set aside $500 million for investment in commodities.  Collateralized-debt obligations holding bonds backed by subprime mortgages illustrate how investments don't always perform as expected. CDOs, as they are known, are pooled debt instruments cut into slices, known as tranches. Higher-rated CDO tranches were considered relatively safe because they were structured so they wouldn't get hit until a large proportion of the debt held by the CDO suffers losses. But losses among subprime-backed bonds held by CDOs were far more correlated than expected, causing steep losses.
