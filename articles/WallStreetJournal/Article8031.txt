 Insurers Face Huge Risk in Persian Gulf; Coverage, if Available, May Get Costlier   By Garcia, Beatrice E; Forman, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1990  Government export insurers and some private insurers could have billions of dollars at risk in the Persian Gulf if hostilities in the region escalate further. In addition, companies seeking to do business there may have to pay dearly for insurance coverage, if it's still available.  Insurance rates for shipping through the Persian Gulf have risen sharply since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last Thursday. Lloyd's of London, a big British insurance marketer, has led a world-wide round of price increases for certain oil and marine coverage. Lloyd's also has posted a war-risk premium on Persian Gulf shipping for the first time since the Iran-Iraq war.  The market for political-risk coverage in Iraq and Kuwait has virtually shut down, brokers and underwriters said. "I wouldn't have the audacity to ask an underwriter for a quote," said Anthony Palmer, a managing director of Berry Palmer & Lyle, Ltd., a Lloyd's of London broker that specializes in political-risk coverage.
