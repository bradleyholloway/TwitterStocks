 Hanoi Seeks Changes at State Firms   By Cohen, Margot, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2004  In their current guise, Vietnam's "general corporations" are highly politicized, murky entities that don't own equity in the myriad companies under their umbrella -- and thus exert little control over them. Each general corporation contains roughly 50 member companies that tend to engage in divergent lines of business or display vast discrepancies in profitability.  "If you get businesses into a corporate structure, you can identify the return on investment," says Peter Nelson, a consultant based in Hanoi specializing in state-enterprise revisions. "If you just have a conglomerate of businesses, you can't take remedial action because you don't know where to take it."  Economists caution that restructuring alone is no panacea without more-decisive, market-savvy executives at the helm. Such individuals are rare in Vietnam's creaky state sector. Indeed, the government is poised to recruit two foreigners to lead parent companies in the shipping and vehicle industries. "I want to find good leadership and management," says Nguyen Trong Dung, deputy director of the government's enterprise-reform department.
