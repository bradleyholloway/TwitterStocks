 New Breed of Activist Battles Road Expansion   By By Christina Binkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1996  On one side of the battle is the state, which is planning to expand the road to six lanes from four. According to a decade-old Florida law, the road must be widened to accommodate traffic for a planned shopping mall and future housing development.  But many residents see the expanded road demolishing their quality of life. They say plans to close off access roads will force traffic down their quiet streets. Moreover, they say, the extra lanes will effectively build a wall down the middle of their communities, cutting off businesses and unraveling social ties.  In Naples, Ms. Barker got into her first road battle in 1993. As president of the Pine Ridge Civic Association, she "passed the hat" when a newly built county road nearby began luring traffic through her subdivision as a shortcut. Pine Ridge, where many of the 490 homes range in value from $250,000 to $400,000, raised $12,000 to pay a lawyer, collected more for a $1,300 traffic study, and paid $720 to import a planner from Miami for a one-day consultation on design and safety issues. (The Pine Ridge Civic Association, along with other community groups, is part of an umbrella group, the Property-owners Association of North Collier County, or Panic.)
