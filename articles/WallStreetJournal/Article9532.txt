 Coke Is Canning Its Ad Agency   By By Betsy McKay and Vanessa O'Connell, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2003  The meaning of Coke's switch won't be lost on Madison Avenue since John J. Dooner Jr., a former McCann executive and now Interpublic's chief executive, is very involved with the Coke account. Some analysts, though, worry that Coke will spark a trend in which major multinational ad agencies such as McCann are reduced to distributing and executing a campaign born at a rival creative boutique. Some of Interpublic's other big clients, including Nextel and Alltel, recently put their accounts under review, and also may make a change.  This isn't the first time the two have parted ways. In the early 1990s, Coke dropped McCann as its creative agency of record for its biggest brand in the U.S. and turned to Creative Artists Agency. At the time, McCann continued to handle national television and radio media buying for Coke. McCann eventually returned as Coke's lead agency in December 2000 after Coke decided to consolidate its creative work with Interpublic.
