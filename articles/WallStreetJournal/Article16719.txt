 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Driver's Seat: Ford Has a Better Idea -- At Last   By Sabatini, Jeff, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2007  Ford emphasizes the Edge's car-based lineage in its styling, eschewing the brand's traditionally tough SUV look in favor of clean, simple lines ornamented by the sort of jeweled headlights and taillights currently in vogue. The Edge isn't very distinctive once you look beyond its razor-blade grille, but that's precisely the point, as Ford wants the vehicle to be a thoroughly mainstream product.  If that's the price you pay for an automatic with that many gears and no manual-shift mode, the benefit should come at the gas pump. The front-drive Edge has an EPA combined fuel economy rating of 21 miles per gallon; the all-wheel-drive model's is 20. By comparison, the V6- powered version of the midsize, five-passenger Explorer rates 17 mpg in both two- and four-wheel-drive configurations. While you'll certainly see a sizeable improvement in mileage if you move from an Explorer to an Edge, expect real-world fuel economy in the latter to be closer to 17 mpg. That's not bad for an SUV, but it's certainly not going to set any records for energy conservation.  Ford will sell plenty of Edges, precisely because nothing about the vehicle hasn't been done before, and several times over, at that. It's been more than a decade since the first car-based SUVs were introduced, and even Ford tried its hand at building something like the Edge once already. The unlikable and slow-selling Freestyle debuted in 2005, a seven-passenger SUV that borrowed its styling from the Explorer camp.
