 Hartz Brings Back Insect Spray Some Pet Owners Fear Is Fatal   By By Mark Robichaux, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1989  But Hartz Mountain Corp. appears to have pulled off what conventional wisdom would have said is impossible. Hartz has successfully relaunched its Blockade tick and flea spray after a barrage of negative publicity nearly crippled the product two years ago. The relaunch, which relies on a mix of testimonial advertising and skilled public relations, is perhaps a textbook case of how a company may salvage a seemingly doomed product.  In 1987, the Illinois Animal Poison Information Center, the largest such facility in the U.S., received more than 500 calls about adverse effects, including reports of several deaths. The Environmental Protection Agency told Hartz to conduct a battery of toxicity tests on the product. That December, Hartz pulled Blockade from the market due to what it called "adverse publicity," and laid low.  Rather than kill the product, Hartz ran the tests, which determined the product is safe, Hartz says. And while Hartz says the chemical makeup of Blockade hasn't changed, it did relabel the cans with new dosage warnings under an agreement with the EPA. The product was relaunched in January with a new ad campaign.
