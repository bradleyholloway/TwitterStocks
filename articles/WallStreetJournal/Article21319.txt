 At the Mercy of Men: Pakistan Women Look To Bhutto to Improve A Harsh Existence --- Little Seen, With Few Rights, They Face Perils Including Wrath of Male Kinfolk --- Attacked for Going Outdoors   By By Mary Williams Walsh, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1989  For the past two years, 35-year-old Mrs. Zari has been on the run, fleeing from a family of pistol-packing brothers who have been stalking her from mud hut to mud hut here in Pakistan's tradition-bound Northwest Frontier Province. She has escaped so far only because sympathetic women have been hiding her in their homes and sheds.  When Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto took office last year and made history as the first woman ruler of a Moslem country in modern times, hope soared among Pakistani women that she could soften their rock-hard life. That hope is still alive. But so, too, are cruel customs and laws that give tradition all the muscle of the state. A look at Pakistan and its women, from peasant to prime minister, shows that the country with perhaps the greatest opportunity to uplift millions of women may also be the one with the least prospect of change.  The first thing a Western visitor notices in Pakistan is the near-total absence of women. Pakistan made the "Guinness Book of World Records" this year as the nation with the lowest ratio of women to men. No one is sure whether disease and malnutrition are killing them, as press reports suggest, or whether, as Guinness postulates, census-takers couldn't find them because of "purdah," a policy that keeps women from appearing in public. There's a saying here that a woman goes into her husband's home in a wedding dress and comes out in a coffin.
