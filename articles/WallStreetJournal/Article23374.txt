 The Andover of India? Graduates From Doon Score Top U.S. Jobs; Scholastic Bootcamp for Boys Raises Stars, Faces Change; Gandhi Suffered Here, Too   By Raghavan, Anita, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  Many of the Doon alumni say they are still driven by the school's humbling culture. Vikram Malhotra, head of McKinsey & Co.'s New York office, recalls the pain of failing to earn one of the school's coveted blazers, awarded for excellence. "Imagine 500 boys, homogenous in what they wear, and the only way you could stand out is if you wore a blue blazer if you were good in sports and a black blazer if you were good in academics," says Mr. Malhotra, 46 years old. "I fell a point short on each one and to this day it rankles me."  "The monastic existence" is an "article of faith of the school," says Dr. Kanti P. Bajpai, Doon's headmaster. "It is a leveler, a reminder that you are here to work and participate in campus activities and not wallow."  "Let me tell you -- we are getting soft," Philip Burrett, Doon's deputy headmaster told the students at a recent council meeting. "Next thing you'll want to go in a taxi."
