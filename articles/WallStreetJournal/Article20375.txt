 Jazz: Standards, Toussaint-Style   By Fusilli, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2009  After an admirable career of more than a half century as an R&B and pop singer, pianist, composer and arranger, last year Allen Toussaint recorded his first album of New Orleans blues and jazz standards. Produced by Joe Henry and released in late January, "The Bright Mississippi" (Nonesuch) is a sympathetic, soulful, mostly instrumental work that quietly celebrates Mr. Toussaint as much as it does compositions by Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver, Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn and Thelonious Monk.
