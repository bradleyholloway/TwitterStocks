 Miami Trauma-Care Network Founders Over Unpaid Bills and Grumbling Doctors   By By Michael Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1987  Then came an even harder task: finding a hospital to treat the Key Largo, Fla., boy. Nearly half of the hospitals in nearby Dade County -- including five of eight that were once part of a county trauma-care network -- had curtailed emergency services. Eventually, an off-duty physician stabilized the boy in a decommissioned emergency room, then pleaded for nearly four hours with area trauma centers -- hospitals specializing in serious injury -- before finding one that would admit the uninsured boy for surgery.  The boy recovered, but Miami's trauma-care network remains in critical condition. Hailed at its September 1985 inception as one of the most promising experiments in the emerging field of trauma care, the network has been brought down by patients who couldn't pay their bills and doctors who responded to soaring malpractice rates and the strains of trauma work by quitting emergency-room duties. While southern Florida may be particularly susceptible to such problems, health-care specialists say the failure here illustrates the difficulty of establishing top-notch urban trauma care around the nation.  But whether the patients actually can pay is another matter. Auto-accident victims -- the largest single group of trauma cases -- are usually covered by insurance. On the other hand, "knife and gun club" patients -- the term trauma doctors use for victims of urban violence -- rarely have insurance or other means to pay for care. Most Miami hospital administrators say they expected the paying patients to subsidize the nonpayers, as typically happens in suburban trauma systems.
