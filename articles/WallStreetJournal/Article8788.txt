 Fed Chairman Pops The Big Question: Is Market Too High? --- But Greenspan Waffles When It Comes to an Answer, Despite Concern Over Rise   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1996  "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decades?" Mr. Greenspan asked in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute. "And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy?"  The answer, however, was characteristic Greenspan. He noted that sustained low inflation tends to be good for stock prices. He pointed out that the Fed wouldn't worry about "a collapsing financial asset bubble" if it didn't hurt the economy. He recalled that the 1987 stock market crash had "few negative consequences for the economy."
