 Digits   By By Nick Wingfield, David Hamilton, Ann Grimes and Nicole Harris, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  Now that a federal judge has found Microsoft Corp. guilty of violating antitrust laws, the threat of a high-profile private antitrust lawsuit from a Microsoft competitor looms large. Some think America Online Inc., whose Netscape division played a central role in starting the antitrust investigation, might be a logical candidate to take on Microsoft in court. But one former Netscape executive said AOL also could use the threat of private litigation as a bargaining chip.  One obvious deal for the companies concerns Web browsers. AOL has a longstanding agreement to bundle Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser with AOL's access software; in turn, Microsoft bundles AOL software with Windows computers. But AOL is eager to use the new version of its own Netscape browser within the AOL service -- a move that would almost certainly give Netscape a huge boost in market share.  This week, AOL executives said they hope to use Netscape on AOL without losing their carriage on Windows. "We would hope that Microsoft would come to the point of view that we would have that carriage without imposing on us the condition of using Internet Explorer," said Barry Schuler, president of AOL's interactive services group. Would AOL threaten to sue Microsoft to get both? "It's interesting speculation, but I can't comment," Mr. Schuler said.
