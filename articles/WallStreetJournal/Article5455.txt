 If it's good enough for toy boats why not use it in Corvettes?   By Adams, Chris, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1997  Balsa wood has taken the place of what used to be galvanized steel in the floorboard of the $38,060 1997 Chevrolet Corvette. Corvette engineers say the new construction--balsa wood sandwiched between two layers of fiberglass--is as strong as steel and quite a bit stiffer. Steel still makes up about 55% of material in an average car, but other materials have gained as auto makers have searched for ways to make lighter, more fuel-efficient cars.
