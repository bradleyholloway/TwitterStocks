 Jospin Adds Fervor To French Pledge Of Support for U.S.   By By Charles Fleming, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  Mr. [Lionel Jospin]'s remarks came as NATO members started to unveil details of the military support they would provide the U.S. in its fight against terrorism, following a briefing Tuesday in which Washington told its allies why the U.S. believes Osama bin Laden was behind the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.  German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said yesterday that the U.S. is asking its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to cooperate on intelligence, protect U.S. installations in Europe and allow U.S. planes to use their airspace. Germany didn't specify what additional support it would be willing to provide. The U.S., meanwhile, declined to release details of the requests it made for aid.
