 TechCrunch Site Makes Arrington A Power Broker   By Rebecca Buckman and Vauhini Vara, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2006  Start-up iVentster Inc.'s gaming site, XuQa.com, got a positive review in September on TechCrunch. Afterward, two Japanese investors showed up at iVentster's San Francisco office, saying they had learned about the company on TechCrunch. "We were definitely surprised," says iVentster co-founder Ali Moiz. "If somebody travels that far and comes to see you because they saw you on a blog, it makes you think about how many people read that blog."  Mr. [Michael Arrington] acknowledges that he faces conflicts of interest. On a blistering blog post lashing back at his critics this week, he said that TechCrunch is "all about insider information and conflicts of interest," and that traditional journalists "hate the fact that I get information that they can't get." Still, he says he strives to keep his editorial content separate from the blog's advertising and recently hired a dedicated ad saleswoman. Earlier this year, he also started posting more detailed disclosures about his financial ties to TechCrunch companies on the blog.  Some investors worry Mr. Arrington and his ilk may contribute to an investment bubble that could end badly. In May, Josh Kopelman, an investor with First Round Capital in Philadelphia, warned on his blog that many Web companies today "run a big risk of designing a product/service that is targeted at too small of an audience," namely subscribers to Mr. Arrington's TechCrunch blog. (The number of subscribers, then 53,651, has since grown to 133,000, according to the site.) The TechCrunch blog has also spawned its own minipublicity loop, with other bloggers rehashing many of the tidbits Mr. Arrington reports and posting photos from his backyard keg parties.
