 MarketWatch: Parents, Straighten Up   By Hoak, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  It doesn't cost a bundle for parents in their 20s or 30s to purchase life insurance. But it may mean the world to that parent's bundle of joy. A working parent may have life insurance through an employer. Do the math and make sure it's enough.  Maybe even more important than life insurance is for parents to have disability insurance. "If you get into a car crash, there's more of a chance you're going to be injured than actually die from that," Ms. [Melissa Osuch] says. "Life insurance isn't going to help you out there."  "Younger people don't have death on their minds," at least not to the same extent that older clients do, says Cicily Maton, a financial planner and partner of Chicago-based Aequus Wealth Management Resources. But it takes only one horror story about the consequences of a parent dying without a will to change someone's perspective, she adds.
