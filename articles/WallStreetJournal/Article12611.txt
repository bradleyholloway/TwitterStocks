 Second Thoughts: A False Confession Jailed Mr. Yakushiji; Then Fate Intervened --- Case With a Strange Twist Exposes Police Practice Of Pressuring Suspects --- Inside a 99% Conviction Rate   By By Peter Landers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2000  Mr. [Yakushiji] insisted he hadn't done it. Then, as he remembers it, the threats came. Pounding the table, the detective warned: "The longer you wait, the heavier your punishment's going to get!" He threatened to raid Mr. Yakushiji's company and his brother's house to seek evidence. Mr. Yakushiji, a middle-age mushroom-plant worker with a gambling habit and an ill father, felt he would be heaping shame and new burdens on his family and co-workers unless he confessed.  At 2 o'clock that afternoon, Mr. Yakushiji broke down in tears. "Ah, detective-san, actually it was I who did it," he sobbed. A police official, Kimio Ohno, says that it is common for police to "severely pursue" suspects in interrogation but that nothing illegal was done to Mr. Yakushiji. Detective [Tomohiko Taguchi] declines to comment.  It rang true. Ms. [Nobuko Yoshihiro] did recall going to dinner with her son the night he mentioned. There was indeed $940 in the trunk of Mr. Yakushiji's car. His employer's assistant confirmed receiving the loan payment. But no one noticed a simple yet crucial fact: Mr. Yakushiji had paid back the $1,880 on Jan. 7 -- the day before the money was stolen.
