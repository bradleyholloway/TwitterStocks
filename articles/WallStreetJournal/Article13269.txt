 Tracking the Numbers / Street Sleuth: Devil for GM Is in the Details Of Cerberus Deal   By Ian McDonald and Serena Ng, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2006  The buyers of the 51% chunk of General Motors Acceptance Corp., a group of investors led by investment fund Cerberus Capital Management LP, can walk away from the complex transaction without paying a cent if GM's credit rating deteriorates in the coming months, for example. And even if this cash infusion does recharge GM's business, and the car maker can buy back GMAC's lucrative automotive-finance business in the future, analysts say GM will face the same bind as pawn-shop customers: paying through the nose for something sold for peanuts.  If GM's unsecured long-term debt rating sinks four notches deeper into the below-investment-grade ranks to less than a triple-C rating, the group buying GMAC's majority stake can back out of the deal before its expected closing in this year's fourth quarter. The Cerberus group also can bolt if GMAC's credit rating slips below its current level of double-B, or if the company's residential-mortgage or insurance units see a credit tumble.  Such "escape clauses" aren't unusual in big acquisitions such as this one. But in GM's case, there is a real chance the deal might be derailed by factors somewhat out of the auto giant's control -- chiefly, a strike by workers at its biggest supplier Delphi Corp., which could cripple GM's manufacturing and cause it to bleed cash fast. If a walkout happens, GM's credit rating almost certainly will be downgraded. GM's auto sales also have slumped and are another factor that could cause its ratings to deteriorate.
