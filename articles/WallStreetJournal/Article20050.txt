 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Street Sleuth: Trading in Harrah's Contracts Surges Before LBO Disclosure; Options, Derivatives Make Exceptionally Large Moves; 'Someone...Was Positioning'   By Dennis K. Berman and Serena Ng, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2006  [Harrah]'s said Monday that it had received a $15.1 billion buyout offer from private-equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group. The $81-a-share offer caused Harrah's shares to jump 14% and its bonds to fall 11% as the company's credit ratings were cut to "junk" by Standard & Poor's. Yesterday, the shares fell 1.3%, or 97 cents, to $74.71 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The Las Vegas company is reviewing the buyout proposal and isn't certain a transaction will be sealed.  "Clearly, someone out there was positioning for some movement in Harrah's," said Stacey Briere Gilbert, Susquehanna Financial Group's chief options strategist. "I don't know whether they were positioning for an LBO, but for something."  Derivatives tied to Harrah's bonds also moved. The price of a five- year credit-default swap that protects an investor against a default in $10 million of Harrah's bonds climbed 24% last week to $114,000 annually, according to Markit Group.
