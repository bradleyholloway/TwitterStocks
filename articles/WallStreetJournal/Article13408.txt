 Deals & Dealmakers: Apathy Toward Realia IPO Signals Spanish Slowdown   By Sinclair, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2007  Realia set a final price of 6.50 euros a share for its IPO, well below its original range of 7.90 euros to 9.70 euros. The final price values Realia, a joint venture between construction company Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas SA and savings bank Caja Madrid, at 1.8 billion euros.  The IPO comes a month after the share-price collapse of Astroc, listed last year, fueled talk of a rough period for Spain's building boom. Astroc shares gained 10 times their initial price by February, before losing most of those gains shortly afterward. In the past month, the stock has remained under pressure amid concerns about Astroc's corporate governance. The stock fell 2.5% to 13.92 euros in Madrid yesterday.  To diversify away from Spain, last year Realia bought SIIC de Paris, a listed French office company. Realia also is considering acquisitions in Germany and the U.K. within the real-estate sector, Realia Chairman Ignacio Bayon said in an interview.
