 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2004  A: That depends on how old you are. If you're under 50, the limit this year is $13,000. That's up from $12,000 last year. But if you're at least 50 at any time this year, the limit is $16,000, up from $14,000 last year.  The IRS says in Publication 17 that you shouldn't include in your income any "compensatory damages for a personal physical injury or physical sickness." This exclusion "also applies to any damages for wrongful death," such as the award you received, says Martin Nissenbaum, national director of personal income-tax planning at Ernst & Young.  The Senate Finance Committee plans a hearing June 22. "Lately, more and more tax problems involving charitable giving have come out," Sen. [Chuck Grassley] says. He hopes the hearing will be a basis for "consideration of possible legislation to address governance and best practices" in charities.
