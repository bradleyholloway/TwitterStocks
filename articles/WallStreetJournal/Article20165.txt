 Enterprise: Why So Many Want to Create Facebook Applications; Site's Growing Ranks Seen as Potential Source Of Revenue, Customers   By Richmond, Riva, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  The applications are garnering a big buzz among Web companies and venture capitalists alike. Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture firm Bay Partners has raised $300 million specifically for companies developing Facebook applications and is making $25,000 to $250,000 investments per application. "All Internet companies need a Facebook strategy or a presence on Facebook," says Partner Salil Deshpande, because Facebook usership is growing so quickly.  The Facebook platform is so promising in part because its members use it to connect with people they know -- or want to know -- in the nonvirtual world. Unlike News Corp.'s MySpace and most other social- networking sites, Facebook members aren't anonymous. They use their real names and connect with each other to the degree they choose. Facebook also allows businesses to interact with Facebook users fairly freely, while restricting access to any personal data.  "We're certainly pleased with how much it's taken off," say Brandee Barker, a spokeswoman for Facebook. "We already have a thriving ecosystem of businesses built on the Facebook platform."
