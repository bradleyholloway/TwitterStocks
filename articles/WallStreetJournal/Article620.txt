 General Nutrition Fires Its President, Settles a Lawsuit   By By J. Ernest Beazley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1985  Gary A. Daum, president of General Nutrition Inc., was fired late yesterday by the health food retailer over disagreements with the family of the company's founder.  But Mr. Daum's firing reflected "personal business differences" with the family of David B. Shakarian, who died last year, Mr. Daum said in an interview. "We don't see eye-to-eye," he said, adding that the tussle had "regressed to the point where I was terminated."  Citing mounting legal fees, General Nutrition agreed to make the payment to Natures Food Centers Inc., a Massachusetts-based health food chain. The agreement settled an antitrust suit and a separate action involving General Nutrition's acquisition of 33 of its rival's outlets. A U.S. district court judge in Boston approved the settlement yesterday.
