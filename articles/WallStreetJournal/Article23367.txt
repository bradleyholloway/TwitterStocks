 Whose Life Is It, Anyway?   By Pilon, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  The case is far from finished, however: On remand, the FDA will try to show that its prohibition is, in the jargon of such things, "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling governmental interest." Still, the court's reasoning in the case -- Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Development Drugs v. Eschenbach -- is rich with implications for medical freedom and constitutional jurisprudence.  Liberal judges, often hostile toward our founding principles, invent rights by drawing on their own conceptions of evolving social values. Reacting to the perceived judicial activism, conservative judges go overboard the other way, recognizing only those rights expressly "in" the Constitution -- thus ignoring the presumption of individual liberty at the very foundation of the document. Neither side gets it right. The Constitution no more authorizes judges to invent rights from whole cloth than it allows them to ignore rights plainly meant to be protected.  The D.C. circuit got it right in [Abigail Burroughs]. Recognizing, first, that the Due Process Clause has long protected substantive rights, the court noted two distinct approaches in the Supreme Court's rights jurisprudence. One, based in "personal dignity and autonomy," has led the court (sometimes wrongly) to prohibit state intrusion in "the bedroom, the clinic, and the womb" -- e.g., abortion. The other approach, more restrictive, finds a right only if it is "deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition."
