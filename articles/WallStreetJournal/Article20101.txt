 Love & Money: Family Vacation: What Price, Convenience?   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  [Erik] says that every time he and his family plan a trip, "we have the opportunity to find cheaper flights with layovers. Ten times out of 10 I will choose to buy the nonstop flight," even if it costs more. "I don't know if it's a sad testament to my life or life in general today, but convenience drives many of our family's decisions, simply because time together has become a very precious commodity."  "I would never pay the extra money for the club level when I'm alone," he says, "but it's just so much more convenient when she's with me to have breakfast down the hall and hors d'oeuvres for dinner. It's exciting to her and gives her more time to go swimming. Ultimately, it's more expensive, but the price is well worth it."  [Amy]'s position on the flight is simple: She will be the parent stuck entertaining our restless 3-year-old daughter, who gravitates toward Mom over Dad. "I really don't want that hassle," she told me. "What if the flights are delayed?"
