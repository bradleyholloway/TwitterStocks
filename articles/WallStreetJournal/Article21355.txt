 At the Pump -- A Special Report --- A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Caleb Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1989  Overestimates of summer driving led to excess output, refiners say. Prices peaked in mid-May at a weighted average of $1.18 a gallon and are now at $1.13, says the Lundberg Survey. "They could continue to drop in August," says Trilby Lundberg, president, especially if oil prices keep falling. But sluggishly. "Pump prices are fast to respond to rising prices but slower to fall when crude prices fall," says oil consultant Antonio Szabo of Bonner & Moore.  High-octane premium suffers the most because of a 20% price rise between January and May. "People are experimenting to find out what {octane} they need," says Gordon H. Thomson, Exxon vice president. Many drivers switch to midgrade gasolines, two to three octane points and about a dime a gallon lower. But Amoco says premium, its most profitable gas, has stopped declining and predicts a rebound.  They don't draw customers, but restrooms remain a major consideration in station design and operation. The reason: Bad ones hurt the image. "There's a tremendous don't: Don't let them get dirty," says Glenn Tilton, Texaco's marketing chief. Ashland's SuperAmerica unit puts them inside for easier maintenance. Texaco claims air dryers for hands improve hygiene and cut litter, while Amoco says people prefer paper towels.
