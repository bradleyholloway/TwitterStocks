 L.A. Times's Plan to Run Press Releases Stirs Debate   By By Daniel Akst, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1988  "Corporate News" will soon start appearing in the Los Angeles Times. But the section won't contain news at all. In fact, it will be advertising space filled with company press releases.  The Times says its "Corporate News" feature will be clearly labeled as advertising when it appears weekly in the business section. But that hardly placates critics, who express shock over the move by one of the nation's biggest, most respected -- and most profitable -- newspapers.  Still, the Times won't be the first to run such ads, which some critics say can be mistaken for staff-reported news. Barron's, a weekly owned by Dow Jones & Co., the company that publishes this newspaper, has been running press-release advertising for years, under the heading "Current Corporate Reports." Investor's Daily also carries it, under the heading "Investor's Newswire." Both use the words "corporate news" in smaller type, and both label their sections as advertising.
