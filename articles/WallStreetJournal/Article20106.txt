 Xerox Names Ursula Burns to President Post   By Bulkeley, William M, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2007  Ms. [Ursula M. Burns], who grew up in public housing in New York City, started her Xerox career as an engineering intern in 1980. Ms. [Anne Mulcahy] wrote in her message to employees that "Hollywood couldn't have written a better script."  Ms. Burns earned a masters degree in engineering at Columbia University and began full-time work at Xerox. After a stint working as an assistant to then chief executive Paul Allaire, she won progressively bigger jobs in product development and planning. In 2000, she was named senior vice president in charge of manufacturing and the supply chain, where she had the difficult task of negotiating cost-cutting agreements with Xerox unions that permitted outsourcing much of the company's manufacturing.
