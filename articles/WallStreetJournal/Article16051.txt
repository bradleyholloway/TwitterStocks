 Time Off: A Week of Diversions   By By Stuart Ferguson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2001  A 400-foot-high Electric Tower -- lit by power generated from Niagara Falls -- was the centerpiece of Buffalo's exposition, which opened in May 1901. Touting the industrial, agricultural and commercial achievements of the U.S. and it's western-hemisphere neighbors, the 350-acre fair drew eight million visitors. The expo's only remaining building now houses the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society (BECHS), which has used two sites for this large show commemorating the centennial. On display are the original 9-foot architect's model of the Electric Tower, Thomas Edison's film footage of the fair, paintings, photos and many other items from a century ago. The revolver Leon Czolgosz used to assassinate William McKinley during the president's Sept. 6 tour of the expo is on public display for the first time.
