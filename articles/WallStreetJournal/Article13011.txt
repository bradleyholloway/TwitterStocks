 Leading the News: Toyota Posts 60% Rise in Profit; Minivans, SUVs Sell Well in U.S.   By Zaun, Todd, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2004  The solid performance is the latest sign that Toyota remains on a roll after reaching several important milestones in the past year. The company passed Ford Motor Co. in total vehicle sales for 2003 to become the world's No. 2 auto maker behind General Motors Corp. In the U.S., Toyota became the best-selling car brand last year, a first for a foreign maker, and its Lexus line was the top-selling luxury brand.  The biggest boost to Toyota's profit came from expanded overseas sales, especially in North America where Toyota sold 560,000 vehicles, 5% more than in the year-earlier period. Fueling the gain was robust demand in the U.S. for two recently redesigned vehicles -- the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Lexus RX330 SUV. The popularity of the new vehicles contributed to a 57% increase in Toyota's North American operating profit to 128.2 billion yen. Operating profit is revenue less the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses.  Toyota doesn't provide consolidated earnings forecasts, but as a sign of its growing optimism, Toyota raised its forecast for its parent company, which includes mostly operations in Japan. Toyota now forecasts a parent-company net profit of 560 billion yen for the year ending March 31, compared with an earlier forecast of 510 billion yen. Toyota also raised its forecast for global vehicle sales for the year ending in March by 80,000 vehicles to 6.65 million vehicles, which would be an increase of 8.8% from the year earlier. Toyota reported its results based on U.S. accounting standards.
