 Venturing Beyond U.S. Shores Pays Off   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2006  Professional investors around the globe, as well as here, have been generally favoring non-U.S. stocks over U.S. shares. Those money flows can help drive up returns, as portfolio managers keep buying more non- U.S. shares.  One reason for the managers' move is that the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing after the Federal Reserve's string of 17 interest-rate boosts since 2004. Current estimates for U.S. gross domestic product for the fourth quarter hover around 2.5%, which is below previous years' trends.  One risk on the horizon: If the U.S. economy slows sharply, there's a danger it could drag down the fledgling recovery in Japan and weigh on Western Europe's growth. Parts of Asia, such as Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan, are more exposed to a U.S. slowdown because of their technology-exporting companies.
