 U.S. Offers Pact To Put Limits On Currencies --- But West Germany, Japan Haven't Agreed on Plan; Dollar Declines Sharply   By By Art Pine and Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1987  The Reagan administration has offered to cooperate with West Germany and Japan in stabilizing exchange rates if those countries stimulate their economies.  Under the proposal, presented by Treasury Secretary James Baker in secret negotiations with the so-called Group of Five countries, the major powers would establish "reference ranges" -- broad upper and lower limits for the dollar, the West German mark and the Japanese yen -- and then intervene in the foreign-exchange markets if their currencies approach those limits. The talks also include Britain and France, the other members of the Group of Five.  Indeed, the dollar suffered one of its worst tumbles in more than a year yesterday as traders brushed off a report of the U.S. offer and concentrated on remarks by Mr. Baker on NBC's "Today" show yesterday that no special meeting of the Group of Five countries had been scheduled.
