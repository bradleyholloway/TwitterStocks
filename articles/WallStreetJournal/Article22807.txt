 Notable & Quotable   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2001  Now that America is warring on terrorism, it is black people who can remind America that we know it well. For we remember the terrorism that swept the South during the civil rights movement and the lynchings before that. We remember the four little girls killed in the bombing of a Birmingham Church. We know that dangerous rhetoric can lead to acts of lunacy that kill innocents. And we know that the surest defense against terrorism is affirmation of America's basic values. . . .
