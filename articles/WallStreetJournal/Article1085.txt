 Money Rules: Behind Soaring Executive Pay, Decades of Failed Restraints; Instead of Damping Rewards, Disclosure, Taxes, Options Helped Push Them Higher; Return of Golden Parachutes   By Joann S. Lublin and Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  Charles Munger, vice chairman of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and a longtime business partner of the famed investor, describes executive compensation as "wretched excess." In an interview, Mr. Munger says he hears complaints even from "Republicans who grumble on the country-club porch" about the resulting political turmoil over the pay question. They're "mad at corporate America," he says.  On a yellow legal pad, Mr. [Ralph Whitworth] sketched a plan that paid a modest cash compensation and plenty of options. Mr. [Rand Araskog] "tore it off and took it with him," Mr. Whitworth says. Two days later, the chairman of ITT's compensation committee chairman called Mr. Whitworth and declared, "Rand is going to take you up on your offer." Mr. Araskog says he doesn't dispute Mr. Whitworth's recollection.  At the time, "we never saw an [option] plan we didn't like," Mr. Whitworth recalls. "People would say, 'How much is too much?' We said, 'The sky's the limit as long as it's tied to stock options,' which we equated to performance."
