 Vioxx Trial Focuses on Arrhythmia   By Ilan Brat and Barbara Martinez, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2005  Proving a causal link between arrhythmia and Vioxx is the biggest challenge for Mark Lanier, the attorney for Carol Ernst, the widow of Mr. Ernst. To that end, he suggested in court yesterday that Mr. Ernst, who took Vioxx for eight months, may have had a blood clot, which led to a heart attack, which then led to a fatal arrhythmia. "It's conceivable that Bob Ernst could have a heart attack and a heart attack could cause an arrhythmia and then arrhythmia could cause his death, isn't it?" Mr. Lanier asked Merck research executive Nancy Santanello, who has been on the witness stand for three days.  After the jury was dismissed, Merck lawyer Jonathan Skidmore reiterated to reporters, "There's no reliable scientific link between arrhythmia and Vioxx." The 1998 meeting referred to Vioxx's effects on dogs, which he said were low on the "totem pole" of trials, "down there with petrie dishes."
