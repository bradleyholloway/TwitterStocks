 Bookshorts: Yeager Out-of-Doors; Kids Everywhere   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1988  When Chuck Yeager uses the phrase, "the right stuff," he's talking about the way golden trout tastes when you cook it over an open fire with wild onions, pulled fresh out of the ground. In "Press On: Further Adventures in the Good Life" (with Charles Leerhsen, Bantam, 247 pages, $17.95), he confesses that he still doesn't know what Tom Wolfe meant by the phrase when he made it the title of his best-selling book about pilots. "Tom Wolfe made a lot of money off it, but it's not something I've ever heard a pilot say."  Still, Tom's a nice guy, says Mr. Yeager, though maybe a bit too abstruse: "I never understood a lot of what he was driving at. Once, a few years ago, he sent me a bunch of his books to read, but I never got past the titles, they were so weird. 'Velvet Gloves and Mauve Something' was one, I think. I prefer Louis L'Amour any day."  Mauve doesn't fit into the color scheme of Mr. Yeager's life. Blue, brown and green are his shades, though the plane he broke the sound barrier in was orange. "Press On" is mostly a series of fun and exhilarating stories about Mr. Yeager in the out-of-doors. The best chapter is the first, in which he describes his life-long love affair with a mountain range, the Sierra Nevada. "My annual trip into the Sierras is now the central event of my life," he says. Once he took relaxing camping trips in those mountains, time off from the exhaustion of flying, but now his journeys have become more rugged, with 18-mile-a-day hikes up bloodying terrain, and only what dinner you can catch. "They have evolved into more like military missions," Mr. Yeager writes.
