 A Violin Bargain, Strings Attached   By By Gwendolyn Freed, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  Still, not everything is lollipops and roses. "I'm not sure `congratulations' is the word," said New Jersey Symphony Orchestra board chairman Victor Parsonnet. To consummate the deal, the orchestra had to borrow $14 million from the Commerce Bank of New Jersey and the Prudential Foundation, with an undisclosed number of orchestra patrons acting as guarantors. "They are among the household names of people in New Jersey who are invariably there supporting arts and culture endeavors," said orchestra board member Scott Kobler, a lead architect of the arrangement. The other $4 million has been tendered in five-year notes. "It took a year from the time [Herbert Axelrod] first made his offer," said orchestra president Lawrence Tamburri, "and at least 25 lawyers were involved to some degree or another."  The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra is in the midst of a music director search that should go better now that it has these extraordinary instruments in hand. "Every conductor who comes here talks about these violins," said Mr. Tamburri, and Dr. Axelrod notes that "more than one maestro has agreed to lead the orchestra, providing they have the 30 instruments," said Dr. Axelrod. The 65-year-old Estonian Neeme Jarvi, music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, is rumored to be among them.  In the long run, the orchestra will probably not regret snagging the instruments at Dr. Axelrod's fire-sale price. "The best investments I ever made were in violins," Dr. Axelrod said. "Strads I bought 20 years ago for $100,000 are now worth over $2 million each. Not a single violin from my collection of 50 instruments has ever gone down in value. . . . My cost for the New Jersey Symphony instruments was $29 million. They were appraised in 2002 at $49.5 million."
