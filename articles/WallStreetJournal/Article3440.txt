 Incumbent Immortality   The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2001  State legislators have tried this stunt before. Last June, the California state Assembly failed to pass a weakening of term limits when a fourth of members declined to vote on it after hearing from outraged constituents. At that time, Senator Don Perata of Oakland conceded that "the legislature can't change term limits; it would seem too self-serving." So instead legislators are giving behind-the-scenes backing to a petition drive for a ballot measure that would allow incumbents to seek four more years in office if they collect the signatures of 20% of the registered voters in their districts. The initiative is partisan as well as brazen: GOP districts are unlikely to be wedded to their incumbent, Democratic districts often are dominated by local machines and can more easily gather signatures.  State Senator Perata, who also chairs the redistricting committee that is about to gerrymander the state on behalf of incumbents, is the main spark-plug behind weakening term limits. He argues that voters should have experienced legislators on hand to address the power mess, and the job can't be entrusted to rookies. But a fourth of the current legislature was in office and voted for the disastrous electricity bill in 1996. Term limits were approved in 1990, and the first legislator to be affected by them didn't leave office until 1997. The voters might wisely think good public policy would say good riddance to the office-holders who got them into this mess.
