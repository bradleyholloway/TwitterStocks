 Cities Reap Less From Tax On Cigarettes   By By Rafer Guzman and John D. McKinnon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1999  Pointing to statistics showing declines in cigarette-tax collections in recent years, cities say they are getting less tobacco money in their revenue streams. The state distributes most of its cigarette-tax revenues to local governments, regional hospitals and a handful of other entities through a set of revenue-sharing formulas.  And when measured on a per-capita basis in constant dollars, the numbers are even worse, according to a draft report from the state's Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations in Tallahassee. "When you adjust for inflation and population growth, the amount of cigarette-tax revenue has been on the decline," says Steven O'Cain, a committee analyst and the author of the report.  What's more, many city officials think the worst is yet to come, thanks to a $206 billion settlement between states and the cigarette industry. Already, the settlement -- spurred by Florida's own $13 billion deal with tobacco companies -- has caused cigarette makers to raise prices by as much as 45 cents per pack, stirring fears among local governments that sales will plummet, along with their take.
