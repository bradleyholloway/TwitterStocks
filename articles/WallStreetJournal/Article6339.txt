 Former Enron CEO Makes His Case on Television   By Kara Scannell and Rebecca Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 2004  Mr. Lay and his team seem intent on exploiting a possible weakness in the government's case, which characterizes Mr. Lay as playing a less-sweeping role in the Enron conspiracy than some expected. Explaining the shift in strategy, Mr. Ramsey, said, "The [indictment] does not demonstrate any need to be fearful, so we're speaking out today." He called the indictment "light" and "a stretch." Mr. Ramsey said he hasn't encouraged a client to speak publicly in decades. He decided to do so now because he is convinced of Mr. Lay's innocence, as well as the weakness of the government's case.  Mr. Lay's approach seems in part geared toward putting his case directly before the public -- and prospective jurors. "I think that undoubtedly he is concerned about his reputation and he is equally concerned" about the degree to which "the jury pool is spoken to only by the government," said John Carroll, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer in New York. Mr. Lay's team began the public- relations campaign Wednesday when it circulated an "urgent" request asking people to speak out about his character. "In preparation for the worst, our children and family would greatly appreciate your support by signing the attached affidavit. Letting the judge know that Ken has been a good citizen and cares about his community is important," the cover sheet to a fax read.
