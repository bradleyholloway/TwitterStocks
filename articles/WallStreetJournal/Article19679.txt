 Divided Ranks: As Fight Heats Up Over China Trade, Business Is Split; Low Value of the Yuan Helps Companies That Depend On Cheap Manufacturing; Head Start for New Balance   By Peter Wonacott and Leslie Chang, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2003  The company also has 20% of its shoes made by U.S. workers, but it says even they wouldn't be clear winners from a yuan that floated higher in value. The American workers stitch together shoe parts made in Chinese factories, so the low yuan helps even New Balance's U.S. production. Mr. [Darren Tucker], using an alternative name for the yuan, adds: "Most of our competitors do not manufacture in the U.S., so they would be even more strongly in favor of a cheap renminbi."  As China's policy of linking its currency's value to the dollar comes under increasing criticism, the U.S. corporate lobby that used to criticize Japan's trade policies in the 1980s is looking less united. Factories struggling to compete with China's export machine have egged on Mr. [John Snow]. They say a stronger yuan would make it easier for them to compete -- and hire U.S. workers -- because it would make China's exports costlier here. But some U.S. corporations with different business models, from New Balance to health-care giant Johnson & Johnson, are expressing unease with this pitch.  Smyth McKissick, chief executive of Easley, S.C., textile company Alice Manufacturing Co., says Chinese imports are assaulting an advantage his industry thought it had secured under previous trade agreements. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. textile companies could sell their fabrics to cut-and-sew operations south of the border, where they'd come back to the U.S. as duty-free clothing and comforters. He says allowing China to manipulate the yuan is "terribly misguided" policy. "It's nuts," Mr. McKissick says.
