 Scientists Tout Method for Reprocessing Nuclear Wastes   By By John J. Fialka, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2001  The work is important because, if it is practical as well as possible to safely reprocess nuclear waste, doing so would help dissipate one of the single biggest clouds hanging over the Bush administration's desire to ramp up use of nuclear power: the question of what to do with the leftover material nuclear-power plants generate. For decades, a concern about handling nuclear wastes has been the danger of nuclear proliferation -- that terrorists or rogue nations could obtain the plutonium in it. Plutonium is the metal of choice for making nuclear weapons.  The transmutation quest has an international dimension. France, the United Kingdom and Japan currently remove plutonium from spent nuclear-power plant fuel using an older process derived from U.S. nuclear-weapons production. It extracts pure, bomb-grade metal that is recycled into nuclear fuel. "The rest of the world has gone on and we would like to influence them as they proceed" by offering a less-risky substitute, Dr. [John L. Sackett] says.  Meanwhile, Russia is working with a U.S. company, General Atomics of San Diego, to develop a new generation of nuclear-power plants fueled by millions of tiny, ceramic-coated particles of plutonium removed from Soviet-era nuclear weapons. Russian officials like the idea of transmutation, according to General Atomics Vice Chairman Linden Blue: "They say if we're going to throw away all this, let's at least extract its energy value." The program, which is jointly funded by the U.S. and Russia, aims to build a prototype reactor in Siberia, starting in three years.
