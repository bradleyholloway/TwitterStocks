 Alkermes and Alza In Pact to Develop Brain-Cancer Drug   By By Laura Johannes, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1997  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Alkermes Inc. will receive up to $60 million under a partnership with Alza Corp. to develop RMP-7, a brain-cancer drug that some on Wall Street had written off after disappointing clinical trial results in March.  Alza, a Palo Alto, Calif., drug-delivery company that owns 10% of Alkermes, reviewed those results, some of which were not publicly available, and decided to fund further trials. "Despite the results shown in March, we believe there is a product there," says Robert Myers, Alza vice president. "We're hoping to speed the process and bring a strong product to market."
