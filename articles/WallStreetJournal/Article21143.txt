 In Concert: Woodwinds: The Sweet Sounds of Vienna   By By Barbara Jepson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1987  New York -- Dark. Mellow. Round. Beguiling. The distinctive tonal qualities that clarinetist Peter Schmidl elicits from his instrument exemplify an esteemed tradition of woodwind playing. Mr. Schmidl, a co-principal clarinetist with the Vienna Philharmonic, is hardly a household name here. But when he performed Mozart's Clarinet Concerto with the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall recently under Leonard Bernstein's gloriously supple direction, it was easy to recognize Mr. Schmidl as a member of this renowned orchestra.  For decades, the Vienna Philharmonic has been noted for its special sonic glow. The violins are invariably sweet; the cellos have a rich, burnished luster; the brass is full-bodied, never strident. But to American ears, the woodwinds are the most remarkable. Whereas reed players in this country are noted for their clarity and brilliance, their Viennese counterparts produce a sound that seems almost honeycoated.  "We grew up in Vienna with soft sounds," says the 46-year-old Mr. Schmidl, whose recording of the Brahms Clarinet Trio with pianist Andras Schiff is available on London compact disc and tape. "Our woodwind sound is related to that of the strings, which I always compare to our piano. The international piano now is the Steinway, which has a brilliant tone, but in Vienna we have the Bosendorfer, which is more mellow."
