 Driven Down: European Luxury Cars Fall Into Sales Slump As U.S. Prices Soar --- Many Customers Now Buy From Brokers Charging A Third Off Sticker Prices --- Japanese Rivals Loom Bigger   By By Bradley A. Stertz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1989  But at Edward Haskell's dingy South Bronx warehouse, the intercom blares, telephones buzz and well-heeled shoppers brave the bombed-out surroundings. His place, too, is stocked with BMWs and other European cars -- cars that he buys at fire-sale prices from dealers who can't sell them and that he resells at far below the sticker price. At regular dealerships, "people look at the price of a new European car and laugh," the harried auto broker shouts. "It's a sign of the times."  At first, European auto makers pooh-poohed the slump in their biggest export market. Now, they are pushing the panic button. Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Austin Rover have swept away entire layers of their top U.S. managements. The Audi of America unit of Volkswagen AG has had three top executives in the past 16 months. Other European auto makers' U.S. operations have purged dozens of jobs.  At the same time, the once-smug, now-humbled Europeans are resorting to Detroit-style hype to move the metal. Dealers' leasing at discount rates accounted for half the U.S. sales of Mercedes' least-expensive models last spring. BMW gave dealers cash incentives to make better deals. Even stolid Rolls-Royce is trying marketing gimmicks, including golf lessons from touring pro Tom Kite.
