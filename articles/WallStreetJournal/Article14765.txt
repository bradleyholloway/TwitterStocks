 Wheat Futures Continue to Fall as Soybean Prices Rise amid Signs Southeast Drought Is Worsening   By Kilman, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1990  Wheat prices continued to slide toward the depressed levels of 1987 while soybean prices rose amid signs that the Southeast drought is worsening.  Prices of wheat futures contracts fell in the wake of reports that Canada and the European Community are arranging shipment of large amounts of low-priced wheat to countries, such as China, Egypt and Japan, traders said yesterday.  In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the futures contracts for delivery of soft red winter wheat fell to new life-of-contract lows. The wheat contract for September delivery dropped 6.25 cents a bushel to settle at $2.5625 a bushel.
