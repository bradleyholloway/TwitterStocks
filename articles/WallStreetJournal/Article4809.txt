 Russia, Ukraine May Not Sign Economic Pact --- Separatism and Squabbling About Trade Threaten Week-Old Draft Accord   By By Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1991  Neither Russian republic officials in Moscow nor Kiev leaders have made a final decision on whether to sign the economic pact, which was worked out Oct. 2 in Alma-Ata, capital of Kazakhstan. The issue is to be discussed at a meeting tomorrow between President Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of most Soviet republics, including Russia's Boris Yeltsin and the Ukraine's Leonid Kravchuk.  But opposition to the agreement has spread in Moscow and Kiev, with senior officials in both capitals complaining that the draft text is at best premature. In Russia, the issue has become a focus of fierce squabbling among Mr. Yeltsin's top aides that has almost paralyzed the government and led to the resignation of two officials, Prime Minister Ivan Silayev and economic specialist Mikhail Bocharov.  Two more of Mr. Yeltsin's lieutenants have quit this week, specificially citing the dispute over the economic accord. Yevgeny Saburov, the Russian economics minister who initialed the Alma-Ata accord, handed in his resignation yesterday, complaining to Parliament that "the Russian government in its present composition is incapable of stabilizing the economy and assuring the transition to a market."
