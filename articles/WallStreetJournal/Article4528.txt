 Solidarity Inherits a Mantle of Power In Nation That Likes to Defy the Wearer   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 1989  The old Stalinist boss, Wladyslaw Gomulka, once muttered those words in a fit of frustration, or so the story goes. The quote dates back to the early 1960s, when the middle-aged leaders of Solidarity, today's trade union-liberation movement, were children.  After a long count, the results of last Sunday's election are official: Solidarity knocked the Communists out cold. Entirely honest, the elections were not entirely free. Before they took place, Solidarity signed away the winner's right to run the government. So in Poland, the Communists remain in charge.  Except for the fact that the Communists cannot rule, short of reimposing martial law, without Solidarity's endorsement. The price Solidarity exacts for that endorsement will amount to a dominant influence over the exercise of power. And that's where the curse comes in. Anyone who tries to exercise power in Poland now will be jinxed from the start by the impossible task of electrifying the economy while struggling to keep the social peace.
