 Wall Street Firms Seek Recusal of Judge Hearing Class-Action Suit Involving IPOs   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  Judge [Shira Scheindlin] has initially rebuffed the request, saying she has disclaimed any interest in benefiting from any possible damages awarded to plaintiffs in the class-action cases. One of her law clerks said she wouldn't have any comment. Gandolfo V. DiBlasi, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who represents Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and acts as a liaison for the securities firms, also declined to comment. Among the defendants is the Credit Suisse First Boston unit of Credit Suisse Group, which has been an early focus of the regulatory probe; a lawyer representing CSFB in the matter didn't return a call seeking comment.
