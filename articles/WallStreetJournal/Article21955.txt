 Buy This Beauty: Runs on High-Test, Comes With Manual --- Chunk of a Reprocessing Plant For Bomb-Grade Uranium Turns Up at Used-Car Lot   By By Timothy Noah, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1994  POCATELLO, Idaho -- At Frontier Car Corral, proprietor Tom Johansen is offering a 1972 Ambassador sedan, a 1975 Sportscoach motor home and the major components of a nuclear reprocessing plant to make bomb-grade uranium.  Inadvertently, they also may be increasing that threat. Praised for a new policy of openness about the government's Cold War activities, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's department and its contractors may have become too lax. After all, not only did the government sell Mr. Johansen nuclear hardware, but it allowed him to acquire crucial blueprints, flow sheets and manuals needed to set it up.  Mr. Johansen, 41, a laconic Pocatello native who favors blue jeans and baseball caps, ended his formal education in high school. His ambitions long have extended beyond the plywood-paneled, fluorescent-lit sales office of the Frontier Car Corral. Funded by Metro Steel Inc., a family-owned Salt Lake City metals company, Mr. Johansen for several years has purchased and resold surplus from the nearby Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, a 900-square-mile complex set amid the brown buttes and dusty lava plains of Idaho's Arco desert.
