 Sabena Says KLM, British Airways To Invest in Unit   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1989  Sabena said British Airways PLC and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines each would take a 20% stake in the state-controlled Belgian concern's new air-transport subsidiary.  The agreement, which Sabena said was in the final stages of negotiation, would be Europe's biggest airline alliance, a worrisome prospect for other medium-sized carriers. The agreement would allow British Airways and KLM to "make a strong fist toward" Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France, said Kees Haasnoot, an analyst for Kempen & Co. in Amsterdam.  Sabena would retain a 60% stake in the unit, Sabena World Airlines, which would lease Sabena's fleet. Barring any objections from governments or the European Community, the new subsidiary would begin operating by Jan. 1. Sabena's other activities, such as catering, maintenance, hotels and duty-free shops, are excluded from the agreement.
