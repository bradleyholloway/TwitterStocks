 Energy: Rise in Electronic Trading Adds Uncertainty to Oil; Shift Leaves Traders Looking for Answers When Prices Jump   By Chambers, Matt, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  "One of the things that has been lost is the color and some of the information that the floor provides," said Andy Lebow, a senior vice president at brokerage Man Financial in New York. For example, on-the- floor traders can get a sense of whether it is actual oil users, like refiners or airlines, or financial speculators that are doing the buying or selling. "Now, if people ask what's going on, you can say, 'Well, I see numbers flashing on the computer,' but unless it's my customers driving it, I can't tell," he added.  The catalyst for Nymex's members to allow others access to their profitable crude-futures trading was the success of IntercontinentalExchange, the electronic energy market. The exchange launched a cash-settled copy of Nymex's benchmark U.S. light, sweet crude-oil futures in February 2006, and, with that added to its European Brent crude contract, quickly captured more than half of the world's crude-oil-futures trading.  A visit to the pits still reveals a hive of activity, if a little more subdued, and those still working there say the benefits of going through the floor are still there. Said Michael Cambria, who works on the floor at Nymex with PNDR Energy Group, "When I heard the spike to $68 could have been started by somebody's mistake -- to me, well, that was just 'Welcome to the world of electronic trading.'"
