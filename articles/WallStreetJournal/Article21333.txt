 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Bush in Europe   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 2, 1989  George Bush returns from the NATO summit today bathed in good will and friendly press notices. His vigorous calls for troop withdrawals and a dismantling of the Iron Curtain went over big in Europe, and particularly so in West Germany. His proposals, if they ever could be brought to fruition, would give middle Europeans a normal life, something they haven't experienced in more than 50 years. No wonder they responded with such enthusiasm.  Several things need to be said about this trip. First of all, the President himself was responsible for taking the political initiative at the summit. His critics were beating him up for letting Mikhail Gorbachev "win" the battle for the minds and hearts of Europeans, but he was laying his own plans. In the end, mostly by pointing to the obvious, he managed to get out in front of the NATO alliance and lead it in a direction politically appealing to Europeans from Cork to Krakow.  He built his initiative primarily on the conventional-arms reduction talks already under way in Vienna, saying, in effect, that if Mr. Gorbachev really wants to withdraw troops and tanks sufficiently to create parity between the forces of the East and West, that is fine with us. And as a gesture of good faith and balm for Chancellor Kohl, we'll once again agree to postpone any discussion of modernizing U.S. short-range nuclear missiles in the European theater until 1992, when we'll know more about how the conventional-forces reductions are working out.
