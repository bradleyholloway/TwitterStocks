 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review -- Closed-End Country Funds Feel Effects of Alternative Products   By By Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2000  In many ways, closed-end country funds ended the 1990s in much the same way they went into the decade. Thanks to the best performance by overseas stock markets in six years, these foreign-stock funds gained an average 56.8% in 1999, rewarding investors with returns vastly superior to most U.S. blue-chip indexes, just as they did in 1989.  At the beginning of the 1990s, when stocks in unifying Europe were suddenly hot and emerging markets were gaining legitimacy as an asset class, the typical closed-end country fund traded at a sharp premium to the net asset value of its underlying stocks. That was because these funds, which issue a limited number of shares, provided one of the best vehicles for exposure to these exploding but largely inaccessible foreign markets.  Fast forward: Even the best-performing closed-end funds finished 1999 at considerable discounts to their NAV, a reflection of how many new alternatives there are for investors to buy into companies based overseas -- American depositary receipts, open-end mutual funds and direct purchases of foreign shares through securities brokers. At the same time, closed-end funds are trying to fend off competition from upstart products such as World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS.
