 Groupe Bruxelles Lambert Displays Renewed Vigor After Collapse of Drexel   By Hagerty, Bob, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  Though the financial damage was relatively small, GBL was stung by criticism over its handling of the affair. Analysts reproached the company for not having sold its stake in the mid-1980s, when the junk-bond house was still flying high. They also criticized GBL for having let itself become so dependent on an investment over which it had no control. Drexel, which in its glory days accounted for as much as 40% of GBL's profit, never deigned to give its big Belgian shareholder a board seat.  Now the normally secretive GBL is depicting itself as a decidedly active investor, willing to buy and sell. At a shareholders meeting in May, GBL's chairman, Albert Frere, said GBL would concentrate on a limited number of high-quality companies, primarily ones based in Europe and in which GBL can have a significant influence.  In the past, concedes Emile Quevrin, a GBL director, the company was spread too thinly. But he says that problem was partly a legacy from investments made long before Mr. Frere took command as part of a 1981 rescue of GBL. One of those legacies was Drexel; another was Cie. Internationale des Wagons-Lits & du Tourisme S.A., a Franco-Belgian travel company best known for operating sleeping compartments on trains.
