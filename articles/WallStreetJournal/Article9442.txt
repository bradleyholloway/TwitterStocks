 In His Shadow, Taking Notes   By By Jonah Goldberg, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2002  Will Mr. [Richard Blow] pause to note the irony? After all, when JFK Jr. died in a plane crash in July 1999, it was Mr. Blow who issued fatwahs against [George] writers who had spoken to the press about the deceased icon. He reportedly fired the talented Lisa DePaulo for mentioning, to New York magazine, that [John F. Kennedy Jr.] had helped her cope with her mother's cancer and for saying that Kennedy "had good instincts" as an editor.  That's on page three. For the next couple hundred pages we're told what it was like to get hand-me-down ties and free Knicks tickets from the boss. There are lots of you-are-there moments when Mr. Blow is one of those unidentified men in the background as paparazzi snap pictures of his boss. Mr. Blow was often assigned the task of tapping Kennedy on the shoulder, pretending to have urgent business so John-John could break away from groupies and well-wishers. In other words, for all of Mr. Blow's milking of his relationship with Kennedy, the portrait in "American Son" rarely gets richer than skim.  It seems that, confidentiality agreement be damned, Mr. Blow had hoped to write a book about George even if Kennedy hadn't died. He certainly seems to have taken a lot of notes. Kennedy's death required a rewriting of a memoir about a failed magazine into an homage of its founder. He tosses in a few frothy bits about Kennedy shouting at his wife, about his flying ability, etc., but Mr. Blow is basically out of the room and the loop for the major developments in his boss's life. He didn't even become executive editor of the magazine until shortly before Kennedy's death.
