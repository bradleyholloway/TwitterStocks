 Inprise Director Sues to Overturn Rule Limiting Ability to Get Company Data   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 1999  The Scotts Valley, Calif., company, formerly Borland International Inc., on July 30 adopted policies that allow Inprise's chief executive officer to place limits on what corporate information directors can receive. Among other things, the policies require directors to consult with the CEO before any communication with the company's employees, who are also barred from communicating with directors without prior approval from the chief executive.  C. Robert Coates, an outside director and investor who joined the board in June, sued the company and other directors this week in Delaware Chancery Court. The suit brands the policies an illegal "gag order" that prevent him from carrying out his fiduciary responsibilities to oversee the company's operations.  Joanne Butler, Inprise's general counsel, characterized the policies as standard procedures that conform with Delaware law. She said they were adopted, in part, to make sure Mr. Coates and two other new directors were aware of their obligations not to improperly disclose confidential information.
