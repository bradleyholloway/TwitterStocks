 Common Sense: Bank of America's Deal-Making May Present a Buying Opportunity   By Stewart, James B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2005  Obviously, had I known that Bank of America was going to launch another major takeover, I would have waited. As I've noted in earlier columns discussing takeover bids, the stock of the acquirer almost always drops on the news. That's because earnings are often depressed by higher debt payments to finance the acquisition, or are diluted by the issuance of new shares to finance a deal, and because history suggests that many big mergers turn out to be a mistake.  Some may recall that today's Bank of America isn't the stalwart of California finance, but rather the former NationsBank, itself the product of even-more-obscure predecessors. That's why Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C., not San Francisco. After digesting Bank of America and adopting its brand name, it more recently gobbled up FleetBoston Financial, itself the union of Fleet and Bank of Boston.  Moreover, while there's a bidding war for an oil company like Unocal, when oil prices are at historically high levels, Bank of America is buying MBNA at a time when financial stocks are far from their peaks, and may represent bargains. Bank of America is offering a roughly 31% premium to MBNA's recent share price of about $25, but MBNA was trading above $28 as recently as the beginning of the year.
