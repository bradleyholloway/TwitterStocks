 The Market, Not Peronism, Has Devastated Argentina   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2004  In her July 23 Americas column, Mary Anastasia O'Grady tries to explain Argentine social protest as a "power struggle" within Peronism, without informing readers of the broader context in which it is being developed ("In Peronist Argentina, Every Day Is Groundhog Day"). After a decade of free-market reforms, Argentina faces a devastated landscape, in which half of its population lives below the poverty line. The top priority of President Kirchner is to find a nonviolent way to resolve this situation. Both the social drama and this administration's commitment to nonviolence have little to do with a power struggle within the official party.
