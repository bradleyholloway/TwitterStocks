 Business and Finance [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1993  CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS and the Clinton administration closed in on a deficit-reduction compromise, but it isn't clear they have the votes to pass it. Even as some concessions were made to win the votes of wavering lawmakers, other lawmakers threatened to bolt over some issues. The major tax and Medicare spending portions of the package have been decided and only minor issues remain.  Congress's scaled-back version of the administration's investment plan leans toward traditional Democratic social programs at the expense of more pro-business initiatives.  European currencies fell less than expected, as major central banks failed to lower interest rates, despite a newly loosened monetary system. Several European stock and bond markets rose, some very strongly, on speculation that rates will soon fall, spurring an economic recovery in Europe.
