 IXI Mobile Plans Diverse Answer To the All-in-One `Smartphone'   By By Buster Kantrow, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2003  IXI has generated a minor stir, not least by offering an application for Bluetooth, which has been much anticipated but so far has materialized mainly as a link for hands-free headsets. "What I'm saying, bluntly, is our stuff works and is adopted, or Bluetooth doesn't make sense," said Edgar Auslander, IXI's senior vice president of strategy and marketing. "We were created to bring wireless data to the market."  "It's a great idea, great on paper, but I'm skeptical," says Ben Wood, an analyst at Gartner Group in London. "The vision of this kind of diversity of accessory devices -- Bluetooth pens, Bluetooth headsets, Bluetooth sunglasses and watches -- is fun, but it's probably a little divorced from the reality of the market today." Mr. Wood notes that the consumer use of Bluetooth remains limited, and that typically only more advanced handsets are equipped to take advantage of Bluetooth links.
