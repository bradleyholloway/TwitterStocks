 For Soviet Readers, Most-Popular Books Are Hard to Find --- Scarcity of the Top 12 Works Leads Newspaper to Urge Larger Printing Efforts   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1988  MOSCOW (AP) -- The most sought-after books in the Soviet Union this summer show readers are clamoring for works born in the age of glasnost or released after years on the censor's shelves.  The government newspaper Izvestia ranked the most popular literary works in an article urging larger printings of books in hard-bound novel form for library sales and wider circulation of magazines that serialize major books.  Izvestia said it determined the 12 most popular books in the Soviet Union based on waiting lists at library reading halls, where Soviets can sign up for a turn to read the works on the premises. Some books can be checked out of libraries, but works with an especially strong following are kept at libraries to prevent theft.
