 Marketing at the Movies --- First, It Was On-Screen Ads; Now, It Is Lobby Promotions, And Some Call It Intrusive   By By Suzanne Vranica, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2002  Movie theaters are routinely used for advertising in Europe, where on-screen ads have been around for decades. In the U.S., however, on-screen commercials are relatively new. Last year, U.S. movie theaters brought in between $200 million and $300 million in on-screen ad revenue, according to industry estimates. By contrast, marketers spent about $19.4 billion on network TV.  Among those in the movie-theater industry that are ramping up their lobby marketing offerings is Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp., which owns 160 theaters in the U.S. Loews has three staffers dedicated to luring sponsors. To bring in additional ad deals, Loews also uses Screenvision, a New York-based movie-ad joint venture of Carlton Communications PLC and Thomson Multimedia SA.  John McCauley, vice president of marketing at Loews, says he can get as much as $1 million from a company for an annual sponsorship agreement that typically entitles it to theater signage and access to the theater lobby. Companies such as Coca-Cola Co. and General Mills Inc. are also using theaters for their ad pitches, Mr. McCauley adds. Lobby promotions experienced double-digit growth last year and generated roughly $40 million to $50 million, according to estimates by Screenvision.
