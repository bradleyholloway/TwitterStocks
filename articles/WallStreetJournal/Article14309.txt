 Most Stock Indexes Slip Again, But Several Issues Post New Gains   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1986  Thrift, utility and some bank stocks moved higher. Transportation stocks kept chugging along, too, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average closing up 2.99 at 866.74, a record for the third consecutive day.  The bond market rally of recent sessions apparently has sharpened investor appetites for such interest-rate sensitive issues as bank, thrift, insurance and utility stocks. This group showed little spark earlier this fall, when the rest of the market was gradually advancing and many analysts were touting the prospects of stocks that should benefit from a more robust economy. But the rate-sensitive issues started to post major advances early this week.  Insurance stocks traded on the Big Board scored big gains in the first three days of the week but eased yesterday. Thrift issues, however, kept rolling along. Among the gainers, H.F. Ahmanson rose 3/4 to 23 5/8; Great Western Financial moved up 1 1/8 to 45 1/2; Golden West Financial gained 1 1/4 to 35 3/4; and Far West Financial added 3/8 to 13. Financial stocks also were big gainers in the OTC market again.
