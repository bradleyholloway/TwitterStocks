 Pipeline Firms to Ask Legislature For Relief on City Franchise Fees   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1996  A coalition of pipeline owners, energy companies and industry groups is drafting legislation that would bar cities from collecting franchise fees -- which are based on a percentage of total revenue -- from long-distance transmission pipelines that cross city streets and land. Further, the proposed law would limit cities' ability to take pipeline owners to court to collect back franchise fees and refer any disputes over the fees to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates pipeline safety.  Proponents say such a law is needed to bring uniformity to myriad municipal franchise-fee regulations, and to clarify that existing fees are designed to reimburse cities for the cost of regulating pipelines within city limits.  The group is asking for legislative relief after nearly three dozen cities in Texas and Louisiana hired the Houston law firm of O'Quinn, Kerensky, McAninch & Laminack to collect potentially millions of dollars in unpaid franchise fees from the pipelines. Under the arrangement, the law firm charges the cities nothing for its activities and is paid a contingency fee out of any money it collects.
