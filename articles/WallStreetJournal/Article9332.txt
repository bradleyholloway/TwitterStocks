 What Does Dad Want? RedEnvelope Knows --- A Trip Through a New Catalog For the Loyal Husband Who Still Cultivates a Few Vices   By By Raymond Sokolov, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2001  Dad drinks. Quite a lot, apparently. He has a "cocktail set" ($95) and a monogrammed flask ($30) -- "Just a nip. That's all he'll need to keep him toasty warm in his waders [not included], around the campfire or while visiting the in-laws" (maybe more than just a nip at their house). He also has a "retro martini set" ($65), "sake pure + simple" ($38), a crystal vodka set ($35), a professional bar set ($110), a "hunter's flask + cup set" ($45), monogrammed tumblers ($45 for a set of four), a crystal bar decanter ($75), Riedel single malt glasses ($120 for 6), a duck wine decanter ($78), Riedel tasting glasses ($65 for 2), an iceless wine cooler ($35), a lavish array of wine accessories, monogrammed beer mugs and a microbrew kit.  Indeed, his interest in the activity that made him a father in the first place is barely visible in RedEnvelope. No subscriptions to men's magazines, no tank tops, no scents, no romantic cruises he might share with the Missus. The first of only two women to appear in this paean to paternity is an emphatically sexless creature all dressed down to paint the house. She sits on a ladder with a paintbrush in her right hand, a smudge of chaste white paint on her cheek and her left arm draped around his neck. He does rest his left hand on her thigh (with his wedding band in the foreground of the picture). Laughing, they gaze affectionately at each other. The alert consumer will note that he is wearing a tan cotton tool vest ($70). The caption hints archly: "Give him this vest and you may never hear, `Can you hand me that nail?' again."
