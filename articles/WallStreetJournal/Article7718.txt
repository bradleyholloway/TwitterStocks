 AT&T Taking Step to Bolster Computer Line --- Stake in Sun Microsystems Of Up to 20% Is Planned At Cost of $300 Million   By By Michael W. Miller and Brenton R. Schlender, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1988  American Telephone & Telegraph Co. agreed to buy as much as 20% of Sun Microsystems Inc., the young Silicon Valley company that AT&T has tapped to help shore up its loss-ridden computer business.  The move also gives a big dose of credibility to Sun, one of the computer industry's hottest newcomers, but one that hasn't yet shed its image as a brash adolescent company.  The investment plans follow an important technology pact AT&T and Sun announced last fall, in which Sun agreed to help AT&T develop a new family of mid-range computers. The joint venture is an ambitious bid to create an industry standard for powerful computers out of AT&T's Unix operating system and a Sun microchip -- dubbed Sparc -- much the way Microsoft Corp.'s software and Intel Corp.'s chip have become personal-computing standards.
