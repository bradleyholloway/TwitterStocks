 Comeback Diary: One Company Rebuilds: At Keefe Bruyette: Eulogies and Interviews   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  Few companies on Wall Street were as devastated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. The investment bank, whose offices were on the 88th and 89th floors of World Trade Center 2, lost 67 of its 220 employees, including some of its most talented analysts. Co-Chief Executive Joseph Berry was killed, as was Christopher Duffy, the son of John Duffy, now the firm's sole CEO. In a continuing series that will run periodically in The Wall Street Journal Online, John Duffy gives a first-person, behind-the-scenes look at his efforts to rebuild the investment bank over the past three tumultuous weeks, as told to Aaron Elstein of The Wall Street Journal Online. The initial report is published today in The Wall Street Journal; this and subsequent installments will be carried online at WSJ.com.  What to do now? I walked over to a hotel across the street from Penn Station and started making phone calls. I couldn't get in touch with the firm, so I called home to talk to my wife and tell her I was OK. I got my daughter on the phone and she told me one of the World Trade Center towers had collapsed. Which one, I asked. She wasn't sure. [Keefe Bruyette was located in WTC 2, the south tower. That tower was the second struck by a plane but the first to collapse.] I got back into my car and headed home. I soon knew that the second tower had collapsed and, as I drove home, I was thinking, my God, who got out? It seemed like I was stuck on the highway for a very long time. I got home and started calling our office in Hartford, Conn., which became something of a central information depository. That is when I found out my son was missing. He had moved out of the house on Sept. 1 to an apartment in Manhattan with some college friends of his. As the day wore on, I was notified about everyone else.
