 Settlement Accord With Ex-Directors Of WorldCom Fails   By Young, Shawn, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2005  The remaining defendants include two former directors who hadn't settled; the company's former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP; and 17 banks that underwrote WorldCom securities. Citigroup Inc., one of WorldCom's top underwriters, agreed last year to a $2.6 billion settlement.  "The bond underwriters have no objection to the WorldCom directors entering into a lawful settlement with investors," said a spokesman for the underwriters. "However, the plaintiffs wanted to include a judgment reduction formula in the settlement that we believe is clearly unlawful -- and we are pleased that Judge [Denise Cote] has agreed with us."
