 Genentech's Avastin Suffers Setback; FDA Panel Votes 5-4 Against Use of Drug To Treat Breast Cancer   By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2007  FDA officials questioned some aspects of the Genentech application. The agency stressed that patients taking Avastin in the main NCI study overall didn't live significantly longer. It also said Avastin didn't show a clear benefit in a separate study in patients with metastatic breast cancer that had previously been treated.  The agency also said there were more safety issues among the patients taking Avastin. FDA officials said they believed six deaths were likely or clearly tied to the drug regimen in the Avastin patient group, for a rate of 1.7%. The agency attributed no deaths to Taxol taken alone; Genentech officials said this number wasn't clear because of how the study's data were collected.  In the NCI Avastin study, the FDA said it saw disagreements among researchers over whether, and when, a patient's cancer progressed. Maha Hussain, the panel's chairwoman and a professor at the University of Michigan, said she felt there were "too many uncertainties in how data was collected." She said she believed that an approval based on such a study "lowers the bar."
