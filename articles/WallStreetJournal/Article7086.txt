 Health Costs: Keep Your Kids Insured   By McQueen, M P, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2010  (The rule remains in effect until 2014, when all adult kids will be able to get on a parent's plan.) Parents also can put adult children on their Cobra plan, which allows terminated workers to continue under their former employer's group health-insurance plan. [...] adult children who have passed a state's age limit for Cobra coverage under a parent's plan in the last 60 days may be able to stay or get back on the plan, says Phil Lebherz, executive director of the Foundation for Health Care Coverage.
