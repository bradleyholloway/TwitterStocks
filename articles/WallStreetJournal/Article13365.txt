 The Bush Budget On Deficit Cutting, Skeptics Abound   By McKinnon, John D, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2007  Mr. [Bush] also hasn't addressed the likely costs of long-term relief from the alternative minimum tax. Originally created by Congress in the 1960s to ensure ultrawealthy people didn't use credits and deductions to avoid paying any tax, it is beginning to hit the middle class. It isn't indexed for inflation, so more earners qualify for the AMT, and the Bush tax cuts have accelerated the expansion of its reach. Congress keeps passing one-year patches, but the cost of relief is soaring each year; it would be at least $36 billion through 2008 and could reach $1.3 trillion over the next decade, according to various estimates. Democrats are adamant about fixing the AMT problem, in part because it hits states they dominate -- such as New York, New Jersey and California -- especially hard.  Mr. Bush also is projecting reductions in expenditures for agricultural subsidies -- as much as $5 billion annually, compared with last year's forecast -- as the administration seeks to reauthorize farm-economy support programs. Much of the change is due to strong market demand, which has kept prices from falling to levels that trigger federal subsidy payments. But the administration's agriculture plan also is expected to tighten up on some programs, while focusing more on establishing overseas markets and putting more money into research, particularly renewable fuels. Some of those proposals could fall short of farm-state Democrats' expectations.  That reality sets up a much bigger debate over fiscal policy in 2009, following the presidential election in 2008. Hanging in the balance will be a possible overhaul of U.S. health care, the fate of Mr. Bush's tax cuts and maybe Social Security and Medicare. To jump- start the debate over entitlements, Mr. Bush again is urging Congress to create new private accounts for future Social Security recipients.
