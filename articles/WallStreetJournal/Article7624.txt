 Business and Finance [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1987  TEXACO LOST a major ruling in its legal battle with Pennzoil. The Supreme Court dismantled Texaco's protection against having to post a crippling $12 billion appeals bond, pushing Texaco to the brink of a Chapter 11 filing. But the court decision puts more pressure on both firms to settle the case, which stems from Texaco's 1984 takeover of Getty Oil.  General Motors slashed car production further due to continued weak sales and high inventories. The latest cutbacks, affecting four assembly plants, indicate GM has retreated from its optimistic sales outlook.  The Dow Jones industrials closed above 2400 for the first time with a modest rally by stocks. The average finished up 15.20 points, at a record 2405.54. A firmer dollar helped most bond prices edge higher, but traders said the market remains skittish.
