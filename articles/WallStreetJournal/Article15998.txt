 Letters to the Editor: Give the Warriors What They Need   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2001  I think the Army faces the most serious problem in our All-Volunteer Force. The Army needs to reorganize into three branches: the Combat Ready Force, the Heavy Armored Force and the Peace Keeping Force. CRF in a battalion size can consist of a few Apache attack Helicopters, the Bradley Fighting Vehicles, the Airborne and Ranger troops. HAF retains most of the M1 tanks, the BFVs and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems. PKF will be staffed by Reserve and Guards, equipped with the weapon systems left by the CRF and HAF. Only the best-qualified and longer-term volunteer soldiers can serve in the CRF. CRF soldiers don't need $50,000 of college tuition to lure them.
