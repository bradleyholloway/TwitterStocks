 Esprit Tries to Shed Its Youth Image; Popular Teen Brand in '80s Aims for More-Mature Look With a New Campaign   By Cho, Cynthia H, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2004  In its current advertising campaign, developed in-house, the company is aggressively pushing the image that it is no longer a brand for teens by featuring only clothing from what it calls its casual line, which is aimed at men and women 25 to 40. The models in the print and outdoor ads, who look to be in their mid-to-late 20s, reflect Esprit's position as a "mature fashion brand," says Andreas Adenauer, president of Esprit North America.  In April 2002, Hong Kong-based Esprit Holdings spent $150 million to buy back the U.S. rights to Esprit, which Oaktree Capital Management and Cerberus Partners had bought in 1996. Now that the U.S. brand is a part of Esprit Holdings, the ad campaign in the U.S. is part of a global effort to promote Esprit. While the ads are new to American shoppers, similar ones have been running in Europe and Asia for years, Mr. Griffith says.  In addition to showcasing only items from the casual line in its ads, the company has taken other measures to distance itself from its former young image. It is running print ads only in Lagardere's Elle and Time Warner's InStyle, in addition to the trade publication Women's Wear Daily, published by Advance Publications' Fairchild Publications. Esprit plans to run the ads in magazines geared toward younger readers in a few months.
