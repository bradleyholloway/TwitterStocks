 USA Network Says Time Warner Cable Is Playing Favorites   By By Sally Beatty and Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2001  Time Warner abruptly reversed course later last week after complaints from NBC -- which agreed with Bravo to take over Bravo's advertising obligation. Bravo will now stay where it is. General Electric Co.'s NBC owns a roughly 25% stake in Rainbow, Bravo's parent. A Rainbow spokeswoman declined to comment.  On Friday, USA Network, a unit of USA Networks Inc., also objected, and raised the issue of favoritism. "It is hard to conclude this repositioning is not a part of Time Warner favoring wholly or partially owned programming services over independent services," said USA Network. "As we have communicated to Time Warner directly, this pattern is disturbing and discriminatory."  AOL Time Warner -- which owns 50% of Court TV, the network set to assume USA's channel spot -- dismisses suggestions that it favors its own networks. Time Warner Cable says that on its system in New York and elsewhere channels not owned by AOL Time Warner, such as Viacom's Nickelodeon, occupy any number of lower channel slots.
