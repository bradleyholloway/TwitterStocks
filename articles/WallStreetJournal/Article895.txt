 A Special Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Selwyn Feinstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  Northwestern University says its latest survey of 200 corporations shows this year's college graduates are being offered starting salaries only 2% to 3% higher than the class of 1986. That's hardly enough to cover inflation. At the University of Houston, some recruiters are trying to save by shunning advanced-degree holders and hiring baccalaureates at entry-level pay.  The University of Pennsylvania says the hottest fields continue to be investment and commercial banking, engineering, accounting, computer science and retailing. The University of Maryland sees requests for majors in accounting, marketing and "business in general," but "not an awful lot of demand for liberal arts majors." Banks and consulting firms, though, are recruiting at Haverford College, a liberal arts school.  Job vacancies at senior corporate levels -- searches outside the company for positions paying $100,000 or more a year -- rose 12% in the first quarter from the year-before period, even while companies were cutting back on middle managers, says Korn/Ferry International. That increased interest at the top follows a 16% rise in last year's fourth quarter, when demand perked up after months of decline. Biggest hirers, says the recruiter, were in the financial-services, health and high-tech fields.
