 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Hollywood Report: After the Three-'Rings' Circus; Astin, Epic's Sam, Strives To Duck Blockbuster Bust; A Strikeout With Scorsese   By Lippman, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 2004  Mr. Astin and his agent, manager, lawyer and publicist are well aware that they have a very small window of opportunity to leverage the success of "Rings," and many in Hollywood think Mr. Astin will succeed, maybe more so than Elijah Wood, who played the trilogy's ostensible hero, Frodo. So Mr. Astin's nervously waiting the debut of "50 First Dates," starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, a sort of "The Wedding Singer" meets "Groundhog Day" meets "Awakenings." In the romantic comedy, Ms. Barrymore's character has a disorder that causes her to forget events of the previous day. A marine biologist (Mr. Sandler) falls for her. But, because of her overnight amnesia, he must woo her from scratch every day. Mr. Astin was right for the comedic role of the brother because "he's got this combination of sweetness to him, but also a real manliness," says "Dates" producer Larry Kennar.  Still, Mr. Astin's nervousness bubbles over in a phone interview. As the son of actors Patty Duke and John Astin (Gomez in the original "Addams Family" TV series), [Sean Astin] got his first acting job at age 10. He received good notices for the college football movie "Rudy," but the film did poorly, his weight ballooned and big parts stopped coming through. "I probably had $50,000 in the bank," he recalls. "I had a mortgage, insurance payments, two cars -- it goes." Making "Rudy," he found himself working out with Tom Hanks at the Sony Pictures studio gym. But after that, "I'm at L.A. Fitness," a health club frequently found at malls. For the decade after "Rudy," Mr. Astin would be consigned to the antipodes of Hollywood, mostly working in TV.
