 TV Cuts Both Ways For Plastic Surgeons And for Patients; If You Want Brad Pitt's Nose, Should a Reputable Doc Give You Dose of Reality?   By Antonio Regalado and Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2004  Leading doctors complain that both the Fox and MTV shows emphasize spectacular and unhealthy transformations. In MTV's program, people undergo surgery to look more like famous stars, such as Britney Spears and Elvis Presley. In Fox's show, which promises to turn a "gaggle of self-proclaimed 'ugly ducklings' into a bevy of graceful beauties," 17 women compete to be crowned the "swan." None of the contestants is allowed to look in the mirror during the three months in which they have surgery -- and counseling.  Are the doctors being thin-skinned? Nely Galan, the creator of Fox's "Swan," says the society will "have a change of heart once it sees the show," which will run for the first time tonight. "If I had three kids and my stomach was hanging down, what's the big deal about fixing it?" asks Ms. Galan, who adds, "You'd fix your house if the paint was chipping." Producers also say the show does vigorous psychological testing and consulting before and during the filming.  The surgical society also is coping with a spate of imitators. "It seems like every little town in America wants to do their own 'Extreme Makeover,' " says Charles Verheyden, a surgeon with the Scott and White Clinic in Temple, Texas, who is chairman of the ASPS ethics committee. Local TV news stations usually organize such programs, and Dr. Verheyden says he gets calls every week from doctors wondering whether they can participate. There are also overseas versions. In Italy, women who don't feel attractive have gone on the hit show "Scalpel: Nobody's Perfect."
