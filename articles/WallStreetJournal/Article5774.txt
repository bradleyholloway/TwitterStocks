 Number of N.C. Charter Schools May Reach Legal Limit By Spring   By By Will Pinkston, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1999  Charter schools are sprouting at a "phenomenal rate" in Florida and North Carolina as a result of laissez-faire laws in those states, but growth has been uneven throughout the rest of the Southeast, according to a federally funded study.  Leading the way in the Southeast is Florida, which passed its charter-school law in 1996 and now ranks fifth in the nation in the number of schools operating, according to U.S. Charter Schools, an initiative sponsored by the federal Department of Education. Florida law sets a per-district limit for charter schools; it ranges from 28 in school districts with more than 100,000 students down to 12 in districts with fewer than 50,000 students. The result: The state has more than 100 charter schools.
