 Number of Unsold Homes Increases; Listings Rise 2.5% In 18 Metro Areas; Pending Sales Fall   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  Total listings of homes in these metro areas at the end of June was up 2.5% from May, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas.  Thomas Lawler, a housing economist based in Vienna, Va., predicted that the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index, a national measure, will decline about 7% this year. He said that the housing market is unlikely to start recovering before mid-2008 at the earliest and that the recovery probably will be gradual. Among the wild cards is whether builders will slash production, which would reduce the glut of homes.
