 Stocks Gain; Firmer Bond Prices And Gains for Dollar Are Factors   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1987  The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 36.72 to 2508.16. After falling a total of 168 points in five of the six prior sessions, the market "was entitled to a bounce," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.  A sharp rise in Treasury bond futures and stock-index futures as well as higher prices for U.S. stocks traded in Europe set the New York market up for a lift as the opening bell was sounded yesterday. The industrial average jumped more than 30 points in the first few minutes of trading.  But a close reading of IBM's earnings report showed that the bulk of the increase came from a lower tax rate and a gain from the sale of its stake in Intel. The report actually "threw a wet blanket on the market," said Gerald Simmons, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
