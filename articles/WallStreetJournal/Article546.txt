 Seeking a Cooperative Missile Shield   By Anonymous, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2012  Sen. Jon Kyl's "Missile Defense Is Self-Defense" (op-ed, May 15) argument against giving Russia an assurance that U.S. missile defenses are not directed against Russia disregards the fact that such an assurance could open a path to a cooperative NATO-Russia missile defense. [...]NATO-Russia cooperation would defuse missile defense as a problem on the U.S.-Russia agenda at a time when Washington wants to ensure Moscow's continued support to supply U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan and keep pressure on Iran.
