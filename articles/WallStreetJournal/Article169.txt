 Britain's Major Can't Break Out of Slump Plaguing Him Despite Nation's Rebound   By By Craig Forman and Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1993  Over the weekend, Tory ministers seemed in disarray over plans to cut spending on the welfare state. Today, Mr. Major faces another potentially damaging rebellion by Conservative back-benchers over Tory plans to privatize British Rail. Turnabouts over the health service, educational testing and other policies suggest the Tories' grip on the levers of power is tentative.  Mr. Major's recent victory in a key parliamentary vote on the Maastricht treaty should have ushered in a new beginning. Instead, he gives the clear impression of lurching from crisis to crisis. He can't get away from speculation about a major cabinet reshuffle, in which Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont would be bumped. Even more worrisome, there is little evidence that the public knows what Mr. Major stands for, or has a clear idea how he differs on issues from his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher.  But voter sentiment doesn't seem to be rebounding quickly. Mr. Worcester, for one, figures Mr. Major has been so clearly linked with the recession that the economy would have to come roaring back to change voters' impressions of Tory bungling. "If the economy doesn't pull Mr. Major up by his bootstraps in the next 18 months, the Tories could dump him," says Mr. Worcester.
