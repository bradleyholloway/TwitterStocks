 Tribune Holder Might Back A Management Buyout   By Ellison, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2007  While it isn't uncommon for big shareholders to hire their own financial advisers, Blackstone's hiring raised questions about the foundation's intentions, including whether Tribune management intends to use it to make a bid for the company. Indeed, the foundation has signed a confidentiality agreement, allowing it to review Tribune's financial information just as potential bidders are doing.  Tribune stock makes up about 75% of the McCormick foundation's holdings, Mr. [Joseph A. Hays] said, and the foundation "advances the ideals of a free democratic society by investing in our children, communities and country," according to the foundation's annual report. Last July, the foundation acquired 10 million shares as part of Tribune's Dutch tender offer.  The foundation's five-person board is made up of three current Tribune executives: Mr. [Dennis FitzSimons], the CEO; Tribune Publishing President Scott Smith, and Los Angeles Times Publisher David Hiller. The other two members are former Tribune CEO John Madigan and James Dowdle, a former Tribune executive vice president.
