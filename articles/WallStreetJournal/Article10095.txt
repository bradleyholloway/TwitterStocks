 NTSB Weighs Measures To Improve Air Safety   By Pasztor, Andy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2007  Until now, the board's "most-wanted" list of aviation-safety improvements has called for equipment able to "give immediate warnings of probable [runway] collision/incursion directly" to pilots. Likewise, the Federal Aviation Administration has focused on measures -- both in the cockpit and by air-traffic controllers -- to maintain the required safe distance between planes on the ground. The agency, for example, has made it easier for carriers to install onboard moving map displays alerting pilots of an impending runway collision.  The anticipated changes by the NTSB also follow calls by independent safety experts, including William Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an Alexandria, Va., aviation-safety group, to broaden the emphasis on runway-safety measures. "While there have been relatively few fatalities associated with runway incursions," Mr. Voss told a House Transportation subcommittee in June, "it is impossible to ignore the number of incidents that have been reported." But he said "runway incursions are a subset of the larger problem of runway safety."
