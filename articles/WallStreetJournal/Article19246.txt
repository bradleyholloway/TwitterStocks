 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2000  "The Reform Party won New Hampshire," boasts Ross Perot aide Russ Verney. He says GOP Sen. [John] McCain's reform message mimics the Texas billionaire's earlier themes. Verney says he "couldn't rule out" that Perot might seek the White House again. But continued McCain success would cool developer Donald Trump's interest in the race, an adviser says.  McCain would siphon away Trump's potential support for a reform candidacy, says the adviser. Meantime, Trump plans to propose in St. Louis next week a universal health-care plan, financed by higher corporate taxes. Reform Party leadership remains in limbo until next week's national committee meeting decides whether to remove embattled Chairman Jack Gargan.  Congressional Democrats fret about a lengthy battle in which Gore becomes the nominee but "ends up dead" for the general election, says a House leadership aide. Gore allies insist Bradley can't go too far without hurting his own credibility. "It's hard to go from Pope John XXIII [McCain] to Jack the Ripper overnight," cracks Democratic pollster David Axelrod.
