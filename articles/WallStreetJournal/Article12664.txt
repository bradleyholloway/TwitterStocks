 WebMD and Quintiles Held Merger Talks   By By Ann Carrns, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  According to an affidavit from Dennis Gillings, Quintiles's chairman and chief executive, WebMD and Quintiles discussed "potential business combinations" on Jan. 11, when Mr. Gillings met with WebMD CEO Martin Wygod. "Most recently," Mr. Gillings's affidavit says, "Mr. Wygod has suggested that Quintiles should acquire WebMD."  An acquisition of WebMD by Quintiles would seem counterintuitive since, based on the number of shares outstanding reported by each company in their most-recent regulatory filings, WebMD has a market capitalization of about $3.2 billion, larger than Quintiles's roughly $2.2 billion.  The dispute stems from an agreement by WebMD in May to provide data to Quintiles as part of WebMD's $840 million acquisition of Quintiles's Envoy Corp. unit. Envoy is a clearinghouse, processing millions of medical, pharmacy and other claims daily over an electronic network. Quintiles repackages the data for sale to its clients, who glean insight into the popularity and use of various drugs.
