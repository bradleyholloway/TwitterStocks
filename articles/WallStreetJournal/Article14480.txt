 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Self-Inflicted Sanctions   The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1988  This week the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a ban on virtually all U.S. investment and trade with South Africa. It is generally acknowledged that the sanctions already in place have caused thousands of black South Africans to lose their jobs. What isn't known is that sanctions have cost just two small parts of the U.S. economy more than $600 million since 1985.  By almost every standard, the sanctions imposed on South Africa in 1986 have been a failure. The dismantling of apartheid has slowed to a crawl, black businesses are shutting their doors and American influence in the region has never been lower. But South Africa itself has never been the only concern of the pro-sanctions lobby. It is noteworthy that these major pro-sanctions drives always seem to emerge in U.S. election years, suggesting they have more to do with influencing political outcomes here than in South Africa.
