 Dollar to Take Back Seat to Yen, Euro This Week   By By Tom Barkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2000  Mr. [Ashraf Laidi] also said traders will be cautious about trading below the 104 yen level due to the threat of BOJ intervention to keep the yen from gaining too much strength and hurting recovery.  "It's very strong because manufacturing sentiment has been consistently improving in the euro zone, but particularly, traders will scrutinize the prices paid component of the PMI," said Mr. Laidi. "Any new or fresh signs of inflation in the euro zone may raise questions about the ECB's credibility to be ahead of curve."  Late Friday in New York, the dollar was staging a rebound against the yen, trading at 106.02 yen after hitting an intraday low of 104.76 yen, and up from 105.22 yen late Thursday in New York.
