 French Firms Find Ways to Get Construction Contracts in Iraq   By Faucon, Benoit, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2004  French companies are excluded by the U.S. government from bidding for U.S.-financed contracts valued at about $18.6 billion in Iraq, because of France's refusal to support the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The U.S. Defense Department released a memo in early December saying these contracts would be limited to companies from the 63 countries that gave military or political aid for the Iraq invasion.  Mr. Loos's comments come as France and the U.S. appear to be overcoming some of the tensions that surrounded the decision to invade Iraq last year, when the U.S. accused France of putting commercial ties with Iraq above the security threat from Saddam Hussein's government.  Waste and water management company Veolia Environnement SA acknowledges sending employees to Iraq on a humanitarian, nonprofit basis, but says they have since left the country. Catering company Sodexho Alliance SA has a contract to supply food services to U.S. Marines within the U.S. but said it wasn't providing services to U.S. Marines on tour of duty in Iraq.
