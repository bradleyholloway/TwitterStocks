 Japan Appears to Bet That Rising Joblessness Can Coexist With an Economy That Is Growing   By By Peter Landers, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1999  Friday's announcement of a record Japanese unemployment rate may show just how far the country is from recovery. But the government appears to believe that fast-rising unemployment and economic growth can coexist, and some new data suggest this scenario, while unlikely, isn't out of the question.  The Ministry of Labor said unemployment in March hit 4.8%, up 0.2 percentage point from February and a record since Japan started keeping statistics in 1953. The figures reflect the stepped-up pace of restructuring at Japanese companies, especially big ones such as Sega Enterprises Ltd. Sega announced last Wednesday that it is reducing by 1,000 its work force of 4,000 and may fire some people -- until now a taboo in Japan.  Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan, notes the Japanese have tended to spend a smaller proportion of their income when unemployment rises. If the trend holds, that means higher unemployment will carry a double whammy: Not only will Japanese earn less on average, but they will also spend less of what they earn.
