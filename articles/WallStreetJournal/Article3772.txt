 Americas: Anybody Up for Nation-Building in Haiti?   By O'Grady, Mary Anastasia, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2004  The "cannibals" have turned on the "monsters" seeking vengeance for the killing of one of their own. The "thugs" have joined up with the "cannibals" and have driven the "monsters" from the country's fourth largest city.  Gangsta rap? Try Haitian politics. "Monsters" is local Haitian terminology for President Jean Bertrand Aristide's brown shirts, the informal enforcers of his Lavalas Party regime that he has fed and groomed over the past decade. The "cannibals," offspring of the "monsters," have switched sides and are now allied with the "thugs," former Haitian military and police officers who oppose Mr. Aristide.  The removal of Mr. Aristide is a necessary but insufficient step in the rebuilding of Haitian democracy. Without a reliable peacekeeping force that commits for the long term to defend the rule of law and human life, the country's nascent democracy movement might be crushed. The 1994 U.S. intervention that returned Mr. Aristide to power and then left Haiti to suffer under his misrule teaches that foreign "help" requires a long-term commitment.
