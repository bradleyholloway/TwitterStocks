 Study of Kids' Brains Hopes to Answer: What Is Normal?   By Robert Lee Hotz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2007  When completed, this NIH brain archive promises to become the first clinical benchmark by which normal development can be judged, matching behavior to brain anatomy from birth through adolescence. With it, specialists should be able to understand better problems such as autism, in which neural miscues undermine the mind. Educators bedeviled by child-rearing fads and untested teaching theories should be able to match alterations in brain structure to the rise and fall of learning skills. "Once we know the map, we can tell what nudges the brain for good or ill," said NIH brain imaging expert Jay Giedd.  Not only is every new brain different from any other, but the variations within each one as it adapts, swells and contracts confound analysis. "A developing brain looks weird," said pediatric neurologist Katrina Gwinn at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who directs the NIH project. "Something that might be normal in an adult might look abnormal in a child."  The children were scanned periodically using three techniques: structural magnetic resonance imaging to catch changes in the brain's gray matter, which contains neurons; diffusion tensor imaging to monitor its white matter of connecting nerve fibers; and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to track the ups and downs of brain chemistry. To match changes in brain anatomy to mental abilities, the youngsters also regularly took tests of IQ, dexterity, spatial ability, memory and cognitive skills. "So we are actually able to follow individual children and look at snapshots of the same brain over time," said Dr. [Deborah Waber].
