 Executives on Trial: Key Witness Against Stewart Will Testify Today, After Delay   By Kara Scannell and Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2004  Parts of Mr. Faneuil's account began to fall into place yesterday. Judy Monaghan, an administrative manager at Merrill Lynch yesterday testified that Mr. [Peter Bacanovic] gave Mr. [Faneuil] a "lump sum" payment of $5,600 and raised his supplemental compensation to 1.75% of Mr. Bacanovic's monthly commissions, from 1.25%, in March 2002. Although the pay increase wasn't effective until July 2002, Ms. Monaghan said Mr. Bacanovic asked to see official documentation of the agreement around the time the raise was granted because he wanted "to illustrate to Doug there was additional payment coming through."  Ms. Monaghan's recollection didn't entirely match Mr. Faneuil's assertions. Ms. Monaghan said it was her idea that Mr. Faneuil take an extra week of vacation in early January 2002 because he had a "stressed-out, worried look." Ms. Monaghan also said she mentioned the vacation idea to Mr. Bacanovic, who agreed. Defense lawyers are expected to cross-examine Ms. Monaghan today.
