 Ask David Wessel   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2005  As part of the Social Security fix that President Reagan signed into law in 1983, up to 50% of Social Security benefits are subject to the income tax if a recipient's income (adjusted gross income plus tax- exempt interest plus one-half of the Social Security benefit) exceeds $25,000 for single taxpayers and $32,000 for married couples.  The Congressional Budget Office's June 2004 "Outlook for Social Security" (see www.cbo.gov) has more details on how income taxation of Social Security works. People with private pensions aren't taxed on the portion of their pensions that represent their after-tax contributions, but do have to pay taxes on the rest.
