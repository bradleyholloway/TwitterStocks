 OPEC's Freeze Keeps Pressure on Prices; Cartel Blames Markets For Oil's Steep Rise, But Promises 'Vigilance'   By Cummins, Chip, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2007  Ministers said that OPEC's supply-and-demand figures suggest there is ample inventory of crude to keep consumers well supplied through the winter. But OPEC officials also said they were seeing a potential buildup of supplies afterward. Some fear weaker global economic growth could eat into demand, leading to oversupplies. "We have supply to meet demand in the winter," said Hassan Qabazard, director of OPEC's research division, after the decision was announced. "After that, we have excess," he said.  The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based watchdog for consumer countries, said in a statement after the OPEC decision that the market remained "clearly uncomfortable" over diminishing stockpiles of crude and the fact that oil remains around $90 a barrel. The IEA did note that OPEC production has been higher recently than expected, thanks to recent increases from Iraq and Angola.  In 2003, near the start of the recent price run-up, OPEC's spare capacity was pegged by some at less than one million barrels a day. Today, the cushion stands at 3.5 million to four million barrels a day, and on its way up to five million a day, according to OPEC officials. The IEA, excluding OPEC members with political or physical barriers to ramping up production, estimates OPEC's spare capacity at 2.5 million barrels a day.
