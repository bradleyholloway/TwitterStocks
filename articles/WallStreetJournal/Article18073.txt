 Ceaucescu's Palace, Monument to Ego, Has New Landlords --- The People of Romania Face An Interesting Quandary: What to Do With It Now   By By Philip Revzin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1990  Romanians have just such a white elephant on their hands, built but never finished by the executed dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu, and now public property in fact.  As they stand in long lines to buy their meat and bread, many Romanians ponder such questions. Mr. Ceaucescu's dream -- the House of the Republic -- is, rather, a folly that cost this poor country more than $1 billion over the past 10 years. Today it stands empty and unused, dominating downtown Bucharest, a monument to megalomania. The new government won't move into it. Nobody knows quite what to do with it. Everybody has a suggestion.  Strangely, some Romanians feel a perverse attachment to this absurdly luxurious structure built with their money and the sweat of their brow while most people here were shivering in dark, unheated housing. The palace was built by some 100,000 workers, many of them army conscripts forced to do construction work. Traian Guiu, a stocky, balding boilermaker, who with 10,000 others is touring the building, is asked if he is angry.
