 1998 Year-End Review of Underwriting: Corporate Issuers Draw on U.S. Capital Markets for a Record Sum   By By Anita Raghavan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1999  "The new-issue market for stocks clearly shut down in August," said Richard Kauffman, head of global equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. Mr. Kauffman points to the fact that less than a dozen deals of more than $100 million have been offered in the stock capital markets since Labor Day as a sign that the market for IPOs barely reopened this fall. "The fourth quarter was probably the quarter of large deals, the Internet and nothing else," he said.  Among the highlights were three large initial public offerings: a $4.4 billion stock sale by Conoco Inc., the oil subsidiary of DuPont Co. and the largest U.S. public-market IPO ever; a $2.9 billion offering by Infinity Broadcasting Corp., a spinoff from CBS Corp.; and a $2.8 billion issue from Fox Entertainment Group Inc., a spinoff by News Corp. Together, the three offerings represented more than 20% of the IPO volume in 1998, according to Securities Data. (Another blockbuster IPO, the $18 billion offering by Japanese mobile-telecommunications concern NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., which ranks as the largest IPO ever, wasn't included in the underwriting rankings because it was sold to private investors.)  A third of IPOs were priced below their initial filing range in the third quarter, according to Tom Tuft, co-head of global equity capital markets at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Only 9% of IPOs were priced above the range. By comparison, in the fourth quarter, about 30% of IPOs were priced above their initial range, Mr. Tuft said.
