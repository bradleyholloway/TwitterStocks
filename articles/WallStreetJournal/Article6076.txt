 Taste -- Houses of Worship: The Power of Prophecy   By By Edith Blumhofer, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2002  Well, the Kingdom of God did not arrive in 1966. But its arrival is still on many minds. While most evangelicals know nothing of [Homer A. Tomlinson]'s antics, most share his deepest conviction: that the nation of Israel and the "end times" are inseparably linked. Indeed, they believe that the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 set the stage for the return of Christ. This is one reason evangelicals have been such strong supporters of Israel throughout its history, including today.  For evangelicals, marking events in Israel is a way of noting progress on their own end-times calendar. It reminds them of the need to evangelize the lost as well as of the importance of their own readiness for Christ's return. Some also eagerly await the conversion to Christianity of the Jews, taking literally (as the Scofield Bible teaches) the words of St. Paul's Letter to the Romans: "All Israel shall be saved." This hope has long animated evangelical missions to the Jews.  The evangelical interest in Israel reaches much further back than 1948. Jonathan Edwards, grandson of the Puritans and promoter of the Great Awakening, proclaimed in the 18th century his expectation that the Jews would return to the land of Israel. For Edwards, this certainty was rooted in the character of God, who had promised it. And so generations of American evangelicals have embraced the view that the God who is faithful to his promises will someday restore Israel uncontrovertibly to the Jews.
