 House Panel Nears Completion of Bill Aimed at Overhauling Thrift Industry   By By Paulette Thomas Staff Reporter of Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1989  The House Banking Committee approved its version of legislation to overhaul the thrift industry, keeping the plan's funding package intact and adding provisions for low-income housing.  The bill passed on a 49-2 vote late last night, after four days of debate and consideration of more than 120 amendments. The bill will be reviewed by at least two other committees before going to the House floor. The Senate already has passed a similar version of the bill, which closely resembles the proposal made by President Bush three months ago.  But the House committee, under the populist Mr. Gonzalez, added provisions for low-income housing. After more than 12 hours of debate yesterday, the committee approved an amendment that would give nonprofit organizations and low-income people the right of first refusal to acquire some low-cost housing. Sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), the amendment would require the Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal agency to dispose of repossessed assets of insolvent S&Ls, to hold some repossessed property for three months and sell it to low-income people at a discount.
