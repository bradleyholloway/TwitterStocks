 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2004  This new option is effective only for 2004 and 2005. But it may prove so popular that it could eventually win a longer life. Sponsors of the bill "are probably counting on the fact that, like so many other tax benefits available for a limited number of years, this deduction will be extended in the next Congress," says a new publication by CCH Inc., a Riverwoods, Ill. provider of tax and other business information.  A: The House-Senate conference report on the new law specifically says you have the option of deducting "state and local general sales taxes in lieu of the itemized deduction provided under present law for state and local income taxes." So, it's clearly not limited to state sales taxes. For more details on the new law, see the Web site of the House Ways and Means Committee (http://waysandmeans.house.gov/), whose chairman is Rep. Bill Thomas of California.  Tom Herman's "Tax Report" appears Wednesdays in The Wall Street Journal.
