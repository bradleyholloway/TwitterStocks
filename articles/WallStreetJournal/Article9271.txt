 A Weak Presidency Doesn't Mean Stalemate   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2000  It's equally true that this will be the most tenuous new presidency in over a century. Not only did a plurality of Americans nationwide vote for Mr. [George W. Bush]'s opponent, but it seems clear a plurality of Floridians who went to the polls Nov. 7 did the same. The Bush victory was due to a flawed ballot system. And since the election, Mr. Bush is not to be confused with a confident, comfortable, secure man ready to lead the country.  There's also a better-than-even chance of reaching a bipartisan accord on tax cuts next year. Mr. Bush would have to scale back significantly on his huge $1.3 trillion proposal and go along with some of the targeted approaches proposed by [Al Gore]. Democrats, in turn, would go along with ending the so-called marriage penalty, reducing (but not eliminating) estate taxes and cutting the top marginal tax rate by a point or two (less than Mr. Bush proposed). The resulting overall size and shape of a tax cut would be broadly consistent with what many politicians, Republicans as well as Democrats, campaigned on this fall.  The tone for dealing with these big-ticket items may be set in the first couple months of the 107th Congress by Mr. Bush's old rival, [John McCain]. The Arizona Republican will demand a vote on campaign-finance reform. If the Senate GOP leadership resists, he warns, there will be "blood on the floor." Ms. [Susan Collins] is one who says she'll stick with him in a protracted struggle.
