 Boskin to Head Bush Advisers On Economy --- Stanford Economist Helped Forge President-Elect's 'Flexible Freeze' Plan   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1988  President-elect Bush chose Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, a mainstream conservative who has sometimes been critical of Reagan administration policies, to head his Council of Economic Advisers.  Mr. Boskin was a close adviser to Mr. Bush throughout the presidential campaign. He will bring to the Bush administration two qualities valued by the president-elect: a solid reputation in academia, and unswerving loyalty to his boss.  Mr. Boskin is one of the authors of Mr. Bush's "flexible freeze" proposal, which suggests the federal budget deficit can be eliminated without raising taxes simply by controlling the growth of spending and encouraging economic growth. In a speech yesterday, he gave a rosy view of the current economic picture, dismissing fears expressed by Federal Reserve officials that the economy is growing too fast to prevent an outbreak of inflation.
