 Philip Morris, Moving Swiftly, Unveils Plan to Meld Kraft and General Foods   By By Alix M. Freedman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1989  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Philip Morris Cos., moving with unusual swiftness, unveiled its plan to meld Kraft Inc., acquired for $12.9 billion last November, and General Foods Corp. into the world's second-biggest food company.  The plan calls for John M. Richman, vice chairman of Philip Morris, to oversee the integration of the two companies in his new capacity as chairman and chief executive officer of Kraft General Foods.  Michael A. Miles, president and chief executive of Kraft, will become president and chief operating officer of the newly formed entity. Mr. Miles, who in recent weeks was rumored to be a leading candidate for the post of chief executive at RJR Nabisco Inc., will take over Mr. Richman's job as chief executive "sometime in 1990," when the integration is complete, Philip Morris said. Mr. Richman will remain as vice chairman of Philip Morris.
