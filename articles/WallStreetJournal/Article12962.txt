 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Theater -- View: The Odor of Sanctimony   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2003  Not only is "Trumbo" dull, it's shifty. In the first scene, Trumbo refuses to tell HUAC whether or not he is a Communist. A few pages later, we learn from Mr. [Gordon MacDonald]/Trumbo that his father explained Communism to the Trumbo children as "a system where people were provided for on the basis of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.'" After that, we're told that Trumbo managed to survive the blacklist "without having co-operated with the Committee, without naming names, without recanting previously held beliefs." And that's it. Not one word is said about the precise nature of the "previously held beliefs" he declined to recant. Innocent viewers will likely come away supposing that his only deeply held conviction was that it is immoral to inform on your friends.  One thing "Trumbo" does make clear, albeit unintentionally, is that its subject was a smug, sanctimonious windbag who suffered from the mistaken notion that he was funny. It would also have been worth pointing out that he was a well-compensated Hollywood hack who paid his party dues (and bought his luxurious California ranch) by cranking out such deathless masterpieces as "The Flying Irishman," "Sorority House," "Kitty Foyle," "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" and "Tender Comrade." One might well call him a limousine Leninist, though I prefer the crack Billy Wilder made about the Unfriendly Ten: "Only one of them had talent. The rest were just unfriendly."
