 Travel Watch: Find Out If Your Bundle Deal Is a Bargain   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2005  Price a la carte. Always try pricing the package components individually by using travel-booking sites or, even better, going straight to the airline's or hotel's Web site. The reason: Travel packagers often build a commission into their price. So if the components aren't heavily discounted, you might pay more to cover the dealer's commission. Also many hotels offer cheaper prices on their own Web sites.  One isn't always going to be cheaper than the other, so it's smart to check both types, says Zak Patten, associate editor at the site. Make sure you've fully priced the trip including all the commissions and service fees.
