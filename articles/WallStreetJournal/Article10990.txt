 Fast-Food Chains Draw Criticism For Marketing Fare as Nutritional   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1987  Improbable as it seems to their critics, fast-food companies are jumping on the nutrition-advertising bandwagon. McDonald's Corp. alone plans to spend an estimated $20 million this year to tout what it calls the "positive nutritional value" of its food. Arby's Inc., meanwhile, has obtained permission to advertise that its sandwiches are "prepared in compliance with the guidelines of the American Heart Association" -- which says it considered such things as fat and sodium content. Pillsbury Co.'s Burger King chain also is considering nutrition ads.  "The McDonald's ads are hypocrisy," says Michael Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C., consumer group. He complained in a letter to McDonald's that the ads are deceptive because they make only selective nutrition claims. "McDonald's food is loaded with grease and salt, but the ads imply you can make a balanced diet out of it," he says.  Also critical of McDonald's is Michael McGinnis, an assistant surgeon general who helped write the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' seven guidelines to a good diet. The advice -- repeated in a McDonald's ad -- includes avoiding sugar, sodium and alcohol; the ad says that McDonald's "fits in" with this concept. But that isn't true, says Mr. McGinnis. He contends that with the possible exception of the salads in some restaurants, there isn't much at McDonald's that belongs in a proper diet.
