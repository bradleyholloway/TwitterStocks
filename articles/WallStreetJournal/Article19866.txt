 Gore Group to Start Cable Channel as Youth Forum   By Flint, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2005  Messrs. [Al Gore] and [Joel Hyatt] say they hope young people will use the channel as a forum to express their opinions on news and current events. Viewers will be invited to submit short films, documentaries and home videos to be aired on the channel. Mr. Gore's group also has struck a deal with Google Inc. to use information from Google in its programming.  A segment called "Google Current" will report on what topics are generating the most interest on the Web, using Google as its source. Google doesn't do its own reporting, but will rank the topics, based on which subjects generate the most search queries. A Google spokesman confirmed it struck an agreement with Mr. Gore's group.  Broadening the channel's distribution is likely to be a top priority. Newsworld, which now carries an assortment of international newscasts, is available on satellite TV and cable-TV services in about 20 million homes. Mr. Gore's group hopes to boost its distribution to 50 million homes in five years. In comparison, channels such as CNN and MTV are available in 80 million to 90 million homes.
