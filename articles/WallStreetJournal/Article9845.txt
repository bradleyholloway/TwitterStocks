 Time Inc. Will Appoint Huey Editor in Chief Before Year End; Pearlstine Successor Faces Advertising Challenges At Flagship Magazines   By Hagan, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2005  Mr. [John Huey], whose selection was expected, will succeed Norman Pearlstine, 63 years old, who has for 11 years presided over the editorial side of Time Inc., the Time Warner Inc. unit that publishes 155 magazines including Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and People. The transition to Mr. Huey, a former managing editor of Fortune who has worked with Mr. Pearlstine for years, was orchestrated in contract negotiations two years ago, the people familiar with the matter said.  As editorial director overseeing the weekly and business magazines since 2001, Mr. Huey has shown a willingness to aggressively shake up magazines. Earlier this year, he named the editor of Time's London European edition, Eric Pooley, to be Fortune's managing editor. In 2002, he hired Terry McDonnell, the editor in chief of Wenner Media's US Weekly, to run Sports Illustrated.  After two court appeals failed, Mr. Pearlstine opted to hand over Mr. Cooper's electronic notes to the government, reasoning that Time Inc. wasn't above the law to continue resisting. He called the decision "the toughest in my career." His book, to be called "Off the Record: The Use and Misuse of Anonymous Sources," will explain why he turned over the reporter's notes.
