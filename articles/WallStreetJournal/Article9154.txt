 Lucent Shocks Investors With Shortfall --- Longtime Highflier's Stock Plummets After Hours Due to Profit Warning   By By Stephanie N. Mehta, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2000  Lucent made the disclosure after the markets closed. At the 4 p.m. close of the New York Stock Exchange, it was down $3.75 at $69. In after-hours trading, its shares tumbled an additional $17 to $52. For the day, the nearly 29% loss would translate into $63.7 billion of lost market capitalization.  The expected shortfall is a blow for a company that has consistently met or beat analysts' estimates. "We are clearly disappointed with the results for the quarter," Lucent Chairman Richard McGinn said.  In many cases, Mr. McGinn said, customers are simply postponing their purchases until Lucent can deliver the gear. But some customers that needed such equipment immediately turned to Lucent's competitors.
