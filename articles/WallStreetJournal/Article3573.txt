 Health & Science: FDA Advisers to Review AstraZeneca's Prilosec   By By Jill Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  If Prilosec is approved for over-the-counter sales, it would cost about $1 a pill, down from $4 a pill, and would be marketed by Procter & Gamble Co., dividing the profits between P&G and AstraZeneca. Prilosec was the best-selling drug in the world until recently, with sales topping $6 billion at one point.  AstraZeneca is trying to protect its billion-dollar Prilosec sales by getting patients to switch from Prilosec to the company's slightly different heartburn drug called Nexium, which remains under patent. But the company wasn't able to launch Nexium early enough to get a majority of Prilosec users to switch before that patent expired. AstraZeneca also is entangled in lawsuits with generic makers who want to make their own versions of Prilosec.
