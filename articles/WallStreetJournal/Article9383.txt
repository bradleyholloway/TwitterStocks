 Regional Report: Cross Country   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2001  Mounting budget pressures will probably force more states to issue special bonds to cash in their portion of the 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies over the coming year. Wisconsin, Nevada and West Virginia, among others, now are considering issuing such bonds as Wall Street becomes more comfortable with the esoteric securities.  By issuing the bonds, states are borrowing against the future payments they expect to receive from tobacco companies, which are forecast to total $206 billion for 46 states, Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories by 2024. Alaska, Alabama, Iowa and South Carolina already have issued such bonds.  The next likely issuer is Wisconsin, where state officials are considering raising as much as $1.9 billion, double what they had originally expected to issue in tobacco bonds. The state Legislature already had authorized using $450 million of the proceeds to plug a revenue shortfall; the rest will go to an endowment fund and be invested back into the market. Frank Hoadley, Wisconsin's director of capital, says the state expects to earn a higher return on those investments than it will pay out in interest to investors who buy the bonds.
