 Film: The Naked Truth: A Tale From the Czech   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1988  Tomas, a handsome young surgeon, has a standard greeting for attractive women: "Take off your clothes." His directness throws them off guard -- and he's handsome -- so they frequently do what he says. He has sex with them and goes home, where he always spends the night alone on a single bed. He's determined to travel "light" through life -- unbeholden to anyone or anything -- because he thinks that commitment of any kind will destroy him.  Tomas is the rakish, soulful, ironic hero of "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," Philip Kaufman's splendid film adaptation of the Czech exile Milan Kundera's dazzling novel, which was published in the U.S. four years ago. In Mr. Kundera's skillful hands, Tomas was a philosophical and artistic symbol within a complicated, pessimistic fable.  It was no small trick to project Tomas sympathetically onto film, where harsh objectivity might make him seem like a shallow lecher, at least at first. But by casting Daniel Day-Lewis as Tomas, Mr. Kaufman found a way to make the Kundera character vulnerable and tragic, even before he finds conviction and acts on it. Mr. Day-Lewis has already demonstrated his versatility with remarkable performances in "My Beautiful Laundrette" (as a homosexual punk) and "Room With a View" (as an insufferable, sniffy Victorian). The young actor's amused imperturbability and his dark, thin good looks help him now to make himself plausible both as a rake and, deeper down, someone troubled and noble.
