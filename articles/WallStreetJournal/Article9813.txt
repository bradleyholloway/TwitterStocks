 Job Hopping Overseas Can Enhance a Career, But It Takes Fortitude   By Lublin, Joann S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2005  Switching continents to switch jobs can enhance your career. Bilingual global managers "are going to be more and more in demand," predicts Kyung Yoon, a vice chairman of search firm Heidrick & Struggles International. "But the learning curve is very high if you've never lived in that target country before."  IN MOST cross-continental placements, "we have had a five- or 10- year relationship with someone" and know the person's track record intimately, says Jeff Hauswirth, head of the Toronto office for recruiters Spencer Stuart. Prepare for such a move at least "a year or two in advance," he advises.  For his Visa interviews, Mr. [Bill Lee] took extra days off during a U.S. vacation. Your willingness to subsidize such screening costs may bolster your chances of a cross-continental job hop. Inform hiring managers "that it's relatively easy for you to be there," suggests Marilyn Machlowitz, a New York executive recruiter. "Offer to inconvenience yourself."
