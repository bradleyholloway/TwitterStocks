 A Show of Hands Carries the Day In Tiny Appenzell; Swiss Canton Votes Annually In the Town Square; This Year, a Leash Law   By Thurow, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2005  The open-air voting day is particularly suited to Appenzell. All the other cantons in Switzerland, except one, have adopted more modern voting methods. Appenzell is the smallest canton, with 15,000 people and pastures full of cows that produce the milk for the region's famous cheese. (Officially, the tiny canton is known as Appenzell Inner-Rhodes; neighboring Appenzell Outer-Rhodes is more than three times its size.) A canton administration runs the daily affairs and keeps track of the finances. And residents vote on federal matters -- elections to national parliament or referendums on issues like how to use the national gold reserve -- in the modern way of secret balloting. But the cantonal elections for office, enacting a dog-leash law and deciding on big spending projects like the traffic island are all done out in the open.  "Some people thought the women would come and spread manure all over town," says Mirjam Walzthoeny, who returned to her post at Appenzell's information center after the voting. "But there were no problems. There's never been a problem."  [Lydia Rechsteiner], proud to be inside the voting circle, checked her watch after the proceedings. "A little long this year," she said, "but we had some important business." She was particularly happy to raise her hand for the new dog law, which met no opposition. "I've been bitten three times while hiking," she said.
