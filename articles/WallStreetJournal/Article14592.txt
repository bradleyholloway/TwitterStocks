 A Fusion Discovery Tentatively Confirmed   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1989  "We're not absolutely certain, but we have detected neutrons (produced by fusion reactions) that are consistent with the Brigham Young result," said Kelvin Lynn, a researcher at Brookhaven, a federal government-supported lab in Upton, N.Y. The neutrons were produced in a battery-like device similar to ones employed in so-called cold fusion experiments by two Utah teams, whose reports have sparked world-wide fusion fervor.  Scientists still haven't reported replication of a more controversial, separate experiment by a University of Utah chemist, B. Stanley Pons, and his British colleague, Martin Fleischmann. Their claims, while considered far-fetched by many scientists, have sparked excitement, because the results indicate cold fusion can produce large amounts of energy. If the finding is confirmed, "It would be the most significant discovery since fire," said Philip Ross, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, a federally supported facility that is associated with the University of California at Berkeley.  Fusion, the combining of the nuclei of hydrogen atoms to release energy, occurs at millions of degrees in hydrogen-bomb explosions and stars. Scientists have sought for decades to harness it for power generation. Two weeks ago, the University of Utah researchers reported they had generated copious quantities of heat and other signs of fusion in rods of the metallic element palladium, laden with deuterium, a form of hydrogen. Brigham Young's Mr. Jones last week reported that his team, using similar apparatus, independently found signs of fusion on a much smaller scale than that claimed by Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann.
