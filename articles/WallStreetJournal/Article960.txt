 Market Timers Get a Boost From Wall Street Gyrations   By By Cynthia Crossen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1987  Market timing amounts to jumping among stocks, bonds or cash, trying to pick the next winner. Most sophisticated investors stopped doing so in the 1970s and 1980s, as studies showed that market timers usually lost more than they gained. Instead, big investors spread money among stocks, bonds and other assets, according to a long-term plan that wasn't supposed to budge.  In the $2 trillion pension-investment business, tactical asset allocators still have only a small chunk, estimated at $10 billion to $20 billion. But the field is growing rapidly, particularly among corporate pension funds. Many asset allocators have won points for abandoning the stock market well before the Oct. 19 crash.  "Watching the market go up month after month was really tough," says Michael T. FitzGerald, managing director of TSA. "But in October, we suffered no loss in our portfolio," while stock averages plunged nearly 30%. Mr. FitzGerald says one of TSA's portfolios went into October about 13 percentage points behind the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but finished the month 14.4 percentage points ahead of the S&P. These swings are much wider than usual, he adds.
