 Politics Before Safety   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  We admit to a smidgen of sympathy for Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, who says the problem is a lack of money. In attempting mission impossible, the TSA long ago burned up the $2 billion Congress appropriated for its first year. But it must be conceded that Mr. Mineta and the TSA's recently fired head, John Magaw, sometimes seemed more interested in the empire-building opportunities Congress afforded than in making the best of a difficult mandate. The TSA wasted months designing a logo and uniforms. And after it mooted plans to employ more than 60,000 screeners (more than twice the number in the current private system), Congress voted to cap the number at 45,000.  Already hamstrung by a Congressional requirement to hire only U.S. citizens as screeners, the TSA managed to add obstacles of its own. It was initially pushing for a 50% female work force on the grounds women shouldn't be patted down by male screeners. That was necessary only because the TSA's own fears of "profiling" left it committed to an ineffective policy of random searches. With cockpits still undefended, with recent TSA tests showing fake guns and bombs getting past screeners 25% of the time, and with the TSA's air marshal program in apparent disarray, that search policy is nothing short of a clear and present danger. In sum, "the United States does not have a security system, it has a system for bothering people," says Israeli security consultant Shlomo Dror.
