 China's Power Play   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2005  Beijing's effort to exclude the U.S. is a raw show of China's new political muscle. Over time, a body without U.S. participation will tend to define itself in opposition to American purposes. Just look at the China-dominated Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a recent alliance with Russia and four former Soviet states. Last month it called for U.S. forces to quit Central Asia. Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld had to make a rush trip to Kyrgyzstan to preserve the use of Central Asian bases to supply U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  The record on this count has been disappointing. Indonesia, Asean's largest member, was alarmed when China put forward its proposal for a summit that excludes the U.S. -- but decided against confronting Beijing on the issue. Vietnam too has repeatedly voiced concern in private but is reluctant to publicly challenge the Chinese. Indonesian and Malaysian opposition to an American proposal to help patrol the Strait of Malacca sent an unfortunate message about their support for a continued U.S. presence in Asia.
