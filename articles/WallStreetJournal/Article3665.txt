 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2003  The Dutch agriculture ministry confirmed a 57-year-old doctor, whom it didn't identify, died Thursday of pneumonia in the southern Dutch town of Den Bosch two days after beginning work on a farm at which animals were infected with bird flu. It said the veterinarian hadn't taken antiviral medication that Dutch health officials had prescribed as a preventative measure for workers coming into contact with infected animals.  The declaration was the furthest Mr. [Gerhard Schroeder] has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S. He and his center-left government criticized Washington's steps against Iraq right up until the war started. In early April, Mr. Schroeder began making a slow retreat, saying for the first time he hoped U.S.-led forces would win the war quickly. -- Reuters  India says Islamic separatists are crossing into Jammu-Kashmir from Pakistan's portion of the Himalayan region to attack Indian troops and other targets. The two countries nearly went to war after a terrorist attack on India's parliament in December 2001 that India blamed on Pakistan. While tensions have since eased, there has been no resumption of India-Pakistan dialogue.
