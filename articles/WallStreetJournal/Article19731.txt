 Terror in an Envelope   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  The chemical has also made frequent appearances in the post- September 11 world. Former Iraq weapons inspector David Kay mentioned it last week in his report on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. Saddam, he said, was actively trying to weaponize ricin right up until the U.S. invasion in March. Ricin also turned up in a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was clearly experimenting with the chemical -- as it was with anthrax -- though there is no evidence that it succeeded in weaponizing either substance.  The ricin letters are also a reminder that the threat of terror remains clear and present. There's been a lot of talk lately that the failure to discover any stockpiles of WMD in Iraq proves that the terror threat isn't "imminent" and that we can return to our pre-9/11 way of countering it. Is ricin's arrival in a Senate mailroom imminent enough?
