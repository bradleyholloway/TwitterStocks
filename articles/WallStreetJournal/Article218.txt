 Owens-Illinois Sues System Software, Charging Fraud   By Dorfman, John R, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 1995  In the lawsuit, Owens-Illinois says System Software engaged in "repeated and material misrepresentations regarding the existence of software having the capabilities and functionality necessary to meet the known requirements of Owens."  After news of the Owens-Illinois lawsuit began to circulate Wednesday, System Software issued a news release saying it has filed a suit on its own against Owens-Illinois in the Law Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, for "nonpayment of license fees and certain fees for services." The suit was filed on the same day as the Owens-Illinois suit, System Software said, after negotiations proved unsuccessful. System Software "emphatically denies misrepresentation by it with respect to the contract," the news release said. A spokesman for Owens-Illinois said the company, as a matter of policy, doesn't comment on pending litigation.
