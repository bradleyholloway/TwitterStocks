 Dividing the Spoils: Taft Broadcasting Co. Faces Being Split Up Among 3 Rival Owners --- How a Raid by Robert Bass Brought Chaos to Firm, Profits to Him and Others --- The Lindner Name in Lights?   By By Constance Mitchell and George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1987  They were certain Taft's $760 million bid to acquire a dozen radio and television stations from Gulf Broadcasting Co. would help turn Taft into a top entertainment conglomerate. But instead of catapulting Taft into the big time, the Gulf purchase sent Taft's share price tumbling. That brought on an aggressive new shareholder -- Texas investor Robert Bass -- two takeover bids, and a lengthy struggle for control of the company.  Now, 2 1/2 years later, the Taft empire is about to be dismantled. On June 3, Taft's board approved a $1.4 billion acquisition of the company by a partnership made up of three former rivals -- Mr. Bass, Taft Vice Chairman Dudley S. Taft and Ohio financier Carl Lindner -- each of whom has a distinctly different idea of what the company should be.  The Bass family likes to spot undervalued companies in turmoil, buy a hefty stake and push for change. Mr. Bass won't discuss the Taft situation, and Taft's top executives refused repeated requests to comment. But interviews with associates of Mr. Bass, current and former Taft employees, and Wall Street investment bankers reveal that Taft was easy prey.
