 Brazil Stocks Drop as Debt Is Downgraded   By By Matt Moffett, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1998  Brazil's stock market tumbled 8.6% yesterday, helping to drag the rest of Latin America's bourses down with it, as Moody's Investors Service downgraded Brazil's foreign debt.  It was a grim day on markets throughout the continent: Argentina's market fell 6%; Venezuela's, 7.5%; and Chile's, 3.4%. Even Colombia, which had tried to preempt speculators by announcing what was effectively a currency devaluation on Wednesday, saw its stocks decline almost 1% on Thursday.  One catalyst for the sell-off was Moody's decision to downgrade Brazil's country ceiling for foreign-currency bonds and notes to single-B-2 from single-B-1. Moody's also downgraded Venezuela's country ceiling for foreign-currency bonds and notes to single-B-2 from single-B-1. And it warned that it was reviewing the debt ratings of Argentina and Mexico.
