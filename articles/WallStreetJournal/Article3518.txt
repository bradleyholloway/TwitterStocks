 Global AIDS Fund Deals Setback To Drug Makers in Board Choice   By By Rachel Emma Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  A divisive issue is whether the fund will buy antiretroviral medicines to treat people with HIV, the AIDS virus, and whether it will buy generic drugs. A 40-member transitional group recommended that the fund pay for medicines, including antiretrovirals, anti-TB drugs and antimalarials. Mr. [Goran Lindahl], who couldn't be reached for comment, might offer some input in this area: Anglo, based in the United Kingdom, is planning a program to pay for antiretrovirals for its South African HIV-infected workers.  Board members chosen include a representative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, representing philanthropies and seven representatives from donor countries including the U.S., Japan and the European Community. Uganda will represent Eastern and Southern Africa and Brazil will represent Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, two HIV-positive women, one from Health Rights Action Group in Uganda and one from the Academy for Educational Development in Washington, as well as a doctor with the German Institute for Medical Mission, will represent nongovernmental organizations.
