 Telecom Sector Boosts Market; SBC, AT&T and Tellabs Gain   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2002  SBC Communications, which closed Tuesday within $1 of its low for this year, climbed $1.20, or 5.2%, to $24.30. AT&T rose 50 cents, or 4.5%, to 11.70. Equipment maker Tellabs gained 42 cents, or 7.9%, to 5.76 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Shares of cable-television service operator Comcast gained 99 cents, or 4.6%, to 22.54, also on Nasdaq.  In many instances, stocks traded in ignorance, if not defiance, of adverse news. Chip maker Fairchild Semiconductor, for example, ended in the black, though just by 11 cents, or 1%, at 10.60. Fairchild had reduced its earnings guidance late Tuesday because it wasn't seeing improvement in orders in July and August. Of course, it could be argued that, with the stock coming in at a low for the year on Tuesday's close at 10.20, bad news was baked into its share price.  Intel improved 24 cents, or 1.5%, to 16.10 on Nasdaq, thanks to some end-of-day bargain hunting. During the session, though, the chip maker sank to a 52-week low, amid increasing conviction on the part of analysts that the company is going to have to steer revenue targets toward the low end of its existing range of forecasts, amid a struggling personal-computer market.
