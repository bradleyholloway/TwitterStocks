 IPO Outlook: Three Ethanol IPOs Generate Buzz; With Energy Prices Rising, Companies Seek to Cash In On Search for Alternatives   By Lynn Cowan and Patricia Kowsmann, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2006  According to industry experts, ethanol demand is being driven by many factors, including high gasoline prices, which is making consumers look for alternative fuels, and pro-ethanol campaigns from the government and car makers, which are pushing for more widespread use of a vehicle fuel called E85, a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline (currently most cars can run on 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline).  "The fast growth in the ethanol industry over the next few years is going to face many obstacles, including the difficulty in transporting it, ramping up corn production on a scale that could be demanded if ethanol is to significantly replace oil, and the difficulty in splash- blending ethanol into gasoline as a product for the consumer, " said Robert Wilder, chief executive of California-based WilderShares LLC, creator of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index of 40 publicly traded ethanol, solar-power and fuel-cell companies. "Nonetheless, ethanol still seems poised for possible strong growth ahead."
