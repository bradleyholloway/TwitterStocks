 A Fading Taft Hopes Its Past Will Buy It A Shot at a Future --- Oklahoma's Black Pioneers Raised Many Such Places; Can Tourism Save Them?   By By Elizabeth Seay, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1997  Taft could easily be taken for yet another faded farming town that never quite recovered from rural flight and the Dust Bowl but for a singular fact: It was founded by African-American pioneers and its residents are, in the main, and always have been, black. As such, Taft is one of the few surviving traces of another time, when African-Americans, spurned by the white South and spurred by the idea of self-determination, built their own self-supporting communities in the new states and territories of the Midwest.  But the surviving towns, aided by aspiring entrepreneurs like Ms. Gaines and growing interest among African-American historians and writers, now feel that time may be on their side. They have stories to tell -- of black oil moguls and big talkers trying to create an African-American state -- and, in places like Boley, 50 miles to the west, quaint historic districts to show off. Grants are helping to spruce up some of the towns, and state tourism officials are beginning to recognize their allure amid a nationwide surge in so-called heritage tourism. The towns even hope to get a boost from noted African-American author Toni Morrison, who is setting a novel, "Paradise," in the fictional black town of Ruby, Okla.  "We'll have buses coming in," says Ms. Gaines, a 44-year-old who has hooked up with a coalition of African-American Oklahomans intent on positioning the towns as a hub for black tourism. On a drive through Taft, she points to what she considers a key draw: "See? Black-owned houses."
