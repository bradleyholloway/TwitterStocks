 California May Lower Cap on Mortgage Deduction   By Carlton, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1991  In an attempt to offset a nearly $15 billion state budget deficit, the California Legislature is considering a measure to cap the home mortgage-interest deduction for state income-tax purposes at $70,000, or the annual interest on the current equivalent of about a $700,000 loan. The move would generate $60 million a year in revenue.
