 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Leisure & Arts: Fresh Contexts and Favored Formats   By Blumenfeld, Larry, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  The soft strums of guitarist Romero Lubambo, Ms. [Luciana Souza]'s frequent duet partner and countryman, support this "bossa-fication" of songs written and previously recorded by the likes of Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman and Leonard Cohen. James Taylor's "Never Die Young" seems stiff to the form's natural lilt, but most tracks work, showcasing Ms. Souza's confident yet still advancing skills. The least likely song choice, Elliot Smith's cryptic "Satellite," ends up the clearest realization of her theme. Far from the aloof trifles that often caricature bossa, Ms. Souza's vocals are direct and always informed by the drama of the lyric. She weaves a narrative about love, romantic and mystical, that reaches its climax with a cleverly syncopated version of the 1966 Beach Boys hit "God Only Knows."  This disc is dominated by savvy original pieces, especially two powerful linked tunes by Ms. [Myra Melford], and mines the work of other undervalued composers. Robin Holcomb's "Up Do" proves a showcase for Mr. [Marty Ehrlich]'s technical mastery and expressive range. Andrew Hill's "Images of Time" offers an example of the duo's ability to express balladry and bebop without convention. Throughout, glorious details abound: A note grows gnarly, then flute-like near the end of "Images of Time"; drone-like piano overtones color the start of "Night," helping to frame Mr. Ehrlich's clarinet melody. Mr. Ehrlich and Ms. Melford both play in and lead numerous groups of varying instrumentation; this pairing, documented previously on 2000's wonderful "Yet Can Spring" (Arabesque), is an important home base.
