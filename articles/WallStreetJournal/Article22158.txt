 Plan to Let Courts Enforce EU Laws Stirs an Outcry   By Murray, Shailagh, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1996  The idea has a slew of practical problems, EU lawyers, lobbyists and others point out. First, there's certain to be confusion over jurisdiction. Should lawsuits be filed in the plaintiff's or the defendant's home country? And which laws apply -- if any? That could be difficult to determine, as countries have varying methods, not to mention time lines, for adopting EU law as their own.  "But that said, if the person has no alternative they should at least be able to come to the commission," says one EU official who opposes the proposal. The prevailing argument for preserving the current, if flawed, system is that it's pointless to have EU law if EU institutions don't uphold it.  Mr. [Jacques Santer]'s office is keeping its distance from the issue. A spokesman for the commission president says, "Maybe it's on some people's minds or desks. But Mr. Santer is not aware of it. It's not part of his plans, so he has no comment yet."
