 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2006  In Washington, an IRS spokesman declined to speculate on whether any changes are coming. "The current rates remain in effect," he said. "Typically, we only make such adjustments once a year." The increases last year came "in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which involved extraordinary factors."  Starting Jan. 1 this year, the IRS's rate for use of a car, including vans, pickups or panel trucks, is 44.5 cents a mile for business miles driven. The rate is 18 cents a mile for medical or moving expenses. The statutory rate is 14 cents a mile for volunteers who used their vehicles to help charitable groups, other than for activities related to Hurricane Katrina. Congress approved special rates for Katrina-related relief.
