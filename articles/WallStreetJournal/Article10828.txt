 Texaco Attacks $10.53 Billion Judgment In Court Bid to Have Verdict Overturned   By By Matt Moffett and Thomas Petzinger Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1985  In their fiercest assault against the Nov. 19 verdict in favor of Pennzoil Co., a battery of Texaco attorneys put forth some 30 grounds for overturning or reducing the jury award in a hearing before a state judge, Solomon Casseb. One Texaco attorney, Gibson Gayle Jr., called the verdict "the most devastating specter of disaster in all of legal history."  Texaco also entered a long-shot motion to have the case certified for appeal not to a higher Texas court, but directly to the New York Court of Appeals, a maneuver that can succeed only with the approval of Judge Casseb and the Texas Supreme Court. The move to escape the Texas courts, whose sophistication and impartiality in the case have been questioned by attorneys for Texaco and by others, was based on an earlier agreement between Texaco and Pennzoil that New York contract law would be applied in the case.  Yesterday's hearing, scheduled to continue this morning, was only the first major event in an appeals process that could span several years. If Judge Casseb rules to affirm the jury's verdict, Texaco will have 30 days to appeal to him for a new trial -- a request he may take 75 days to decide. If a new trial is denied, and assuming the full $10.53 billion judgment has been upheld, Texaco must post an appeals bond of about $12 billion. The bond, which includes interest on the award, is necessary to prevent Pennzoil from exercizing its right, under Texas law, to begin seizing Texaco's assets in the state.
