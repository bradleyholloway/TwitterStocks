 Business and Finance [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1989  THE AUTO INDUSTRY SLUMP worsened during the final 10 days of June as sales of cars and light trucks plunged 19.6%. For the Big Three makers, sales skidded 22.7%. The weak performance puts increased pressure on the domestic auto industry to slow production further and sweeten costly incentive programs.  The dollar tumbled further in thin trading amid speculation that interest rates will soon ease. Bonds followed the dollar lower, but stocks edged up. The Dow Jones industrials closed 3.79 higher, at 2456.56.  A takeover bid for Time is still being mulled by a group tied to Cablevision Systems, but some traders are skeptical an offer will emerge. Cablevision, a Time shareholder, is trying to block Time's purchase of Warner.
