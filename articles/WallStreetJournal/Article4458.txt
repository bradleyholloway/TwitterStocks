 Masco Industries Inc. Agrees to Spin Off Some of Its Businesses   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1988  TAYLOR, Mich. -- Masco Industries Inc. and Masco Corp. have signed definitive agreements to spin off some of Masco Industries' manufacturing businesses into a new company, called TriMas Corp.  When Masco Industries originally announced the spinoff in July, it said it planned to place defense and tooling businesses in TriMas. Following further study, company officials decided other manufacturing businesses would be more appropriate. Masco Industries said it is spinning off operations that make drum and pail closures, high-pressure gas cylinders, specialty fasteners and precision tools.
