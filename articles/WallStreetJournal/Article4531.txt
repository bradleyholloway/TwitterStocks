 Two AIDS Vaccine Reports Stir Interest --- Approaches Taken by Salk, Repligen-Merck Group Pass Preliminary Tests   By By Marilyn Chase, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 1989  Jonas Salk, the creator of the first widely used polio vaccine, declared that his prototype vaccine using dead AIDS viruses is safe to use in previously infected human volunteers, and that it may have prompted such a strong immune response in two infected chimpanzees that it cleared all signs of the virus in the animals.  Secondly, a team of scientists led by Scott Putney of Repligen Corp. and Emilio Emini of Merck & Co. said they have located a point on the virus coat, named RP 135, that elicits antibodies that neutralize the virus. They injected a mixture of those antibodies and live virus into an uninfected chimp, and it remained free of infection.  These thrusts at the mutable and elusive AIDS virus could signal science is "piercing the armor," said Dani Bolognesi, a researcher at Duke University. He called the Repligen-Merck work "encouraging," and the Salk experiment "provocative."
