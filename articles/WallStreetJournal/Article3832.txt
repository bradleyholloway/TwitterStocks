 Executives at ITT Educational Inflated Enrollment, Suit Says   By Forelle, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 20, 2004  A spokeswoman for ITT Educational said she couldn't comment on the specifics of the latest complaint. "All the defendants intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations made in the complaint," she said, reading from a statement. "ITT ESI has a strict code of ethics, and it has numerous checks in place to ensure compliance with governing laws and regulations."  The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, claims that ITT Educational falsified enrollment figures by "counting as enrollees those students who merely expressed an interest in the school." Citing an unnamed former employee, it alleges that "nearly 70 to 80 percent" of prospects included in gross enrollment figures at the Salt Lake City campus "never attended class."
