 Look Out Below: Does a big pay gap between the top executive and the next tier feed turnover   By By Rick Jurgens, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  Clearly, the way companies distribute pay among top executives can vary a lot. The question, though, is: Does it matter? And more specifically: Does a wide pay gap between the top executive and those just below make a difference in terms of corporate performance?  The study tallied turnover among the top five executives at 460 companies for 1992 to 1997, using data from proxy statements available on Standard & Poor's Compustat database. The study, which has yet to be released, also calculated how pay was distributed among the executives within each company. Researchers then developed for each company a measure of pay equality in which a "0" shows equal pay and a "1" shows complete inequality -- one individual monopolizing all pay.  Why is this correlation worth looking at? Prof. [Matt] Bloom says the fact that turnover increases along with the pay gap raises questions about "whether it is worth it for a company to spend big dollars attracting and retaining a top CEO, especially if such efforts mean upsetting the balance of pay with other senior executives." By upsetting that balance, he says, a company can end up draining its executive talent pool and reducing the cohesion, knowledge and experience of the managerial team it relies on to make key decisions.
