 British Lion Mustn't Spit Out Nuclear Teeth   By By Stephen J. Solarz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1986  At its annual conference last month, the British Labor Party reiterated its commitment to a nuclear-free Britain. A government formed by the Labor Party -- now in opposition but given a good chance of winning the next elections -- would dismantle Britain's independent nuclear deterrent and require the removal of all U.S. nuclear weapons based in the United Kingdom.  Were Labor to implement its anti-nuclear policy, it would inevitably generate powerful political pressures in other NATO countries, Belgium and the Netherlands above all, to enact comparable bans. If one or two found it impossible to resist these pressures and adopted non-nuclear policies of their own, even a conservative government in West Germany would find it very difficult to avoid a similar step.  Labor Party spokesmen maintain that no matter how unhappy their anti-nuclear policy made the U.S., Washington could not afford to terminate its defense relationship. Yet precisely because Labor's policy could set in motion a chain reaction in other allied countries, the U.S. must make it clear that the benefits of U.S. nuclear protection are inseparable from its burdens. The U.S. could, after all, hardly insist that its other allies accept nuclear weapons if Britain did not.
