 Leaving Your Job? Think Twice Before Stuffing Retirement Money Into an IRA   By By Ellen E. Schultz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 20, 1997  In contrast, if you transfer your former employer's stock to an IRA, you won't owe any taxes until after you sell the stock and withdraw the money. But those withdrawals will be taxed at your ordinary income-tax rate, even if a good portion of the money results from long-term gains. And if you die with the stock in your IRA, your heirs won't be entitled to special tax treatment-they will owe income taxes on the full value of the account.  Transfer it to an IRA. Despite all the possibilities, the simple solution -- moving the money to an IRA -- still makes a lot of sense for many people. You may save yourself some headaches and if you don't commingle the money with IRA contributions you made yourself, you can later transfer it to a future employer's plan.  Or maybe move it to several IRAs. Let's say you need a bit of money coming in while you're setting up a consulting business or looking for a job. Split your money among several IRAs, and begin to receive a stream of payments ("substantially equal periodic payments" is the lingo) from one of them. The amount you receive each year depends on your life expectancy, your age and the amount in that particular IRA. Regardless of your age, you won't owe the 10% penalty that generally applies to IRA distributions before age 59 1/2.
