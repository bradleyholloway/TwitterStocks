 Small-Stock Focus: Luminex, National Golf Tumble As Worries Weigh on Russell 2000   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2002  NYSE-traded Stillwater Mining, a Denver mining company, tumbled 3.15, or 17%, to 15.47. The company said the SEC wants it to change the way in which it accounts for its probable ore reserves. Stillwater plans to "vigorously defend" its position on reserve methodology and will pursue all avenues of appeal. But it also said that if the SEC gets its way, that could lead to a downward revision in the company's reserves that could result in a material adjustment to 2001 earnings and to results for prior years.  E.piphany fell 99 cents, or 14%, to 6.07. The San Mateo, Calif., software company said its first-quarter loss will be wider than expected, with revenue falling short of analyst projections. The company said it revised its outlook because it won't be able to recognize revenue from a client that is re-evaluating its customer-relationship-management requirements. The client, E.piphany said, is directly related to the largest transaction in E.piphany's history. J.P. Morgan and Janney Montgomery Scott lowered their ratings on the stock.  OnTrack Data International leapt 2.29, or 24%, to 12 after the Minneapolis provider of data-recovery and electronic-discovery services agreed to be acquired by Kroll for $12.50 a share in stock, or about $140 million. Kroll said it expects the acquisition to add to its earnings immediately. Kroll, a New York security-products company, fell 50 cents, or 2.9%, to 16.60.
