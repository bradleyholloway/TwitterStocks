 Five Books to Retire By   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2004  In the past several months, the company has updated two of its offerings, "IRAs, 401(k)s and Other Retirement Plans" (Nolo, 6th edition, $34.99), and "Plan Your Estate" (Nolo, 7th edition, $44.99). No, the titles couldn't be any drier, and the covers will probably remind you of a college textbook. But few resources are as valuable when it comes to financial planning in later life.  The latter of the two books, "Plan Your Estate," is an exhaustive guide, explaining everything from simple wills to complex trusts. Particularly helpful are a series of "profiles" that illustrate how estate plans can benefit various individuals and families: a prosperous couple in their 60s and 70s; a single man in his 60s; a younger couple; a couple in their 60s in a second marriage, etc. As with Nolo's IRA book, the pages are filled with detailed examples.  Finally, you can buy -- for anyone on your holiday shopping list -- the single best book ever written about investing and building a nest egg. "Winning the Loser's Game" by Charles D. Ellis (McGraw Hill, $24.95) first appeared in 1985. Now in its fourth edition, the book remains an invaluable tool for investors of all ages. A "loser's game" is one in which people tend to defeat themselves. Think tennis, golf -- and investing. Mr. Ellis, in about 170 pages, patiently explains how individuals can "win" at investing (if not at tennis and golf) through a combination of realistic goals, sound policies, self- discipline and patience. It's not sexy -- just smart.
