 Contra Vote: Faint Hearts Ne'er Won Fair Aid   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1988  In the hubris of the Beltway, this week's House debate over Contra aid has been advertised as a titanic clash over the future of peace and freedom in Central America. Only in a city as self-absorbed as Washington could anyone really believe this. The significance of this week's vote is not how momentous it was, but how trivial. What the two parties were fighting over so fiercely -- in hours of passionate debate and arm-twisting -- came down in the end to a trifling $3.6 million in military aid.  If that seems a harsh judgment, consider that this was Congress's 20th Contra aid vote since 1981 and the issue is still a political muddle. Two weeks ago I wrote that the Reagan administration finally seemed prepared for a Contra brawl in which both sides' principles would be placed on the table. I must have been delirious.  In the event, the administration returned to its seven-year habit of paring back its aid request to "address the concerns" of every congressional faintheart. It cut back its aid package by tens of millions of dollars, filled most of what was left with bandages instead of bullets, and on the eve of the vote even offered Congress an effective veto over whether to dispense the aid. The issue is nothing less than preventing "the communization of Central America," said President Reagan, yet he offered barely enough military aid to buy bullets for a month.
