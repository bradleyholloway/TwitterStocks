 Cable Shares, Led by Cox, Plunge On Concerns About High Expenses   By By Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2002  Cox shares fell 19% to a new 52-week low after a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst published a research report yesterday noting that Cox will be spending more money on the upkeep of its customer base.  Ellen East, a spokeswoman for Cox, said the increased costs are "part of the natural evolution of the business" and said the cable concern is taking steps to offset the rise in expenses. For instance, Cox said it has rolled out self-install kits for its high-speed Internet service and upgraded its Web site to handle more customer-service questions in an effort to limit labor costs.
