 Letters to the Editor: Make that `Nuclear' New York University   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2001  Although the power output of the U.S. Navy surplus Aerojet General 201-M graphite shielded reactor was puny, it was fully capable of "going critical." For my B.S. in nuclear engineering I crawled into the base of the reactor to install U-235 fuel rods, as well as performed various experiments. But because of the shielding, the background radiation counts were lower in the reactor building than on the surrounding campus!
