 Tech Stocks Offer Relief To S&P 500   By By Peter A. McKay and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 2, 2001  There were mixed signals yesterday on when that might happen. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index visited "bear market" territory for much of the day, trading at least 20% below its record high, before swinging barely into positive ground on a round of late buying. Thus, the S&P still hasn't tumbled into a bear market by the common definition -- only an end-of-day finish below the 20% mark counts -- and hasn't been in one since 1987. But it remains awfully close.  Of course, not all analysts agree with the 20%-down threshold as the only bear-market definition. With the Nasdaq so battered and the S&P 500 holding off the bear by a mere mathematical sliver, many consider the stock market firmly in the bears' grip.  Most analysts agree that tech stocks, at least, are as battered as they can get. "The bear market we've been in so far has been very sector-specific," focusing on technology stocks with intermittent tech rallies such as yesterday's, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer for the brokerage Josephthal & Co. "We're still in a bottoming-out level for stocks, but the losses don't justify saying there's a bear market in the broader sense."
