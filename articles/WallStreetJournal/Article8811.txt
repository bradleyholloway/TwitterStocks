 Takeoffs & Landings   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1997  Airline flights to Florida, the Caribbean and the Southwest are selling out faster than usual, forcing travel agents to offer some rather desperate solutions. At North Salem Travel about 35 miles north of New York City, Rosemarie Banza has started telling clients to drive four hours to Boston, or three hours to Albany, N.Y., because flights leaving those cities are the only ones in the region with seats to Florida. Even then, nonstop flights are "out of the question," she says.  At Associated Travel, in Santa Ana, Calif., Thom Nulty uses technology to snare seats, with a software program that continuously looks for seats opening up at the last minute. In a day, the program, called Aqua, can check thousands of flights and "typically, you get cancellations, even for President's Day," Mr. Nulty says.  In Vail, Colo., town officials just unveiled a $14 million cable system with cars, or gondolas, that feature padded leather seats, cherrywood trim and luxury-car paint -- with colors ranging from Mercedes brilliant silver to Lexus sandstone beige. In Telluride, Colo., officials recruited retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf to inaugurate their new $16 million system. The 2.5-mile line, the longest of any U.S. ski resort, runs between the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village.
