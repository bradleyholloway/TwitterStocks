 For Aching Joints, Go Soak in Spa   By Inada, Miho, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2006  "The disease should be first controlled by medicine," says Yoshihiro Ishihara, who has practiced spa therapy on arthritis patients for 30 years. "Spa therapy should be used in combination with medicine and other treatments."  The institute doesn't offer scientific evidence that the spring water is effective for arthritis or other diseases. But many who go through the exercise program are "convinced that this water is better" than regular warm water, says Tara Phillips, who teaches water exercises at the institute. Of the 480 people who take water exercise classes at the institute each month, about 75% have some form of arthritis, she says.
