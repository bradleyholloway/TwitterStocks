 Burberry Cuts Down on Plaid Patterns As It Helps Push Up Sales of Parent GUS   By By Sarah Ellison, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2001  Sales at the Burberry unit jumped 85% to GBP 425 million ($601.2 million) from GBP 230 million a year earlier, which contributed to a 6.8% increase in overall GUS sales to GBP 6.04 billion ($8.54 billion) from GBP 5.66 billion a year earlier. "Burberry was the star" of our performance, Mr. [John Peace] said.  Great Universal Stores, which is expected to formally change its name to GUS PLC this summer, reaffirmed plans to float as much as 25% of Burberry in the next 12 months, but Mr. Pearce said he was in no hurry to rush Burberry to market. Analysts value all of Burberry at between GBP 1.5 billion and GBP 1.8 billion. "There is great growth potential" within Burberry, Mr. Pearce said. "If there weren't, we'd be trying to rush it out, but we have a business with a great deal left to do."
