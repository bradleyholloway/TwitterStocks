 Sears Drops Suit, Agrees to Change Ads in New York   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1989  Sears, Roebuck & Co. abandoned the legal challenge to New York City consumer-protection laws it began last June, agreeing to change advertising that regulators challenged as deceptive.  Sears also agreed to reimburse $10,000 to the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs for the cost of its investigation last year into Sears' advertising practices. A spokesman for the huge retailer doesn't admit violating any New York City laws, but he added Sears "wants to be in compliance."  Thus, Sears backed off its threat last June that if it lost its legal fight in New York, it would "virtually discontinue advertising" there, "including national publications and network broadcasts in that market." That's no small threat: Sears has the third-largest promotion budget among U.S. corporations, spending $1.17 billion a year.
