 New Jersey Casinos To Reopen Today As Budget Is Set   By Sanders, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2006  Harrah's Entertainment Inc., Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. and Boyd Gaming Corp. are all eager to reopen their gambling halls. Assuming the budget agreement was finalized last evening, as expected, the casinos were set to reopen by today. The two-day business interruption isn't expected to hurt casino operators' earnings much.  The analyst estimated the financial impact on Harrah's third-quarter earnings would likely be less than a penny a share for each day the casinos were closed. Similarly, for Boyd, it would take a three-day closure of the Borgata casino for Boyd to lose a penny a share. It would take a 10-day closure for MGM Mirage, which owns a 50% stake in Borgata, to suffer a penny a share decline, the analyst said.
