 Belgian Farmers Reel From Food Scare That Reflects Gap in EU Regulations   By By Brandon Mitchener and Konstantin Richter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  Belgian farmers like Mr. Huysman, feed sellers, wholesalers, supermarkets and consumers are reeling from a new food scare to rival Europe's "mad-cow" crisis of last year. Transport of chickens, cows and pigs is under a nationwide ban. Bakery and butcher-shop shelves are bare as tons of chickens, eggs and by-products from bouillon to biscuits are carted off for disposal.  The European Union has ordered destruction of Belgian pork, poultry, beef and egg and dairy products from suspect farms. Countries as far away as the U.S., Canada, Ghana, Russia and Japan have blocked certain Belgian imports. The U.S. is impounding shipments of chicken and pork from anywhere in the European Union.  The chicken-feed fiasco highlights a missing link in the way Europe regulates the food chain. As in the mad-cow scandal, the current problem involves contaminated animal feed. It is the latest in a steady diet of food-safety fears that have swept Europe, from campaigns against genetically modified foods to listeria contamination in unpasteurized French milk and cheese to possible ill effects of hormones and antibiotics in animal feed.
