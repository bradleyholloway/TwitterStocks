 Lockheed Corp. To Buy Sanders For $1.18 Billion --- Price Is Set at $60 a Share; Company to Get Entree Into Defense Electronics   By This article was prepared by Roy J. Harris Jr. And Eileen White in Los Angeles, Daniel Hertzberg in New York and David Stipp in Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1986  The acquisition would give Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed its long-sought major entree into the defense-electronics business, and allow Nashua, N.H.-based Sanders to evade the grasp of Loral Corp.  Lockheed's offer tops a sweetened $980 million cash and securities bid from New York-based Loral, a major electronics competitor. Some investors had expected a bidding war to develop for Sanders after it initially rebuffed Loral last month, perhaps involving a number of large defense contractors that have expressed interest in electronics acquisitions lately.  The combination of Lockheed and Sanders could be the first wave in a flood of major defense-electronics acquisitions. Boeing Co. has said it is looking to add to its electronics capability, possibly by buying a large company. General Dynamics Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. also are mentioned as interested. And since General Motors Corp.'s $5 billion purchase of Hughes Aircraft Co. last year, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have been expressing their own interest.
