 Chase Manhattan Pounded in Emerging Markets   By By Michael R. Sesit and Matt Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1997  Some people at the bank estimate that in the past week or so, Chase suffered pretax losses of $150 million to $200 million trading emerging-market debt; the exact number couldn't be determined. These people say the bank was caught holding developing-country bonds on its books that it couldn't sell and trying to unwind complex, structured derivative securities.  "It's been a very difficult week for everybody," noted a Chase trader, who said that the bank had been hoping to limit its emerging-debt trading losses to $200 million, but added that Chase "had a big (bond) holding in Brazil" and was also significantly exposed to the Russian bond market. If those two and other emerging debt markets fall steeply again, Chase could have a hard time containing losses at that level. These markets have been caught up in the contagion sweeping global financial markets from the currency and stock market turmoil engulfing Southeast Asia.  Traders close to Chase said the bank sustained its biggest losses early last week, but that its traders were able to reclaim some lost ground later in the week as some markets rebounded. Chase traders contended that market rumors that the bank had lost several hundred million dollars, especially in Russian bonds, were exaggerated.
