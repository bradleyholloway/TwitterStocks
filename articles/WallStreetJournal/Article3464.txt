 Stocks Rise on Expectations of Rate Cut   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2001  More good news could come today when the Fed meets on interest rates. Fed-fund futures suggest a cut of 0.25 percentage point is likely, taking the Fed-funds rate down to 3.5%, its lowest level since 1994, though a few investors are holding out for a cut of 0.50 percentage point.  Not this time. Investors are desperately searching for a reason to believe the worst is over for the stock market and corporate profits. Many investors are hoping for a quarter-point rate cut, with a statement by the Fed indicating that the central bank sees signs of improvement. While a half-point cut could cheer some investors, others would wonder if the Fed sees more tough times ahead. Since the Fed's six rate cuts this year have done little to revive the economy so far, a half-point cut might not do more than a quarter-point would, according to these investors.
