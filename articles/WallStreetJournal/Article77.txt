 A Reaganite Finds New Freedom Fighters   By By K.E. Grubbs Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1988  "THAY BAW BOE," Burma -- The road here was exotic enough: narrow, bumpy, sometimes muddy; thick bamboo brushing against the windshield of the Isuzu station wagon; cobras; malaria-carrying mosquitoes; smugglers hiking in the opposite direction; Buddhist monks; guerrilla soldiers. Yet we were only a few miles into this strife-torn nation, entry into which, from Thailand, was technically a violation of Burmese law.  Student insurgents in this guerrilla encampment want freedom and democracy and have found support, in an otherwise inhospitable jungle, from ethnic groups that have been fighting the Rangoon regime since the country's independence after World War II. In the eyes of Dana Rohrabacher, 41, the former White House speech writer who just gained the retiring Rep. Dan Lungren's seat, these students and tribesmen qualified for patronage under the Reagan Doctrine. They are bona fide freedom fighters.  In fact, Mr. Rohrabacher's remarks to the 800 students at Thay Baw Boe were not particularly incendiary -- but I get ahead of myself. The congressman-elect and I were invited by Greg Shade, an importer in the region who shares in our acquaintanceship of two decades. Mr. Shade wanted us to direct international attention to what he regards as one of the great human dramas of the times. (Rep. Stephen Solarz of the Asian and Pacific affairs subcommittee had preceded us in a sanctioned visit with officials and dissidents in Rangoon in September.)
