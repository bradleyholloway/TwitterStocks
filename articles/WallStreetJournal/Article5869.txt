 California's Governor Orders Regulators To Slash Electric Rates in Southern State   By By Andy Pasztor and Jason Leopold, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2000  Meanwhile, the Navy isn't waiting for state initiatives. With its San Diego power bills projected to climb to $39 million from the $20 million budgeted from June to September, Navy planners have been quietly studying the possibility of bringing in 10 of their own generators to supply electricity to San Diego bases. In addition, admirals have demanded sharp reductions in power usage, including orders to turn off all lights in many offices during peak times. "We are working by the lights of our computers," said a Navy spokesman. As SDG&E's largest San Diego customer, the Navy uses about 130 megawatts a day during high demand periods.  The governor's move also could spark fallout outside the state. California officials contend they have athority to roll back regional retail electric rates as long as such actions don't affect wholesale prices across the state, which are within the purview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. So far the FERC has maintained a generally hands-off posture, but yesterday staff members said they are investigating the state's legal standing to unilaterally cap rates. Moreover, federal regulators have privately stressed their concern that patchwork solutions by California have the potential to worsen the state's power woes unless they are coordinated to changing conditions in the wholesale market.
