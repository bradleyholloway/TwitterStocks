 Harper & Row Gets Proposal Of $34 a Share --- Friendly Bid for Publisher By Cross, Holder of 6%, Is Valued at $141 Million   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1987  Theodore Cross, the entrepreneurial Princeton, N.J., publisher, proposed to acquire the shares of Harper & Row Publishers Inc. he doesn't own for $34 each, or about $141 million.  Harper & Row is one of a handful of publicly held publishers that remain after a wave of acquisitions in the industry last year. Employees hold about 26% of the company's shares; Mr. Cross for some years has been its largest individual holder with close to 6%.  Harper & Row said in a statement that it hasn't yet had time to evaluate the proposal. In December, Harper & Row directors adopted a shareholder-rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers should an acquirer accumulate more than 20% of the company or disclose an offer to accumulate 30% or more.
