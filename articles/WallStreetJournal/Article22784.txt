 Fears of Homebound Holiday Cut Energy Prices   By By Peter A. McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2001  SUGAR: Investors wasted little time in taking profits in raw sugar futures following a sharp rally Friday that left the commodity looking "overbought," according to market observers. October futures at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade hit a two-week low of 8.57 cents a pound, before settling at 8.76 cents, down 0.6 cent on the day. The contract rose 0.44 cent Friday.  U.S. crude-oil and gasoline reserves have been growing steadily, and analysts expect that trend to continue today, when the American Petroleum Institute, of Washington, releases its weekly inventory report after the close of trading. The industry trade group's recent reports have shown U.S. gasoline inventories of more than 200 million barrels -- nearly a five-year high.
