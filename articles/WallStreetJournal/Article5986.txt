 U.S. Urges a Reluctant India to Support New Global Trade Talks   By By Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2001  India has been a leader of the developing world in trade negotiations. It was at India's insistence during the talks leading to the landmark 1993 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for example, that poorer countries were given extra time to grant full patent protection to foreign pharmaceutical products. Still, while Indian pharmaceutical executives became experts in the nuances of world trade, the larger business community sat on the sidelines. It was to the failed Seattle WTO ministerial meeting in 1999 that India first brought a formal business delegation.  There have been other problems hampering exports, Dr. [Ashok Gulati] acknowledges. India tried repeatedly this year to sell wheat to Iraq under the United Nations' oil-for-food program, but Iraqi inspectors rejected the shipments each time on quality grounds. Fiscal strains in India's state governments have raised costs for some Indian exporters: Tea companies in the east complain of steep taxes, while manufacturers complain of exorbitant power tariffs. India processes only a tiny amount of its crops into exportable juices or packaged foods, partly because of government restrictions making it hard to set up large agribusinesses.
