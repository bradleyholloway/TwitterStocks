 Barron's Insight: Adidas Is Pushing Its Game   By Williams, Christopher C, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  Adidas, the No. 2 sporting-goods maker behind Nike, served as the official sponsor of the quadrennial soccer extravaganza, which was played in its home country. Adidas covered stadiums with its ads, clothed teams in jerseys and shorts adorned with the iconic three- stripe logo and sold 15 million soccer balls. World Cup sales drove a 60% surge in second-quarter revenue and set the company on pace to generate 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) from soccer-related sales this year.  The World Cup has also helped Adidas score points with investors, who have bid up the shares more than 12% over the past month on the Frankfurt exchange, to a recent 38 euros. American investors can readily buy or trade shares through most major brokerages. Though Adidas also has American depositary receipts listed in the U.S., those trade infrequently.
