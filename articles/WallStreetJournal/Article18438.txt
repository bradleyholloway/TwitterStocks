 Health Plan Might Include Surcharge For Firms That Avoid Insurance Pools   By By Hilary Stout and Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1993  Administration officials are considering a surcharge on large companies that choose not to participate in regional insurance-purchasing pools that the Clinton health plan would establish.  Under the still-evolving Clinton health plan, most people would obtain insurance through the pools, either by contributing individually or through their employers. But administration officials are considering allowing large employers to opt out of the purchasing pools. Many big companies argue that they have become quite adept at bargaining for high-quality, low-cost health coverage, and they want to be able to continue to do so on their own.  Alternatively, the administration may require every employer, no matter how large, to participate in the purchasing pools. To make mandatory participation more palatable to large employers, administration officials said, all employers might be guaranteed that their premiums would never exceed a certain predetermined level; if the costs of covering everyone in the pool execeeded that amount, the difference would have to be made up through another revenue source, possibly the government.
