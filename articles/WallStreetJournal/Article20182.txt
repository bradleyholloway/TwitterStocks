 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2007  If Congress does nothing this year, those exemption levels will fall, throwing about 25 million people into theAMT's tangled web. That's up from only about four million AMT victims for 2006. Those people would pay, on average, an additional $2,000 apiece in federal income taxes, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says.  Clearly, Congress won't allow this to happen. Forcing 25 million people to pay the AMT for 2007 would be political suicide for just about anyone seeking re-election next year. After all, the AMT originally was designed to prevent a small number of very wealthy people from avoiding paying any federal income taxes. It wasn't supposed to affect middle-income taxpayers, but now it does.
