 Bonn Studies Company's Role In Libya Plant   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1989  FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The West German government said it is investigating the activities of a West German chemical company alleged by the U.S. to have played a key role in the construction of a chemical weapons plant in Libya.  The investigation comes as Bonn presses ahead with plans to tighten West German export laws in response to evidence last month that other West German companies illegally sold nuclear technology to Pakistan, India and South Africa. Amid growing U.S. criticism of lax West German export controls, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann is expected to submit the revisions, which include stiffer penalties for violators, for cabinet approval on Jan. 10.
