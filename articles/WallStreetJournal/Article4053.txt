 Carbide and India Will Resume Talks On Bhopal Accord   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1985  Negotiations between Union Carbide Corp. and the Indian government about a possible out-of-court settlement on compensating victims of the Bhopal poison-gas disaster are scheduled to resume here shortly, two months after they broke off.  Meanwhile, the Indian government has turned down a Union Carbide offer of $5 million in interim relief for victims of last December's accident in central India. The rejection was disclosed in an order handed down Friday by federal Judge John Keenan, who said the Indian government considered "onerous" certain reporting requirements attached to the money.
