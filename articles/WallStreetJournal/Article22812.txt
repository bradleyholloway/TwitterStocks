 Burger King Pairs With DreamWorks And Nickelodeon   By By Jennifer Ordonez, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2001  Burger King said its latest deal differs from the exclusive 10-year promotional deal McDonald's has with Walt Disney Co. because Burger King can choose to work with entertainment companies other than DreamWorks and Nickelodeon. Two recent Burger King promotions with DreamWorks, for "Chicken Run" and "Shrek," were among its most successful, the company noted.  DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said the exposure the company's movies will get at more than 8,500 U.S. Burger King restaurants "obviously works greatly to our benefit. It's huge exposure for us."  Burger King said it expects to step up its promotion schedule over the next four years and is in talks to form an alliance with a theme park, similar to McDonald's presence in Walt Disney theme parks. DreamWorks also will work with Burger King on its advertising campaigns.
