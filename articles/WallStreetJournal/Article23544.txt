 Strong October Jobs Growth Sends Another Mixed Signal on Economy   By Reddy, Sudeep, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2007  Friday's cheery employment headlines didn't dispel many economists' diagnosis that that the U.S. economy is slowing significantly, pulled down by a persistent decline in housing construction and housing prices. The volatility in financial markets continues to create unease. "It's those abysmal sectors that are going to create more financial problems, and those financial problems are going to feed back into the economy and create more weakness ahead," said Mr. [Brian Fabbri], who, like many other forecasters, expects fourth-quarter growth of between 1% and 1.5%.  The International Monetary Fund's new chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn called the jobs numbers "much more than expected," but said no recent developments in the global had changed the IMF's view that the U.S. economy would slow in 2008, but avoid recession. "There is no evident signal that it [U.S. economy] will go further than a slowdown," he told reporters.  Adecco SA, the world's largest temp-employment firm, said Friday that third-quarter world-wide revenues rose 2% while revenue in the U.S. and Canada dropped 8%. "We don't see a recession in the U.S.," Chief Executive Dieter Scheiff told investors. "And we continue to see solid growth rates in Europe and Asia."
