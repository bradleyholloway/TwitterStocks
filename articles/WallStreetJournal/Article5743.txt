 On Sports: Baseball in Slow Motion   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 1999  "Cricket" has become synonymous with scrupulous fair play, but how, then, do you account for the behavior of the Cambridge University players during their match against Oxford University at Lord's here the Sunday before last?  The fielder's gesture was a ruse, like that of a baseball fielder claiming to have caught a ball he really trapped. As I've learned from watching cricket during present and past visits to England, that sort of thing happens a lot in the sport. Was it underhanded? Uh, maybe. Was it uncricket? You'd think so, but, as I've been informed by longtime fans, it's part of the game.  Other things about cricket might surprise Americans. The forerunner of baseball is thought to be the quintessential English sport, but it's not very popular with English spectators. Lord's, the game's 30,000-seat London showcase, fills up for the occasional international test match, but attendance at the contests of the county league, England's main professional circuit, usually runs in the 1,500 to 4,000 range. Only about 150 people showed up for the match I saw between Oxford and Cambridge, the country's two leading universities.
