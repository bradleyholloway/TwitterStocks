 Relatively Small Number of Deaths Have Big Impact in Pfizer Drug Trial   By Bialik, Carl, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2006  Philip Barter, director of the Heart Research Institute in Australia and chairman of the steering committee overseeing Pfizer's torcetrapib study, told me he was contacted Friday evening by Charles Hennekens, a professor of biomedical science at Florida Atlantic University and chair of Pfizer's safety monitoring board. Dr. Barter said Mr. Hennekens shared troubling information about deaths in the trial. Dr. Barter told me he realized the "imbalance in deaths had crossed the statistical boundary" that had been set before the trial to trigger an automatic halt. Dr. Barter stopped the study Saturday. (Dr. Hennekens referred all questions about the study to Dr. Barter.)  Subjective clinical expertise comes into play in setting these thresholds before the trial starts. "If you're talking about a drug to cure cancer when there is no other treatment, you would tolerate an enormous risk before pulling the plug," Brian Strom, chairman and professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, and a veteran of several safety monitoring boards, told me. "Where you're talking about a drug to treat allergies, where there are other drugs available and they are safe, you would tolerate much less risk."  Dr. Barter agreed that "just a couple" fewer deaths could have let the study continue. "If it had been just above the boundary, I don't know what we would have done -- whether we would have waited another month or not to halt the study," Dr. Barter told me. He added, "As you know, statistics is not an exact science."
