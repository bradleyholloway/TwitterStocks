 Fed Moves to Push Down Rates; Money Supply Cited   By Wessel, David; Lipin, Steven, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1992  The FRB lowered short-term interest rates on Apr 9, 1992 as a result of concern that the money supply had narrowed for the three previous weeks. The 1/4 point reduction in the key federal funds interest rate brought the figure to 3.75%. Fed officials cautioned that the reduction will probably not be followed by further reductions anytime soon.
