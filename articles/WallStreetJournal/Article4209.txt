 Publisher Sees Passel of Possibilities In Promoting the Poor Ol' Possum   By By Alceia Swasy, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1986  The groundswell is named George Borum, editor and publisher of the Possum County News in Owensboro, Ky. A man with a mission, Mr. Borum has already had the second week in October -- this week -- declared "National Possum Week." (Well, he persuaded a calendar maker in Michigan to print those words in its calendars.) And now he is pushing for the big prize -- or at least hoping to dispel some myths about the nocturnal creature.  "Possum is a brain food," he contends. "It improves your memory because once you eat a possum, you'll never forget it." His Possum County Recipes cookbook features Possum Stroganoff (start with one pound of ground possum) as well as the more mundane baked and fried possum.
