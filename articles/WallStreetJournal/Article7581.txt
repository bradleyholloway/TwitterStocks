 Stocks Close With Modest Losses After Sharp Drops Earlier in Day   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1986  Stock prices ended yesterday's active session with just modest losses after a late buying spree transformed a 3 p.m. decline of 19.68 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a 7.45-point decline at the close.  IBM finished down 1 3/4 at 121 3/8 after trading as low as 119 1/4. Goldman Sachs took the stock off its recommended list. Traders said that poor demand at the sale of $9.26 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds accounted for the decline in bond prices.  James Baker, head of capital commitment at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, said that despite the weakness in the bond market and in so widely followed a stock as IBM, the stock market "still gave a pretty good account of itself." While stocks being traded as takeover or restructuring plays still commanded a fair amount of attention, he said, there was also buying interest in utility stocks. Other traders noted buying of paper and forest product stocks, as well as chemical issues.
