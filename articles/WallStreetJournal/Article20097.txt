 SmartMoney: Time to Take Another Look at Techs   By Barnett, Megan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  Networking software from F5 helps companies balance the loads among servers to prevent this -- no small job considering that some of its clients have 10,000 servers or more. This year F5 is expected to earn $91 million, or $1.96 a share, on revenue of $510 million.  In emerging markets, the pipes are being laid and the streets are being paved. In the U.S., our skylines are being redrawn, and landscaped office parks populate the suburbs. All of which plays to the strength of Autodesk, a maker of computer-aided design software, which is used by designers and engineers to create plans for everything from skyscrapers to espresso makers. Two distinct drivers for the company's growth are international expansion and the design industry's move from two-dimensional software to 3D design, which is in its early stages.  Nortel Networks has had a rough go of it in recent years. Accounting discrepancies forced it to restate financial results three times in three years. Criminal probes, class-action lawsuits and junk-bond ratings nearly crippled it. A year ago Nortel brought in Mike Zafirovski, Jack Welch protege, to turn the company around. Mr. Zafirovski's management style is beginning to show progress. Nortel settled its class-action suit without breaking the bank and is expected to earn a profit in 2007, after losing money in five of the past six years. Analysts expect Nortel to earn $324 million, or 68 cents a share, in 2007 on revenue of $11.9 billion.
