 Saudi Purchase of Long-Range Missiles Rekindles Debate on U.S. Arms to Arabs   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1988  Initially, the discovery that the Saudis have acquired the missiles has produced more anger than reconsideration of policies. The Reagan administration is upset that the Saudis hid their acquisition of the missiles. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, in turn, has asked the U.S. to recall its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Hume Horan, apparently in part because of the ambassador's complaints about the Chinese missile deal.  Israel's supporters in Congress are angry that the Saudis have introduced a more potent class of weapons to the Middle East tinderbox. A bipartisan group of 31 Senators last week signed a letter to the Reagan administration urging that all arms sales to Saudi Arabia be suspended until the Saudis withdraw the Chinese missiles.  But over time, the Saudi move will resurrect the argument that the U.S. should be more willing to sell arms to friendly Arab states so they don't turn elsewhere. If the U.S. supplies weapons, proponents will argue, it has some control over their level of sophistication and can use its influence to reduce the chance they will be used against Israel. As the Saudis illustrated, American influence is lost when Arab states turn to China, Britain or the Soviet Union, as several are doing.
