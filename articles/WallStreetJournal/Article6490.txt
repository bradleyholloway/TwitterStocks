 Schwab Again Has Wall Street Fans ... for Now   By Craig, Susanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  T. Rowe's Mr. [Kyle Cerminara] believes Schwab hasn't been successful in tapping this money pool and estimates the firm could add 10 cents to its earnings per share for every $10 billion it moves to its bank, known as Charles Schwab Bank. The promise of higher returns on "sweep" money has played a key role in the recent spate of industry consolidation. In June, Ameritrade's acquisition of TD Waterhouse USA included $200 million in sweep benefits, according to New York brokerage house Sandler O'Neill & Partners. E*Trade's August acquisition of Harrisdirect included roughly $103 million in sweep benefits, or 55% out of a total of $186 million in total benefits from the merger, according to Sandler.  Sandler O'Neill analyst Richard Repetto says [Chuck Schwab]'s other challenge is figuring out how to make more money from its current asset base. The firm is an industry leader in bringing in new assets, and he says that Schwab brought in about $50 billion in net new client assets in 2004. This is well ahead of Merrill, which reported net new assets of $24 billion in its global private-client division during the same period. Overall, Schwab had total client assets of $1.08 trillion in 2004 compared with $1.4 trillion in Merrill's global private-client division.  The Schwab spokesman says some products and services, like mutual funds and fee-based investment advice, require brokers to spend more time with the client and the firm is simply compensating them more for those than, say, simple stock transactions that don't require as much time. Moreover, Schwab says the push for higher fees isn't key to its strategy, since competing on cost has become so vital. Rather, Schwab is placing greater emphasis providing more investment advice and encouraging brokerage clients to bring Schwab their banking business, such as mortgages.
