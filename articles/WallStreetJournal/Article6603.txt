 SmartMoney: You Can Save $100 a Month, No Sweat   By Bradford, Stacey L, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  -- Cancel unused services. If you're not watching HBO now that "Sex in the City" is off the air, don't pay for it. Savings: $10.95 a month by ditching one premium channel, or $36 a month by downgrading to a basic plan.  -- Don't pamper your Pontiac. Unless the manufacturer specifically recommends a high-octane gasoline for your model, there's no performance advantage to filling up with anything other than regular unleaded, says Mantill Williams, a spokesman for AAA. Savings: $14 a month by filling up with regular rather than premium.  -- Don't pay for checking. In nearly every market there's at least one bank that doesn't charge its customers for a checking account, says Mr. [David Osborn]. Savings: $7 a month by ditching your fee-based checking account.
