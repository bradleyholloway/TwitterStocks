 Early European Rally, Spurred by Cuts in Rates, Fizzles as Most Markets in Region End Lower   By By Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1999  Interest-rate cuts in Britain and Denmark gave an early boost to stocks in Europe, but the rally quickly fizzled out and most European stock markets ended the day lower.  The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave short-term interest rates unchanged Wednesday helped to comfort investors. Though the announcement surfaced too late to affect European and Asian markets Wednesday, it provided support yesterday when markets reopened.  In London, the benchmark index ended virtually unchanged, while Germany's Xetra DAX index closed down 0.6%, the French CAC 40 index fell 0.5%, Italy's MIBtel index shed 0.2%, and Spain's IBEX35 index fell 0.9%.
