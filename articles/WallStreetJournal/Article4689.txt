 Talking Strategy: Collecting Overdue Bills Involves Walking Delicate Line --- `Know When to Hold, When to Fold' And Be Clear, Two Experts Advise   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1990  With the economy teetering on the edge of a recession, collecting overdue debts is crucial for any small business. But that is exactly when customers find it hardest to pay bills. What is the best way to get what's owed you? The Wall Street Journal asked two collection experts for their views: Leonard Sklar, author of "The Check is Not in the Mail" (Baroque Publishing, San Mateo, Calif.), and Paul Mignini Jr., president of the 40,000-member National Association of Credit Management, Columbia, Md.  Mr. Sklar: In addition to the usual excuses for stretching out payments, you hear excuses like, "Times are tough," "We're having a difficult time making it." You acknowledge this by saying: "I know things are tough. Let's get this settled before other bills get in the way."  Mr. Mignini: If you don't have a check on the 31st day, that's the day you begin your {telephone} collection process. When you call, you want to get a promise from the debtor to pay a certain amount at an exact time. Then you've got a commitment. So when you call a second time, you say, "You promised to pay me $100 on the 25th." The burden is on them.
