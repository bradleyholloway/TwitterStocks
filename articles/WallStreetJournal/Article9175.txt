 VeriSign Is Clicking With Its Encryption Outsourcing --- Surge in Transactions Over the Web Spurs Strong Demand for Firm's Services   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2000  The recent push by companies to buy and sell over the Internet is driving unprecedented demand for sophisticated encryption products that encode e-mail, purchase processing and sensitive information on Web sites. And as businesses open their computer networks to customers and suppliers, many are buying more than just encoding software: They are turning over their entire encryption operations to outside companies.  The rise of encryption outsourcing has been a big boom for the main encryption vendors, which are offering everything from security consulting to services that tag computers with digital identifiers. VeriSign Inc., the pioneer of the outsourcing model, has seen its stock price more than quadruple in the past six months, and now boasts a stock market valuation of about $29 billion. Two other companies that have recently entered the services fray now have market caps above $5 billion.  VeriSign operates a highly secure computer "bunker" at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. When a company signs up for the service, the company dispatches digital certificates to the customers' computers. The certificates, small pieces of software, contain information about the client company or individual to which the computer belongs. In this way, a business that communicates with suppliers over the Internet can access the suppliers' certificates to verify the suppliers' identities before processing an order.
