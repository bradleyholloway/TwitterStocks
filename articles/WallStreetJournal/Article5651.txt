 Home Office: The Call of the Fridge --- Pudding, Pound Cake, Calories Are Home Office Pitfalls; `Tapioca Talks to Me'   By By Lauren Lipton, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1998  But he has no willpower at all when it comes to tapioca pudding. "I hear it calling all the time," says Dr. (David) Kohn, 54 years old, who, among other things, is chairman of Charles Booth Professional Haircare. "I have my office just off the kitchen, and the food talks to me. It says, `Dave, I'm luscious.'" After two years of working from home, Dr. Kohn discovered he had put on 15 pounds.  Having a home office has its perks, but often weight loss isn't one of them. While going to the office has its own temptations -- bagels at business meetings, gummy bears on co-workers' desks -- working from home, even just for a day or weekend, is no piece of cake.  Or maybe it's too many pieces of cake. Anybody with a home office can empathize with a 1996 survey of home-business owners by Income Opportunities magazine. The survey found that 36% reported eating and drinking more since working from home. Almost one-quarter admitted to using eating and drinking as an excuse to take a break. And -- surprise -- one-third reported gaining weight.
