 Tax report: Hopes grow   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1996  Bipartisan support is building for proposals to eliminate capital-gains taxes for most people who sell their homes. This would replace an existing law allowing homeowners to postpone taxes on profit from selling their main home if they buy and live in a new one within two years of the sale date and if the new home costs as least as much as the old one. It would also replace a provision allowing people age 55 or over to exclude up to $125,000 in gains, once in a lifetime.
