 Chief Overseer of Fannie, Freddie Will Step Down   By James R. Hagerty and Dawn Kopecki, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  Mr. [Armando Falcon Jr.], 44 years old, said that his resignation as director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, will be effective May 20, barring "extraordinary circumstances." He said he intends to "explore new career options." Mr. Falcon couldn't be reached for further comment.  Two years ago, the Bush administration planned to replace Mr. Falcon, but a nominee to succeed him ran into opposition in Congress, and the administration decided to retain Mr. Falcon. In 2003, some in Congress criticized Mr. Falcon for having failed to anticipate an accounting scandal at Freddie Mac. Mr. Falcon then launched an investigation of Fannie's books, found accounting violations and forced the ouster of that company's chief executive officer last December. Ofheo also has forced Fannie to hold more capital and overhaul its risk controls and executive compensation.
