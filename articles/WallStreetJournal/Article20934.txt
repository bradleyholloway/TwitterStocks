 West German Politician, in U.S., To Signal Opposition's New Tack   By By Thomas F. O'Boyle, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1986  BONN, West Germany -- Johannes Rau, opposition candidate for chancellor in West Germany's 1987 national elections, is the son of a preacher -- "Brother Johannes," his colleagues call him. Mr. Rau has a little sermon to deliver when he arrives in Washington this week.  Mr. Rau has some persuading to do in Washington. Since his party was ousted from power in 1982, it has opposed the deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles in Western Europe and the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly called "Star Wars." Many people in Washington as well as around Europe therefore consider Mr. Rau's party limp on defense and lukewarm on the Western alliance.  Mr. Rau has an uphill battle in his effort to unseat West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. His speeches lately, attempting to woo moderate voters, have veered from his party's line, voicing support for the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance and stressing Germany's historical ties to the U.S.
