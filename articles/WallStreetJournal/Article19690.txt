 Tyco's 'Special Bonus' on Trial; Credits Added to Loan Accounts Are Seen as Strong Ammunition In Prosecution of Top Executives   By Maremont, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2003  In August 1999, prosecutors say Mr. [Mark H. Swartz], then Tyco's chief financial officer, quietly ordered a subordinate to add credits totaling $38.5 million to the employee-loan accounts of three people: himself, Mr. [L. Dennis Kozlowski], and Barbara Jacques, a Tyco events planner. The credits amounted to a huge forgiveness of loans, which Mr. Swartz allegedly told the subordinate stemmed from a "special bonus" approved by Tyco's board to reward the three for relocating to New York from New Hampshire.  For many of the charges in the case, the defense is expected to argue that money received by the two men was authorized by the company. In pretrial hearings, defense lawyers suggested that another of the main pillars of their case will rest on knowledge of such now- disputed transactions by Tyco's outside auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. "Embezzlement can't succeed without stealth, without concealment," one of Mr. Kozlowski's attorneys said in a pretrial hearing. During pretrial skirmishing, prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to exclude the auditors from giving evidence, indicating they feel their case may be somewhat vulnerable on this score.  A person familiar with Mr. Swartz's defense strategy said the $38.5 million was disclosed in the company's books, and the auditors either knew about it or should have. This person added that Mr. Swartz didn't have anything to do with the decision to forgive the loans, and promptly repaid his $12.5 million portion when Tyco lawyers told him last year that the forgiveness had never been approved by the board. As for the failure to include the sum on Mr. Swartz's W-2, this person said that it was an oversight.
