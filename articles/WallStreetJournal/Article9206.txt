 Food Investors Are Hungering For More Deals   By By Cathleen Egan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2000  Next in line: Nabisco Holdings Corp. Already on the block, Nabisco likely will be gobbled up by one of the many suitors that have made the auction process quite active. Financier Carl Icahn is the only one who has publicly put his hat in the ring, but R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Corp., Winson-Salem, N.C., Philip Morris Cos., New York, France's Danone SA and as many as nine others also are said to be eying the Parsippany, N.J., snack maker.  Waiting in the wings are companies such as Hain Celestial Group Inc., Uniondale, N.Y., which has an attractive health-food and oils business, and Campbell Soup Co., Camden, N.J., which basically hung a "for sale" sign on its door when it brought back former Chairman and Chief Executive David W. Johnson, in the opinion of many observers. Campbell also was considered an acquisition target of Bestfoods before Bestfoods finally accepted a $73-a-share takeover offer from Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch conglomerate.
