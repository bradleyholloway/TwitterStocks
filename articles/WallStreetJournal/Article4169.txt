 Jazz: A Big Band in Full Cry   By By Nat Hentoff, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1986  New York -- Although jazz is largely an improvisatory music, a considerable body of exhilarating jazz writing for orchestra has developed over the decades. There have been such flavorfully distinctive orchestral composers as Duke Ellington and Don Redman. And ingenious, witty, and boldly influential arrangements played an integral part in the success of the ranking orchestras since the 1920s: Fletcher Henderson, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, et al.  From time to time in recent years, attempts have been made to establish a jazz repertory orchestra that would bring the classic scores back to life. Symphony orchestras, after all, are conservators of a heritage; why should the past glories of jazz be available only on disembodied discs? But none of the previous ventures at creating a permanent jazz concert orchestra has succeeded. The terminal problem each time has been money.  Yet, the yearning to build a standing jazz orchestra persists, and the newest attempt may actually work. Its paladin is Gary Giddins, the jazz critic and historian, and helping him to realize his obsession have been Bill Lacy, president of New York City's Cooper Union, and Roberta Swann, director of the Great Hall at that college. The Great Hall, where Abraham Lincoln announced his bid for the presidency, is now the home of The American Jazz Orchestra, making this the first jazz repertory undertaking with an institutional base.
