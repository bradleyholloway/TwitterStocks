 Schumer and Graham Play a Risky Game of Chinese Tariffs   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2006  It is clear that Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Lindsey O. Graham do not understand the rules that they accuse the Chinese of breaking. In their Sept. 25 editorial-page commentary "Play by the Rules," they refer to America's exploding trade deficit. This is only one component of the trade relationship between China and the U.S. They conveniently choose to ignore the benefits Americans enjoy from another component, the financial account surplus, courtesy of the Chinese. By purchasing our debt, the Chinese have kept interest rates low, allowing our citizens and government to borrow at extremely low levels.  Sens. Schumer and Graham say that free trade is important, but it isn't "easy." Yes it is. Free trade simply means no tariffs and no non-tariff barriers to trade. It doesn't include having legislatures vote on raising tariffs on imports because politicians in one country think another country's currency is undervalued, as the senators propose to do in the case of China. Tariffs are protectionism, not free trade, no matter how many times their sponsors claim otherwise.
