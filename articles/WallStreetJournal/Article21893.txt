 The Chamber almost caves   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1994  An editorial comments on the position of the Business Roundtable and the US Chamber of Commerce on the Clinton health plan. Noting that the Business Roundtable voted 60 to 20 to reject the Clinton plan and Robert Patricelli, who chairs the Chamber's health care committee, stated that "we believe it cannot even be used as a starting point for committee markup," the editorial says it sounds as if, after some confusion, the Roundtable and the Chamber have the same position.
