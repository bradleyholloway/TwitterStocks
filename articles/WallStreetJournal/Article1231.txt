 Earnings Digest -- Financial Services: H&R Block Loss Widens on Mortgage Costs   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2007  In a bid to pare its mortgage exposure, H&R Block said it reduced more than $3 billion in mortgage loans to $113 million through sales and write-downs. It said it still had $86 million in reserves for potential losses from buying back underperforming loans.  H&R Block tried to sell Option One to Cerberus Capital Management earlier this year, but the private-equity firm pulled out of the deal last week. H&R Block is now shutting down the unit.  Mr. [Richard C. Breeden], who was subsequently named to succeed Mr. [Mark Ernst] as chairman, wants the company to focus on the company's core tax business and get out of securities brokerage, banking and lending, saying they have robbed H&R Block of momentum.
