 Technology Journal / Health: Immunex Says Test Shows Drug Aids Multiple Sclerosis   By By Ralph T. King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1998  Immunex Corp. said its chemotherapy drug, Novantrone, provided a significant benefit to multiple-sclerosis patients based on preliminary analysis of a late-stage clinical trial in Europe.  The results, to be reported at a scientific meeting today in Stockholm, indicate that Novantrone decreased the incidence of attacks and slowed disease progression in many of the 194 patients in the two-year study.  Multiple sclerosis is a crippling immune-system disease. Several treatments have become available in recent years, notably Biogen Inc.'s Avonex and Chiron Corp.'s Betaseron, but those drugs haven't dramatically altered the course of the affliction, which can lead to complete paralysis and early death. Those drugs also require daily or weekly injections. Novantrone is administered intravenously once every three months.
