 Starting Out: Protecting Your Credit   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 2007  The report can be a sobering document if you have a woeful payment history or carry a heavy debt load. Suzanne Hildebrand, a 25-year-old administrator at a nonprofit in Fresno, Calif., was "not so happily surprised" when she pulled her husband's credit report three months after the wedding. He had a history of late payments and some accounts that were sent to collections.  One reason: New credit counts for 10% of a FICO score. People hungry to borrow tend to be bad risks, so Fair Isaac is watching for how many new accounts you have and how many recent requests for credit you've made. A request for credit stays on the report for two years, and counts as part of the FICO score for 12 months.  Fair Isaac offers a free booklet called "Understanding Your FICO Score" at MyFico.com. Another helpful guide is "What You Should Know About Credit History," available on HSBC North America Holdings' YourMoneyCounts.com site.
