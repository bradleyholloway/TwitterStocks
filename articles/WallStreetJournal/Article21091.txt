 A Young German Pilot's Lark in Moscow Creates Political Dilemma for Gorbachev   By By Mark D'Anastasio, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1987  Ordinary Russians are reacting with anger and humiliation to the failure of Soviet air defenses to stop a single-engine plane piloted by a 19-year-old West German, Mathias Rust, that crossed the Soviet border and buzzed the Kremlin before landing in Red Square.  "At first, people simply didn't believe it," says Valery Soifer, a top Soviet geneticist whose application to emigrate to Israel has made him a nonperson. "Then it hit, and the reaction was typically xenophobic. They want blood."  As state prosecutors and the KGB security police probe the youth's motivation for risking his life to hedgehop 500 miles over Soviet territory to land his single-engine Cessna at the Kremlin wall, the popular reaction to Mr. Rust's escapade presents a dilemma for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
