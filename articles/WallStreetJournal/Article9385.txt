 details: Decking the Halls In Red, White & Blue   By By Jeff Zaslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2001  The holiday spirit has new meaning this year, as homeowners across the country add red and blue to their white Christmases. Despite the bad economy, sales of ornaments, lights and decorations -- a $1.9 billion market in 2000 -- are expected to rise as much as 15% this year, fueled by patriotic holiday decor, according to Unity Marketing, a research firm. For retailers, it's an unprecedented market niche. "Last year, most retailers sold zero dollars in patriotic Christmas decorations," says a National Retail Federation spokeswoman.
