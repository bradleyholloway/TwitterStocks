 EU Plan for Airport Slots Vexes Carriers   By By Paulo Prada, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  The proposal is the first of a two-part initiative to revamp the system that governs takeoff and landing slots at the most congested airports in the European Union. The aim, in addition to addressing the delays that plague air travel in Europe, is to clarify what the commission says is a murky framework that allows the abuse of rights to those slots.  Carriers, accustomed to the flexibility afforded by slot swapping, say prohibition to do so would hinder their ability to respond to supply and demand. Moreover, airlines say, they feel blindsided by a proposal that initially was expected to merely suggest technical changes to the existing slot framework.
