 Television: Unliberating Memories   By By Martha Bayles, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1989  Against a pulsating geometric background, a cartoon dove perches on a guitar. Both shapes swirl with psychedelic hues to the snarl of electronic feedback. The graphic is by Peter Max, the music is by Jimi Hendrix, and the purpose is to introduce a "Woodstock Minute" on MTV. Consisting of clips from the Warner Bros. movie "Woodstock" (airing on both MTV and its sister channel, VH-1, Aug. 6-17) and of micro-interviews with some of the performers, these snippets have been airing since May.  Apparently, their purpose is educational, like the "We the People" snippets CBS aired during the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. It's too late -- and too painful -- to contemplate what CBS did to the Constitution. But it's not too late to contemplate the wisdom of entrusting the troubled, complex history of the 1960s to a cable network that sent out a press release saying, "It was the summer of '69. Lyndon Johnson was in the White House."  Most of us can remember that Richard Nixon was in the White House during the summer of '69 -- the same year that U.S. troops in Vietnam peaked at 550,000, a figure not far off the 500,000 who gathered on that hillside in Bethel, N.Y., for the mid-August Woodstock Music and Art Fair: An Aquarian Exposition. We can also place Woodstock on a descending curve of countercultural "be-ins," from the blissed-out Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 to the bottomed-out Rolling Stones concert in Altamont in December 1969.
