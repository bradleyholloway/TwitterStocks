 Olympia & York To Sell Assets To Raise Cash --- Developer, Facing Obstacles In Revamp, Is Expected To Sell Stake in Railway   By By Larry M. Greenberg and Neil Barsky Staff Reporters for The Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1992  One likely asset sale is believed to be O&Y's 18% stake in Santa Fe Pacific Corp., a Chicago rail concern. Such a sale could generate about $426 million for the company. O&Y's stake, purchased in 1987, is believed to be encumbered in part by a $275 million bank loan.  The company had hoped to stave off bankruptcy filings through short-term loans from its major banks. The banks have so far been unwilling to lend O&Y more than is necessary to keep its operations from grinding to a halt. Over the long term, the company is believed to need as much as $800 million to fund its operations and complete its massive Canary Wharf project in London.  O&Y also said it missed making an interest payment of about 17 million Canadian dollars (US$14.2 million) that was due yesterday. The payment was to be made to holders of two series of bonds, secured by its First Canadian Place office tower in Toronto, which have a face value of C$325 million.
