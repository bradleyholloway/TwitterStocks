 Business Brief -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc.: Alcatel Subsidiary Is Sued On Claim of Contract Breach   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2001  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it sued Alcatel Business Systems for allegedly failing to buy flash-memory chips under terms of a January 2000 contract. The Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of semiconductors, said it entered a long-term pact to supply the subsidiary of France's Alcatel SA with flash-memory chips. AMD said Alcatel Business Systems has since opted to buy the product on the open market at a lower price rather than honor the agreement.
