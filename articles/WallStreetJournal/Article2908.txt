 Newbridge Agrees To the Purchase Of UB Networks   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 1996  Newbridge Networks Corp. agreed to buy UB Networks, a unit of Tandem Computers Inc., in a bid to boost its penetration of the corporate market for internal computer networks.  Newbridge, a manufacturer of communications systems based in Kanata, Ontario, agreed to pay at least $100 million for UB Networks, but the price could reach $150 million, depending on UB Networks' future performance.  Newbridge executives said UB Networks will bring to their company complementary technology and a 650-strong sales force. The acquisition makes an "excellent" fit, said Eric Hindin, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting concern.
