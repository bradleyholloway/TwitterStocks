 The Democratic Tribe   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1998  This morning Rep. Dan Burton's House committee begins several days of hearings on Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and the nexus between contributions to the Democratic Party and Indian policy. The Babbitt tale is noteworthy because it resonates on a number of levels.  There is first of all the issue of whether the Interior Secretary's case merits the appointment of an independent counsel. The relevant question might be put this way: Are there any conceivable circumstances under which Janet Reno would call for an independent counsel to investigate any member of the Clinton Administration? If she passes on the Babbitt case, the answer would have to be no, that there will be no more ICs for any reason for any conceivable covered person over the next three years.  The essential details of the Babbitt case are fairly straightforward -- almost a he-said/he-said dispute between Mr. Babbitt and a lobbying Democratic lawyer -- but the fact remains that enough public detail has emerged that someone has to resolve whether federal law was violated. Mr. Babbitt is a member of the President's Cabinet, heretofore a "covered person" under most anyone's interpretation of the Independent Counsel statute.
