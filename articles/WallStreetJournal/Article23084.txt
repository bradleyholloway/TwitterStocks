 Fannie's Watchdog   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 2004  If Ofheo really wants to make a difference, then its focus should be on Fannie, which is dangerously undercapitalized and is less capable of managing its risk. That's clear enough if you inspect the "fair-value accounting" disclosure in Fannie's own books. By that accounting, Fannie has lost so much capital in the past three years that its capital is now below Ofheo's required minimum.  Why the big difference between Fannie's fair-value and core capital? Because Fannie takes enormous interest-rate risk that it hedges with cash-flow derivatives. Fair-value accounting requires companies to show losses (and gains) in these derivatives, but under the core capital measure they are essentially excluded. In other words, when Fannie's losses are factored into its balance sheet under fair-value, it is vastly undercapitalized.  They have a point, but only as long as Fannie doesn't have to close out its derivative positions before they expire. In fact, Fannie does close out derivative positions as part of a monthly rebalancing of its portfolio to keep its duration gap small. (That's the difference between cash flows on assets and liabilities.) And by closing those positions, Fannie has essentially locked in its losses. Those losses are not -- to use the term of art -- recoverable. Students of Fannie Mae's business estimate that a substantial part of the $11 billion gap between its core capital and its fair-value capital has been locked in. That doesn't bode well for its earnings or regular balance sheet down the road.
