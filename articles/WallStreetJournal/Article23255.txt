 Americas: Aristide's Past Deserves More Intense Scrutiny   By O'Grady, Mary Anastasia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2005  Haiti's pro-[Jean Bertrand Aristide] gangs are still on the prowl. Last year they launched "Operation Baghdad" with Iraqi chaos as the template for terror. U.N. peacekeepers and Haitians have since managed to pacify much of the country, but killing and kidnapping persist in certain neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince. Close observers say that the thugs hope that by spreading fear and misery they can persuade Haitians to call home the authoritarian Aristide.  As I reported here in October 2004, Mr. [Michael Jewett] alleges that in September 2003 his boss, IDT's Executive Vice President for International Business Development Jack Lerer, explained to him what had been negotiated with Mr. Aristide. "IDT Telecom would deposit the settlement dollars from terminating traffic in Haiti through Teleco Haiti to an offshore account set up on behalf of President Aristide by Mount Salem, [a holding company] headquartered in the Turks and Caicos Islands," the amended complaint says. Mr. Jewett also claims that he was instructed to "keep the terms of the transaction confidential."  If Mr. Aristide did make a deal with IDT it would not be the first time he has involved himself directly with Teleco. President George H. W. Bush released frozen Haitian assets held in the U.S. to him in the early 1990s, after he had been exiled by a military coup. The big income earner for Haiti was the long distance telephone revenues. Christopher Caldwell reported in the American Spectator in 1994 that Mr. Aristide "raised hackles at the Latin America division of AT&T by ordering the proceeds from Haiti's international phone traffic moved to a numbered Panamanian account."
