 Yahoo Gains 10%, H-P Jumps, Propelling Key Indexes Higher   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2003  The session "was a weird one," said Andrew Baker, senior vice president of equities trading at Wedbush Morgan. "This may have been the market trading on emotion with people saying, 'This is a good place to sell,' and it snowballing."  AMR, parent of American Airlines, jumped 1.50, or 11%, to 14.85 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the airline to "equal weight" from "underweight," saying the carrier's prospects are "not as grim" as they had been. The gain helped the Dow Jones Transportation Average post a new 52-week high with a gain of 59.11 points, or 2.1%, to 2850.73.  InterActiveCorp rose 1.30, or 3.6%, to 37.71 on Nasdaq. The company faces a potential windfall from efforts by General Electric and Vivendi Universal to buy its stake in Vivendi's assets. Vivendi and GE are working on a merger of their film and television businesses.
