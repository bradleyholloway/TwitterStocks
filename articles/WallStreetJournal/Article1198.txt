 OPEC Seeks Soft Landing for Oil; With Crude Hitting $78.23, Cartel Pursues Market Calm And Role of White Knight   By Peter Fritsch and Oliver Klaus, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2007  The U.S. and other nations have lobbied for months for more OPEC oil. OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla Salem El-Badri said the group's move to add roughly 500,000 barrels a day to existing OPEC output on Nov. 1 -- the group's first official production increase in more than two years -- was taken with the end user in mind. "Our message to the consumer is that we care and we are concerned, and that is why we increased production," he said.  It appeared that important OPEC producer Saudi Arabia -- the U.S.'s closest ally in the Arab world, and the cartel's unofficial leader -- managed to sway reluctant fellow members to adopt the increase. Most OPEC members had said before the meeting that an increase wasn't necessary, given the uncertainty about the demand picture because of potential fallout from the subprime-mortgage market's troubles.  On paper, OPEC's move increases its output ceiling by 1.4 million barrels of oil a day, to 27.2 million. But the true amount added to world markets will be less than that -- totaling roughly 500,000 barrels a day by some estimates -- because OPEC's production already surpasses its own output ceiling. In July the 10 nations pumped an estimated 26.6 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency.
