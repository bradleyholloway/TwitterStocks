 Whew! Nasdaq Rises in Day of Relative Calm   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2000  After two frightening days for stocks, the market calmed down yesterday, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 20.33 points, or 0.49%, to 4169.22. But the small change masked a certain amount of volatility, with the index up at one stage 137.99 points and at another down 139.80. Some investors said the Nasdaq technology stocks were poised to resume their climb, and those people were buying. Others were warning that more bad days still could be in store, and they were selling. Whoever is right, at least the market didn't have to deal with another stock free fall like the drop at one juncture around midday Tuesday that had the Nasdaq off 574 points -- a harrowing moment despite the afternoon recovery that restored most of the losses.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose Old Economy stocks have been in demand in recent days, yesterday gave back 130.92 points, or 1.17%, to 11033.92. It showed late-day weakness as worries spread that March payroll numbers, due out tomorrow, could indicate a still-hot economy. That would rekindle worries about Federal Reserve interest-rate increases. But traders said at least the worries are focused again on specific issues, and not on the broad fear of a market meltdown.  Yesterday's modest gains on Nasdaq retraced only a bit of the ground the Nasdaq composite had lost in its 423.94-point, or 9.27%, drop in the week's first two days. The Nasdaq still is down more than 17% from its March 10 record and is at the level it traded in early February. But it is up 2.5% since the year began, on top of its nearly 86% gain last year. The Dow, by contrast, remains down 4% since the year began.
