 Safeway to Pursue Dominick's Sale; Labor Deal Is Set   By By Patricia Callahan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  Safeway's disclosures of the outsize labor costs at Dominick's and strife during contract talks are likely to come back to haunt the company as it seeks a buyer for all or part of the chain, which is the No. 2 grocer in the Chicago metropolitan area. Safeway said Dominick's costs for wages and benefits average $3 an hour more than those of its chief rival, Jewel Food Stores, a unit of Albertson's Inc.  Safeway, which inherited union contracts when it bought the chain, alienated some employees. "They acknowledged they imposed a way of doing things -- a more efficient way, but they shoved it on people and said, `Do this,' " said Lehman Brothers analyst Meredith Adler in New York. Any buyer will have to address the problems, but she said, "You can rally the troops and say, `We're not Safeway.' "
