 Germany Defies World-Wide Auto Slump   By Roth, Terence; Simison, Robert L, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1991  The car market in Germany is booming, with many dealers buying foreign brands to fill the demand. Car sales in Germany took off in 1990, rising 7.4% while sales in the rest of Europe fell 4.1%. In 1991, registrations in western Germany are up 25%. The boom is due to economic expansion and a car-buying frenzy by former East Germans.
