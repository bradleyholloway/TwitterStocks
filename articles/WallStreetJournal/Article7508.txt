 Union Carbide's Silence on Plan to Sell Units Is Worrying Profit-Hungry Holders of Rights   By By Karen Slater, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1986  It's been a month since Carbide gave each shareholder a right, proportional to the holder's stake in the company, to part of the proceeds from the planned sale of the company's consumer products units. And many holders thought they would have heard who the buyer or buyers will be by now.  "This is a classic case of no news is bad news," says Paul T. Leming, chemical industry analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co. "Every day that goes by without any news, fear eats away at your stomach."  Carbide announced the sale of its consumer units in January and distributed the unusual dividend rights March 3 as part of its successful bid to repel a takeover by GAF Corp. The final bids were reportedly submitted at the end of March, leading analysts to hope for an announcement within the next few weeks.
