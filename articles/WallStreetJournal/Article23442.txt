 Real-Estate Finance: In European Real-Estate Market, Which Spots Are Hot, Which Not   By Sara Seddon Kilbinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2007  Not so hot: "Central European offices are getting overheated as they're overbuilding good quality offices and vacancy rates are rising as a result. Vacancy rates are around 11% today in Prague. I would therefore be more comfortable going into secondary cities such as Manchester and Birmingham in the U.K. than into Prague and Budapest because yields there are only one-half to one percentage point higher than in smaller cities in Western Europe."  Top picks: "There are three countries that we find particularly interesting at the moment: the U.K., Germany and Italy because of the introduction of real-estate investment trusts there this year. This is likely to have a positive impact on these countries and we may invest in REITs there or create REITs of our own. We invested around $2 billion in these countries last year and hope to invest more this year. Last month, we acquired a 25% stake in the Garanti REIT, which is listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, for around 25 million euros. Together with Dogus Holding AS, we own a 50.98% stake. We also intend to invest further in Turkey this year and will consider all property asset classes.
