 Be Careful What You Wish For   By Taranto, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  Harry Reid, the new Senate Democratic leader, is moderate to pro- life on abortion. In 1999 he was one of only two Senate Democrats to vote against an amendment expressing "the sense of Congress in support of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade." But when he appeared on "Meet the Press" Sunday and Tim Russert gave him a chance to take a clear position against Roe, Mr. Reid demurred, saying that "it would be pretty difficult for everybody" if the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 ruling.
