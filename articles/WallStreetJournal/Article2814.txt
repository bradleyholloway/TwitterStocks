 A federalist solution to racial conflicts   By Francis, Samuel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1996  Samuel Francis responds to a Feb 22, 1996 Politics & Policy article on Pat Buchanan's political views. Francis says the article, stating that he had "called for 'a white reconquest of the United States' in the conservative magazine Chronicles" is in error as to the location of the statement, which it takes out of context.
