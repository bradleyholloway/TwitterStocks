 Pepsi Bottling's Net Jump 20%   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  Banc of America Securities analyst Bryan Spillane said it was no surprise shares traded lower when the market opened. However, the sell-off accelerated later in the day because the company's conference call suggested Pepsi Bottling wouldn't be able to implement significant price rises in supermarkets until after Labor Day. During the second quarter, Pepsi Bottling said it experienced increased price competition from Coca-Cola Co.
