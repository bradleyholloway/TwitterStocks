 Investigators Are Scanning 3 Continents To Find InverWorld's Missing Funds   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1999  At a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing here, Robin Phelan, an attorney for InverWorld, said using the securities as collateral was "customary and appropriate" under the agreements InverWorld's investors signed. But investors' attorney's disagreed. "It's a breach of fiduciary duty, if not outright fraud," said Gerald Drought, one investor's attorney.  Neither investors nor PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm hired to liquidate InverWorld affiliates IWG Services Ltd. and I.G. Services Ltd., know what is left of the collateral. Wealthy Latin American investors, many from northern Mexico, say they thought they were buying U.S. Treasury bills and blue-chip stocks when they invested with InverWorld.
