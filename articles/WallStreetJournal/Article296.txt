 Deere Posts Smaller-Than-Expected Loss As Weak Commodity Prices Hurt Sales   By By James P. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 1999  Deere & Co. reported a smaller-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter loss, ending a year in which the agricultural-equipment maker's sales remained under heavy pressure as a result of a continuing recession in the U.S. farm economy.  For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Deere, of Moline, Ill., had a net loss of $29.5 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with net income in the year-earlier period of $162.1 million, or 71 cents a share. Revenue fell 13% to $2.79 billion, from $3.21 billion.  Deere would have had a slight profit but for a $40 million charge it took to cover costs of an early-retirement program. The program is only the latest in a series of production cutbacks and belt-tightening moves it began implementing last year in response to a softening market.
