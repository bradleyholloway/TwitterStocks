 America Online's Fancy Accounting Methods Once Again Are Raising Red Flags for Some   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1998  The Internet-service provider has assured analysts that it has its auditors' blessing for a controversial, seldom-used sale-leaseback transaction that accompanied a $430 million asset swap in January. America Online also has persuaded Wall Street to accept an unusual rationale for treating some capital gains from stock sales as regular earnings.  For some, however, the issue rings alarm bells. In 1996, America Online had to write off $385 million of deferred marketing costs, erasing many quarters of past profits. In 1997's fourth quarter, after AOL adopted what it called gold-standard accounting policies, the Securities and Exchange Commission forced it to make $32 million of accounting adjustments.  At issue is how America Online should account for the sale of its ANS Communications network-services unit to WorldCom in January. Essentially, America Online swapped ANS for CompuServe's on-line division, which it valued at around $280 million, plus nearly $150 million in cash. It also contracted to use ANS's services for another five years.
