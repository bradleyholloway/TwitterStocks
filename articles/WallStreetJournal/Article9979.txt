 Expedia, Citigroup Collaborate on Rewards Program   By Ron Lieber and Jessica Vascellaro, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2006  If you are a regular Travelocity or Orbitz customer, you would need to commit to spending lots of money on one site to make it worthwhile to switch to Expedia. Say you spend $2,500 per year on travel and move it all to Expedia. That could be worth 2,500 ThankYou points, enough for about $25 in rewards via Citi's program. If you aren't earning anything on the other sites you currently use and won't miss special features they offer, then the extra incentive may be worth it. If you spend less than that each year on travel and don't have any other way of earning ThankYou points, the rewards won't add up to much.  Members don't have to use a Citi credit card to earn ThankYou points from Expedia's new loyalty program when charging travel on the site. But Citi is clearly hoping that its cardholders will think it is a good idea to do so, since they will be able to double dip -- earning points both from Expedia (one point per dollar of travel purchase in most cases) and Citi (for using the credit or debit card to pay for it) for the same purchase.
