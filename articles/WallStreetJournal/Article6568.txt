 MarketWatch Weekend Investor: Insider Stock Sales During Buybacks Doesn't Feel Right   By Greenberg, Herb, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2006  Audit Integrity, a Los Angeles research firm, did just that, and didn't particularly like what it found. "Buying stock with one hand while selling it with the other," the report says, "presents a clear conflict of interest."  That's just what I did several weeks ago when I heard the jeans were showing up in New York's Century 21 department stores. Mr. [Charles Lesser] told me the company had indeed sold some "overstock" items to Century 21 -- and that Century 21 and Nordstrom Rack were the only two discounters buying directly from True Religion. He said that if I could find the jeans elsewhere, they're likely counterfeit.  So, I called him again, this time asking about those True Religion jeans at a few BJ's Wholesale Club stores in New York and Massachusetts. "They didn't come from us," Mr. Lesser says. Then where did they come from? He doesn't know, but he had a pair shipped to him to see if they're legit.
