 Telecom-Gear Executives Buy Shares   By By Brian Callaghan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  Joe Bellace, an analyst for Jefferies & Co., said it wasn't surprising that there hasn't been any insider buying at Lucent until now, because all of the executives acquired "tons of stock" after the company's initial public offering in 1996. The August purchases included one million shares by Lucent Chairman Henry Schacht, and 350,000 shares by President Patricia Russo. "It's not shocking to see Pat Russo buy when the stock's only at a dollar and a half," Mr. Bellace said. Lucent shares were up six cents at $1.79 a share yesterday on the Big Board.  Mr. [Ian Zaffino] said that insider buying at Andrew is being driven by the same rationale seen at Crown Castle. "They think their stock is cheap," he said. In 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday, Andrew shares were down 83 cents at $9.16 a share. Credit Suisse has a bank-facility relationship with Crown Castle but no banking relationship with Andrew, Mr. Zaffino said. No other analysts interviewed said their investment firms had banking relationships with the companies they commented on.  Ted Moreau of Robert W. Baird & Co. said that insider purchasing at Andrew results from the low level of the stock, a depressed telecom market, and open windows for the executives to buy stock. He also said that a number of new employees who came on board after Andrew's $470 million purchase of Celiant Corp. from Lucent may be acquiring initial stakes in Andrew.
