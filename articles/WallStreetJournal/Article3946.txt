 Tip of the Week: Get an Idea Of Gas Cost   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2005  In some cases, you may be better off going by bus or plane, especially if you are traveling alone. A round trip from Tampa, Fla., to Richmond, Va., in a 2004 Ford Explorer, for example, would cost $215, according to the AAA site. The same trip on a Greyhound bus would cost just $138 if you bought the ticket seven days in advance. And Travelocity.com was recently advertising flights on the same route for as little as $166 over Labor Day.
