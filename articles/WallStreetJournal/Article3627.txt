 Catalog Critic: Old-Fashioned Gratitude   By By Lisa Gubernick, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 2002  The fire truck cards from FineStationery.com definitely had more stuff on them. Each high-quality ivory card featured a vivid cut-out fire engine and ladder, with most of the thank-you sentiment pre-printed in a grade school-style hand ("Dear _____, Thank you very much for the _____"). Nicholas, 4, loved the red truck; the grown-ups found the cards adorable and were wowed by their yellow confetti packaging. But Nicholas's mom noted that while the card is designed for a child who's just learning to write, there's not enough room for a young scrawling signature. Then there was the price: Our box of 25 notes cost $133, more than $5 per card.
