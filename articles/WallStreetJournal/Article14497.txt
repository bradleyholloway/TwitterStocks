 REGIONS   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1988  A state-by-state study of premature deaths by the Centers for Disease Control shows that New York in 1985 had 254 heart-attack deaths for every 100,000 males age 35 to 64, the highest of any state. Other states along the heart-attack axis -- Rhode Island, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana -- are clustered just below New York in the grim standings. North Carolina and South Carolina are also near the top.  The healthiest hearts, meanwhile, appear to be out West. New Mexico has the lowest fatality rate for middle-aged males: 108 deaths per 100,000. Other states at the low end are Utah, Hawaii, Montana, Alaska, Washington and California. The figures are age adjusted to account for states with younger populations; male statistics are cited because men are at a higher risk for heart attacks than women.  "Explaining the geographic differences is very difficult," says CDC epidemiologist Patrick Remington. In the 1960s, California was the first state to show a dip in heart-attack rates. Now declines are occurring in every state. Smoking, excess weight, and a diet high in saturated fats are strongly linked to heart disease, so states where these factors are on the wane should rank lower on the heart-attack scale.
