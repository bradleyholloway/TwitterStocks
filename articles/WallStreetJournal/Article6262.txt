 Wyeth Shares Decline After 'Opt-Out' Suit Setback   By Abboud, Leila, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2003  The plaintiff had chosen not to participate in the global settlement [Wyeth] established in 1999 to pay claims related to its diet drugs, and investors worried that the award might be a sign of what is to come in other "opt-out" cases. About 78,000 people have opted out of the settlement agreement and are eligible to sue Wyeth individually. Analysts had expected the awards in opt-out cases to range from $10,000 to $15,000, according to a Merrill Lynch report.
