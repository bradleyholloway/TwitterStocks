 Japan's Farm Lobby Fighting Reforms By Exploiting National Distrust of U.S.   By By Damon Darlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1988  Speculative reports that Washington will now push Tokyo to lift rice imports are widely printed in the Japanese press and frequently discussed among politicians, farmers and agribusiness bureaucrats. Unsupported worries also are widespread that drought-diminished U.S. food supplies might encourage an embargo on food sales to import-dependent Japan.  All this is playing into the hands of Zenchu, Japan's powerful farm lobby and agribusiness conglomerate, as it tries to thwart farm reforms. Not surprisingly, strong opinion has formed against a government plan to reduce rice subsidies, the first test of Japan's willingness to overhaul agriculture since the beef accord. A government advisory panel recommended Wednesday that the government lower the price it pays rice farmers by an average of 4.6%. But because of protests from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, and Zenchu, the recommendation is less than last year's cuts and only half of what the government wanted, and it ignores a proposed formula that would have encouraged Japan's tiny, inefficient rice farms to go out of business.  Clearly reform is scaring the LDP, which owes its three decades of rule to Zenchu's vote-delivering ability. And a setback for farm reform in Japan is a setback for the Reagan administration's drive to eliminate farm subsidies world-wide. At Washington's behest, farm reform was a major topic at the June Toronto summit. While there was no agreement among the industrialized nations to reduce protection of their farmers, the issue remains high on the Reagan administration agenda. The U.S. will need Japan's cooperation to get sweeping changes under the so-called Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
