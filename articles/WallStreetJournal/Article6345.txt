 H-P Plans to Buy Synstar to Boost European IT Base   By Fildes, Nic, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2004  The offer for Synstar, to be made by an H-P subsidiary in Europe, H- P Global Investment BV, is for 100 pence in cash for each Synstar share. Yesterday, Synstar shares rose 27%, or 21 pence, to 99.25 pence each on the London Stock Exchange.  Steve Vaughan, Synstar chief executive, said the H-P bid was unsolicited but the offer represents a good premium over the company's growth strategy and has the blessing of the Synstar board.  "It's tomorrow's price today," Mr. Vaughan said. Market forecasts for Synstar were for 30% earnings growth in fiscal year ending in September, so H-P's offer is attractive, especially as it is an all- cash bid, he said.
