 Ex-Drexel Analyst Sentenced for Role In 'Yuppie' Case   By By Michael W. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1986  Robert Salsbury, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. arbitrage analyst, drew a lenient sentence of three years' probation and community service for his role in the "Yuppie Five" insider-trading case.  Mr. Salsbury has asserted that senior Drexel officials were aware of his insider trading, a contention his lawyer repeated at yesterday's sentencing. Drexel denied that charge.  Since Mr. Salsbury and the other four figures in the Yuppie case were indicted in May, Drexel has come under much closer scrutiny for alleged insider trading. The firm is currently the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury, as part of the widening Ivan Boesky scandal that came to light last month.
