 Earnings Digest -- Apparel: AnnTaylor Tries for a Better Fit   By Kevin Kingsbury and Angela Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2007  Like many other chains that sell women's fashions, AnnTaylor has been in a sales slump. Same-store sales, or results at locations open more than a year, fell 6.2% in the quarter. Same-store sales at its namesake chain dropped 3.1%, while those at the company's lower-price Ann Taylor Loft stores slumped 11% as the chain "lacked the appropriate balance of updated classics, color and novelty."  AnnTaylor also recently hired Mark Mendelson, a former executive with Jones Apparel Group Inc., to run a new chain of stores it expects to launch in the fall of 2008. AnnTaylor on Friday said for the first time that the chain is targeted at the "modern boomer segment."
