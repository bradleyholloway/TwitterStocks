 Aches & Claims: Health Scares in Your Inbox   By By Robert J. Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2003  Some warnings have a grain of scientific truth but exaggerate or distort the facts. One such alert advises people not to microwave food in plastic containers or wraps because heated plastic releases cancer-causing substances into foods. It's true that certain chemicals may migrate from plastics during microwaving and that some scientists have raised concerns. But the Food and Drug Administration says the levels of these substances are safe.  Occasionally health-related e-mails offer well-intentioned advice that's inaccurate. For instance, one message says that people having a heart attack can perform CPR on themselves by coughing. In fact, hospital patients experiencing abnormal heart rhythms are sometimes instructed to cough to maintain blood flow, but the American Heart Association doesn't consider cough CPR a legitimate life-saving technique.
