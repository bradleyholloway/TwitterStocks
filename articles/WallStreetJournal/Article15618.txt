 As the Economy Hums Along, Rural Population Recovers, Too   By By Patrick Barta, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1997  After starting the decade with its population staggering from the one-two punch of depressions in the energy and farm sectors, Sherman is poised to end the current decade with more residents than it has had since the early 1980s. In Stratford, the county seat, new homes are going up, and many downtown buildings vacant seven years ago now house businesses. Likewise, the student body at the county elementary school is the biggest in recent memory.  Much of rural Texas is in similarly happy straits, with populations stabilizing, if not expanding. In fact, if current growth rates continue, most counties far from major urban areas will add seven times the number of people in this decade that they did in the last, according to estimates in a Texas A&M University study to be published next month.  That there is a rural population miniboom under way shouldn't be startling. More than anything else, the strong and steady expansion of the economy, including recovery in those industries that imploded in the 1980s, helped swell the state's total population by some 2.1 million people from 1990 to 1996. That increase was greater than in any other state during the period, and of the total, roughly 800,000 reside outside the state's major cities.
