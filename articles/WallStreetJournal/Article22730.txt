 Cattle Futures Jump as Mad-Cow Fears Wane   By By Daniel Rosenberg and Shella Calamba, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 2, 2001  Last week, the market sagged after the U.S. Food & Drug Administration quarantined a feedlot in Texas. Cattle there had been fed a mixture of bone-and-meat meal banned in the U.S. The quarantine, along with the rash of cases in Europe, made headlines across the country, and analysts and traders feared it would dent beef demand. Nearby Chicago Mercantile Exchange cattle futures fell nearly 5% from their January high.  The FDA later said none of the Texas cattle tested positive. BSE has never appeared in the U.S., and many in the industry are confident it never will. Beef demand soared in recent months despite the scare in Europe, a signal that U.S. consumers aren't too concerned about a crisis.  The steady cash came despite a declining beef market. Beef is down about eight cents from January's record highs. Some analysts say beef prices fell due to a slowing U.S. economy. When people are laid off, or have to accept smaller raises, they are less likely to go out for steak. But others say a downturn won't hurt the market.
