 Aluminum Workers Reject Contracts at Certain Plants   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1986  About 5,000 members of the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers voted to continue striking Aluminum Co. of America's Warrick, Ind., and Massena, N.Y., plants after rejecting proposals covering certain local issues.  Meanwhile, hourly workers at Reynolds Metals Co. rebuffed the accord at the No. 2 domestic producer's Longview, Wash., rod and cable plant and the Louisville, Ky., plant; strikes are planned at the two plants. Union members ratified the agreement at six other Reynolds plants.
