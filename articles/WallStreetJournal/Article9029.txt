 Clinton Considers Tax-Credit Proposal To Help Care for Elderly and Disabled   By By Greg Hitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1998  The Clinton administration is working on a proposal to provide families with tax credits to help defray the cost of long-term care for the elderly and disabled.  Details of the package are still being pieced together, but the initiative has caught the attention of President Clinton and is a leading candidate to be included in the fiscal 2000 budget, aides said. The proposal would respond to concerns about the high cost of such care, and the lack of affordable long-term care insurance.  "This issue is going to get more and more significant as the years pass," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national consumer health organization. "There's some significant support for it, but (there are) some questions. . . as to whether encouraging long-term care coverage via the tax code is the best, most efficient, more equitable way to do that."
