 Asian Currency-Reserve Pool Offers Clout   By Simms, James, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2007  "This sends a very good signal that we are going to use our combined reserves to support ourselves in case the need arises," Malaysian Second Finance Minister Nor Mohamed Yakcop said in an interview.
