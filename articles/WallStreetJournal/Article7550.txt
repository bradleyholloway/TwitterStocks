 Bookshelf: Return to the Cuckoo's Nest   By By Lee Lescaze, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1986  In piece after piece of "Demon Box" (Viking, $18.95, 384 pages), a miscellaneous collection of his short writings since the late 1960s, Mr. Kesey casts a longing glance or two over his shoulder at what, for him, were happier days. Specifically, he longs for the days of 1960s spirit, when antic actions flowed from the firmly held faith that times were changing.  Upon learning in of the 1968 death of Neal Cassady, father of the Beatniks, star of Jack Kerouac's "On the Road," devotee of speed (or whatever drug you've got), Mr. Kesey calls a memorial roll of '60s figures from LBJ to Timothy Leary, from Curtis LeMay to Eldridge Cleaver. "Come back and remember," Mr. Kesey asks. The litany is an appeal for meaning to emerge from those times, but it ends, as many Keseyan things apparently do these days, with a shrug. "Attendance mandatory but not required."  "Down to five pesos from five thousand dollars/ Down to the dregs from the lip-smacking foam/ Down to a dope-fiend from a prize-winning scholar/ Down to the bush from a civilized home." Whatever time Mr. Kesey may have lost, he doesn't spend a minute on self-pity. Nor, despite the status "Cuckoo's Nest" earned him as a Major Writer, does he take himself too seriously. In fact, Mr. Kesey likes to pause along the way to point out that some of the moments described in this book were not his finest.
