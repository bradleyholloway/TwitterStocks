 World Wire [1]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1994  The plans follow U.S. antitrust authorities' decision to follow the European Union's lead and investigate a telecommunications patents policy of the independent European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which has about 330 government, industry and phone company members.  The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association in Washington says the policy amounts to compulsory licensing and could prevent its U.S. members from participating in technical work on European standards, a contention the European institute denies. The U.S. group has complained to the EU, which said the policy might have to be changed to comply with EU competition rules.  Japan's prototype fast-breeder reactor, known as Monju, is to begin a self-sustaining nuclear reaction, as part of preparations for full operation of the $5.45 billion facility by 1996. The project is aimed at reducing Japan's need to import most of its energy by developing a power source that most nations have rejected as unfeasible. The reactor burns plutonium refined from the byproduct of conventional reactors and produces still more plutonium. If the Monju tests succeed, a demonstration reactor would be built and a commercial reactor could follow in the year 2020.
