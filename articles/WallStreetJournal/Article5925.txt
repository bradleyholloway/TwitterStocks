 Ad Notes....   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  BRIEFS: CNN, a unit of AOL Time Warner, has begun to contact ad agencies about a branding assignment. In March, the cable-news network hired Messner Vetere Berger McNamee, a unit of Havas Advertising's Euro RSCG Worldwide to handle its estimated $50 million ad account. However, the agency, which has done research on CNN's behalf, has never been given the green light to produce work. "There is no formal review," says a spokesman for CNN. "However, sometimes we go out and look at other agencies for specific assignments." . . . WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson has hired Simon Bolton, the 42-year old chief executive of the San Francisco office of True North Communications' FCB, as CEO of J. Walter Thompson, United Kingdom, a post that has been vacant since last year. FCB said Geoff Thompson, 57, FCB's world-wide creative director, will pick up the chairman and CEO titles.
