 XFL Is Sacked in Ratings, Drawing Tiny Viewership   By By Joe Flint and Stefan Fatsis, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2001  Last Saturday's game on General Electric Co.'s NBC averaged a lowly 1.6 rating and a three share. Each rating point represents 1.02 million households, while the share represents the percentage of television sets in use. In terms of viewers, only 2.2 million people watched the game. Making matters worse for NBC, the network owns half of the league with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc.  Spokesmen for the WWF, XFL and NBC said the rating for Saturday's game was expected to suffer because of head-to-head competition from the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament games on CBS. NBC remains committed to completing the XFL season as scheduled, said Kevin Sullivan, a spokesman for NBC Sports.
