 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Northern Louisiana   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1989  We don't personally know Frank McNamara, who resigned this week as U.S. Attorney for Boston after 28 of his 39 Assistant Attorneys signed a letter against him. Perhaps Mr. McNamara was as incompetent as charged. But having learned a bit about Massachusetts politics during the recent presidential campaign, we wonder. A few facts keep coming to mind:  Two: Mr. McNamara also encouraged the FBI to probe Governor Dukakis's ties to developers who stood to make an enormous profit from the sale of some land to the state at New Braintree. The local FBI office closed that investigation without subpoenaing a single document or interviewing a single witness, and now the New Braintree investigation is being cited as one of Mr. McNamara's mistakes. But many New Braintree residents believe a real investigation, not a perfunctory one, was in order.
