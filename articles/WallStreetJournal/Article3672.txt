 CBOE Licenses Investment Firm For BXM Product   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2003  So why can't investors duplicate the BXM approach on their own? They can, Mr. [Ron Egalka] said, but he argued a licensed investment manager can better apply the strategy in changing markets. "Anyone can buy S&P 500 stocks and turn around and sell a one-month S&P 500 call against it," he said. "But you must also be aware of how to vary the different aspects of the BXM concept to increase or lessen the risk exposure or to exploit market conditions."  With stocks drifting sideways or lower for the past three years, and volatility heightened, the BXM has handily outperformed the S&P 500. Last year, the BXM fell 6.7%, compared with a 23.4% decline in the 500-stock index. The five-year return at the end of 2002 for the BXM was 28.6%, compared with negative 9.3% for the S&P 500.
