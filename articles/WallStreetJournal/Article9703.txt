 Executives on Trial: Tyco Ex-Lawyer Belnick Believed His Compensation Was Approved   By Bray, Chad, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2004  As closing arguments began yesterday, lawyer Reid Weingarten said Mr. Belnick, the conglomerate's chief counsel from 1998 to 2002, didn't come into the job with the mind-set of an "inspector general." He instead believed other top executives when he was told directors had reviewed his compensation.  Mr. Belnick "was paid a lot of money at Tyco, money we believe was earned," Mr. Weingarten said.  As a result, Mr. Belnick rubbed some Tyco executives the wrong way when he attempted to introduce more-centralized reporting methods in the company's legal department, Mr. Weingarten said.
