 Bank-Rating Service's Influence Grows --- Big Depositors Rely, Some Say Blindly, on Keefe Bruyette   By By Jeff Bailey and G. Christian Hill, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1985  It's a similar story at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. "We rely on the Keefe ratings to determine who we'll sell funds to," says Paul J. Bielat, treasurer, with about $2 billion deposited in banks. Mr. Bielat says the regional home loan banks, in varying degrees, build the Keefe ratings directly into their investment policies.  The reliance of these two big money managers on the ratings illustrates the growing influence of Keefe's bank-rating service, known as Bank Watch. The New York-based bank securities firm rates the 300 largest U.S. banks, 100 big foreign banks and a growing number of thrifts. The 650 Bank Watch subscribers, like Messrs. Laird and Bielat, include many of the biggest sources of bank deposits. In addition to money market funds and the Federal Home Loan Bank system, cash-rich corporations, municipal treasurers, insurance companies, foreign central banks and bank trust departments buy the Keefe service.  The ratings (see chart below) range from A, "Unquestioned strength, no perceived credit risk at any maturity," to E, "Very serious problems . . . Continued viability without outside assistance must be seriously questioned," according to subscribers. Subscribers typically get ratings on 75 or more institutions, and Keefe charges $100 annually for each of those ratings. Gregory Root, the Keefe vice president who oversees the 15 Bank Watch analysts, refuses to confirm any ratings or how they're defined -- Keefe tries to keep Bank Watch confidential. Mr. Root says the ratings by themselves could be misleading because Keefe also sends clients a two-to-four page commentary on each bank it rates.
