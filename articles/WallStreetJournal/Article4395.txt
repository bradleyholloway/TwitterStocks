 Senate Postpones Debates on INF Treaty; Resolution of Verification Issues Is Urged   By By John Walcott and John E. Yang, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1988  The Senate postponed its debate on the treaty to eliminate U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles after congressional leaders said the two countries first should resolve serious differences over how to verify compliance with the pact.  The debate had been scheduled to begin tomorrow, but leaders of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees sought the delay. "There are serious problems and until they are resolved, I think it would be very difficult to proceed with a full-fledged debate in the Senate," said Sen. William Cohen, (R., Maine), vice chairman of the intelligence committee. "My feeling is that until these disputes are resolved, we should not proceed."  Administration officials said the Soviets haven't agreed to some U.S. demands for on-site inspection of facilities where medium-range missiles are assembled or stored. They said the delay in the Senate debate probably means the Senate won't approve the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty before President Reagan begins his Moscow summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev May 29.
