 New Construction Contracts Slipped 0.9% in January   By By Stephanie Ferrell-Keegan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1992  New construction contracts in the U.S. slipped 0.9% in January from December, as continued weakness in the commercial building sector offset steady improvements in residential and public-works spending.  F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said January construction contracts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $246 billion, down from December's $248 billion. But the value of new construction contracts in the last year generally has been increasing despite the commercial sector, Dodge said.  "A stubbornly depressed nonresidential building market is keeping the construction sector from realizing its full potential," said Dodge's vice president and chief economist, George A. Christie. "Even after the long recession, lingering weakness in commercial and industrial building is offsetting very substantial gains in one-family housing and public-works construction."
