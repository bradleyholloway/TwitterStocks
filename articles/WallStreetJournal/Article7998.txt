 NBC Reportedly Plans News Service Operating 24 Hours for Its Affiliates   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1990  NBC News is planning to launch a 24-hour news service, similar to Cable News Network's Headline News, and offer it to the network's 208 affiliates, according to people familiar with the proposal.  Although plans aren't finalized, NBC News, a division of National Broadcasting Co., reportedly would provide fully produced newscasts -- with anchors separate from NBC News -- to affiliates during periods when the network isn't operating. For example, NBC doesn't transmit programming for several hours during the morning beginning at 9 a.m., in the afternoon beginning at 4 p.m. and overnight beginning at 2 a.m.  NBC is planning to announce details of the service in June at its annual convention with affiliates in Washington. It would be offered exclusively to NBC affiliates.
