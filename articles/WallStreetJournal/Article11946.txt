 Make the dollar as good as gold   By Mueller, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1995  John Mueller responds to Paul Craig Roberts's Mar 16, 1995 commentary on "The Inevitable Decline of a Reserve Currency." Mueller says the relative strength of the yen (strongest), mark (middle) and dollar (weakest) is a direct function of the degree to which each is not a reserve currency.
