 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- details: Big Wheels Head For the Hills   By Dougherty, Conor, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2004  Peter Perron, 46, an attorney in the Seattle area, recently took up unicycling with his wife, Suzanne Ross. They started on standard unicycles in tennis courts, holding onto the fence for support. Later, they used ski poles to keep balance and added mountain unicycling, on trails, to their repertoire. It's "a funny, inexpensive way to have fun," says Mr. Perron, who adds that he's lost 10 pounds. Plus, it's "not something that everybody does."  In 1996, John Foss, a 25-year unicyclist, organized an event called the "California Mountain Unicycling Weekend" that lured 35 cyclists; attendance at the annual event has more than doubled since and a half- dozen similar events have sprung up around the country. Nonetheless, Mr. Foss says he has come to accept that wherever he rides, the one question he's likely to hear is, "Dude, are you in the circus?"
