 Corporate Sandals: Birkenstock Family Feuds Over Its Name; One Heir's Estranged Wife Starts a Rival Business; 'Dallas on the Rhine'   By Rohwedder, Cecilie, The Wall Street Journal,  May 20, 2005  Alarmed by this debut, Birkenstock Orthopaedie GmbH, run by Mr. [Susanne Birkenstock] and his two brothers, asked the district court of Cologne to stop Ms. Birkenstock from using the clan's name to promote sandals. In its filing, the company said that Ms. Birkenstock sold shoes that resembled Birkenstocks, had the same function and therefore were in competition. It was "overly clear," added the filing, "that the defendant's sole mission is to sponge off the reputation of the plaintiff's brands."  "The problem was that retailers were calling and asking, 'what's this new product of yours?'" he says. "We didn't want someone to try on her shoes and say, what are these funny things?" Mr. Birkenstock says he didn't see Mr. [Bernd Hillen]'s letter before it went out and wouldn't have written it that way -- especially a passage that said Ms. Birkenstock was running her business from the "basement" of her home. "It wasn't very diplomatic," he concedes.  In February, the Cologne court ruled that Ms. Birkenstock can sell shoes, but only if her last name isn't prominently displayed. Her company is now called SB International and her ads say, in tiny letters: "Designed by Susanne Birkenstock." Birkenstock officials say they will watch closely how Ms. Birkenstock will market her sandals as she expands into the U.S., the shoemaker's second-biggest market after Germany.
