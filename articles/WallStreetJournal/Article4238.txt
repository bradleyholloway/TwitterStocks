 Weyerhaeuser Co. Has Plan to Market Embalmed Plants --- Company Seeking to Provide An Alternative to Plastic; Don't Water, Just Dust   By By Ken Wells, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1987  Now you can have real plants with all the carefree benefits of plastic ones. So says Weyerhaeuser Co., the Tacoma, Wash.-based forest products giant, which wants to revolutionize the house and ornamental-plant market with a patented chemical process that essentially embalms real plants and preserves them indefinitely in a lifelike state.  The company, through its Auburn, Wash.-based Weyerhaeuser Specialty Plants Division, will soon begin shipments of tiny evergreen bonsai trees in a first test of what it hopes will become a lucrative preserved-plant market. The trees, says Stephen Barger, the division's general manager, require no watering, pruning or repotting.
