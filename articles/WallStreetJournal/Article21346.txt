 Indictments in Chicago: Striking at the Heart of the Soybean Pit   By By Robert L. Rose and Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1989  After battling for seven months against traders in the soybean pit at the Chicago Board of Trade, U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas indicted 19 soybean traders. Mr. Valukas induced at least four of them to cooperate, almost guaranteeing there will be more indictments to come in this city's largest agricultural trading pit.  Today, it's a pit at war, with some longtime traders fighting both the prosecutor and former colleagues. John N. Eggum, a former wheat trader who moved over to beans when the soybean market got hot last year, has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud, to give up trading forever and to testify against fellow traders. At least three other bean traders have also agreed to cooperate.  The soybean fraternity has been shattered by the defection in the past few days of Mr. Eggum, who stopped trading and sold his seat after news of the investigation broke last January. One of many Board of Trade veterans who made mid-life career changes to become futures traders, the 47-year-old trader early on was considered a prime target of the investigation. Now that he's made his deal, the question is what he'll tell the government about fellow traders.
