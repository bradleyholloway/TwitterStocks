 What's Your Workout? Professional Poker Player Doesn't Gamble With Exercise Online edition  By Murphy, Jen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  "I eat very little while playing in a tournament," he says. "I'm sharper that way. I guess you could even say I'm hungrier." Mr. [Lee Watkinson] eats cereal or an omelet in the mornings. Most tournaments start at noon and players are allowed to eat at the card table and are also given a dinner break. At the table Mr. Watkinson might eat a banana or energy bar or nibble on nuts.  He won't eat a meal during the dinner break. "A lot of people go out and have a huge dinner after they've been playing for eight hours and then they come back tired and with a full stomach," he says. "Your concentration is blown." Alcoholic drinks are also served to players at the table but Mr. Watkinson abstains. "I've gotten to the point where I'm pretty much over drinking," he says. "It wears me out."  "Even if I feel tired before I start I know how good I will feel once I get warmed up," says Mr. Watkinson. "And how much better I will feel for the rest of the day." Strength training takes more motivation. "It is the only part of staying healthy I don't really enjoy," he says. "And so I usually don't do it until later in the day."
