 Spanish Bank Terminates Bid To Buy a Rival   By By Nicholas Bray, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1987  Banco de Bilbao ended its takeover bid for Banco Espanol de Credito, or Banesto, following a rejection of the offer by the Madrid stock exchange.  The combination of the two banks would have created Spain's largest bank, with 20% of the domestic market and deposits of more than three trillion pesetas ($26.79 billion), ranking 74th world-wide. Banco de Bilbao had described its takeover attempt, the first of its kind in Spain, as being part of a strategy to strengthen the Spanish banking sector ahead of the scheduled liberalization of European Community financial markets in 1992.
