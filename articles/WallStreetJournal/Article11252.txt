 Letters to the Editor: Babes Declare War in Toyland   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1989  As a man with three young children, as a business executive, as a human being who reads on your front pages of a nine-year-old child's murder and of Iran's cries to murder strangers (young and old alike), I am outraged to read your story about a day-care operator, Rick Porter, promoting "games" that elicit young children's calls for other kids to "Kill each other!" "Blow each other's heads off!" ("Are Mollycoddlers Turning Our Tykes Into Little Wimps?" page one, May 10.) When kids react in that manner, the use of Mr. Porter's day-care "toys" must be seriously questioned.  My wife teaches in an elementary school where many children suffer terribly from violence and abuse at home, where outdoor recess is canceled because gang wars break out across the street, where a sixth-grade girl wielding a knife leads her class to rumble with another class.
