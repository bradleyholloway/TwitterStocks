 Jaguar, General Motors Confirm Talks About GM Taking Stake in British Firm   By By Richard E. Rustin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1989  The announcement confirmed what the financial and automotive worlds have believed for three weeks. It came three days after Ford Motor Co., which Jaguar regards as an unwelcome suitor, received U.S. antitrust clearance to buy as much as 15% of Jaguar. Thus, a Jaguar-GM tie, which Jaguar yesterday said has quietly been under discussion for months, looms as a defensive alliance against Ford.  In Detroit, GM also confirmed discussions over the past several months about the possibility of joint ventures with Jaguar. "In this connection," the U.S. auto maker said, "GM is discussing the possibility of acquiring a minority interest in Jaguar PLC to assist Jaguar in remaining an independent British-owned manufacturer."
