 Resisting Moscow's Energy Imperialism   By Connolly, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  NUKES AND TRADE: Expect to see North Korea's nukes and a Pacific- wide free-trade zone emerge as major issues at this week's summit of 21 Asian-Pacific leaders in Vietnam. U.S. President George W. Bush and the leaders of the four other nations seeking a way to curtail Kim Jong Il's weapons program -- Japan, China, South Korea and Russia -- are likely to focus on the Pyongyang problem.  Meanwhile, with Vietnam having just been accepted as the WTO's 150th member, Hanoi, like Beijing before it, has now thrown its hat in with capitalism, encouraging more stable economic growth than in the investment frenzy of the mid-1990s. So much for yesteryear's excoriation of running dogs. Russia too seems WTO bound, with plans by Moscow to sign a deal with Washington at the meeting on Russia's accession to the WTO.  Meanwhile, Spain's Telefonica SA will join a pair of charitable foundations run by billionaire Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing to buy most of a 23% stake in Hong Kong fixed-line operator PCCW Ltd. being sold by his son, PCCW Chairman Richard Li. The Spanish telecommunications company will purchase an 8% stake and solidify its relationship with PCCW's biggest shareholder, China Network Communications Ltd., gaining greater access to PCCW's know-how in Internet-protocol TV.
