 GE, Abbott Abandon Deal For Two Units   By Kathryn Kranhold and Avery Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2007  The breakup may have been related to ongoing regulatory problems at an Abbott manufacturing facility. On March 13, the FDA sent [Abbott] a warning letter concerning a plant in Irving, Texas that makes blood and urine tests and the machines that analyze them. The FDA called the devices "adulterated " and "misbranded." It said Abbott needed to fix the problems quickly and get an outside consultant to monitor compliance. GE may have been nervous about taking on regulatory issues; its surgery-equipment business has been under a consent decree since January.  GE Chairman Jeffrey Immelt had warned investors in May that the deal was taking longer than expected. Mr. Immelt referred to the in-vitro market as GE's "cup of tea," and called Abbott the "definitive IVD player."
