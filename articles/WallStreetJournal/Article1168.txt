 Profit Hopes Attract Activity in Brokerages   By Hadi, Mohammed, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2007  More than 152,300 put options on the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund, or XLF, which tracks the performance of financial stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, changed hands. The fund includes, among many others, Lehman and Goldman among its holdings, along with Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.  Traders of puts on the XLF weren't as focused on moves to come in coming days and weeks. Rather, the bulk of trading in these contracts was by those looking as far out as December, said Christopher Jacobson, senior derivatives strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group.
