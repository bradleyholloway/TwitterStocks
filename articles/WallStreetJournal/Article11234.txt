 All About Yves: Saint Laurent Remains Idol of French Fashion, But He Isn't Immortal --- Unlike American Couturiers Without Succession Plans, YSL Sketches Its Future --- The Sweet Smell of Success   By By Philip Revzin and Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1989  The most famous fashion designer in the world is holding court backstage. Cameras clatter. Models breeze past in billowing chiffon. Surrounded by his claque, Yves Saint Laurent busses a socialite on both cheeks. She is stunning in a crimson Saint Laurent outfit. He embraces a banker, distinguished in a gray Saint Laurent suit.  Just moments ago, under a tent pitched in a courtyard at the Louvre, an effusive crowd roared its approval of Mr. Saint Laurent's fall line for 1989. From all sides, praise is heaped on this man who has been fashion's idol for 30 years: "Magnifique, Yves!" "Fabuleux, Yves!" "Fantastique, Yves!"  The Saint Laurent organization denies widespread rumors that the designer is seriously ill. Even so, it is taking steps to ensure that the YSL dynasty -- nearly $2 billion in annual sales of clothing, perfume, scarves, and sundry other stuff -- lives on into the next century. The French and Italian businessmen who run YSL are about to sew up the management and capital to prevent an unfriendly takeover. And though Mr. Saint Laurent isn't grooming a creative successor, the company's solid financial footing virtually guarantees that when talent is needed it will be there, his advisers assert.
