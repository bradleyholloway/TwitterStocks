 Alamito Receives Takeover Offers By 2 More Suitors   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1986  Alamito, an electricity wholesaler, said a committee of outside directors is reviewing an offer of $128 a share, or about $294 million, from a group of New York-based investors. The company said the committee already has decided that a merger proposal from Homans McGraw Tully Valeo & Co., a Boston-based investment banking concern, is deficient.  An attorney for Alamito said the $128-a-share offer came from an investor group that intends to form a company called Megawatt Corp. to acquire all of Alamito's stock outstanding. While Megawatt still needs a definitive financing commitment, it told Alamito that "it has obtained a financing proposal from General Electric Credit Corp. to provide $260 million of financing for the merger and that Megawatt would be capitalized with $20 million of equity capital." GE Credit is a unit of General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn.
