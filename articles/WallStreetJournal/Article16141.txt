 Blue-Chip Rocket: Up 480 Points in Two Days   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2002  The Dow soared 2.10%, or 217.96 points, to 10586.82, returning to a level it hadn't seen since July 20. Counting Friday's leap of 262.73 points, the rally left the index up 480.69 points in two days, the first time since October 2000 that it has gained 200 points on two consecutive days. The Dow now is up 5.6% since the year began, although it remains 9.7% below its record high of 11722.98, set Jan. 14, 2000.  He pointed out that the broader S&P 500 index, which also put in a big gain, now is nearing the top of the range in which it has traded since the latter part of last year. Mr. [Rob Cohen] said he doubts that the rally is strong enough to push the S&P to new post-September highs. Oracle, a leading software concern, for example, has just warned that its quarterly financial results will be weaker than it had expected.  The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500, which are heavily exposed to tech, also benefited from the recent surge. The Nasdaq composite yesterday soared 3.14%, or 56.58 points, to 1859.32, while the S&P 500 rose 1.95%, or 22.06 points, to 1153.84.
