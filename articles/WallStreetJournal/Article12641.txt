 GM to Name PepsiCo Executive To Advertising, Marketing Post   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Joann S. Lublin, Gregory L. White and Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2001  At Pepsi-Cola, where he worked for 12 years, Mr. [Christopher "CJ" Fraleigh] earned kudos for accelerating growth of the company's popular Mountain Dew brand. Most recently, he headed up marketing efforts for Pepsi's cola brands, including Pepsi-Cola, diet Pepsi and Pepsi One.  A former Pepsi colleague predicted that Mr. Fraleigh's talents will enable him to succeed at GM. "He will find that unique touchpoint with the consumer that's been lacking. It's there to be mined. He doesn't have to invent it. He'll discover and dramatize it," said Brian Swette, an ex-Pepsi marketing executive who now is eBay Inc.'s chief operating officer.
