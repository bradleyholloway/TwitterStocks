 Global Stock Markets Rally on Election Results, More Bullish Stance on Japan and Strong Dollar   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Bill Spindle in Tokyo and Sara Webb in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1998  The trading day kicked off with a strong rally in Japan where the key stock market index jumped 4.1%. Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong rose 1.4%, South Korea gained 1.4%, Thailand rose 3.2% and Singapore climbed 3%. European markets picked up the ball and ran with the rally, encouraged by a stronger dollar, some good corporate news and the prospect of more interest-rate cuts in Europe, with Germany up 3.6%, Italy up 3%, France up 2.8%, the Netherlands up 2.5%, Switzerland up 2.3%, Sweden up 2.1%, and London up 2.2%.  Monday's assessment by Mr. (Barton) Biggs that "Japan could be the next great trade," pushed Nikkei futures higher overseas on Tuesday and helped foreign brokers in Tokyo pile up 17 million more "buy" orders than "sell" orders from overseas investors when trading opened in Japan yesterday.
