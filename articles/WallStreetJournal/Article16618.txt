 SmartMoney: Showered With Deal Fees   By Barnett, Megan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2006  "We've got all the primary ingredients for a strong M&A environment," says James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, noting the combination of available cash and strong earnings growth, which makes companies attractive to potential buyers.  Half of Lazard's revenue comes from M&A advisory services, and it advised clients in three of the top 10 global deals during 2005, according to Dealogic.  "Lazard's stock has bounced back nicely from its IPO flop," [Mike Holton] says. "It is a direct beneficiary of an M&A boom."
