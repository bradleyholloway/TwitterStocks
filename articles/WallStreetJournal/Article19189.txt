 Swimming With Belugas -- and Other Close Encounters of the Marine Kind --- Canada's Marine Science Centre: Where Curious Guests Can Belly Up to a Whale   By By Melissa A. Trainer, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1999  VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Sporting Neoprene boots and a life vest, I chuckled as I grabbed a Coleman cooler filled with herring and entered the beluga habitat at the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre. I was participating in one of the aquarium's Encounter programs and was about to come face to face and belly to belly with three of the aquarium's five beluga whales.  The Marine Science Centre sits in the heart of the city's world-renowned Stanley Park. When it opened in 1956, the original mandate specified that the aquarium needed to play a major role in education, conduct original research, help make Vancouver more beautiful and operate on a financially self-sufficient basis. But as time wore on, the aquarium's leaders felt they needed to re-examine and re-evaluate the organization's direction and role in society. Environmental and marine issues were becoming more complex, and extensive surveys and research revealed that visitors wanted more information to make sense of it all. The aquarium's executive director, Dr. John Nightingale, explained, "For the first 40 years, the aquarium showed and taught people about ecology, but ignored the human dimension. What our visitors were telling us was that when they watch television and read the paper they are confused by environmental issues. People turned to us to help understand what is behind those headlines."
