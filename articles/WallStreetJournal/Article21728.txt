 Four Airline Chiefs Join to Block USAir Proposal   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1992  In a rare joint appearance, the chief executive officers of four U.S. airlines urged rejection of British Airways' plan to invest in USAir unless U.S. carriers gain much greater access to Britain and other international markets.  By banding together, the four -- Stephen Wolf of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, Robert Crandall of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Ron Allen of Delta Air Lines, and Frederick Smith of Federal Express Corp. -- turned up the heat on the Bush administration to secure an "open skies" agreement with the British as the price for approving the deal.
