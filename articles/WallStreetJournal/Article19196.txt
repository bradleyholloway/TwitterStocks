 Talks to Resume With Beijing On WTO Entry   By By John Simons, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher characterized the talks as a "stock-taking by experts." He said the meeting, likely to take place in Beijing, wouldn't amount to a formal restarting of negotiations. However, the U.S. will be represented by its chief WTO negotiator Robert Cassidy, indicating the talks may be an attempt to bridge substantive areas of disagreement. "We really do have to take a look to see where we are," Mr. Fisher said.  Mr. Fisher said the administration received "indications" from China that it would like to proceed with the talks, which have been suspended since April. At the time, President Clinton failed to agree to a proposal by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, humiliating the Chinese leader. The sour relations worsened after the U.S. bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in May. Since then, U.S. officials have been waiting for Beijing to extend an invitation to resume the talks.  The U.S. Trade Rep asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to analyze the concessions Mr. Rongji made last spring and their effects on the U.S. and Chinese economies. The ITC report, which was released yesterday, suggests that many sectors of the U.S. economy -- from banking to entertainment -- would benefit from China's accession to the WTO because Beijing would be required to remove certain trade barriers.
