 When a Friend Asks for Money, Try Saying 'No'   By By Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1985  In most other financial matters, lawyers or accountants can intervene swiftly and steer a person away from such shaky propositions. But most people readily lend money to friends and relatives -- often asking for no more than a friend's oral promise of repayment.  "Everybody I've lent money to never paid me back," says LaUna Huffines, a communications consultant in Mill Valley, Calif., who has lent several friends amounts less than $1,000. Mrs. Huffines tried to handle the loans in a businesslike manner, requiring promissory notes and, in one case, requiring a decorative oriental screen as collateral.  Little wonder that financial planners almost unanimously assail loans to relatives and friends. "Money has ruined more friendships," says Lewis Altfest, a New York financial planner. If friends are approached about a loan, he says, they should "try to steer people into a normal loan situation whenever possible or co-sign a loan rather than lend the money directly."
