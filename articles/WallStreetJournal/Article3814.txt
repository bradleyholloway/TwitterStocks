 Electronic Health Records Get a Push   By Wysocki, Bernard, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2004  Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, has proposed establishing a "technology bonus" to insurers and providers to update their systems and switch to electronic records. He estimates the savings at billions of dollars, adding that the Veterans Administration, using new technology, has cut the cost of pulling a medical record from $9 to almost nothing.  The Bush administration made $50 million available for electronic- records demonstration projects in 2004. The president's 2005 budget doubles that amount to $100 million. That's just a drop in the bucket, yet government could create more financial incentives to persuade the health-care industry to pony up the billions of dollars.  Some employer groups are applauding the government's efforts. "If you had to pick one factor to change, to enable the biggest jumps in efficiency and quality, it's the routine use" of electronic records, said Arnold Milstein, medical director of the Pacific Business Group on Health and a Mercer Human Resource consultant.
