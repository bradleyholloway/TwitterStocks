 Public Ignorance on Central America Reflects a Major Failure for Reagan   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1988  Whatever its other successes or failures in Central America, the Reagan administration has lost one important battle: the fight to inform and shape U.S. public opinion.  That conclusion emerges from a new poll that discloses a stunning level of public ignorance about Central America, despite President Reagan's seven-year effort to focus attention on the region. Moreover, the survey finds, those who are least knowledgeable also are least sympathetic to President Reagan's policies.  The nationwide survey shows that a large percentage of Americans don't know that El Salvador is a friend of the U.S., can't name the country where Sandinistas and Contras are fighting, and don't even consider Central America "close to our borders."
