 Directing the Poor to Free Medicine   By Hensley, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2005  "We knew that they were difficult to access, not very visible and not well known," says Miles White, chairman and chief executive of Abbott Laboratories. "We determined we could make a much greater contribution to solving the problems of access and affordability much more directly" by cutting through the red tape.  "One of the main challenges in cancer care is access and affordability of appropriate cancer treatment," says Russ Hinz, an executive with the American Cancer Society in Milwaukee. The pilot partnership program has helped some patients in Wisconsin, he says. But he is reserving judgment on the effort until he sees how long it will last. "Is there a long-term commitment to keeping this in place?" he asks.  Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Washington-based PhRMA, says, "This will not be a three-month, feel-good-and-go-away program. It is a major, sustained push to help low-income and uninsured Americans."
