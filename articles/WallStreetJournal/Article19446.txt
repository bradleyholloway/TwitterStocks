 Most Asian Markets Post Small Losses as Investors Shrug Off Rate Cuts in U.S. and Within Region   By By Sarah McBride, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2001  "The problem is massive uncertainty," said William Pitt, Singapore-based director of Pacific equities for Henderson Investors, which has around $2 billion under management in Asia. "It's partly related to what military or political outcome we're going to see" in the wake of last month's terrorist attacks in the U.S. The main longer-term factors, he said, are questions about the global economy.  "Asia's reacting to fears that in the short term, pushing on the string isn't going to work," said Robert Conlon, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Investec Asset Management, referring to the interest-rate cuts. "Over the longer term, it works, but it doesn't have that effect in the short term. . . . Asian markets aren't going to recover until everyone's fairly confident the U.S. will recover." Investec manages about $350 million in the region, excluding Japan.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index rose 1%, or 49.50 points, to 4881.80.
