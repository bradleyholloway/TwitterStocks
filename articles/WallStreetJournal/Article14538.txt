 An Anti-Takeover Arsenal That Failed --- Macmillan Tried Many Defenses To Stop Suitors   By By Cynthia Crossen and Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1988  Few management groups have thrown up as many takeover defenses as the one running Macmillan, a publishing and information-services company based in New York. Although many of the strategies Macmillan used have become commonplace in recent years, it tried more of them -- and pushed them further -- than almost any company in recent memory.  Macmillan granted its managers hundreds of thousands of restricted shares for which they paid nothing; it borrowed millions of dollars to buy shares for an employee stock-ownership plan, then made management the plan's trustees; and it funded a mammoth "golden parachute" plan for executives. Most audacious of all was the company's restructuring plan, which would have preserved Macmillan's independence by giving management ownership of the company's best assets at very little cost to themselves.  Yesterday, Macmillan's board finally surrendered, recommending to shareholders that they tender their stock to Maxwell Communication Corp. Meanwhile, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. withdrew its rival offer. Maxwell last night completed its tender offer, and will pay $90.25 a share, or $2.62 billion. That price is 80% higher than when Macmillan's six-month-long battle to retain independence began.
