 Apparel Concerns Get Mixed Review On Their Prospects   By By Terri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1992  Cautious shoppers are continuing to shun expensive clothes in favor of jeans and sweats. The trend is expected to boost the earnings of certain apparel companies, which will be reporting their second-quarter results in the coming weeks.  During the seasonally slow second quarter, apparel makers concentrated on clearing out spring goods and on some reorders -- for jeans and sweats in particular. As a result, analysts are forecasting strong year-over-year gains in second-quarter net income for suppliers of basic apparel such as Russell Corp., Fruit of the Loom and VF Corp. But reorders won't help jeans and budget apparel maker Gitano Group Inc., which is undergoing a major restructuring and recently disclosed that it will report a second-quarter loss, compared with a profit a year ago.
