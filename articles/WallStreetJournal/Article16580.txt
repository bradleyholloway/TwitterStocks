 Awash in Cash: Cheap Money, Growing Risks; Big Mergers Are Making a Comeback As Companies, Investors Seek Growth   By Dennis K. Berman and Jason Singer, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  Conditions are "not the best I've seen, but pretty favorable," says Bon-Ton chief executive Byron L. "Bud" Bergren. "For us to try to build 142 [stores] is almost impossible," he says, given the cost. "It's a lot better to buy."  "There's a lot of money willing to bet on cost savings of a merger," says James Q. Crowe, CEO of telecom company Level 3 Communications Inc. Level 3 announced the $680 million purchase of WilTel Communications on Monday, predicating much of the deal on cost cuts. Its shares are up 1.4% since the announcement. "The market is certainly much more skeptical of the intangible kind of synergies," Mr. Crowe says.  "It's consistently active," says Jonathan Turner, who heads the Internet practice at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But it's not the days when you heard about a deal on Monday, were in a hotel conference room by Friday, and had a press release by the next Monday."
