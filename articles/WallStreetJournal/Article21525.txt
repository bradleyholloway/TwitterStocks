 Poultry in Motion Breeders Sell Shares In Ostrich Market --- Investors Hope to Get Rich, But So Did the People Who Raised Chinchillas   By By Karen J. Benfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1991  "You can regain your capital within the first year," says Ronda Barton, who sells people on the idea for Bordelon Breeders International, a big, high-tech ostrich ranch outside Fort Worth. The company sells birds outright and syndicates one-half and one-third interests in ostriches that Bordelon raises for clients. Bordelon pays dividends in chicks. It holds "marketing seminars." You can buy or lease.  One recent Saturday, 50-odd would-be ostrich owners joined the Williamses in hearing the Bordelon pitch. "With cattle, you've just got the hides and the meat," says Craig Longhurst, Bordelon's marketing director. "But with ostriches you've got hide and feathers, then you've got meat, and then you've got eggs. So you've got two more profit centers."  Profit centers? It is true that ostrich leather -- a pimply skin -- is highly prized, certainly highly priced. Mark Cross in New York has an ostrich handbag that sells for $3,475, though it may not move as fast as an ostrich on the hoof (40 mph). And at the Nocona Boot Company near Dallas, ostrich-leather boots walk out the door at $1,000 a pair.
