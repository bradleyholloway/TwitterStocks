 Arizona REIT Mines Database For Business --- Franchise Finance Targets Food and Auto Chains For Specialty Financing   By By Janet Morrissey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1999  Pick a city, name a street corner and ask about the prospects for a Burger King or other major franchise at that site and Morton Fleischer could tell you whether it will succeed.  Mr. Fleischer, chairman, president and chief executive of Franchise Finance Corp. of America, uses a finely tuned research machine -- which includes a database of 10,000 operators complete with traffic counts and cash flow -- to find high-yield investment opportunities for his specialty finance company among the country's fast-food, auto-parts and conveniencestore chains.  These aren't just any franchisees: These are operators of well-established big-name chains, such as Burger King, Arby's, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Checker Auto Parts, Chevron, Midas Muffler Shops, Texaco, Circle K and 7-Eleven, where the long-term leases and mortgages guarantee stable, steady cash flows for the REIT.
