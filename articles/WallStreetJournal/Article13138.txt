 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2005  A: We omitted them from this table because such a small percentage of taxpayers qualify to deduct anything. For example, while itemized deductions were claimed on about eight million returns reporting adjusted gross income in the $100,000 to $200,000 range, the medical- expense deduction was claimed on only 368,385 of those. So the average medical deduction for this income category of $10,515 represents the average claimed on those 368,385 returns.  A: The table comes from RIA, a New York-based tax information and software company, based on new Internal Revenue Service data posted recently on the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov). These are only national averages and are definitely not what the IRS considers to be acceptable amounts for everyone to claim. "Only amounts actually paid for expenses that are deductible may be claimed," says an executive at RIA.
