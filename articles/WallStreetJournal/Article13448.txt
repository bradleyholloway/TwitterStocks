 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Sports -- Golf Journal: The Battle Over a Golf Ball; A patent challenge highlights controversy around Pro V1, Titleist's cash cow   By Newport, John Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2007  I spent a lot of time this week poring over the surprisingly interesting court documents from a lawsuit that Bridgestone Sports brought against Acushnet, the parent of Titleist. Bridgestone contended that some of Titleist's balls, most notably the phenomenally successful Pro V1 models, infringed Bridgestone patents. On Monday, after two years of bickering in a Delaware court, the companies quietly announced that they had reached a settlement.  Of those, two-thirds switched to the Pro V1, in large part because Titleist's marketing strategy, internally dubbed the "pyramid of influence," had long been to pay as many pros as possible to play its products, on the theory that amateurs will follow. And they did. Almost overnight the Pro V1 became golf's "It" ball.  Given that other companies were marketing comparable balls even before the Pro V1 made its debut, it's not surprising that intellectual property disputes would arise. Acushnet, Bridgestone and Callaway all base their claims on patents dating back to the early 1990s or before. Bridgestone, incidentally, is no bit player. Despite having only an 8% share of the U.S. market, its balls are well- regarded by industry insiders and highly popular in its home base of Japan. The company also manufactures Nike's balls, including those that Tiger Woods plays.
