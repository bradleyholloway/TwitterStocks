 Health & Technology: House Panel Grills FDA, Drug Firms; Hearing Centers on Method For Releasing Negative Data On Use of Antidepressants   By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2004  "We had a point of view and the FDA had a different point of view," said Joseph Camardo, a Wyeth senior vice president, who said the company also wanted to add a caution about hostility and suicidal thoughts. The committee also released a document confirming a previously reported incident in which the FDA asked Wyeth to remove a label precaution it added later about Effexor's possible link to hostility and suicidal tendencies in young people. In the letter the agency said the sentence could be "confusing and potentially misleading" when combined with a new FDA-recommended label warning urging doctors to closely watch adult and pediatric patients. The agency had recommended that warning for the labels of all major antidepressants.  Responding to questions, FDA Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the agency "will make every effort to cooperate with the committee." She generally declined to discuss specific details about individual drug labeling and disclosure decisions, which are made within the FDA's drug center. But she said the agency must follow laws that sharply restrict its ability to make public corporate data, particularly about unapproved drug indications. "We want balanced information that reflects what is known scientifically about the drug" on the label, she said. She also said the agency believes "the jury is still out" about the effectiveness of most of the antidepressants in treating depressed young people.
