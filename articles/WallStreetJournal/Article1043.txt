 The Tax Cut Record   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2006  Yes, gas prices are high and interest rates are rising, which helps to explain the anxiety felt by some of the public. But these head winds are all the more reason to be impressed by the economy's ability to push ahead nonetheless. We'd have thought that the Democrats who are now voting to let taxes increase would be thrilled to know that things turned out better than they had feared. Americans are better off despite Democratic predictions that, as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi put it back in 2003, tax cuts would "damage long term economic growth."  Alas, admitting error is not a natural political act, so the tax cut critics are now suggesting all of this growth would have happened anyway. Thus the Washington Post this week quoted Robert Rubin -- the [Bill Clinton] economic guru -- as dismissing the importance of tax cuts because "We had very good markets in the '90s before all these tax cuts went into effect." And it quoted chief Lehman Brothers economist Ethan Harris as saying that the expansion "has nothing to do with tax policy, and more to do with the corporate sector starting to spend some of their record profits."  What these gentlemen want everyone to forget is the unique nature of the 2001-2003 recession and sluggish revival. After the stock-market collapse, 9/11 and Sarbanes-Oxley, American business was shell- shocked. Hiring at the Fortune 500 was nil and corporations were hoarding cash. The 2001 one-time tax "rebate" -- pushed as the economic cure by Mr. Rubin's former partner Jon Corzine in the Senate -- and phased-in income tax cuts had provided only a short-term lift. Only consumer spending, buoyed by easy Federal Reserve policy and a housing boom, prevented a deeper recession.
