 City News -- Urban Gardner: The Perfect Reporter   By Gardner, Ralph, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2011  Sean "Puffy" Combs, Martha Stewart, Sotheby's honcho Alfred Taubman, the fraud case against Anthony Marshall, Brooke Astor's son -- I've always been amazed by the court reporters sitting inconspicuously at the front of the courtroom and calmly recording every last utterance.
