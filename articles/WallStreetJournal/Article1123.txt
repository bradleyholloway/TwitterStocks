 AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers to Team Up on 2 Drugs   By Whalen, Jeanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2007  AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers said their partnership makes sense because AstraZeneca is eager to focus on diseases such as diabetes that are treated by primary-care doctors, while Bristol-Myers is more focused on selling drugs for diseases treated by specialist physicians, such as cancer.  The partners will encounter stiff competition in the diabetes segment. Most large drug companies are pouring money into developing drugs for the growing disease. One of the two drugs AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers will develop is a DPP-4 inhibitor called Saxagliptin. DPP-4 inhibitors prolong the action of hormones in the body called incretins, which decrease blood-sugar levels. If Saxagliptin makes it to market, it will likely be the third such drug for sale, as Merck is already selling a DPP-4 inhibitor called Januvia, and Switzerland's Novartis AG is hoping for regulatory approval soon of a similar drug called Galvus.
