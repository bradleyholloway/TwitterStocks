 Seligman & Latz Inc. Directors to Consider An Offer for the Firm   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1985  Seligman & Latz Inc. said its directors today are expected to consider a proposal to sell the company. Seligman didn't identify the buyer or indicate a price.  The group includes Philadelphia Industries Inc., which owns City Stores Co. Early last year, Seligman & Latz reached a merger agreement under which City Stores would pay about $23 a share for the New York concern. Later, when City Stores reduced its offer to $20 a share, Seligman & Latz spurned the merger, calling the offer inadequate.
