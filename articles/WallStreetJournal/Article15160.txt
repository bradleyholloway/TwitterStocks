 Mobil to Post Charge Totaling $250 Million --- Action for Fourth Quarter Reflects Oil-Price Drop, Effect on Inventories   By By Caleb Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1994  Mobil Corp. said it will report a $250 million charge for the fourth quarter to reflect the decline in value of its petroleum inventories caused by the more-than-25% plunge in 1993 prices.  Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, said the charge is noncash but necessary to meet accounting rules that require the company to value its inventories based on market prices for crude oil and petroleum products on Dec. 31 of each year. In 1993 world crude prices fell by more than $5 a barrel to five-year lows.  "The charge is really a nonevent," said Michael Mayer, an oil analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co. in Burlingame, Calif. Mr. Mayer said that despite the plunge in crude prices he still recommends the purchase of Mobil stock, because he believes the company will record strong earnings from its gasoline-refining and marketing business and natural-gas operations. He also said there's a "50-50 chance" the company will raise its dividend later this year.
