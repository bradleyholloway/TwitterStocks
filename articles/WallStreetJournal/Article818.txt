 UAW Strikes Part Of GM Facility Over Subcontracts   By By John Bussey, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1986  WARREN, Mich. -- The United Auto Workers union local here struck part of a General Motors Corp. facility, claiming that the auto maker has subcontracted work to non-UAW workers.  While the number of strikers, 450, is relatively small, the job action again demonstrates the union's strong feelings on the issue of subcontracting and so-called outsourcing, in which work is shifted away from UAW-organized plants to lower-cost producers. Both topics will clearly be on the UAW's agenda as it goes into national contract talks with GM and Ford Motor Co. next year.
