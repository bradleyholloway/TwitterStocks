 The Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait: Kuwait's Big Foreign Assets Likely to Elude Iraq's Grasp   By By Barbara Toman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1990  THE KUWAIT INVESTMENT OFFICE sold its 5.8% stake in Knogo Corp. in August 1989, according to Knogo officials. In Friday's edition, it was reported that the Kuwaiti office owned the stake as of February 1989, according to reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a passive investor, the Kuwaiti office is only required to file notification of the sale to the SEC annually.  Over the past 30 years, tiny Kuwait has poured its oil wealth into an investment portfolio spread around the world. Yesterday, the U.S., Britain and France froze Kuwaiti assets in their respective countries to prevent their seizure by Iraq. And Switzerland moved in that direction by ordering Swiss banks to reject any withdrawals of Kuwaiti assets that seem suspicious.  The office's most visible investment was the BP stake, amassed in late 1987 and early 1988. The Kuwaitis snapped up shares in Britain's biggest company after the U.K. government's disastrous public offering of its 31.7% BP stake in late 1987. Although the Kuwaiti office initially insisted it was a long-term investor in BP, British officials fretted that the oil-rich Arab country eventually might try to control the U.K.'s main oil producer.
