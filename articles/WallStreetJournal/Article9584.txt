 Leading the News: Ford Says Its Results in Europe Will Improve for Second Half   By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2003  Ford's business deteriorated in all its major markets in the second quarter. But the Ford of Europe division fared especially poorly, as consumer discounts failed to overcome the weak sales environment. "I expect significantly better results in the second half in Europe," Mr. [Nick Scheele] said in remarks to reporters at an industry conference here in northwest Michigan. Mr. Scheele didn't say whether Ford of Europe will return to profitability during the second half.  Ford's troubles in Europe this year have taken on a larger significance because the turnaround strategy Mr. Scheele put in place in Europe when he was running that unit in the late 1990s has been used as a template for the company's more recent effort to rebuild profitability in North America. In the second quarter, Ford of Europe's pretax loss widened to $525 million from $18 million a year earlier. Ford Vice Chairman Allan Gilmour called the European results "unsatisfactory."
