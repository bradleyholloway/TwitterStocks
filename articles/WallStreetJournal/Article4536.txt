 Permanent Ban Set On Semiautomatic Rifle Imports   By By Paul M. Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1989  The Bush administration permanently banned the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles.  The action, which outraged pro-gun groups, made permanent a temporary suspension of assault-rifle imports announced in March. The ban came in response to "the dramatic increase in the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime," said Stephen Higgins, director of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  The ban doesn't, however, affect domestically produced assault weapons, which make up 75% of the total number of such guns owned in this country. Congress is currently considering legislation that would ban domestically produced semiautomatic assault weapons, as well.
