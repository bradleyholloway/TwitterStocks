 Unions and Chamber of Commerce Join To Ease the Way for VoiceStream Deal   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2000  SEN. ERNEST F. HOLLINGS of South Carolina is a Democrat. His party affiliation was misstated as Republican in an article yesterday about unions joining with the Chamber of Commerce to ease the way for Deutsche Telekom AG's acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Corp. (WSJ Oct. 6, 2000)  Communication Workers of America President Morton Bahr, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue have scheduled a news conference to urge lawmakers to sweep away the biggest cloud hanging over the $50 billion deal: a measure on Capitol Hill that would make it harder for companies owned partly by foreign governments to acquire U.S. telecommunications companies.  "Deutsche Telekom owning VoiceStream would allow the company to grow and create new jobs in this country, and it could teach U.S. telecommunications companies a lesson about how to treat their workers and how to treat their unions," the CWA's Mr. Bahr said.
