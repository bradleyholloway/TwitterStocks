 The Buzz: Goldman Transfer Adds to Evidence Street Is Losing Ground to London   By Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2007  At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein is sending a top lieutenant, Administrative Chief Edward Forst, to London next month. Mr. Forst will retain his title but will be based in London to oversee Goldman's business in the U.S., Europe and Asia, according to a Goldman memo issued late last month. Mr. Forst has been chief administrative officer since 2004.  A Goldman spokesman said Mr. Forst wasn't available for comment. He added that while Mr. Forst will retain his management responsibilities in the U.S., he won't sit on the firm's London-based management committee, which is responsible for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
