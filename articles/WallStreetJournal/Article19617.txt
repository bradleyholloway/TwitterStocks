 U.S. Considers Revised Proposal For Code-Sharing by 3 Carriers   By By Stephen Power and Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2003  A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the airlines held discussions with the DOT for several weeks before submitting the new proposal. "We gained better insight regarding the DOT's concerns through our discussions with the Department," said Tom Donahue, a Delta spokesman.  With Northwest, Delta and Continental controlling 35% of the domestic air travel market, the proposed alliance would be the largest ever. Code-share agreements allow airlines to extend their reach without additional planes and crews by placing their own flight codes and selling tickets on each other's flights. The agreement between Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, Northwest (No. 4) and Continental (No. 5) would also allow passengers to earn and use frequent-flier miles on each of the three airlines' flights and use their airport lounges.
