 PURSUITS; Picks -- Hit List / Iman: The supermodel on the music she loves to hear at runway shows   By Dodes, Rachel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  The first single from Mr. [Justin Timberlake]'s new album, "FutureSex/LoveSounds," has played everywhere from Michael Kors's show in New York to Dolce & Gabbana's in Milan in recent weeks. "I just love this song," says [IMAN].  Hip-hop star Ludacris has dabbled in fashion, designing a sneaker for Puma and backing his own clothing line. Iman thinks the first single off his coming album, "Release Therapy," is an ideal runway song. "It's a good beat; you can really move to it."
