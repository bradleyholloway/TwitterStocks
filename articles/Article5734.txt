 Indian Woman, After Years of Struggle, Brings Suit to Trial Charging U.S. Mishandled Funds   By By Anne Fawcett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 9, 1999  Growing up on the Blackfeet Indian reservation in Montana, Elouise Cobell often heard her grandparents complain that the Bureau of Indian Affairs owed them money. Later, fresh out of college and treasurer of the Blackfeet Nation, Mrs. Cobell noticed the mishandling of records and funds herself.  Did it ever. Last month, Federal Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington ordered a trial on the class-action suit. The suit charges the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs with depriving about 300,000 Indians of billions of dollars that had accumulated in trust accounts created to compensate them for use of their land and to pass along royalties from the sale of natural resources. PricewaterhouseCoopers cannot find documentation to support $10 billion of transactions. Some documents were stored in old sheds or thrown away by bureau employees.  Mrs. Cobell advocates starting an entirely new agency that would manage Indians' money using trust-law principles. Whatever the decision, the case has gone further than she ever imagined. "If you asked me today if I ever thought I'd be fighting the biggest issue in Indian country right now, I'd say no," she says. "Would I be in court? No. Would I ever take on the U.S. government? No."
