 Bookshelf: Doing the Book Tour and the Movie Deal   By By Joseph Nocera, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1988  Is this what it's come to? A new writers' manual arrives. You pick it up expecting to find it full of the usual advice given to novice writers -- advice on language and plot and character and so on. And, indeed, you do find such advice. But you also find it packed with other wisdom as well -- wisdom on those things that have become oh-so-crucial to the success of the modern American novelist.  Its author is Rita Mae Brown, and though you wouldn't know it from this book (which is surely the most sloppily written writers' manual ever slapped between covers), she clearly has the gift. Ever since the publication of her first novel, "Rubyfruit Jungle," in 1973, she has shown herself to be a smart and funny novelist who gets better every time out. Still, pop culture being what it is, chances are that most people know of her not as a novelist but as Martina Navratilova's spurned lover.  I mention this mainly because Ms. Brown alludes to it herself ("I lost the love of my life, who unfortunately went to the press about it.") in an opening chapter that quickly makes plain just how odd this manual is going to be. In it, she describes her own life and career -- the books written, the money lost, the cats loved -- while at the same time disowning the label "writers' manual" (her publisher made her do it, she explains).
