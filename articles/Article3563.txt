 Getting Going: Family Finance: It's All Relative   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  We worry that our parents will outlive their retirement savings. We're comforted by the thought that family members would probably bail us out if we got into money trouble. We strive to help our kids financially and we'd like to bequeath them at least part of our nest egg.  That's trickier than it seems. Children grow up spending their parents' money, so it is almost inevitable that they will have a skewed financial outlook. After all, for kids, all purchases are free, so why should they fret about the price tag or keep a lid on their desires?  My advice: Make your kids feel like they are spending their own money. Give them a candy allowance when they are younger and a clothing allowance when they are teenagers, and insist they live within this budget. That way, instead of you constantly saying "no" to your children, your kids will learn to say "no" to themselves.
