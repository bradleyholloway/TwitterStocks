 Kroger Moves Into Sights Of Private-Equity Shops   By Berman, Dennis K, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2007  The conditions of the current buyout market aren't that dissimilar to the 1980s. Big buyout shops such as KKR, Blackstone Group and TPG, formerly Texas Pacific Group, have amassed huge war chests and have to put that money to work. A company like Kroger would allow them to spend a big chunk of money in one place.  Supervalu Inc., parent company of Save-A-Lot stores, last June bought most of Albertson's Inc.'s grocery stores in a $9.7 billion deal, making Supervalu the nation's No. 2 grocery chain by revenue, behind Kroger Co.  In that deal, Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Supervalu got more than 1,100 stores that operate under different names, including Albertson's, across the country, while CVS Corp., as a part of a consortium of investors, got about 700 free-standing drugstores that operate under the Sav-On and Osco names. Calls to Kroger weren't returned last evening.
