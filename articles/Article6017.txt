 Hard Drive: Negotiating All Night, Tenacious Microsoft Won Many Loopholes --- Judge Urged Antitrust Truce After the Terror Attacks; Professor Steered Talks --- Exemptions `at Every Turn'   By By John Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 2001  The settlement gives personal-computer makers greater freedom to install non-Microsoft software on new machines and to remove access to competing Microsoft features, such as Internet browsers. It also bans retaliation against companies that take advantage of these freedoms, prohibits exclusive contracts and requires Microsoft to disclose design information to hardware and software makers so they can build competing products that run smoothly with Windows.  This time around, the government wanted Microsoft to let personal-computer makers choose more easily among competing software that works with Windows, such as media players, instant-messaging programs and Internet software. The appeals court had found that Microsoft used its monopoly -- Windows runs more than 90% of PCs -- to coerce PC makers to use Microsoft's own versions of such software for the Internet and other purposes, instead of accommodating programs sold by rivals.  Microsoft wanted any settlement to allow it to pursue its longtime strategy of building new features into Windows -- what the company calls its "freedom to innovate." Microsoft says weaving these features into the Windows system benefits customers. But the Microsoft strategy also has meant that companies selling their own innovations, such as instant-messaging software, were often thwarted. That's because so many PC makers preferred to take the Windows package, as is, and install it on their machines.
