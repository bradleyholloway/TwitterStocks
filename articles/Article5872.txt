 Letters to the Editor: Roller Bags and Steamer Trunks   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2000  Here are a few helpful hints that actually work. Pack light. Wear your suit on the plane. Hang up your stuff as soon as you get there. Hang it in the bathroom while you shower. Hotel rooms often come with irons, which, when properly used, eliminate wrinkles better than any bag. And, if something is too heavy to carry but has to go there, FedEx it to your hotel the day before. Save the steamer trunk for your next trip on the Titanic.
