 On Sports: Aussie Rules: Cash Carries Day   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  London -- One school of thought holds that Ivan Lendl is emotionless on the tennis court, but that is not true. The Czech-born Connecticut squire showed quite a bit of emotion here Sunday in his loss to Pat Cash in the Wimbledon men's singles final. At one point he flung his racket to the turf, and at another he similarly abused his towel.  Neither of those actions had the slightest effect on Cash, of course, which is why Lendl usually refrains from such antics. The 22-year-old Australian bent, folded and mutilated poor Ivan in three sets -- 7-6, 6-2 and 7-5 -- to become the first Aussie champion at Wimbledon since John Newcombe in 1971. As about 10,000 of the Centre Court crowd of 12,500 said as soon as the last point was played, it just goes to show that Cash is better than a Czech.  Cash's definite superiority to Lendl showed up most clearly in the second set. He surrendered nary a point to the world's No. 1-ranked player in his four service games, something no one could recall ever happening in a Wimbledon final. Cash won nine of his 16 service games Sunday at love, and gave up a single point in just four others. He lost just 15 service points in all, two on double faults. Lendl broke his service but once, in the third set.
