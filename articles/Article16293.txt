 Digits   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2003  Calling herself the "[Martha Stewart] of the digital kind," Ms. [Tami D. Peterson] hopes to become a fixture in Michaels craft stores this summer with a new book: "Digital Decorating" (Martingale & Co.). Ms. Peterson hopes her book will be a category buster that offers a new market for computer and printer makers looking for new revenue streams. A former Microsoft Corp. employee who worked on the marketing rollout of Excel and Word in the late '80s, Ms. Peterson says she conceived the idea after seeing people buying scanners and using them only to e-mail pictures of their grandchildren.  The 660-member firm is hiring 19 attorneys who formerly were with the Hong-Kong based firm of Siao Wen & Leung, with expertise in corporate securities, commercial and China practice. Critical among them: Carson Wen, a well-connected Hong Kong attorney who also is a second-term deputy to the National People's Congress of China. The group has an active initial public offering practice in Hong Kong, having completed 19 IPOs during the past 2 1/2 years, Heller says. The group also reports it has 25 offerings pending in a wide range of industries including software, consumer electronics, bioengineering and pharmaceuticals.  Heller Chairman Barry S. Levin says, "Our sense is that for many years people were populating Hong Kong with U.S. lawyers." A better way to tap into the "vibrant economy," he says, "is by adding local lawyers to an international firm who are fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin." Four of the Hong Kong firms' lawyers, including Mr. Wen, are licensed to practice in the People's Republic of China.
