 SEC Staff to Urge End of Big Board Ban Against After-Hours Domestic Trading   By By Bruce Ingersoll, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1986  The Securities and Exchange Commission staff plans to recommend an end to the New York Stock Exchange's restrictions on after-hours domestic trading in stocks listed on the Big Board.  SEC officials expressed concern that the exchange's rule is driving trading volume to London and other foreign markets and is distorting the development of global, 24-hour trading. The rule, known as Rule 390, with very limited exceptions bars member firms from off-exchange trading during the exchange's regular hours and from any domestic after-hours trading.  The SEC staff expects to submit its proposal to the five-member commission by the end of this month, according to Michael Simon, an assistant director of market regulation. The staff's plan was first reported Monday by Securities Week, a trade publication.
