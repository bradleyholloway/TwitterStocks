 For Expedia, Acquisition Talk Keeps Stock on Journey South   By By Robin Sidel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2002  Expedia shares have tumbled more than 30% since USA Interactive, which already owns 55% of the company on a fully diluted basis, in early June made an unsolicited offer to buy the rest. Three days after making the bid, USA Interactive put the offer on hold, much to the relief of Expedia shareholders who were disappointed that the $77-a-share stock bid represented a slim 7.5% premium to Expedia's stock price at the time.  USA Interactive, which is led by media veteran Barry Diller, has made it clear that it still wants to buy Expedia and two other majority-controlled subsidiaries. And while the prospect of a looming acquisition often drives a stock higher, Mr. Diller's reputation for driving a hard bargain is affecting Expedia's stock price. USA acquired the controlling stake in Expedia from Microsoft in February.  "If [Expedia] investors wanted USA Interactive stock, they would have bought USA Interactive stock. They liked the concept that Expedia is a stand-alone entity," says Bailey Dalton, a vice president who follows Internet travel companies at boutique investment bank C.E. Unterberg, Towbin. She recently downgraded Expedia from short-term "buy" to "market perform" and considers the company to be "inextricably linked" to USA Interactive.
