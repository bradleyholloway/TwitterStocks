 Officials Suspect Poehl Secretary Of Impropriety --- Investigators Say Evidence Indicates That She Sold Information to a Trader   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1987  FRANKFURT, West Germany -- State prosecutors said a secretary to Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is suspected of having furnished privileged information to a currency trader who is being sought in connection with the fraud that caused foreign-exchange losses last year at Volkswagen AG.  A Bundesbank spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the central bank or Mr. Poehl on the investigation of the secretary. Prosecutors don't believe that Mr. Poehl or any other Bundesbank employees were involved. But the incident is an embarrassment for Mr. Poehl, whose appointment to a second eight-year term as Bundesbank president has yet to be officially confirmed by the West German president, Richard von Weizsaecker.
