 Installment Sales and Trusts Play Well Together   By Smith, Ray A, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2004  Sell Now, Pay Taxes Later  -- Investors can sell properties and defer and reduce taxes -- their own and those of the family members they transfer property to -- by combining private annuity trusts with installment sales. Here's an example of such a combination.  -- Tom Smith owns a small shopping center valued at $1 million and wants to sell it.  -- Mr. Smith agrees to provide the buyer with seller financing but wants the buyer to put 30% down, or $300,000. Mr. Smith would lend the buyer the $700,000 balance.  -- If Mr. Smith uses an installment sale, federal and state capital-gains taxes will be due on the down payment. There is also the risk the buyer could pay off the note earlier than planned, meaning Mr. Smith would be hit with an immediate capitalgains tax bill.  -- Instead, Mr. Smith chooses to establish a private annuity trust, with his daughter as the trustee, and transfers the property to the trust. The trust then sells the property to the buyer, with the buyer making the $300,000 down payment and the trust lending the buyer $700,000 on installment-sale terms.  -- The trust realizes no gain on the sale -- meaning no capital-gains taxes are due -- because what it paid for the property, the value of the annuity contract, and what it sold it for are the same.  -- Mr. Smith's capital-gains taxes are deferred until he starts receiving annuity payments.  -- This combination of the private annuity trust and installment sale defers the capital-gains tax that would have been due immediately for the down payment.
