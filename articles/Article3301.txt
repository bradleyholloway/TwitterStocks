 Russian Entrepreneurs Fret Over Putin --- Some Fear Election Victory Will Mean Stiffer Rules Likely to Choke Growth   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2000  As many foreign investors and Russian business tycoons swoon over Vladimir Putin, a small but significant constituency of entrepreneurs -- who some say hold the key to the country's economic future -- fear his near-certain victory in a presidential election next Sunday may tighten a bureaucratic noose that is strangling free enterprise in Russia.  Mr. Putin, a former KGB spy, has impressed multinational companies by pledging to improve Russia's investment climate, simplify the tax system and strengthen the rule of law. But many of Russia's young entrepreneurs fear he will merely entrench the interests of big business and squeeze out small, struggling companies like theirs.  Russia's business magnates, who built up their oil and industrial empires mostly thanks to favors from the state, endorse Mr. Putin, despite the absence of a clear economic program. Many foreign investors also believe Mr. Putin will be good for business: The Russian stock market, buoyed by foreign buyers, has risen to a 22-month high.
