 Letters to the Editor: Insurance Is the Cause of the Crisis   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1994  By terminating medical insurance payment for medical care, the federal legislation Mr. Kristol proposes to fix the several problems he discerns in American health care become unnecessary, including making insurance portable from job to job, ending limits on pre-existing conditions, simplifying health-care paperwork, etc.  The present system is akin to insuring the patient's oil changes, when it should be limited to helping him pay for a major car accident. To that end, super-catastrophic medical insurance purchased by the individual, and not by the employer, is the only kind that should be in place, as suggested by Milton Friedman; absence of insurance deep-pockets would make it necessary for doctors and hospitals to lower fees again to levels people could afford, and would have the secondary benefit of restoring the physician's professional image. A Medical Savings Account, tax-deductible for the individual (which is not presently the case), and which would accumulate if not spent and rolled into the patient's retirement plan, would encourage the patient's close monitoring of cost, and would represent true "managed care," lowering expenses drastically.
