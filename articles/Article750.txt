 Judge's Remarks on Pennzoil Suit Boost Texaco; Effect on Appeal Seen Minimal   By This article was prepared by Matt Moffett And Thomas Petzinger Jr. in Houston And Allanna Sullivan in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1986  Off-the-cuff remarks by a Texas trial judge heartened Texaco Inc. and put Pennzoil Co. on the defensive during a lull in the companies' $11.1 billion legal drama.  At issue are remarks made by Texas Judge Solomon Casseb Jr. on April 2 before a Los Angeles County Bar Association group. In a rambling response to a question, Judge Casseb recalled that White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco and Houston-based Pennzoil had agreed to apply New York contract law in the case, which involved whether Texaco interfered with Pennzoil's agreement to merge with Getty Oil Co. in 1984. The critical issue in the appeals, the judge went on to suggest, will involve whether he properly applied New York law.  The remarks didn't receive widespread attention until an aggressive Texaco public relations consultant provided a recording of the comments to the Houston Chronicle, which printed its account Friday. The newspaper noted that Judge Casseb also expressed confidence that the verdict would be upheld. Nevertheless, after publication of the remarks Pennzoil's stock price fell $4.375 to close at $51.125 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday. Also in Big Board trading Friday, Texaco closed at $32.625 a share, up $1.75.
