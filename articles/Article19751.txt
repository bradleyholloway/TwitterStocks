 The Pensions of Your Past   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2004  The key word, Mr. [William Arnone] notes, is "first" -- when you "first" file for Social Security benefits. Let's say you file at age 66, at which point you learn about a pension or pensions that you would have been eligible to tap at age 55. In other words, Mr. Arnone explains, you would have lost the opportunity to collect, and perhaps invest, 11 years' worth of retirement savings. "It could be a missing source of income," Mr. Arnone says. "And every little bit helps, especially for boomers, who aren't doing a very good job of planning for retirement."  A few wrinkles: Deferred vested pensions stem only from traditional "defined-benefit" retirement plans, not "defined-contribution" plans like 401(k)s. Second, you had to stay at your old job long enough to qualify for the firm's retirement plan -- hence, the word "vested." Finally, the pension itself probably was frozen at the point when you left the company; it hasn't been growing in value. So, while found money is always a treat, don't expect millions.
