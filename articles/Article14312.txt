 Hong Kong's Governor Dies On Peking Trip --- News Sends Stock Market Into Plunge and Renews Fears of 1997 Transition   By By Jesse Wong, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1986  The cause of death wasn't given, but according to United Press International, government sources said it likely was a heart attack or stroke. Sir Edward had been governor of Hong Kong since 1982. Sir Edward was in the Chinese capital to open the Peking office of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council when he died.  News of the governor's death sent the Hong Kong stock market plunging in the initial hour of trading Friday. Stockbrokers and other financial analysts in Hong Kong said Sir Edward's death renewed local concerns about the planned transition of the British colony to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.  Shortly after news of Sir Edward's death reached the stock market, Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., one of two note-issuing banks in the colony and the main executor of monetary policy, offered overnight rates as high as 3% to stem any sudden depreciation in the Hong Kong dollar.
