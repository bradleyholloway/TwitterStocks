 China Mobile Write-Off Strategy Should Please Shareholders in the End   By By Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  To help finance acquisition of the seven networks, China Mobile plans to raise $6.58 billion through a global share offer, along with a $600 million bond offer -- to which Standard & Poor's Corp. assigned a triple-B credit rating yesterday. China Mobile also plans to make further acquisitions -- potentially even larger than this one -- which will also be funded through equity offers. Moreover, its fixed-line sibling, China Telecom, plans to list soon.  China Mobile's new acquisitions include some of China's wealthiest mobile owners in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as in the four provinces of Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei and Guanxi. They also bring the total number of subscribers to nearly 40 million, a 64% increase, according to estimates from Nomura International (Hong Kong) Ltd. That figure is far ahead of rival China Unicom Ltd., which listed in June.
