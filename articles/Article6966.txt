 Technology (A Special Report); 10 Questions To Ask When Picking a Cellphone Provider   By Jesse Drucker and Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  There are caveats. That Verizon Wireless plan, for example, includes free calling to other Verizon Wireless subscribers; the T- Mobile plan doesn't have a similar provision. Plus, Nextel's higher rates may be worth it if you plan to use its Direct Connect feature a lot: The carrier offers customers unlimited minutes for this walkie- talkie-like connection to other subscribers. For example, while a $79.99 per month plan from Nextel will only get you 800 prime-time minutes -- compared with 1,500 from T-Mobile -- the Nextel plan includes unlimited walkie-talkie time. It also includes free incoming calls.  Other options include a Siemens AG phone from Cingular, and T- Mobile's Sidekick, which has a little screen that flips up over the keyboard, making it look like a miniature computer. The Sidekick isn't intended for corporate use; instead, it gives users a new email account to use with the gadget. This option might be best if you're self-employed -- and thus don't have a corporate email account -- or if you rely on text messaging or instant messaging more than email.  The most frequent irritant is a long and confusing monthly bill that can be as much as 33% higher than the price of the plan. Blame a baffling list of taxes and add-on fees. Some of the fees, such as Cingular's "regulatory cost recovery fee" or Verizon Wireless's "federal universal service charge," sound like they might be taxes required by the government, but are actually fees the carriers impose on their own.
