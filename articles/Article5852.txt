 Review / Books: You're Fabulous! -- No, You're Fabulous! The Art of Sucking Up --- As `You're Too Kind' Proves, Flattery Will Now Get You Everywhere; Eddie Haskell in the Oval Office   By By Emily Prager, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  Richard Stengel, a former senior editor at Time magazine, addresses this change in the way we flatter in his thought-provoking new book, "(You're Too Kind) A Brief History of Flattery." In this loosely constructed study of the apple-polisher and the brown-nose, Mr. Stengel defines flattery as "strategic praise" and then goes about showing us how it has taken over in our modern society and become our main currency of interaction.  Chimps aside, Mr. Stengel uses God, the ancient Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans, the Troubadours and the Renaissance courtiers to construct a pop buttress for his rather slim argument that "once social mobility became good, flattery lost much of its sinful character," and that flattery is more pervasive now than ever before because we've become a society based on personality worship.  The ancient Egyptians, arguably founders of the cult of personality, didn't really have flattery because in their culture "there was no such thing as false or undeserved praise . . . . The Egyptians didn't feel they were telling untruths," Mr. Stengel writes. This statement would seem to indicate that in additon to "strategic praise," flattery is also "undeserved praise." Indeed, one of the odder things about the book is its legion of definitions of flattery, which makes reading confusing and tiring and not so much fun.
