 Y2K: A Smooth Start -- Federal Officials Expect Few Glitches to Emerge Today --- By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Simons in Washington, Daniel Golden in Boston and Allanna Sullivan in New York   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  Federal officials from the White House's Information Coordination Center, who spent the weekend watching developments around the world, are confident there will be few problems associated with the Y2K computer glitch as businesses and financial markets open across the country today. John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, predicts that today will be "business as usual for the United States."  The year 2000 computer glitch stems from the inability of some computers to distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900. Washington spent $8.4 billion fixing possible glitches in government computer systems. Federal officials say state governments and U.S. corporations paid out approximately $91 billion doing the same thing, although some estimates say the tab is much higher.  Mr. Koskinen's 400-member team spent the last four days gathering information on computer problems from foreign nations, U.S. industries and state and local governments. By late Saturday afternoon, the ICC had compiled a list of 31 mishaps that occurred across the country. Only 13 of the 31 occurrences were definitely related to the Y2K bug, officials said. Seven nuclear power plants, for instance, reported on Saturday that they experienced minor problems with computer systems used to monitor operating data and calculate meteorological data. None of those systems, ICC officials said, had an effect on the safe operations of the power plants.
