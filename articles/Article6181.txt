 Aegon Looks to U.S. More Than Europe For Acquisitions   By By Vanessa Fuhrmans, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1999  Fresh from wrapping up an agreement to buy San Francisco-based Transamerica Corp. for $9.7 billion (the deal should be completed later this year), Aegon won't pause to snap up another life insurer or asset-management company if the right opportunity comes along, Henk van Wijk said in an interview. But if recent history is any indication, the U.S. could be first to provide the next potential purchase.  Aegon has been quick to spot the advantages on the other side of the Atlantic. With a single market of 260 million peoplemany of them aging and affluent baby boomers -- relatively cheap insurance stocks and a fragmented market, the U.S. is the closest thing to a life insurer's dream. Aegon's largest acquisitions in recent years have been its planned takeover of Transamerica and its 1997 $2.6 billion purchase of Providian Corp., Louisville, Ky. The Transamerica deal, when completed and combined with the Providian purchase, will catapult Aegon to third place in terms of assets among U.S. life insurers.
