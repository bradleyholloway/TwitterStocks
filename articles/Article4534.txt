 Jobs Data Show Economy Clearly Slowing --- Recession Doesn't Appear Close; Unemployment Climbed to 5.3% in June   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1989  The economy, dragged down by weakness in the manufacturing sector, is clearly slowing, but it doesn't appear to be in imminent danger of recession, the government's latest unemployment report suggests.  The economy continues to generate new jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday. Last month, employers outside of the agricultural sector added 180,000 new workers to their payrolls. The department also more than doubled its calculation of job growth in May, to a sturdy 207,000, from the 101,000 figure it reported initially.  But the recent employment gains are still well below last year's average, and nearly all the new jobs came in the service sector. Manufacturing employment declined for the third straight month, and both factory wages and the average number of hours worked fell. Overall, the nation's civilian unemployment rate crept up to 5.3% in June as nearly a half-million people entered the work force. The jobless rate was 5.2% in May and 5.0% in April.
