 Disney Chairman Mitchell Says Ovitz Exit Served Shareholders   By Bray, Chad, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2004  Mr. [George J. Mitchell], a former U.S. senator from Maine, said Mr. [Michael Ovitz] would have received the same amount of money and options from the company that he received as severance if he was terminated or if he served out the remainder of his five-year contract. However, Mr. Ovitz's relationship with Chief Executive Michael Eisner and other Disney executives had deteriorated to such a point that it no longer made sense for him to stay at the entertainment company, Mr. Mitchell said.
