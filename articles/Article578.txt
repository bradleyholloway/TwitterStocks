To the Editor:  As one of the attorneys for a Brink's robbery defendant, I was appalled, if not wholly surprised, at the remarks about the case volunteered by F.B.I. Deputy Assistant Director Kenneth P. Walton (news story July 16). The public pretrial disclosure by a law enforcement officer of allegedly incriminating evidence is violative of both the letter and the spirit of the law.  Recently, the courts have adopted extreme measures to prevent such disclosures, even resorting to closing to the public and to the press pretrial proceedings that involve motions to suppress certain evidence.  The reason for such drastic action is clear: the evidence may prove to be inadmissible for a variety of constitutional reasons, yet prospective jurors would have been unforgettably exposed to it.  Mr. Walton's purpose was obvious - to prejudice both the state and Federal Brink's defense. He and other interested officials have done everything in their power to prevent even the semblance of a fair trial.  Some of the suspects have been imprisoned under conditions so medieval that one Federal judge called them ''shameful.'' One suspect was spirited from his place of confinement and held incommunicado by Federal agents, who attempted to terrorize him into becoming a prosecution witness; another was arrested and imprisoned for a considerable period of time even though there was easily available proof of her innocence.  These ''dirty tricks'' are illustrative of the lengths to which the authorities are prepared to go in order to convict some defendants. The moment an organized society countenances such tactics, it sows the seeds of its own destruction. If, because of their politics, or the nature of the crimes charged to them, or both, some defendants are to be treated differently from others, the concept of equal justice under law, the keystone of our constitutional arch, is seriously jeopardized.
