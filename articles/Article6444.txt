 ECB Cuts Key Interest Rates by Quarter Point --- Spate of Sluggish Data Force Europe's Hand, but Bank Plans No Further Easing   By By G. Thomas Sims, The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 2001  The ECB justified the decision, made at a regular policy meeting, by pointing to lower inflation pressures as growth slows, wages remain stable and recent spikes in inflation are deemed temporary. Other triggers for the move included falling industrial confidence and the recent discovery of distortions in data on money-supply growth, which the ECB watches as an indicator of inflation.  Some said the abrupt shift in the ECB's stance created more uncertainty. "It isn't that weak European economic data didn't justify a rate cut, but the fact that the ECB recently put forth a forceful and consistent set of policy rules that wouldn't justify a rate cut," said Robert Sinche, head currency strategist at Citibank. "This rate reduction will create new uncertainties about the conduct of pan-European monetary policy, which will likely give the ECB a less positive reaction than they expected from this rate cut."  Mr. [Wim Duisenberg] said the ECB remains convinced that the global slowdown will have "only a limited impact" on the 12 euro-zone countries for which the ECB sets rates. The ECB expects euro-zone growth this year of about 2.5%, down from 3.4% last year.
