 Thinking About Hong Kong Stocks? Not So Fast   By By Philip Segal, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2002  Sitting on huge profits from its stock-market intervention in 1998, the Hong Kong government this week began its final sale of shares under the so-called tap mechanism, unloading about six billion Hong Kong dollars (US$769 million) in stock to institutional investors.  On its database of funds available to Hong Kong investors, Standard & Poor's lists 18 Hong Kong stock funds that have been around for the past three years. Most outperformed the Hang Seng, while the perennially solid Value Partners "A" Fund, which shuns index stocks, rose 94% during that time. It is a similar story for the five years through Sept. 20: nine of 16 Hong Kong equity mutual funds beat the Hang Seng's 38% decline.  Given a benchmark of 5% in Hong Kong equities, there always is the chance the government could sell more stock if the rest of its investments underperform Hong Kong stocks and it finds itself overweight the market. Of course, there also is the chance the government could come back into the market and buy if it ever decided to raise its benchmark.
