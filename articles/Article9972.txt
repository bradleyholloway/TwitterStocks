 GM, Micron Drop, Sovereign Up 12%; As Blue Chips Pull Back, DuPont, CBOT Keep Going; Boeing Jumps 6% on Week   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  GM, whose stock has risen 60% this year on salvation hopes, suffered a setback and fell $2.08, or 6.3%, to $31.05. Jerome York, an ally of influential investor Kirk Kerkorian, abruptly resigned as a director of the auto maker, in an attack against management. The resignation followed Wednesday's decision by GM to break off talks about an alliance with Nissan Motor and Renault, which had been suggested by Messrs. Kerkorian and York to boost GM's performance and stock value.  Micron Technology plunged 2.40, or 14%, to 15.14, by far the most severe percentage decliner on the New York Stock Exchange. The memory- chip maker's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue missed analysts' expectations.  Sovereign Bancorp gained 2.50, or 12%, to 24.10, the NYSE's biggest percentage advancer. A boardroom battle looms that could lead to the dismissal of Chairman and Chief Executive Jay Sidhu and a potential fracas for Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano SA, which is the Philadelphia institution's largest shareholder, holding a roughly 25% stake.
