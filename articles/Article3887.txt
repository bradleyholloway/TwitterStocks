 Taxpayers: It Might Be Time to Itemize   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2005  Taxpayers don't always know what they can deduct and many don't want to bother keeping accurate records, says Ernst & Young's Mr. [Martin Nissenbaum]. "If you wait until the very last minute, you're not going to have the time to put all the information together that you need to itemize," he says. "A number [of taxpayers] just don't want to deal with it."  First-time home buyers could miss out on big deductions. For instance, a couple who took out a $200,000 mortgage might pay 6% interest -- around $1,000 the first month of the loan. The interest becomes a smaller part of the mortgage payments over time. This means people who don't itemize in the first years after a home purchase probably are missing one of the biggest benefits from itemizing, says Roger Harris, president of Padgett Business Services Inc. in Athens, Ga. He adds: "I can see how young people, especially those who do their own taxes," neglect to itemize even when they should.  To be sure, millions of upper-income taxpayers who itemize don't get the full benefit of all those deductions. That's because of a tricky tax-law provision that imposes limits on itemized deductions for people whose incomes exceed a certain level. Under this provision, most people begin to lose some itemized deductions once their adjusted gross income exceeds $142,700 for 2004. (It's half that amount -- $71,350 -- if you're married and filing separately.)
