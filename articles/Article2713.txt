 Overseas, Otis and Its Parent Get In on the Ground Floor --- UTC Strategy of Early Alliances in New Markets Is Tested in Russia, China   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters Lawrence Ingrassia in London, Amal Kumar Naj in New York And Claudia Rosett in Moscow, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1995  An expensive new factory operating at a meager 8% of capacity might unnerve many executives, but not the folks at UTC and Otis. "We'll be there [in Russia] forever," explains Bruno Grob, head of Otis's operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. "Do we suffer today? We suffer a lot. But one day it will pay. Whether it's five or 10 or 15 years, I don't know, but it will." Better to be criticized for not making money in Russia today, adds his boss, Otis President Jean-Pierre van Rooy, than be criticized in the year 2010 for having been too cautious.  Nowadays, every big company talks about being global. Otis and increasingly UTC's other main businesses -- Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Carrier air conditioners, Sikorsky helicopters and UT Automotive parts -- live it. "My management philosophy was put in my brain during those early years at Otis," says George David, who proved his mettle at Otis, where in 1975 he began his career with UTC. He ultimately became chairman of Otis, a title he retained after also becoming chief executive of UTC last April.  Given UTC's reputation as a so-so performer in markets that offer limited growth, analysts say the company's other operations would do well to learn from Otis. "Otis is one of the best international franchises you can find; it has a terrific brand name," says Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co. "To some degree it's a model for other UTC businesses."
