 Protect the Overprivileged   By By Lowell Ponte, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1997  At a White House conference on Monday, President Clinton called for expanding federal hate crime statutes. At present hate crimes include those committed against people because of their race, color, religion and national origin. The president wants to include homosexuals, the handicapped and women. "We should make our current laws tougher to include all hate crimes that cause physical harm," he said.  Conservatives should applaud President Clinton and demand that his call to banish all hate be put into law. Including, of course, a category that Mr. Clinton omits -- class hatred.
