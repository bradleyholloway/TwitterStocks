 Bigger Bang: Rising U.S. Investment In European Equities Galvanizes Old World --- American Money Has Clout In Government Policy And in the Boardroom --- Bitterness on Bastille Day   By By Greg Steinmetz and Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1999  Two years ago, U.S. investors hit the roof after the French government tried to use a state-controlled corporation to placate political separatists on the island of New Caledonia, east of Australia. The situation involved a mining company called Eramet SA whose minority shareholders included TIAA-CREF, the big U.S. university pension-fund manager, and Fidelity Investments, the big Boston investment firm. The French wanted to swap one of Eramet's nickel mines for an inferior one controlled by the separatists.  Of course, it isn't often that foreign policy bows to economic policy in this way, but Paris's respect for Fidelity and other foreign investors reflects a general eagerness among European governments, and around the globe, to attract American investors. U.S. culture and products have long been a powerful force overseas. Now, more than ever, it's American money. Since the start of the decade, American foreign equity investments have soared to $1.4 trillion from $197.3 billion, according to the Securities Industry Association.  Of the fresh money going abroad, Europe is getting two-thirds, making American investors major players in the Old World. Some highlights: The largest nongovernment shareholder of Volkswagen AG is Denver-based Janus Capital Corp. Omaha, Neb., investor Warren Buffett recently took a rare European foray, buying 2.2% of the shares in British food-and-drinks company Allied Domecq PLC. At British Steel PLC, more than 60% of the shares are held by Americans, up from 20% five years ago. Wags now dub it U.S. Steel.
