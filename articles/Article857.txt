 Recruiting Drive: Shortage of Teachers Prompts Talent Hunt By Education Officials --- Enticements Include Loans, Scholarships, Free Rent; The Search Moves Abroad --- Career Change for a Farmer   By By Francis C. Brown III, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1987  Faced with a worsening shortage of teachers, education officials are peering behind every bush and around every corner in search of them. That means bushes and corners in a lot of unlikely places -- Spain, Germany, aboard New England lobster boats, in the depressed Texas oil patch, on military bases.  There are so few certified teachers available that employers who once paid scant attention to applications now must compete with one another for candidates, sometimes roving overseas to find them. Many districts are raising teacher pay substantially, and some beguile prospects with offers of free rent and other enticements.  The new recruiting drives appear to be working well in some places, but it is too early to tell whether any offer a lasting, comprehensive solution. Working against them are the powerful demographic and social forces that created the shortage -- and that promise to make it worse. Demand for teachers has been rising as the children of the baby-boom generation fill up more classrooms, but the supply has been shrinking; women and minority-group members, the traditional groupings from which teachers emerged, now have wider opportunities in higher-paying fields. Also, more teachers are retiring or quitting.
