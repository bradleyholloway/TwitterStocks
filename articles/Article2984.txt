 Do Mutual Funds Have Auditing Conflicts?   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2002  At least one fund group has already taken action on the matter. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. last year changed its corporate auditor, to KPMG LLP from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, in order to have a different auditor from that used by the individual T. Rowe Price funds. Having separate auditors is "a preference of the independent directors of Price Group and of the Price funds," the company said in a recent proxy filing.  Similar conflicts can come into play in the mutual-fund situation, though, according to Mr. [John Bogle] and others. At some fund outfits, Mr. Bogle says, the fee to audit the management company is "almost trivial" compared with the auditors' pay for working on the funds. In such cases, if there's a common auditor, he says, the desire not to imperil the fund audit assignment could put pressure on the auditor to not question accounting practices at the management company.  Still, the directors of the T. Rowe Price funds decided that having separate firms audit the funds and the management would be better, given that the funds and the management company are separate entities that operate at arm's length, says John Schreiber, an independent director and chairman of the audit committee for the T. Rowe Price funds. He says the fund directors were pleased with PricewaterhouseCoopers' work on the funds and so, a year or so ago, asked T. Rowe Price Group if it would be willing to change to another auditor, which it did.
