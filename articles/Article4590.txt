 Can Wall Street Afford Uncle Sam, Investor?   By By Constance Horner, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1985  That situation could develop as a result of a measure now before Congress that would create a "thrift investment board" to invest federal employee and government pension contributions. The bill (H.R. 3660) is already out of the House committee, bypassing a floor vote, and on its way to conference with a similar provision in an already-approved Senate version. The Senate version would create a board consisting of the Treasury secretary, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a federal managers representative and a representative of a federal employee labor union.  Under both proposals federal workers hired after 1983 (when such workers were placed under Social Security and thus needed a new pension system) would be given the option of investing a portion of their salaries in one or more of a number of funds to be established and managed by this board, including Treasury securities, board-selected stock and bond indexes or (in the House version) individual stocks. The government would match half of the employee contribution, and after a phase-in period, this money would also be invested through these funds.  The problem is not investment in the private sector. The problem is, rather, the mechanism for this investment. Congress is to be commended for wanting federal employees to maximize earnings and save taxpayer dollars through intelligent choices among public and private investment instruments. Indeed, President Reagan has strongly urged such "privatization" measures, to limit federal government intervention in economic decisions.
