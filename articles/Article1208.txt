 Adelphia's Founder Appeals to Top Court   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2007  Prosecutors claimed the Rigases made Adelphia's finances appear robust -- when they were in fact dangerously overextended -- by concealing nearly $2.3 billion of the company's debt. Adelphia was the country's fifth-largest cable television company before its collapse in 2002. Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable, a unit of Time Warner Inc., have since bought Adelphia's cable assets.
