 Private Properties   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2001  The seller, independent filmmaker Paul Morrissey, says he's offering a bargain. The location, in the Long Island beach town of Montauk, is "totally unique," says Mr. Morrissey, who bought the estate with Mr. [Andy Warhol] in the 1970s for $220,000. "I think it's underpriced." Aside from 600 feet of ocean frontage, it's surrounded by more than 100 acres of protected wetlands, guaranteeing its seclusion from celebrity hounds. And of course, few homes can beat this one's guest list: At some point, everyone from Jacqueline Onassis to Mick Jagger has used Eothen (that's classical Greek for "toward the East") as a hideaway.  Mr. Morrissey, who ended up with the estate after Mr. Warhol died in 1987, says he's selling the home because he's concerned about the taxes his heirs would have to pay. The property, which has only been sold once in 100 years, includes a Colonial Revival main house, two guesthouses, a caretaker's house and a staff house. It also has a three-car garage. The estate once measured 21 acres but Mr. Warhol's estate donated a little more than 15 acres to the Nature Conservancy. It was purchased from the Church family, which manufactured Arm & Hammer Baking Soda, back when the Hamptons were stomping grounds for artists and potato farmers, not just jet-setters.
