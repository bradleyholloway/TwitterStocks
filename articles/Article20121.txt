 Politics & Economics: Fresh Fuel for Iraq Debate; Democrats Probe Initial White House Case for Invasion   By Dreazen, Yochi J, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2007  "The country needs to finally have an accounting of how we ended up in Iraq," said Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), whose House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. "It's a broader question than one speech or one issue alone. Why was it that we went to war over false pretenses?"  Democrats want to question Ms. Rice about how the unfounded uranium allegation made it into Mr. [Bush]'s 2003 State of the Union address. The panel has also asked former Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet to testify voluntarily about the claim in his new memoir that the administration took the nation to war without "serious debate." The publication of Mr. Tenet's book, "At the Center of the Storm," has bolstered the Democrats by questioning several aspects of the White House's case for war.  "Congressional investigations, the 9/11 Commission, Secretary Rice's testimony, and a series of responsive letters have all addressed the very prewar intelligence issues [Mr. Waxman] says he wants to address yet again," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in an interview this week. "This is an old story in Washington. If you can't legislate, investigate."
