 The Cancer Drug Delay   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  Back in September an FDA advisory panel composed of prominent oncologists voted 11 to 3 to recommend approval of Iressa to treat lung-cancer patients who haven't responded to conventional therapy. It was potentially the first of a new class of cancer drugs called growth-factor inhibitors that work without the nasty side effects of chemo. "I've never seen a lung cancer patient whose cancer went away by itself. Very clearly there are patients whose cancer went away with Iressa," said panel chairwoman Donna Przepiorka.  We understand the natural bureaucratic tendency to delay decisions in difficult cases, especially since the FDA has long been without a leader. But cancer patients are dying as Iressa remains bottled up. New FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan has a lot to do, but the doctors who treat dying patients will tell him that approving Iressa deserves to be a priority.
