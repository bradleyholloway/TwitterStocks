BRIDGETON, N.J.â€” A young drifter from Maine, described by a Dallas detective as ''one of those double-bad people,'' received a life sentence yesterday for the rape and murder of a 9-year-old Vineland boy.  The defendant - Malcolm Joseph Robbins Jr., 21, of Rockland, Me.  - received a life sentence with no chance of parole for 30 years in the sexual assault and death of Evan Bailey, who was abducted from a Vineland parking lot on Nov. 17, 1980. He pleaded guilty to the charges on April 27.  Judge Steven Z. Kleiner of Superior Court also sentenced Mr. Robbins to two consecutive 15-year terms, concurrent with his life term, for aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping. The judge said he hoped Mr. Robbins would never be released.
