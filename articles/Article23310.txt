 A Hobbled Star Battles the NFL   By Schultz, Ellen E, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  Mr. Washington appealed, and after more medical reviews, the case went to an arbitrator, who also found he didn't have a football- related disability. The arbitrator used a novel rationale: The NFL's disability plan referred to disability from "a football injury" -- but the player had several.  "The trustees have to make some tough calls," says Douglas Ell, a lawyer with the Groom Law Group, which represents the NFL plan. "The trustees are fiduciaries, and can't just say, 'This guy was in the Hall of Fame' . . . and pay him extra money he doesn't qualify for."  When the NFL and the players initially negotiated the benefits in the late 1960s, it's unlikely they foresaw the complexity the future held. Few players have severe disabilities as clear-cut as those of wide receiver Darryl Stingley, who was paralyzed during a preseason game in 1978. The more common injuries cited in disability claims -- cervical-spine injuries, osteo-arthritis, knee, hip and other joint injuries -- can't be as easily measured. Debilitating problems may not show up for years and can be exacerbated by use of painkillers and steroids, along with substance abuse.
