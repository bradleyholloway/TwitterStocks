 Sternlicht Plans Baccarat Hotel Brand   By Audi, Tamara, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  In 2006, Starwood Capital paid $3.2 billion for French concern Societe du Louvre, which included the famed Crillon hotel in Paris as well as the majority stake in Baccarat. Shortly after the sale, the company disclosed plans for a line of ultra-luxury hotels that would carry the Crillon name in cities world-wide. In announcing that brand, Mr. [Barry Sternlicht] described the Crillon masthead as one that would be "obscenely rich and obscenely beautiful."  While Baccarat is also positioned as an ultra-luxury brand, Mr. Sternlicht said the Baccarat properties would be "more fun and looser" than Crillon. He added Crillon -- with plans to open in New York, Rome, London and Barcelona -- would be more of an urban hotel while the Baccarat brand would focus on resorts at first.
