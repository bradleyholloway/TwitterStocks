 Congress's Power Outage   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2002  Recall that this exercise began two years ago amid California blackouts and a consensus that the U.S. needed more energy production. At least the House passed a bill that would do that, notably by allowing oil exploration on a mere 2,000 acres of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But Senators from the Northeast suburbs seem unlikely to accept ANWR drilling in conference, leaving a bill that would produce far more harm than energy.  Both bills also offer tax credits by the barrel. The IRS code already has some 20 energy tax credits, but the Senate's bill alone has 40. There's a 1.5-cent production tax credit for every kilowatt-hour of renewable energy. There's a $3,000 to $4,000 tax bribe for gas-electric hybrid cars (of the kind that Americans have shown no willingness to buy). And our sources have crunched the numbers and discovered a $1-a-gallon tax credit for biodiesel, a sop to the soybean industry. All of this recalls the energy policy of the 1970s, the last time politicians decided they knew more about finding energy than markets do.
