 Car Leasing Allure Grows With Tax Act, But Buying May Still Be the Way to Go   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1986  But other provisions of the tax bill are expected to raise the cost of leasing. And some auto makers and finance companies have already concluded that the tax overhaul won't much affect consumer habits. "I don't see any big change in the next year or two in the number of people leasing," says George Fenner, group vice president for marketing at General Motors Acceptance Corp., the finance subsidiary of General Motors Corp.  Under the overhaul bill, the sales-tax deduction will be eliminated next year. The interest-payment deduction will be phased out: 65% of interest costs will be deductible next year, dropping to 40% in 1988, 20% in 1989 and 10% in 1990. The deduction is eliminated altogether in 1991. These changes will make buying a car more expensive for people who itemize their tax returns. (According to estimates supplied by GMAC, 75% of customers use credit in car purchases, and 30% to 40% of car buyers itemize.)  Consider a $12,000 car, for which a customer puts down $2,000 and takes out a 48month loan for the balance at 10% interest. Assuming 5% sales tax, payments for tax and interest over the life of the loan would total $2,792. Under current law, deducting those payments would save a buyer in the 28% tax bracket $782 in taxes. A taxpayer in the 50% bracket would save $1,396. (Of course, the higher the price of a car, the greater the tax savings.)
