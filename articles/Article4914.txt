 Notable & Quotable [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1988  From an interview with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, in the current issue of Forbes:  {The Sandinista government} can trust Dukakis' administrative ability and the administrative ability of a future Democratic administration to change U.S. policy . . . I think that with Dukakis we could have better conditions to work for a new dialogue. However, I think Mr. Dukakis will doubtless encounter some serious obstacles; he will be subjected to McCarthyist pressures from the die-hard conservatives.
