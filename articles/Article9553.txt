 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2003  Dozens of people helping to write an EU constitution say an EU tax would eliminate a tangled web of indirect levies that few EU citizens know exist. "After the euro, let's make the conceptual leap to a European tax," Pierre Lequiller, a center-right delegate from the French parliament, told fellow convention delegates on Friday.  The tax plan's proponents want the future EU constitution to allow for the possibility of a direct EU tax, and insist that such a tax wouldn't cost EU citizens any more than the indirect taxes it would replace. But another large contingent at the convention derides the tax plan.  Economists expect the British economic czar to announce the biggest deficit-spending plans since the mid-1990s when he unveils his projections for the fiscal year ending next March 31. Estimates of the amount the government will need to borrow range from about GBP 30 billion to GBP 35 billion ($54.6 billion). That is up from the GBP 24 billion Mr. [Gordon Brown] projected last November and compares with estimates of between GBP 22 billion and GBP 23 billion for the year ended last month.
