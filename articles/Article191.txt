Charles Adrien Rene Dollfus, a balloon pilot and aeronautical writer who in 1932 became the first Frenchman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in both directions in an airship, died Friday in Paris, a family spokesman said yesterday. He was 88 years old.  Mr. Dollfus, who was born March 31, 1893, in Paris, was a member of an old and wealthy thread-manufacturing family. He was a balloon enthusiast before his graduation from Ecole du Louvre. By his 18th birthday he was piloting balloons and dirigibles.  In 1918, Mr. Dollfus founded the Paris Air Museum and began his lifetime devotion to the promotion of aeronautics in general and balloons in particular through articles, books and research projects.  He received many French awards, including the Croix de Guerre, the Aeronautical Medal and the Legion of Honor.
