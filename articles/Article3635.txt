 Union Don'ts -- And Dues   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2003  She's focusing on something called the LM-2, a Labor Department form that is supposed to reveal how unions spend member dues. Until Ms. [Elaine Chao] took a fresh look at it, however, the form had remained virtually unchanged since its introduction in 1959 as part of legislation aimed at keeping the mob out of organized labor. The good news is that a reformed version of the LM-2 has just been published in the Federal Register.  Under the new LM-2, unions with annual receipts greater than $200,000 would have to itemize all "major" disbursements, which threshhold will be set somewhere between $2,000 and $5,000. More important, they would also have to account for how their salaried staffers spent their time, probably the largest source of soft-money contributions.  Senator [Tom Harkin] blinks when it comes to applying the same standard to unions. As chairman of a key appropriations subcommittee, he denied Ms. Chao's funding request for the department's only office watching what unions do with member dues. He also inserted this sentence in the committee report: "The Committee directs the Secretary of Labor not to revise, amend, or change in any way, whether by rulemaking or otherwise, the reporting requirements imposed on labor organizations."
