 Bristol-Myers Plans Charge For Cutbacks --- Provision to Be $690 Million After Taxes for Ending Post-Merger Duplication   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1990  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it will take an estimated $690 million after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings to trim operations made redundant by the merger last fall of Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp.  The giant pharmaceutical and health care products company, the second largest in the world after Merck & Co., said the bulk of the charge will be for combining manufacturing operations, shutting down some plants and pruning duplicated administrative operations. The company said it hasn't decided which operations will be affected.  The company said the fourth-quarter charge involves pretax charges of $740 million to cover the staff reductions and plant shutdowns and $115 million for professional fees and expenses related to the merger. Bristol-Myers acquired Squibb in a stock swap valued at about $12.3 billion, completed in October.
