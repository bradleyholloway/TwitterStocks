 House Panel's Decision Would Protect Professionals From a New Tax Burden   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1985  A panel of the House Ways and Means Committee has decided to protect lawyers, accountants and other professionals from a new tax burden proposed in the tax-overhaul bill.  The decisions were made by six members of the tax-writing committee who met yesterday behind closed doors to devise a package of tax changes on a slew of accounting issues in the massive tax-overhaul bill. The actions of previous panels of this kind have been accepted with little alteration by the full committee; full committee action on accounting is expected today.  A separate panel decided to reduce the maximum contributions that can be made to a special retirement plan -- called a cash or deferred arrangement -- to $7,000 from the current $30,000. President Reagan's tax proposal would have eliminated the program, known as 401(k); the plan of committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) would have placed the maximum contribution at $5,000.
