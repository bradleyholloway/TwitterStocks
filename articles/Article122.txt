Despite All Appearances, Woody Allen Wasn't There  The man whose name was on everybody's lips was not there, but it didn't seem to make any difference at Sweetwater's on Monday night. Brian Backer, most seemed to agree, was a worthy substitute for Woody Allen, who avoided the opening-night party for his new play, ''The Floating Light Bulb,'' at the Amsterdam Avenue restaurant.  Mr. Backer, a 24-year-old actor who looks like Mr. Allen, walks like Mr. Allen and seems to have mastered Mr. Allen's self-effacing gestures, portrays a 17-year-old character many take to be Mr. Allen. Mr. Backer added to the belief by repeating Mr. Allen's denial that the play was autobiographical.  ''Woody insists that it's not,'' said Mr. Backer, who then provided further evidence that it is. ''At first I was going to wear glasses like Woody's, but it was decided that that would be just too much,'' he said.
