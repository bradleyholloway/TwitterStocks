 Real Estate Finance: Housing Duo Focuses On Raw Land; Firm Looks Ahead 5 Years To Plan New Developments In Political 'Chess Game'   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  Despite the large potential gains, he says, many banks and investors shy away from investments in raw land without approvals for development. "Everybody hears the horror stories of developments that didn't get entitlement," says Mr. [Jeff Barcy], who was an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston, specializing in real estate, before joining Hearthstone in mid-2005. He calls it "entitlement risk" and says: "That scares off a lot of capital."  Hearthstone continues to provide financing for other land developers. One risk is that the venture with Mr. [Albert Praw] will make Hearthstone look more like a rival to those longstanding partners. Mr. Barcy says he hopes not to clash with Hearthstone's partners in bidding for land. "It's a big world out there," he says.  Hearthstone originally planned to form a joint venture in land development with KB Home, but KB decided not to proceed with that, Mr. Barcy says. A KB spokeswoman cited "changing dynamics" in the housing market.
