 The 'Rescuer' of NASA Talks About Space   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  The space shuttle fleet had been grounded after the horrific Challenger accident killed seven crew members, and a swarm of investigators was uncovering how NASA had scrimped on safety. NASA's reputation had plunged from New Frontier pioneer to bureaucratic bungler.  Now, NASA is on something of a roll. It has launched three shuttles successfully and is preparing to launch a fourth in a few weeks. And Mr. Fletcher, a calm, grandfatherly figure who retired this weekend after his second stint as NASA administrator -- his first was from 1971 to 1977 -- gets much of the credit. "He's been NASA's rescuer," says Howard McCurdy, a space historian.  But the U.S. civil space program still faces severe problems, ranging from increased competition from abroad for space business to an inability to convince the public of the need for new manned space missions. In an office decorated with models of the space shuttle and the proposed space station, the 69-year-old Mr. Fletcher outlined his views on the health of the U.S. space program.
