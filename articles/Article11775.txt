 BP Reports Net Climbed Sharply In 3rd Quarter --- U.K. Oil Concern's Results Reflect Success in Effort To Reduce Its Costs   By By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1993  Earnings at British Petroleum Co. continued their seemingly inexorable rise in the third quarter, reflecting in great part the oil company's successful drive to cut costs.  The pace of BP's continuing profit recovery after a stunning #812 million loss in the second quarter of 1992 has confounded even optimistic analysts, whose projections had ranged as high as #290 million for the latest quarter even after allowing for the benefits accruing to BP from changes in the British North Sea tax regime.  Mr. Hudson and other analysts said they were in the process of revising their assessments of BP based on its faster-than-expected financial recovery since the second quarter of 1992, when the company decided to bite the bullet and cuts its costs sharply. In that quarter, the company charged #919 million to cover the costs of layoffs and asset write-offs. It also began a divestment program and set a target of reaching sustainable profits of $2 billion annually by 1995.
