 For Bonds, Rise in Jobs Means Narrow Trading; Data Reinforce the View On Measured Rate Increases; Relief Rally in 10-Year Yield   By Michael Mackenzie and Shayna Stoyko, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2005  To be sure, long-dated Treasury prices moving higher in the face of a stronger-than-expected jobs report may seem odd, but there is foundation for it. For one, the data don't suggest the Fed is about to tighten more aggressively, preserving the outlook for a "measured" pace of quarter-point increases.  "The fear within the bond market was a move to stronger job growth accompanied by signs of inflation pressures, and that's clearly not the case for now," said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "It makes sense we are getting a relief rally," and 4.28% is a likely target for the 10-year note.  GM bonds were hit the hardest, with risk premiums on its benchmark 8.375% bonds due 2033 quoted at 4.01 percentage points more than Treasurys of a similar duration, 0.12 point wider for the day and near the widest since around mid-January. Ford's 7.45% bonds due 2031 were 0.07 percentage point wider at 3.14 points more than Treasurys, on MarketAxess. "The market is nervous about auto fundamentals," said Thomas Eggenschwiler, director of research at hedge fund Aladdin Capital.
