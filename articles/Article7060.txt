 Arts & Entertainment -- Leisure & Arts / Fine Art: A Five-Decade Marriage of Nature and Art   By Esplund, Lance, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2010  New Perspectives Storm King Art Center Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y. (845) 534-3115 Through 2011 Lie in the grass alongside Alyson Shotz's "Mirror Fence" (2003), a three-foot-tall, 130-foot-long stretch of picket fence covered in mirrored acrylic, and you'll see reflected across its face the rolling hills, fields and sky of Storm King Art Center's 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley. "Mirror Fence" recalls elements and qualities of other works at Storm King -- the reflections of Magdalena Abakanowicz's "Sarcophagi in Glass House" (1989), the curving vertical planes of Calder's "Five Swords" (1976) and Andy Goldsworthy's long fieldstone walls, including "Five Men, Seventeen Days, Fifteen Boulders, One Wall," which was acquired in 2010.
