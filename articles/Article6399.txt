 Navigating Curves: BMW's Push to Broaden Line Hits Some Bumps in the Road; World-Wide Sales Are Up, But Style, Tech Glitches Turn Off Longtime Fans; A Wurst in Three Sizes   By Boudette, Neal E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2005  BMW is now about halfway through its massive overhaul. In the past four years, while most car makers' sales have stagnated, BMW's vehicle sales have soared 34%. But signs of trouble are cropping up, raising questions about whether the strategy will prove successful in the long run. The new curvy styling is turning off some longstanding fans. Some of the new technology has glitches. Meanwhile, competitors like Cadillac and Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti brand borrowed from BMW's old strategy and produced faster, sportier sedans. They're now pulling in some disaffected BMW fans.  This year, BMW will face two critical tests of its strategy. In the spring, the new-look 3 Series will debut. Mr. [Helmut Panke] says BMW "has listened to the feedback" about its recent designs and promises the new 3 Series is less of a departure from BMW tradition than the already-launched 5 and 7 Series. A slip-up with the new 3 Series, BMW's top-seller and the icon of its brand image, might force a re- think of the design direction. "This has to appeal to the BMW hard- core," Mr. Panke says.  Later in the year BMW will decide if it is going to green-light a new vehicle that risks further stirring up purists in BMW's following. It seats seven passengers and is a kind of minivan, although Mr. Panke declines to call it that. Inside BMW, it's known as the "Raumfunktionales Konzept" -- space-functional concept. If BMW decides to go ahead with the car, it won't feel anything like a minivan, Mr. Panke says. "It will drive like a BMW."
