 IN THE LEAD: Do `360' Job Reviews By Colleagues Promote Honesty or Insults?   By By Carol Hymowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2000  For one thing, since most 360-degree reviews are done anonymously, staff members with an ax to grind can use the system to even scores. In a veiled reference to 360-degree appraisals, the boss in one Dilbert cartoon strip announces that raises will depend on evaluations by co-workers, prompting one character to ask: "If my co-workers got small raises, wouldn't there be more available in the budget for me?"  He recalls how the president of one chemical company where Mr. [Garold Markle] worked as a vice president of human resources, received a 360-degree review of his performance that was the length of a book. Each of the reviewers had numerically rated the president on 96 categories. The president, under pressure to improve results, "was supposed to use the review to come up with a plan, but instead felt overwhelmed and frustrated," says Mr. Markle.  In his previous job as a partner at Booz Allen, where he was in charge of a team of about 75 consultants, Mr. [Jay Marshall] learned through a 360-degree review that he had "become invisible" to the consultants he was overseeing. "I had gotten so focused on keeping the client happy that I wasn't spending enough time with my team," he says, "but the feedback they gave me enabled me to snap back." That feedback wouldn't have been possible from his immediate boss or other superiors at Booz Allen, who never visited his job site.
