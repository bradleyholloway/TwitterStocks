 International Corporate Report: Group Sets Standards On Optical Computer Disks   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1986  The agreement follows months of debate on standards in the industry and was viewed by some analysts as a bid by Netherlands-based Philips and Japan-based Sony to settle the question in favor of their own preferred standard. Philips invented much of the basic technology behind optical disks; a similar accord in 1981 between the two companies on compact audio disks ended industry disagreement and paved the way for rapid sales of those disks.
