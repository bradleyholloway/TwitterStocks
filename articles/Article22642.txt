 Copper Prices Rally Amid Falling Inventories   By By David Bogoslaw, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2000  Copper futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange soared, as falling supplies caused traders to exit bearish bets.  Steadily declining inventories in London Metal Exchange and Comex warehouses helped spark the resurgence, according to William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch.  LME warehouse inventories have declined by 6,300 metric tons since Friday to 697,675 metric tons, while Comex inventories have declined by 677 metric tons to 77,865 metric tons, boosting bullish sentiment in the market, traders said. A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds.
