 Smoking Offensive: Brazil's Strict Measures Open Unlikely Front In War on Cigarettes --- High-Powered Activists Get Tobacco-Growing Nation To Clamp Down on Ads --- Warning: Premature Babies   By By Jonathan Karp, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2002  If Mr. [Jose Serra] and Dr. [Jacob Kligerman] succeed in their campaign, Brazil could be a model for developing countries grappling with the dilemma between promoting public health and economic growth. Government officials from China, home to the world's biggest pool of smokers, have visited Brazil for tips on tobacco control. The WHO appointed two Brazilians to head its anti-tobacco efforts, including launching negotiations on a controversial global anti-smoking treaty. The world's developed and developing nations have yet to reach a consensus on that treaty.  For more than a decade, Brazil's cancer institute led the battle to restrict the cigarette trade and smoking in public places. But by May 2000, Mr. Serra and Dr. Kligerman were ready to shift the campaign into high gear. On the United Nations' global "World No Tobacco Day," they launched Brazil's blitzkrieg by invoking an American icon: the Marlboro Man. Encouraged by the WHO, the cancer institute flew in the brother of deceased Marlboro pitchman Wayne McLaren, a lung-cancer casualty. Dr. Kligerman appeared with him to launch a publicity tour and government-sponsored advertising campaign designed to shatter the tobacco industry's portayal of smoking as glamorous.  Mr. Serra -- joined by Dr. Kligerman and cancer institute experts for presentations to lawmakers -- pushed the anti-tobacco bill through Brazil's lower house in less than three months. Then the team went to work on crucial senators. When the cancer institute sponsored an exhibition inside congress on smoking's ills, Mr. Serra and Dr. Kligerman escorted the powerful senate president, who broke down in tears because smoking had contributed to his son's early death.
