 U.S. Considers European Role For Missile-Defense Programs   By By Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2002  Pentagon officials have talked to European military contractors, including Britain's BAE Systems PLC, France's Thales SA and the European Aeronautic Defense & Space Co., about the possibility of participating in U.S. missile-defense projects. Efforts in this area focus primarily on protecting the continental U.S and U.S. fighting forces overseas. For fiscal 2002, which ends in October, the U.S. has allotted $8.2 billion for missile defense, including production of a large ground-based system as well as the development of air, land and sea-based options.  The missile-defense push is an outgrowth of a broader U.S. effort to gain international support -- politically and financially -- for U.S. weapons systems. Pentagon officials cite the success the U.S. has made signing up foreign partners, both governments and countries, for the newest U.S. fighter jet, the Joint Strike Fighter. The U.K., Canada, the Netherlands, Italy and several others have committed billions of dollars to develop the radar-evading jet, which won't enter the military forces until around 2010. Some companies in their countries are getting a cut of the work on the plane, expected to be the biggest seller in military history.
