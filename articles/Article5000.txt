 Air-Conditioner Firms Put Chill on Plans To Phase Out Use of Chlorofluorocarbons   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1993  This internecine contest is being waged among the producers of the next generation of industrial air conditioners, called chillers, that are free of CFCs. Two of the largest companies -- Carrier Corp. and Trane Co. -- are competing for the largest slice of that emerging market. They are attacking each other's choice of ozone-friendly alternatives as either dangerous to human health or the environment.  With the CFC production deadline looming, fewer than 5% of the world's 112,000 industrial air conditioners, or chillers (80,000 of which are in the U.S.), have been converted to non-CFC products, industry officials estimate. In just one city, Chicago, only two building owners have applied for a city variance to convert any of the estimated 1,500 CFC chillers downtown to use alternative compounds.  The cost of adapting to life without CFCs is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Just among industrial air-conditioner users, the price tag is estimated at nearly $8 billion. Add tens of billions for phasing out CFC coolant use in the supermarket and restaurant industry, and in auto air conditioners, where conversions to non-CFC systems are likely to cost about $250 each. Home air conditioners use less damaging hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, which aren't likely to be phased out for at least a decade.
