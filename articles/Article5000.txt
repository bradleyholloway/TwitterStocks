 Getting Started: Investors Can Be Burned by Failing To Learn Deposit Insurance Rules   By By Georgette Jasen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1989  But what about the couple with two joint accounts, one with $50,000 and the other with $65,000? Or the woman who has a $70,000 joint account with her husband, a $70,000 joint account with her son and $45,000 in her own account? In both cases, $15,000 wouldn't be covered by insurance and, if the bank failed, could be lost.  At the same time, people who use the right mix of accounts can get coverage well beyond the $100,000 level, without having to go to another bank. A husband and wife with two children, for example, could have $1.4 million in the bank -- all of it fully insured -- by using the right combination of individual, joint and trust accounts.  Ms. Padgett says she won't soon forget the elderly sisters who lost nearly $100,000. While each had less than $100,000 on deposit in an account she thought of as her own, they made the two accounts joint so they could more easily care for each other in case of illness or disability. Only when the thrift failed did they learn that joint accounts held by the same combination of individuals are added together for insurance purposes, giving them a total of $100,000 coverage for both accounts.
