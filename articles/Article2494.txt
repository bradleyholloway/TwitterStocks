 Firm Deals With Illness Of Its CEO   By By Brenda Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1998  Ms. [Jane] Snorek stresses that she, for one, is confident that the company has swiftly put in place a sound succession plan. In fact, she says she would pick up more First Consulting stock if she had the money. Her firm currently holds 82,100 shares of First Consulting, or less than a 1% stake.

In corporate promotional materials, he has been described as "one of the health-care industry's more respected strategists, technologists and thought leaders."
