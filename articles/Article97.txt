To the Editor:  The recent series of articles in your paper regarding the problem of how to finance capital funds to re-equip our transit system has avoided the critical issue of improving safety in our buses and subways. With the possibility of a fare hike by this summer growing more and more likely, the two million regular riders must be assured their additional revenues are being used partly to improve their personal safety. v. hen considering the formula for coming up with the $1.4 billion that the M.T.A. needs, the State Legislature must mandate part of those funds to effect meaningful safety measures.  More transit police must be hired if crime in our subways is ever going to be controlled. Part of the revenues the M.T.A. gets from a fare increase should be enough to put additional police on the trains instead of just replacing those who retire or leave the job.  In addition to this, we need a steady expansion of the guard-dog program. The 13 dogs now used by trained transit officers have shown their effec-tiveness in fighting crime. In fact, their very presence in the subway is a deterrent to crime.  To supplement police and dogs, the M.T.A. should test camera surveillance in a station with a high crime rate. This type of monitoring is now being used effectively in Philadelphia. Through legislation the M.T.A. should be required to use at least five cents of any fare increase to put these programs into effect.  With the proliferation of violent crimes in the subways, stiffer penalties must be handed down to those convicted of a felony in a mass transportation facility. Would-be criminals must know that they will face a mandatory three-year sentence for crimes in the subways with no room for plea bargaining. The Legislature needs to enact these mandatory penalties as soon as possible.  In addition to greater security, operational safety of subway cars and buses must be guaranteed. A recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that mass-transit systems throughout the country have ''enormous potential for disaster.'' In New York, over 2,000 subway cars are daily out of service for safety reasons, not to mention the new buses that were found unsafe and sent back to the manufacturer.  The Legislature must require that money is used to bring new subway cars into service with undercarriages made of heavy cast steel instead of the R-46 undercarriage that cracks, or the electronic system on the R-44 car that is too sophisticated for our antiquated system. The M.T.A. must be held accountable to replace the R-44 and R-46 with new cars instead of obsolete, 30-year-old cars, as they do now.  No matter how the Legislature comes up with the billion dollars for the M.T.A., part of it must go to improving safety for mass transit riders. ANTHONY SEMINERIO Member of Assembly, 31st Dist.
