 Ahead Of the Tape   By By Jesse Eisinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2002  Yet while consumers might be spending, they also are keeping an eye on the price tag. Yesterday, cut-rate retailers displayed all the strength. Big mass merchants, such as Wal-Mart Stores and Target, showed rises, as did off-price retailers such as Ross Stores. Clothing retailers did worse.  Sure, there are caveats. Even if the PPI does come in big, it will have a lot to do with oil prices, which have risen on Mideast tensions and the improving economy. When you take out food and energy, that "core" PPI is expected to rise only 0.1%.
