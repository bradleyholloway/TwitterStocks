 Quarterly Closed-End Funds Review --- Holder Activists Get a Whole Lot Of Shakin' Goin' On at Closed-Ends   By By Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1999  "It's our belief that directors at some of these funds take actions that are best only for the fund's advisers, not for the majority of shareholders," says Ron Olin, who as a portfolio manager with Deep Discount Advisors in Asheville, N.C., has rallied other discontented shareholders to vote him onto the boards of Austria Fund and Clemente Strategic Value Fund.  The unique characteristics of closed-end funds have made them prime targets for activists because, unlike regular open-ended mutual funds, they issue a fixed number of shares that trade on a stock exchange. Depending on the demand for these shares, the fund can trade at a premium or discount to its net-asset value, or NAV. Typically, funds with discounts of 20% or more -- and right now there are about 30 such candidates -- attract the activist crowd.  Since he became a board member, Mr. Olin's funds have seen their discounts narrow dramatically, and, in the case of the Clemente fund, the share price of the fund has soared. But not everyone believes director activists like Mr. Olin deserve a pat on the back, or are even working on behalf of all shareholders.
