 Gossip Columns In Local Papers Aid Circulation --- `The Dish' Helps Draw In A Younger Audience But Goes Easy on Stars   By By Brian Steinberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2001  As a house band plays dance faves like "Boogie Oogie Oogie" and "Disco Inferno," Ms. [Susie Costaregni], 42 years old, sidles up to celebrity sportscaster PAT O'BRIEN and shoots craps with football great RANDY CROSS. Next up on her list: a former member of the seminal rock band TRAFFIC. "We've got to meet DAVE MASON!" she says enthusiastically. Baseball's ROGER CLEMENS waits elsewhere. And she thinks -- thinks -- she caught actor RICHARD GRIECO out of the corner of her eye.  The capital-lettered names mean one thing. To the untrained eye, this event -- part of the Third Annual Bert Zeldin Celebrity Golf Classic -- marks just another night of the usual highfalutin' antics for which this town is known. For Ms. Costaregni, however, this local gala may well be a news bonanza -- and, in some ways, an aid to the newspaper industry at large. She pens "The Dish," a six-month-old gossip column that runs Saturdays in the Greenwich Time, and its somewhat more metropolitan sister, the Advocate of neighboring Stamford. Both newspapers are owned by Tribune Co., and have a combined daily circulation of about 40,500.  Of course, Ms. Costaregni has to tread gingerly. "If we don't think it's in good taste," says Joe Pisani, editor of the two Connecticut papers, "we won't run it." The best local gossip column, says Jim Sterling, a University of Missouri journalism professor who specializes in community-newspaper management, "is one of those things where people like to get their names in."
