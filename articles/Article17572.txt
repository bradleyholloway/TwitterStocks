 Dividend News: Damson Energy Co. Reduces Dividends On 2 Classes of Units   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1986  Damson Energy Co., citing an unexpected call for the payment of bank debt, cut its quarterly payout to holders of Class A and Class B limited partnership units.  The reduction reflects a continuing financial squeeze at Damson Oil Corp., which has been hurt by weak oil and gas prices and a sharp drop in management fees from company-sponsored limited partnerships. As a result, the company's cash flow has been hurt. Damson Energy is a Houston-based limited partnership formed last year to consolidate a number of oil and gas programs.
