 Peat Marwick Consultant Transferred, Another Sign of Rift With Accountants   By By Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1988  The partner, John L. Montgomery, 53 years old, who headed consulting in the New York area for the past four years, was reassigned to head Peat's strategic and operations management services.  In his previous job, Mr. Montgomery had some 375 consulting professionals, including 50 partners, reporting to him. In his new job, he will serve in a staff function and work with personnel reporting to other partners. Peat, which has the fifth-largest consulting practice in the country, has 1,975 partners, of which 320 are consultants.  Some Peat partners say the move reflects a power struggle within the firm between accountants and consultants. "Over the past few years, the accounting partners have been trying to exercise more power over the consulting partners, who are bringing in more money" per partner, said a partner who requested anonymity. "John was a strong advocate of consultants running their own practice, and he paid for it," the partner added.
