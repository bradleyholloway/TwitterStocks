 As PC Designers Move From Hard to Simple, We Await `Just Right'   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  The year 2000 was a good one because it was the first year of the post-PC era. That means we have entered a period in which there will be a great variety of devices that will do some of the most popular digital tasks that until now have been possible only on a PC, and do them more easily and reliably.  Five big companies -- Compaq, Microsoft, Gateway, AOL and 3Com -- are behind these three latest devices and others, including Intel, are waiting in the wings. But many of these first attempts will likely fail to catch on, and it will probably take a few years for the market to produce enduring winners in each category of digital appliance. This period reminds me of the exciting days between 1977 and 1984, when the PC was taking shape and there were many hardware and software designs offered by numerous players, out of which emerged the two main branches of personal computing: the IBM PC and the Apple Macintosh.  I realize that deciding which features are core features is tough. I know these appliances have memory and storage limitations, and I'm acutely aware that adding too many features raises the danger of recreating the unwieldy, general-purpose PC. Nobody wants a digital appliance that is as dense and forbidding as Microsoft Outlook.
