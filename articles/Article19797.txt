 Style & Substance: Shoppers Who Blend Store, Catalog and Web Spend More   By Stringer, Kortney, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 2004  "Sometimes I just want to know what's in the store before I go," says the Tucker, Ga., actuary, who looks for dresses and bathing suits on the Web sites of her favorite retailers, Charming Shoppes Inc.'s Lane Bryant and the Gap and Old Navy chains of Gap Inc. "Sometimes there is a broader selection or more sizes online than in the stores."  This new shopper is typically more affluent. "In general, those who shop multichannels tend to spend more and be more engaged with the brands, because they have more discretionary income," says Kate Delhagen, consumer-markets research director at Forrester Research. "Some retailers are saying 'If our loyal customers like the store that much, how much more money would they spend if we can reach them X many more times?' "  At Fred Meyer Jewelers, the nation's fourth-largest jewelry retailer, online customers get coupons good for in-store use only when they buy rings, earrings and other items on the company's Web site. "Two years ago, online sales were a threat to the stores," says Mark Funasaki, Fred Meyer's vice president of strategic planning and business development. "Now, we're seeing people come in with printouts from the Web site of items they want to buy. We get quite a few sales online, but the Web site also drives store sales."
