 Mexico's Economy Raises Hopes for 2000 --- Debt Upgrade, IMF Loan May Help Nation Avoid Usual Pre-Election Crisis   By By Jonathan Friedland, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1999  Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. changed its rating outlook to stable from negative for Mexico's foreign-currency bonds, notes and bank deposits, and for local-currency bonds. The agency said the changes reflect the resilience of the Mexican economy to external shocks, but cautioned it is "premature to fully discount uncertainties" leading into presidential elections scheduled for July 2000. Moody's also raised ratings to stable from negative on the foreign-currency obligations of eleven Mexican banks.  Moody's endorsement of the Zedillo government's cautious fiscal and monetary stance comes as Mexico and the IMF put the finishing touches on a $4.2 billion, 18-month loan program.

Those obligations represent by far the biggest chunk of Mexican foreign debt due during the coming sensitive election period.
