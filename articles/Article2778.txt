 FAA Inspections Cite Cracks in the Wiring On Six of 81 Airliners   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 2000  Ms. [Elizabeth Erickson] said no direct link between age and faulty wiring should be drawn from the study. Some wiring damage, she said, was caused unintentionally by maintenance crews working in cramped areas. The cracked wires were found on an Airbus A300, a Boeing 747, two DC-9s and a DC-10, and a Lockheed L-1011.
