 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Compiled by Rich Jaroslovsky, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1987  U.S. and Soviet officials both express readiness to work on a treaty to reduce strategic arms, and hint they may be willing to schedule a 1988 summit even if an accord hasn't been precooked. In their meetings with administration officials, the Soviets talked as if the only question about a return visit to Moscow by Reagan is when, not whether, it will happen.  Reagan would be eager to go as the capstone of what may otherwise be a desultory final year in office. But Gorbachev may be reluctant to receive Reagan without more progress toward negotiating deep cuts in long-range nuclear weapons and some limits on Reagan's Star Wars program.  House conservatives complain that moderates have seized the White House. "There's a feeling that we've been cut adrift," says Illinois Rep. Hyde. The GOP lawmakers concede they lack the votes to successfully buck Reagan. "In a 30-year tradition of impotence, the House Republicans will dissipate their anger and do nothing," laments Georgia Rep. Gingrich. But some say they may not go down the line with Reagan on tough issues next year.
