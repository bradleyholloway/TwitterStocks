 Church and Diocese Battle Over Religion, Sex, Politics   By By Sara Kehaulani Goo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1999  The diocese seized St. Paul's, church leaders say, because its priests and parishoners attempted to secede over their disagreements with the liberal diocesan theology. The diocese wanted to recognize same-sex marriages and ordain homosexuals, and this church did not. This, they argue, is a classic David [E. Johnson]-and-Goliath story.  The priest in question was the rector at St. Paul's, the Rev. James R. Hiles. Two women, including the wife of another priest, said they'd had extramarital affairs with the Rev. Hiles in the 1970s. The Rev. Hiles, now 71, denies the allegations.  So now the pulpit inside the church is filled by a newly appointed rector, the Rev. Donald Parker. The Rev. Hiles -- defrocked by the diocese in 1998, but since reinstated, he says, by Forward in Faith, a traditional group of Episcopal clergy and laymen -- holds services on the sidewalk in front. (The diocese calls Forward in Faith a breakaway group, and does not recognize its authority to ordain priests.)
