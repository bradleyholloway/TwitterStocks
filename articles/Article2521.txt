 U.S. Stocks Beatened but Not Broken by Brazil --- Industrials End Down 125.12; 022 Bonds Advance   By By E.S. Browning and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1999  The Nasdaq Composite Index, down as much as 114.56 -- the equivalent of more than 450 points on the Dow Jones industrials -- snapped back even more strongly. Buoyed by its heavy exposure to resilient technology stocks such as Microsoft and Intel, it finished virtually unchanged, down just 3.94, or 0.17%, at 2316.81.  While Treasurys rallied, bonds of emerging-market nations fell sharply, and weren't able to muster much of a recovery. The difference between yields on emerging-market bonds and safe Treasurys jumped to 14.26 percentage points from 12.34 points, according to the J.P. Morgan Emerging Bond Index. That reflected investor skittishness about emerging-market bonds. The setback, which affected bonds from Brazil and other Latin American nations the most, was the worst one-day performance for the sector since Sept. 10.  Traders warned that more pain may be in store for bonds. "We bounced off our lows, but everything in the emerging markets was affected, and we think we will see more selling pressure because the market expects another chapter to be written in the Brazil saga," said Paul Masco, Salomon Smith Barney's head of emergingmarkets fixed-income trading.
