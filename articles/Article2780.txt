 High Court to Determine Terms Of Police Shield From Lawsuits   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2000  Two military police, including the defendant in the case, Donald Saucier, immediately grabbed Mr. [Elliot Katz] and, according to Mr. Katz, "shoved" him into a nearby police van. He was briefly detained before being released. The officers claimed Mr. Katz resisted arrest, which he denies. Mr. Katz sued the two officers, saying they violated his First Amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause as well as his Fourth Amendment rights with their unnecessary use of force.  The matter the Supreme Court will review involves the Fourth Amendment issue. A U.S. district court in California rejected Mr. Saucier's efforts to have the Fourth Amendment claim dismissed before it could be heard by a jury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, sustained that ruling, saying Mr. Saucier isn't entitled to "qualified immunity" for alleged violations of Mr. Katz's Fourth Amendment rights.
