 Multinationals Bet on Brazil's Recovery --- GM, Nokia, Others Expect Expansion Will Be Sustained   By By Miriam Jordan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2000  Investor confidence has been buoyed by strong economic indicators of late, including 3.8% gross domestic product growth in the first half of this year, compared with the year-earlier period. Brazil absorbed $16.7 billion in foreign direct investment during the first six months of this year, putting it on pace to break 1999's record of $31.4 billion, when money poured into companies that the government had privatized, mainly in telecommunications. Between January and June, foreign and local companies combined unveiled plans for $138 billion in new projects for Brazil, not including mergers and acquisitions. Simonsen Associados, a Sao Paulo consulting firm that tracks intended investment, predicts that by the end of the year a further $99 billion in projects will be announced.  "Brazil is entering one of the best economic moments in its modern history," says Luiz Rabi, chief economist at Banco Industrial & Commercial SA, a Brazilian commercial bank. He cites declining unemployment, rising exports and stronger consumer spending as indicators of accelerating growth. Mr. Rabi predicts that Brazil's gross domestic product will grow between 4% and 5% a year in 2000 and 2001. Amid instability and a devaluation, Brazil's GDP expanded just 1% in 1999 to $558 billion.  "There is a self-congratulatory environment that is well deserved," says Paulo Leme, managing director of emerging markets at Goldman Sachs in New York. But he cautions that any easing of fiscal discipline, as Brazil nears presidential elections in 2002, could spoil the recovery. "It has been 30 years since Brazil has been in this position, to launch strong and sustainable growth for the next decade. The government cannot afford to loosen its grip."
