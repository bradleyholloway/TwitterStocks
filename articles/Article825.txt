 World-Wide [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1986  The president, in a nationally broadcast address, described as "utterly false" reports that the U.S. sold arms to Iran in a direct swap for Americans held in Lebanon. Reagan conceded, however, that he approved small shipments of military gear to Tehran in an effort to begin "a new relationship" with the Iranians. He said the shipments were both legal and in the national interest. Disclosure of the covert moves already has raised questions about the administration's credibility, both at home and abroad.  The body of Rolando Olalia, president of the Philippines People's Party and head of the country's labor federation, was discovered brutally murdered hours before Aquino returned from an official four-day visit to Japan. Olalia's family said it suspected that members of the military were responsible, but hadn't any proof. An Aquino cabinet minister said the murder "further aggravates" the government's problems.  U.S. prelates approved the final version of a pastoral letter that calls for increased government efforts to attack poverty and unemployment. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops' pastoral letter is designed to be a guide to Catholic thinking and teaching on the economy and an attempt to influence public debate.
