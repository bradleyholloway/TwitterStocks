 Eyes on the Road: Electric Car Maker Aims For the Top With Sports Car; Tesla Readies $98,000 Roadster And Looks to Expand Downward Online edition  By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  For those who somehow missed the blizzard of publicity that has swirled around this company for the past 18 months or so, Tesla (www.teslamotors.com) is a Silicon Valley start-up, bankrolled by some of the same people who brought you the Internet boom of the late 1990s. The company's stated ambition is to develop over the next several years a full array of electric cars. Tesla's fans -- many of them influential leaders of Silicon Valley's "clean tech" green- technology movement -- see Tesla as an icon of the broader effort to make big money by unshackling the U.S. economy from petroleum.  Last May, Mr. [Martin Eberhard] told a Senate committee that the company's second model would be a $50,000 sedan built in New Mexico, followed by an even more affordable car. Now, Mr. Eberhard is cagier about exactly what Tesla's "White Star" model line will be, and exactly when it will appear. "We are deep, deep into that," he says. "We are planning on building (cars) in Albuquerque. It's possible we might want to do something different."  "What problem was [John DeLorean] solving?" Mr. Eberhard asks in response to the inevitable question about how Tesla avoids DeLorean's fate. The DeLorean car, when it appeared, was not any better, in some ways not as good, as a Chevrolet Corvette that GM was offering for less money, he says. By contrast, Tesla is offering a product unlike any other. "Nobody produces a real electric car," he says.
