 `Sex and the City' Is a Hit in Asia --- Single, Working Women Follow Show, Spawning A Cross-Marketing Boom   By By Cris Prystay and Montira Narkvichien, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 9, 2002  "The series speaks for everything that is in the minds of most women," declares Bunyapattra Boribalbureephun, a single, 30-year-old public-relations consultant who lives in Bangkok, Thailand. Sporting a skin-baring gown and Chanel jewelry as she sips champagne at a "Shoes in the City" fashion show at Bangkok's elite Central Department Store, Ms. Boribalbureephun insists the New York-set show has real resonance. "Carrie's being a fashion chameleon and self-assured inspires me," she says, referring to the show's lead character, Carrie Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  HBO and its retail partners preceded the mall-based events in Manila with a monthlong "bar tour" in May, during which they showed advance episodes on big-screen televisions at popular night spots, followed by music by top DJs and product giveaways. L'Oreal, for example, had fashionably dressed salespeople cruising the bars handing out red Feria-brand hair color to patrons who said they identified best with the Miranda character (a redhead), and FX Studio Gel to the Carries (blondes) in the crowd. HBO is keenly aware of that connection, and the show's official Web site has links to stores that sell fashion items featured on the show.
