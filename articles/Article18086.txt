 Japanese Firms Mull Private Placement Now That Disclosure Rules Have Eased   By By Masayoshi Kanabayashi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1990  Japanese companies, especially banks, are looking closely at the possibility of offering securities through private placements in the U.S., now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has eased disclosure requirements.  Until recently, many Japanese companies were wary of offering securities in the U.S. because of SEC rules that required them to make extensive disclosures of important financial data. On April 30, however, the U.S. eased those requirements in an amendment known as Rule 144a.  U.S. investment banks now have seized on the new rule to approach normally secretive Japanese companies with the possibility of underwriting private placements in the U.S. So far, says Clive G.N. Galliver, a vice president at CS First Boston (Japan) Ltd., Japanese companies are studying the modification with "a great deal of curiosity, but also a great deal of caution."
