 Microsoft to Offer Handheld Product Called Palm PC   By By Lisa Bransten The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1998  The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant is expected today to announce specifications for a new product category it has called the Palm PC, which will be similar in size and capabilities to the PalmPilot device from 3Com Corp. subsidiary Palm Computing.  Consumer-electronics companies aren't expected to begin shipping devices based on the Microsoft design until sometime later this year, but Palm Computing executives already are gearing for battle. The Mountain View, Calif., company has contacted Microsoft's lawyers to voice their displeasure about the choice of a moniker so close to its own, and is considering stronger alternatives if Microsoft or its hardware partners use the Palm PC name to market their products.  The effort is the latest in a series of forays by Microsoft into the field. Two early designs, Windows for Pens and WinPad, flopped completely. Microsoft tried the handheld market again in 1996 with its Windows CE operating system, which has so far taken off slowly. Randy Giusto, director of mobile technology research at International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market-research firm, estimates that about 500,000 Windows CE-based devices were shipped to retailers or distributors in 1997, but only about half of those were sold to consumers. About a million PalmPilots have been sold to consumers.
