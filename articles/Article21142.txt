 Investors Retreat From European Firms That Rely Heavily on the U.S. Economy   By By John Marcom Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1987  Analysts say the reappraisal has just begun. But the heightened risk of a U.S. recession and the likelihood of further slides in the dollar's value already are hurting European companies most exposed to the U.S. economy. In the long term, U.S. expansion remains a sound strategy; in the short term, it could prove less brilliant.  "So far, the falls have been sort of indiscriminate," says Angus McNeilage, head of European sales at the London brokerage house James Capel & Co. "But I have not a shadow of a doubt that those stocks that will underperform in the months ahead will be those with heavy exposure to the U.S."  Some well-known names have been savaged. Jaguar PLC, the car maker that ships half its output across the Atlantic, at its nadir lost half its value in the market crash, a sharper fall than any other issue in the London exchange's 100-stock index. Such West German rivals as Daimler-Benz AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG aren't quite as dependent on the U.S., but they haven't escaped the jitters. Daimler yesterday closed 21% below its pre-crash level; BMW was off 28%.
