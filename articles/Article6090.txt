 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1998  The president, under political fire, argued his China policies chart a "principled and pragmatic" course between those who wish to isolate China for its human-rights violations and those who see commerce alone as the force for change. The president's address reflected the pressure he has come under as his June 24 departure nears. He said engagement with China fostered Asia's stability.  Islamabad, seeking to lessen friction with India, also hoped to allay the threat of international sanctions ahead of today's meeting in London of the five major nuclear powers and other states. India played down Pakistan's moratorium and a Pakistani offer to enter new bilateral peace talks, saying it had already announced a voluntary moratorium of its own after conducting five tests last month.  NATO defense ministers ordered military experts to begin planning for possible attacks against Serb targets in and around Kosovo. Stepping up pressure on Yugoslav leader Milosevic, the NATO ministers also agreed to mount simulated air raids in neighboring Macedonia and Albania in the coming days.
