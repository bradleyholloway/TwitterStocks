 Heralded Investors Suffer Huge Losses With Tyco Meltdown   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2002  Superstar money-managers including Bill Miller, Leon Cooperman, Richard Freeman, David Dreman and Jim Gipson all piled into Tyco stock in recent months. While most of these investors shunned Tyco shares when they were trading at their peak, they couldn't resist betting on the company once its shares dropped to the mid-$20 range, figuring they were bound to climb back.  So what were these star investors thinking? Most figured Tyco was unfairly beaten down by investors skittish about companies with any hint of aggressive accounting in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. Tyco was trading above $60 a share in December, before concerns first surfaced about its complex accounting. After Tyco was forced to exit the market for commercial paper, and Wall Street panned its split-up strategy, some of the savvy investors began buying up shares.  Others say that if Tyco's earnings and cash flow stay on track, the stock is a bargain. Mr. Gipson argues Tyco can earn $2.10 a share, even after it disposes of CIT, meaning the stock is trading at just about five times earnings, while the rest of the market is above 20. Others say Tyco is even cheaper on the basis of its expected revenue and cash flow.
