 FTC Chairman's Hands-Off View of Marketplace Prompts Scrutiny of Agency by Critics on the Hill   By By Andy Pasztor and Jeanne Sadler, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1987  Daniel Oliver often describes the government's "temptation to over-regulate" and interfere in the marketplace as the single greatest threat to consumers' welfare. "Almost everywhere we find cartel behavior, we find government in the background," the conservative lawyer says.  Such outspoken sentiments would attract little attention coming from a corporate executive, lobbyist or even an aide in President Reagan's business-oriented White House. As chairman of the Federal Trade Commission since last April, however, Mr. Oliver has stirred considerable controversy with his fervent free-market rhetoric.  Now, Mr. Oliver's critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere seem eager to strike back. Many experienced antitrust lawyers, including those who generally support the changes at the FTC in the past few years, worry that the chairman may be going too far in trying to put his philosophy into practice. Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are planning a flurry of oversight hearings in the next few months to examine the commission's recent decisions.
