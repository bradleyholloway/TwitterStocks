 German Stocks Start to Shine; Amid Cloudy Economy, Labor Costs Fall With Union Givebacks   By Sprothen, Vera, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2005  To be sure, some investors remain skeptical about the overall market's prospects. The blue-chip DAX 30 index is up 2.5% this year, trailing the U.K.'s FTSE 100, which is up 3.5%, and France's CAC 40, up 6%. The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index, which track 600 European blue chips, edged up 0.2% Friday and has climbed 4.8% so far this year.  Unions remain a big factor in many industries. Corporations with high exposure to collective-bargaining agreements have the opportunity to benefit the most from cutting labor costs, says Deutsche Bank's Mr. [Bernd Meyer]. Lufthansa, ThyssenKrupp, MAN and Deutsche Telekom, where more than half of all employees are paid according to such agreements, stand to benefit if they can cut costs, he points out.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index rose 19.90, or 0.4%, to 4982.00, ending a four-day losing streak. Hotel and leisure group Whitbread shares surged 7.7% after it confirmed it's in talks that "may or may not" lead to the sale of all or some of its Marriott U.K. hotel assets.
