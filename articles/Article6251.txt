 Letters to the Editor: Invincibly Ignorant   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1999  Jacob Heilbrun's Oct. 1 editorial-page essay "Nobel Committee Is, Well, Red" is correct to remind us that the last three recipients of the Nobel Prize for literature (Dario Fo of Italy, Jose Saramago of Portugal and now Gunter Grass of Germany) have all been what we should call "communoid" -- meaning communist-like. These are typically leftist "intellectuals" who no longer, or perhaps never did, quite admit to being communists, but who are perpetual apologists for the criminality of that variety of police-state socialism.  -- Susan Sontag: "Not only is fascism (and overt military rule) the probable destiny of all Communist societies -- especially when their populations are moved to revolt -- but Communism is itself a variant, the most successful variant, of fascism."  -- Andrei Sakharov (Russian dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, to Soviet officials at 1978 trial of fellow dissident Anatoly Shcharansky): "You are not humans. You are fascists. Hear me, a member of the Academy of Sciences. You are fascists."
