 Americas: No Absolution for Castro's Regime [2]  By O'Grady, Mary Anastasia, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2003  Now Cuba's bishops are pushing further. In a paper released on Sept. 8, they have openly condemned the regime. "In Cuba," writes Vatican- watcher Sandro Magister in Italy's online magazine Chiesa, "the document is being circulated clandestinely and one can understand why: it's the most explicit and reasoned act of accusation the bishops of the island have ever made, unanimously, against the regime of [Fidel Castro]. And Castro, so far, has not replied."  Indeed, the bishop's document, which is posted in its entirety, in Spanish, on the Miami Archdiocese Web site, La Voz Catolica, doesn't mince words: "Notwithstanding the new language and the space that appeared to open during the days of the visit of the Holy Father," the bishops write, "we have seen almost immediately after it, the beginning of an apparent process of revision that does not favor the aspirations of pluralism, tolerance and opening that we discerned on the national horizon."  Afro-Cubans are supposed to be especially grateful to the regime, so Mr. [Jorge Luis Antunez]'s dissidence does not sit well with Fidel or his henchmen. He has been beaten repeatedly and locked in punishment dungeons without water. He has testified that he once heard a Cuban doctor, assigned to treat his wounds, announce "This Antunez's life is worthless because he is a black counterrevolutionary. He should pray to God he doesn't fall into my hands."
