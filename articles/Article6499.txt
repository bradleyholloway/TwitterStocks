 Letters to the Editor: A Sad Disdain for ROTC   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2001  As a Harvard faculty member, I have always been saddened by the university's policy toward ROTC ("Bring Back ROTC? No, Not at Harvard, Despite New Support," page one, Oct. 4). To protest the military's policy toward homosexuals, the faculty and administration (who are mostly liberal and upper-income) place a burden on students interested in ROTC training (who, I suspect, are mostly conservative and from working-class families). This policy acts like a tax on diversity among the student body, if diversity is judged by viewpoint and life experience,and thus works against one of the school's stated goals.
