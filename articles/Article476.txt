Question:I want to go to the Middle East next year. Can you tell me what the best months are, from the point of view of weather, for Israel and Egypt? I am available from November through April. - E.J.H., New York, N.Y. Answer:Israel's weather during December and January can vary from cold with rainy squalls - even occasional snowfalls - in Jerusalem and northern Israel to much milder weather in the Negev, the desert in the southern part of the country.  February and March bring changable, winter-into-spring weather; by April it is really spring with drier, sunny weather that is more like May and June in New York.  An American who lived in Israel for two years recommended that you bring a sweater, and rain gear that is more substantial than a simple plastic coverall, to cope with the changes in temperature and precipitation from one part of the country to another.  Egypt's climate is that of a desert with daytime temperatures that are markedly higher than nighttime. The winter months, from December through March, are considered the best months for travelers since daytime temperatures are likely to be in the 50's, 60's and 70's (though there can be wind and rain immediately along the Mediterranean coast). Beginning in April the daytime temperatures start to climb into the 80's, and there can be dust storms caused by winds called the khamsin. In the southern part of the country, known as Upper Egypt, where you'll want to visit archeological sites, daytime temperatures are likely to be 10 to 15 degrees higher than in Cairo.  When you have determined an itinerary, carefully pick out clothing that suits the places you are going as well as providing you with layers that can be taken off and put back on as necessary to cope with the changes. Modesty, which is asked for in holy places, and the sun, which is strong all over the Middle East, mandate covering one's head and body with simple, sturdy fabrics such as cotton and cotton blends that keep you comfortable and protect you from sunburn. Question:I will be taking a cruise from New York to Bermuda during the month of July. I would like to know what type of wardrobe, including day and evening clothes, to bring with me. - E.D., Clifton, N.J. Answer:An American who has lived in Bermuda (which is nearly 700 miles off the coast of North Carolina) and has traveled frequently between New York and Bermuda by ship, suggests that you select the kind of casual, fashionable clothes you would wear at a resort in the United States.  Take one dressy outfit, long or short, for the captain's dinner or a visit to a nightclub in the port of Hamilton, where long or short dresses are equally acceptable for evening wear. Take a shawl or sweater for cooler evenings on shipboard or on the water. Anything may be worn on the beach but too-skimpy attire is frowned on in town. Bermuda shorts, which are returning to fashion once more, and a head scarf are good for cycling around the island.  Don't forget a sunscreen lotion; though the sun may not seem as strong as further south in the Caribbean, you will still get burned if you do not protect your skin.  And within two to three blocks of the dock in Hamilton you will find lots of shops in which to buy anything you forgot to bring along. Question:I will be traveling throughout Germany in July and part of August and am interested in what the Berlin Philharmonic has scheduled. Can you tell me how to find out about this? - R.C.W., Brooklyn. Answer:Local tourist offices are situated in every city and town in West Germany and can provide you with detailed information on all kinds of events. And though the Berlin Philharmonic may be elsewhere during the summer, you can write to the Verkehrsamt Berlin (Europa Center, 1000 Berlin 30, Federal Republic of Germany) and ask for a schedule of performances.  For the addresses of other local tourist information offices send a list of the cities and towns on your itinerary, along with your name and address, to the German National Tourist Office, 747 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017 (212-308-3300).  Readers are invited to send written questions about travel to Q & A, Travel Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.
