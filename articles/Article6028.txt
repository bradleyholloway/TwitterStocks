 Jobless Rate Suggests Recovery Isn't Near --- Unemployment Hits 5.7% Economists Predict Fed Will Cut Rates Again   By By Jon E. Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  The unemployment rate jumped to 5.7% in November, its highest level in more than six years, the Labor Department said Friday. Employers cut payrolls by 331,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, taking steam out of some economists' predictions that the U.S. economy had begun to crawl out of recession.  "We're still in a recession and the door is still open to easing monetary policy," said Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist. He, like many others, expects the Fed to reduce the benchmark federal-funds rate by one quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%, its lowest level since 1961.  Friday's job report also helped to cement the view that the current recession is no mild one for millions of U.S. workers. Since the economy officially turned south in March, the jobless rate has increased 1.4 percentage points, a slightly greater rise than the average for the six previous recessions dating back to 1960. Employment has fallen by 1.2 million jobs, on a seasonally adjusted basis, since March. That drop almost is as large as the decline during the first eight months of the 1990 recession, though the number of people working is much larger. The employment decline during the past three months alone has been the largest for a three-month period since 1980.
