 Medicare -- Get Your Share   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2005  First, rising costs are not in your -- or your parents' -- head. The monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits, increased 17% to $78.20 last month. Meanwhile, 31 of the 50 top- selling medicines in the drug industry rose in price in the past few months, with a monthly supply of Pfizer Inc.'s cholesterol-fighting Lipitor climbing some 5% to about $120.  The aging council is urging family and friends to help candidates for the savings programs use its BenefitsCheckUp tool, which is available at www.benefitscheckup.org, to figure out whether they qualify. The BenefitsCheckUp tool will check your eligibility based on the rules where you live and figure out whether you qualify for other government benefits as well, including state-run drug-assistance programs. The aging council also is promoting the use of another financial tool -- reverse mortgages -- to help people afford preventive health care that could delay, or alleviate altogether, the need to move into an assisted-living facility or nursing home.  "We want to let parents know that their kids would like them to do things to take care of themselves," says James Firman, the council's president and CEO. "They're not waiting around for their inheritance."
