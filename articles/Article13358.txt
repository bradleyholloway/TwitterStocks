 Subprime Investors Turn Risk-Averse   By Shrivastava, Anusha, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2007  "It's about time," said Mark Adelson, managing director and head of structured finance research at Nomura Securities. Risk premiums "were way, way too tight and now we have moved into stressful times."  "The fundamentals of the market are weighing on the index," said Alex Pritchartt, a trader at UBS. "People are trying to balance risk with reward."  "The market was set up for a relatively weak number and it came in quite a bit stronger than even we were looking for," said Michael Pond, Treasury and inflation-linked strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.
