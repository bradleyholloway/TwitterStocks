 Acxiom Rejects $2 Billion Offer From ValueAct   By Bauerlein, Valerie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2005  The Little Rock, Ark., company said it had refused to even enter negotiations with ValueAct Capital, a San Francisco investment firm that owns about a 10.4% stake in Acxiom. The move came about a week after ValueAct offered to buy all of the Acxiom shares it doesn't own for $23 apiece and said it was confident it could obtain needed debt financing.  In an interview, Jeffrey Ubben, a managing member of ValueAct, declined to comment on ValueAct's next move but insisted that the investment firm doesn't intend to abandon its acquisition push. Acxiom directors "ignored a 25% premium offer, lowered earnings and ignored that we are willing to pay more if we can get access to the company," Mr. Ubben said, indicating that ValueAct is prepared to sweeten its offer.
