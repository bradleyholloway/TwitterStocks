 First Data Trades Suggest Leak   By Dana Cimilluca and Serena Ng, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2007  First Data has been the subject of buyout speculation in recent months, meaning the announcement didn't come as a complete surprise to investors. But rumors weren't circulating last week in a way that would account for the trading in the CDS market, said Tim Backshall of Credit Derivatives Research in Walnut Creek, Calif.  The unusual trading activity follows a pattern lately in big LBOs. The sheer number of bankers, lawyers and others needed to pull off the deals increases the odds of leaks. Activity in the options and swaps of HCA Inc., Freescale Semiconductor and Harrah's Entertainment suggests that some investors might have been positioning themselves ahead of those deals, possibly on insider knowledge.
