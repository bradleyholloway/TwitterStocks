 Murdoch's Editors Know His Voice; London's Times Offers Glimpse Of Hands-On Way the Mogul Runs His Newspaper Empire   By Martin Peers and Aaron O. Patrick, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2007  Mr. [Rupert Murdoch] grew up around newspapers, and even while he runs a vast global media empire, has long been famous for his willingness to check layouts and change headlines, former editors say. "He would point to a picture and say 'that photo shouldn't be cropped like that,'" says Peter Stothard, a former editor of the Times who still works for News Corp. as editor of Times Literary Supplement. "And you know, he was always right."  To win control of the Times and its Sunday sibling, Mr. Murdoch made certain promises about retaining the independence of the paper. According to Mr. [Harold Evans]'s book, "Good Times, Bad Times," these included a guarantee that "the editors would have control of the political policy of their newspapers . . . [and] freedom within fixed annual budgets" and "that the editors would not be subject to instruction from either the proprietor or management on the selection and balance of news and opinion." Instructions to journalists were to be given "only by their editor."  "In my year as editor of the Times, Murdoch broke all these guarantees," Mr. Evans wrote, quoting Mr. Murdoch telling a Times editor that they were "not worth the paper they're written on." Another example cited by Mr. Evans: Mr. Murdoch once told an editor not to worry about whether a cartoon of just-assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat was tasteful. "We want to sell newspapers. Print it!"
