 Gopher Politics   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1998  We're trying this week to understand the logic of Republican budget politics. We think it works like this: If Bill Clinton says publicly he wants $1 billion to build gopher sanctuaries, and if a Republican is running for re-election somewhere with a lot of gophers, then the President gets what he wants for gopher sanctuaries.  Bill Clinton wants more money to build teacher sanctuaries, which he calls schools. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott assured the nation that Republicans were not opposed to additional funding for education. Mr. Clinton promptly called for a $2.1 billion tax-and-bond construction issue for new teacher sanctuaries.  Now if you'll climb up here in the bleacher seats with us, you can watch the Republican team compete at gopher politics on the Beltway prairie by falling to the ground. As you know, a big Republican issue is school vouchers, an idea growing in popularity among parents whose kids are going nowhere in inner-city schools. Arguably the worst, large public-school system is in the District of Columbia. Last year 7,600 District families applied for 1,000 available spots in a private pilot program. Vouchers for D.C. have become the symbol of this nationwide movement, which is opposed by the unionists who run the teacher sanctuaries.
