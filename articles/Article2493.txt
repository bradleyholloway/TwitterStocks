 High court ruling may force states to refund taxes to federal retirees   By Barrett, Paul M, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1993  As a result of a Jun 18, 1993 ruling by the Supreme Court, more than a dozen states could have to pay tax refunds totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to federal retirees. The decision, which questioned how states should apply a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said they couldn't tax the pensions of federal retirees more heavily than those of state and local retirees, is discussed.
