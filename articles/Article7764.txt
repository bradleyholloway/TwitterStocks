 There but for a Few Voice Lessons Might Have Gone All the Osmonds   By By Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1988  "I recall posting invoices, deposit slips or checks in accounting journals or ledgers with other kids in my family," says Mrs. Curtis, a 24-year-old resident of Farmer City, Ill.

Mrs. Curtis's parents, George and Mary Monical of Pontiac, Ill., are both certified public accountants -- as are six of their 17 children. Mrs. Curtis, an accountant who works part-time for her parents, is now studying to make it seven.
