 `A Scheme to Commit Illegal Activities'   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1997  From Rep. Bob Barr's (R., Ga.) exchange with Attorney General Janet Reno during the House Judiciary Committee hearings Oct. 15:  It seems to me, Madam Attorney General, that you could take any one of those films, and perhaps any one portion thereof and fly-speck it. Put it under a microscope and treat it as the Department has seemed to have treated pieces of evidence that has (sic) come before it or that this committee has provided to it, put it under a microscope, parse it, dissect it just as carefully as possible, much like, for example, if there was a traffic cop coming upon the scene of a 50-car pile-up, takes out a microscope, looks at the 37th car in line and determines that the tail light wasn't working.
