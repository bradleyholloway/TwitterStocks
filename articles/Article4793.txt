 Justice Bork: Helping to Restore A Proper Balance   By By Ralph Adam Fine, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1987  Currently on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., Judge Bork is recognized as perhaps this country's most distinguished judicial scholar. He has been a law professor at Yale and solicitor general of the U.S. As solicitor general, he was in charge not only of representing the U.S. before the Supreme Court but also of deciding when the government should appeal decisions to higher courts. It is the only position in government required by statute to be filled by someone "learned in the law."  Commenting on Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, Geoffrey Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, called it "a four-star appointment" and commented that it was rare "to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials." Indeed, when Judge Bork was nominated for the appeals court post in 1981, the Senate unanimously approved.  As Columbia University law Prof. Herbert Wechsler explained almost 30 years ago, a neutral-principled judicial decision rests "on reasons that in their generality and their neutrality transcend any immediate result that is involved." Judge Bork's elevation to the Supreme Court may very well tip the balance toward this neutrality of interpretation, and there are those who fear that the court -- no longer able to do what the individual justices may think is "good" or "moral" or "right" -- will reject activist social, economic and criminal-justice agendas.
