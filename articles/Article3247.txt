 Leading the News: Consumer Business Aids Big Banks; Wachovia, Bank of America Earnings Rose in Quarter; SEC Queries FleetBoston   By Carrick Mollenkamp and John Hechinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2004  Concerning mutual funds, FleetBoston said two subsidiaries, Columbia Management Advisors Inc., and Columbia Funds Distributor Inc., received so-called Wells notices, indicating the SEC's Boston office was likely to recommend that the full commission bring enforcement action against the units. The company said the SEC is alleging that "certain fund prospectuses did not accurately disclose, in violation of fiduciary duties, certain trading activity in fund shares."  FleetBoston said the allegations relate to "a limited number of trading arrangements" made primarily by "three entities" from 1998 to 2003 in one international and two domestic funds it declined to name. Fleet's Columbia unit has about $160 billion in assets under management. FleetBoston said it had set aside a $50 million litigation reserve related to "heightened scrutiny" in the financial-services industry. In speaking with investors, Mr. [Robert Lamb Jr.] said he didn't believe the potential action would slow down the merger with Bank of America. A FleetBoston spokesman declined to elaborate on the SEC allegations. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
