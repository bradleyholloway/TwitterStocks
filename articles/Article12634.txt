 Deals & Deal Makers: Japan's Softbank Freezes Two E-Ventures In Europe With News Corp. and Vivendi   By By Charles Fleming, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2000  EVentures, equally owned by Softbank and News Corp.'s epartners investment arm, was effectively closed down last week and its 12 United Kingdom employees have been laid off, said Mark Booth, epartners' chief executive. "Our allocated capital is better used on early-stage investments than bringing U.S. subsidiaries to Europe," Mr. Booth said. "Stock-market conditions are just too tough for that," he added. News Corp. and Softbank will continue to work together under the eVentures name in India, Australia and New Zealand, where the two have made a number of direct investments in start-up companies.
