 Supreme Court to Review Issue of Punitive Damages   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1988  The justices will decide whether the Eighth Amendment prohibition of "excessive fines" applies to punitive damages in civil trials or is limited to criminal fines. If the justices say the amendment applies to civil cases, they must set guidelines for courts to apply in deciding when punitive awards are excessive.  The issue has sparked substantial interest in recent years as more and more courts have been asked by lawyers for corporate defendants to declare large punitive awards unconstitutional. This proliferation grew out of two previous unsuccessful Supreme Court attempts, one in 1986 and the other earlier this year, to resolve the issue. Both times, the high court disposed of the cases on other issues, but each time the justices remarked on the importance of the question about punitive damages.  This time, there are no other issues. The high court agreed to hear an appeal by Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., challenging a $6 million punitive-damage award. Although Browning-Ferris also raised issues of antitrust law in its appeal, the justices agreed to rule only on the constitutionality of punitive damages.
