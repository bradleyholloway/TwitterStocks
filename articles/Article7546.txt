 Jailhouse Author: Jean Harris Tells Her Story   By By Helen Dudar, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1986  Mrs. Jean Harris, a newly minted author, sits in a glassed-in visitors' room in New York State's maximum-security women's prison and says wryly that she wrote her first book with a singular advantage. Deadpan, she reports the boon as if some benefactor had granted her a generous gift of leisure: no phone to answer, no marketing chores, no dinners to cook, in short, plenty of time.  The time, to be precise, is 15 years to life. The term was imposed in 1981 after she was found guilty of murdering Herman Tarnower, 69, the Westchester cardiologist and famed Scarsdale Diet doctor who was to achieve larger posthumous celebrity as the caddish lover of numerous women, among them, Jean Harris. The state charged that, after 14 years, some of them happy, Mrs. Harris shot him in a storm of jealousy. Since they were both beyond their middle years and since Mrs. Harris was headmistress of Madeira, the poshest sort of girls' school, the affair was a natural prurient feast for tabloids. In retrospect, however, it seems more like updated Thomas Hardy.  Mrs. Harris's "Stranger in Two Worlds" (Macmillan, 388 pages, $18.95), an account of her times before, during and after Tarnower, has gotten surprised, largely favorable notice and early reviews, the kind of book editors schedule when they think they see a winner and want to be the first to say so. It is a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate, and had a lavish first printing of 100,000 copies. Under the state's Son of Sam law, the profits must go to the Crime Victims Board, where they are expected to be a target for civil suits by Dr. Tarnower's heirs. Mrs. Harris had hoped that her royalties could go to her favorite charity, a foundation to help provide higher education for the children of fellow prisoners, many of them black, poor, illiterate and emotionally impoverished.
