 Korean Auto Maker's Big Loss for '94 Leads to Speculation About Takeover   By By Steve Glain, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1995  Prospects for Kia Motors Corp., South Korea's No. 2 auto manufacturer, aren't the brightest.  Earlier this month, Kia Motors' share price rose from a low of 11,600 won ($14.93) to a high of 13,800 won on speculation that the LG Group, Korea's third-largest conglomerate, was amassing Kia Motors' stock, either for a friendly merger or a takeover. LG, formerly Lucky Goldstar Group, denied the rumors, and Kia Motors says it has "never considered the possibility" of a merger.  Kia Motors' shares closed Monday at 12,900 won, about 150 times the per-share earnings forecast for 1996, according to Dongbang Peregrine Securities Co. The average price-earnings ratio for companies on the Seoul stock market is 15. Still, analysts say the possibility that Kia Motors will be a takeover target makes it a speculative play.
