 Time Off: A Week of Diversions   By By Stuart Ferguson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2000  Juxtaposing more than 100 paintings and photographs depicting the Midwest from the 1920s, '30s and '40s with commissioned installations by four contemporary artists, "Illusions of Eden" presents works that capture the unique character and spirit of a 12-state region stretching from the Great Lakes and the Dakotas to northern Missouri. Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton and Margaret Bourke-White are some of the artists found in the "historical" section, while Malcolm Cochran, Maya Lin, Mary Lucier and Kerry James Marshall represent the present; all four have ties to the region. The contrasts range across categories as well as eras. The artists address themes such as "work" (labor and the creation of goods), "garden" (topography and nature), "word" (myth, memory and belief) and "home" (family and society).
