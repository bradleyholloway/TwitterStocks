 Proposal to overhaul food-safety laws to be unveiled today by White House   By Noah, Timothy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1993  The Clinton administration is scheduled to unveil a set of proposals on Sep 21, 1993 covering food safety. The proposals attempt to establish a uniform safety standard for raw and processed foods that requires "reasonable certainty of no harm." The plan also establishes a three-year "fast track" for evaluating pesticides believed to be unsafe, which replaces the harsher "Delaney clause."
