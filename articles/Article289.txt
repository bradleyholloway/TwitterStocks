HARTFORD (AP) - Hartford Democrats will go to the polls today for a second time this fall in an attempt to select a mayoral candidate to represent their party in November's election. The results of the first primary on Sept. 8 were discarded after they were challenged in court.  The four candidates in the first primary remain in the race. They are Mayor George Athanson, State Representative Thirman L. Milner, Deputy Mayor Robert F. Ludgin and Johanna C. Murphy.  Mr. Athanson beat Mr. Milner by 94 votes, 5,229 to 5,135. Mr. Ludgin finished with 3,067 votes and Mrs. Murphy with 2,343. Mr. Milner filed the lawsuit in Superior Court challenging the outcome. The winner of the primary will face the Republican nominee, Michael T. McGarry.
