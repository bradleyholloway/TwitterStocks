 Key Member of Jemaah Islamiyah Is Arrested, in a Blow to Network   By By Leslie Lopez, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2002  Ali Gufron, who is better known by his alias Mukhlas, was arrested in a small town in central Java early yesterday, Indonesian police said. Mr. Mukhlas is believed to have played a key role in the Oct. 12 Bali bombings that killed more than 180 people, mostly Australian and other Western tourists. Intelligence officials allege that Mr. Mukhlas recently took over as Jemaah Islamiyah's operations leader from Riduan Isamuddin. Mr. Riduan, the radical Indonesian cleric also known as Hambali, has been implicated in several terrorist plots in Asia in recent years and remains at large.  Prior to yesterday's raid, Indonesian police had arrested 19 suspects in connection with the Bali bombings. Police also have detained Jemaah Islamiyah's alleged spiritual leader, Indonesian Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Baasyir, but haven't linked him directly to the Bali attacks. Mr. Baasyir denies leading Jemaah Islamiyah or having any involvement in terrorist acts.
