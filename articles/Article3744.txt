 Ann Taylor's Loftier Goal: A More Upscale Shopper   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2007  "We know there's a client there who has an appetite for more upscale, expensive product," says Adrienne Lazarus, president of the Ann Taylor brand, a division of AnnTaylor Stores Corp. In some of the top-selling Ann Taylor locations around the country, she says, "we're sitting next to Neiman's, Prada, Gucci."  Even as chains offering more expensive goods are thriving, Ann Taylor and other midlevel women's apparel retailers have been struggling. To grab more affluent working women who aren't feeling pinched in the pocketbook, the company is introducing a line in its Ann Taylor stores that's a big step up -- 40% more expensive than its usual merchandise. The line, called Collection, includes about 50 items, and it's built around the work-appropriate suits and dresses that created Ann Taylor's reputation. Suit jackets will sell for $295 to $365, and pants for $175 to $195. Collection also includes silk tops for $120 to $195, $165 cashmere sweaters and handbags priced from $295 to $350. Most of the fabrics used in Collection, such as Loro Piana cashmere, come from Italy, and some are used in high-end designer lines.  Kim Roffey, a retail strategist with consulting firm Kurt Salmon Associates, says specialty retail's move higher is "an effort to capture some of that dollar that's going to luxury." But she says it's unclear whether moderately priced retailers will persuade their regular customers to trade up amid a difficult economy. Ms. Roffey says customers at midlevel stores will probably be willing to spend $500 on a special item. But if prices soar above $1,000, she says, "that's where the middle-market consumer really does get nervous."
