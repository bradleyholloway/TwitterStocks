 What to Do Amid All the Big Deals   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2005  For investors, the best way to make money at the takeover game usually is to be a holder of a company that receives a takeover offer. To entice such companies to agree to a deal, the would-be acquirer offers a takeover price that is a premium to where the target's shares had been trading, sending the target's stock surging. Gillette, for example, shot up 13% in a day when Procter & Gamble confirmed that it would make an offer valued at a whopping $52.4 billion.  For shareholders of the companies doing the buying, the M&A resurgence is more dubious. The sad reality is that most large mergers just don't work out, despite all the hoopla usually surrounding them. Just look at the aftermath of the Time Warner-AOL merger. Executives clash, visions of synergies often aren't borne out and the heavy cost of the deals sometimes comes back to haunt buyers.  So, which kinds of companies will see takeover targets in the months ahead? Often when deals pick up in a business they put pressure on executives in rival companies to consider also selling. That's why some investors, such as Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Trust in Chicago, say Kellogg and Colgate-Palmolive could be tempted to accept a takeover offer, to compete better with a merged P&G- Gillette.
