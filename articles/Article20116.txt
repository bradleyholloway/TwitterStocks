 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: On the Cutting Edge   By Passy, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2007  Kershaw Shun Electric Knife Sharpener Cutlery and More cutleryandmore.com; 800-650-9866 $59.95; free ground shipping The good: One-step electric machine was relatively small, about the size of a pencil sharpener. The bad: It was the poorest performer of the bunch. Blades didn't get too sharp and edges were "rippled," one chef said. The manufacturer says it works best with Shun knives, which the retailer's site didn't mention. The shopping: Online store specializes in all things knife-related, and stocks more than two dozen electric sharpeners.  Using a set of very dull knives, we tested five models -- four electric and one manual -- with David Pantone, dean of culinary education at the Florida Culinary Institute in West Palm Beach, Fla., and a few of his colleagues. The devices weren't completely foolproof; some could easily chew up the knife if you didn't guide the blade through relatively quickly. The best model, a new electric from Chef's Choice, brought the blades back to life with a fairly simple-to-follow process. It works on a wide range of styles, including straight, serrated, Santoku and pocket knives. (All sharpeners may not work with all knives. Asian blades, in particular, can require special handling.) Still, it requires some finesse, so practice first on your cheapest knives.
