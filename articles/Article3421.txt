 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: Private Properties   By McMullen, Troy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  AT NEW YORK'S Kips Bay Decorator Show House in New York this weekend, visitors can pick up more than decorating tips: The house is on sale too. The Upper East Side townhouse hosting the annual event, which showcases the work of interior designers, is on the market for $20 million. Janna Bullock, a developer known for restoring landmark properties, purchased the five-story building last year for $9.5 million, city records show. She bought it from Arthur Carter, publisher of the New York Observer weekly in Manhattan. The building served as the Observer's headquarters until last fall. Built in 1907, the 25-foot-wide townhouse measures about 12,500 square feet with eight bedrooms, five full baths and two half baths. Mrs. Bullock renovated the home, says Marie Stewart, director of marketing for the show house. Shel Joblin and C.B. Whyte, of Stribling & Associates, have the listing. At the three-week Kips Bay event, in its 33rd year, a different designer decorates each room in the show house. The event takes its name from the group it benefits, the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club of New York.  Rick Higgins of Higgins Group in Westport, Conn., which has the listing, says he expects the home to get "serious offers" soon and that Mr. [Jack Welch] turned down a "pretty good offer" -- higher than the current asking price -- when it first hit the market two years ago. "Frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't sold," says Mr. Higgins.
