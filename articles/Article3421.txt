 Gruesome Purposes and Counting Machines   By By Geoffrey Wheatcroft, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2001  That is not all, says [Edwin Black] in "IBM and the Holocaust." IBM in effect played a significant part in the German war effort, he claims, and in what became the systematic extermination of the European Jews. Clearly the Germans placed high value on [Herman Hollerith] card machines. After the fall of France in 1940, they commandeered 319 of them in France and took them back to Germany to add to their own, where they were invaluable for war industries and the Luftwaffe.  IBM's record was not attractive, to put it mildly. But with his implied case against innate corporate wickedness, Mr. Black makes a self-defeating argument. The capitalist free market is indeed amoral. It is an efficient system for investment and production but cannot achieve moral aims itself. In this it resembles its physical technology. A hypodermic syringe can be used to inject cyanide or penicillin. It is not an independent moral agent. And that goes for a pocket calculator, a computer or a punch-card machine. Censuses were conducted by the Nazis using the latest technology, for wicked ends. A census has just been conducted in the U.S., using the latest technology, for what are meant to be benign ends.  Nor was IBM's role in any sense vital. Mr. Black concedes that the Holocaust would have taken place whether or not Hollerith had ever invented his punch-card, IBM been born, or Germany become its second biggest customer. But he claims that this technology made the great murder faster and more efficient. Even this is debatable, and confidence in the book is not enhanced by some sweeping statements.
