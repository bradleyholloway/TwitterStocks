 Justices Will Hear Case Involving Property, Casualty Insurer Taxes   By By Edward Felsenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1997  The case involves a provision in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Before then, property and casualty insurers each year were allowed to deduct the amount of claims they paid out as well as the amount of increases they made in their reserves to cover unpaid claims. But Congress decided it wasn't fair to let insurers deduct the full amount of reserve increases because they would then get a windfall by earning interest on the money until the claims were paid.  The Tax Reform Act required insurers to discount their deductions. But, to help insurers with the transition, Congress didn't require such discounts on at least some kinds of increases in loss reserves made during 1986. The industry and the Internal Revenue Service disagree about what kinds of reserve increases are exempt from the discounts.
