 Food & Drink -- Cooking: Batali Fires All Burners --- Next for the chef: a Singapore eatery, a New York grocery, grandmas on TV   By McLaughlin, Katy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2010  Mario Batali, whose collection of 14 upscale restaurants in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas had $140 million in sales last year, he says, will chart new territory this year. He's getting into the grocery business with a 50,000-square-foot Italian gourmet emporium in Manhattan, slated for mid-September. For the first time, his company is replicating restaurant concepts: His Mozza restaurants will open in Singapore this fall, and most likely there will be a Pizzeria Mozza in Orange County next spring. He also plans a television show in which "the old babes" of Sicily -- Italian grandmothers -- show him their secrets.
