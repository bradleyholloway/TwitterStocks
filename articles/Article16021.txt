 With World Markets in Disarray, Some Strategists Start to Reposition Portfolios in Favor of Bonds   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  In Friday market activity, Asian markets fell sharply across the board following a profit warning from U.S. software company Oracle. Tokyo resumed its slump, declining an additional 3.3% as the Nikkei 225 Index approaches the 12000 mark. European stocks were also lower, led by renewed selling in the technology sector. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 1.06 points, or 0.54%, to 195.94. Excluding the U.S., the index dropped 0.90 point, or 0.62%, to 145.22.  U.S. corporate earnings growth (weighted for the size of profits, instead of stock-market capitalization) fell a quarter of a percentage point in February to 14.75%. It could, of course, be just a blip, but Mr. [Albert Edwards] is betting it is among the first signs of the Nasdaq disease spreading to the broader U.S. stock market.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index fell 0.8%, or 50 points, to 5858.60. Tech shares led the decline. Autonomy tumbled 13% to GBP 11.90, while Dimension Data was down 2.6% to GBP 3.92. Cable & Wireless was off 4.5% to GBP 6.85 and COLT Telecom fell 3.7% to GBP 11.42. British Airways had a second consecutive bad day, closing down 6.1% to GBP 3.515 after Thursday's profit warning from peer US Airways. Analysts said US Airways' problems marked the beginning of an industrywide problem. Rolls-Royce posted annual results in line with expectations and its shares gained 12% to GBP 2.145.
