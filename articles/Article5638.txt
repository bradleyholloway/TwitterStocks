 Rate Concerns Are Taking Toll On Whirlpool --- Concern's Stock Has Fallen, But Analysts Question Sensitivity to Rates   By By Maria Mooshil, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1994  "Whirlpool is highly institutionally held," Kemper Securities analyst Jerry Herman said, and "interest rates are a focal point for institutional investors at this point."  The theory is that higher interest rates dampen new-home purchases, which squelches demand for new-home furnishings and appliances. Investors historically have used interest rates and housing activity to gauge Whirlpool's expected performance.  That frustrates some analysts who contend the company isn't as sensitive to interest rates as the market perceives. Only 7% of the Benton Harbor, Mich., appliance maker's business is related to new housing, they said. Furthermore, the stock is a bargain, trading at 10 times next year's earnings projections, a steep discount to the S&P 400 rate of 15 to 16 times earnings. Despite their frustration, analysts understand that when it comes to the stock market, perception is as good as reality.
