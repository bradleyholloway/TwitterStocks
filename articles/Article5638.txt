 China Sets Boost in Domestic Spending --- Plan's Scope Is Unclear; Banks to Extend Loans To Beijing's Exporters   By By Joshua Cherin and Marcus W. Brauchli, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1998  Meanwhile, Chinese banks will extend special loans to loss-ridden state-owned exporting companies "with orders on hand and earning potential" to support China's export growth, the Shanghai Securities News said. Export growth fell to 7.6% in the first half of this year from 20.9% in all of 1997. Orders from Asia have plunged in the wake of the region's financial crisis, and economists worry that demand from North America and Europe looks precarious.  Moving the economy's dependence away from export orders means shifting priorities away from the factory-littered coastal provinces to the mainland's vast interior, where its 900 million peasants live. Programs to support grain prices and boost investment in rural infrastructure are spreading fast; much of the money to be raised by a 100 billion yuan ($12.08 billion) bond issue announced last week is earmarked for rural projects, government officials say.
