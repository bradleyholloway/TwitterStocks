 Wonder Land: Ohio's Marines Are Remembered And Understood   By Henninger, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2005  Both the memorial-fence poets and some of the speakers in the big hall drew a straight line between the Marines' service and sacrifice in Iraq and the way we are able to live back home. "For more than 200 years," said Brook Park Mayor Mark J. Elliott, "Americans have put their lives on the line to protect our freedom." Someone said the Pledge of Allegiance, which in this version was "under God." They listened to some other speeches by public figures, played "Taps" and walked out.  In "Lincoln," David Herbert Donald describes the passage of public sentiment during the Civil War from enthusiasm to condemnation: "Many Northerners were euphoric at the outbreak of war, confident that the Union with its vast natural resources, its enormous superiority in manufactures, its 300% advantage in railroad mileage was bound to prevail. . . . Seward thought the war would be over in 90 days. . . . The New York Times predicted victory in 30 days." We know what happened. And the mood changed. Ohio Rep. Clement L. Vallandigham took to the House floor and "denounced Lincoln's effort to restore the Union by war as an 'utter, disastrous, and most bloody failure.' The President, Vallandigham said, had made the United States into 'one of the worst despotisms on earth.'"
