 Insiders Are Not Always Best Judges Of Future Course of a Company's Stock   By By Alexandra Peers Staff Reporter ofThe Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1991  Investors looking for clues to the stock market's future course would have done better not following the example of several company chairmen or presidents who sold millions of dollars of their companies' shares this year.  Consider Arnold Hiatt, chairman of Stride Rite Corp., the Cambridge, Mass., shoe manufacturer, who sold 95,000 shares between Feb. 11 and Feb. 28. The shares, which fetched $3.4 million, represented about 27% of his stockholdings in the company.  SciMed's closing price yesterday in over-the-counter trading was $49.75. If Mr. Spencer had sold his shares yesterday, he would have raised an additional $1.3 million. Mr. Spencer, who didn't return phone calls seeking comment, continues to hold 225,957 shares, according to SEC filings. On March 11, Mr. Spencer filed with the SEC his intention to sell an additional 61,813 shares.
