Such a blast would instantly set up an electric pulse of up to a million volts in hundreds of satellites and battle stations, zapping their solid-state circuits, and replacing the Pentagon's heady vision of valor in space with the dreary reality of a nuclear junkyard.  The chaos is easy to produce. A Soviet two-megaton warhead, detonated just outside the Earth's atmosphere, would set up a damaging pulse in spacecraft as far away as geosynchronous orbit, the point 23,000 miles above the Earth where satellites hang motionless. The effects of a larger bomb would reach further.  The physics behind the threat is simple. On Earth, the atmosphere absorbs radiation from a nuclear blast. In space, radiation travels unimpeded over vast distances at the speed of light. When radiation strikes a metal object, the object emits electrons and the result is a strong electric pulse. It is as if the delicate parts at the heart of a spacecraft were hit by a bolt of lightning.  Undaunted, advocates of futuristic weaponry forge ahead. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative ''think-tank,'' in a February report called for a $50 billion program to blanket space with missile and laser battle stations. That dream is already off the drawing board: For development of laser weapons alone, the Administration in fiscal 1983 plans to spend more than $430 million.  Do laser designers worry about crippling radiation in space? Not at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, in the Pentagon, where the weapons are dreamed up. ''There's nobody at D.A.R.P.A. who addresses the problem of nuclear effects in space,'' says David T. Petter, a special assistant to the director.  The cavalier attitude rests on the assumption that the threat is old and that ''fixes'' are available. Indeed, scientists at the Defense Nuclear Agency, the Pentagon's experts on the subject, in the early 1970's thought that radiation in space would be minimal and produced only as a byproduct of a nuclear exchange on Earth. But Defense Nuclear Agency strategists of late have started to worry about nuclear detonations deep in space. The mission might be performed by a Soviet missile, or, even more worrisome, by an innocent-looking satellite. The smaller the distance between the fireball and targets such as United States early-warning and communication satellites, the stronger the electric pulse.  To cope with the new threat, Defense Nuclear Agency scientists now advise the military not only to try to ''harden'' satellites against the effects of radiation (with methods such as special circuit design) but to get them completely out of the danger area. The Air Force has taken the advice. Its Milstar communications satellites, to be launched in the late 1980's, will have engines that hurl the vehicles deep into space if a nuclear attack seems imminent. In addition, after a blast Milstars parked 110,000 miles above the Earth might, with luck, be brought down into geosynchronous orbit to take up critical missions, such as relaying commands between the President and his troops.  The Defense Nuclear Agency is a small voice in the military bureaucracy. Though its vision of nuclear chaos in space has altered the course of a few programs, others move forward under their own momentum.  The advocates of laser battle stations note that nuclear blasts in space are banned by a 1967 treaty. Besides, they say, the treaty would never be broken because a nuclear blast would destroy Soviet spacecraft as well.  Such reasoning is flawed. An attack by the Soviet Union could be orchestrated so that its critical satellites were far from the blast or protected by the Earth itself. Such was the case in 1962 when the Earth shielded many satellites from the lethal rays of a United States nuclear blast in outer space.  The fascination with high-tech weaponry has brought us to the brink of a multi-billion-dollar spending spree. Yet in real life, as distinct from dreams out of ''Star Wars,'' there may be little use for exotic arsenals. Before any more money is spent on fantasy, Congress and more members of the military should take a hard look at the nuclear side of space war. --------------------------------------------------------------------- William J.
