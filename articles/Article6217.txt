 The Employee Guide To Restricted Stock; Shift Away From Options Offers Less Lucrative Upside, But Also Less Risk; You Can Get Dividends, Too   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2003  Just as stock options were emblematic of the outsize gains of the 1990s, the movement toward restricted stock partly reflects expectations for more modest market returns down the road. The "restricted" in restricted stock refers to the fact that employees can't sell the shares until a certain amount of time passes, often three or four years, and that employees may have to forfeit the shares if they leave. Unless a company becomes insolvent, restricted stock usually retains some value. But the upside isn't as lucrative, either. Employees generally get fewer shares, and thus will make less money if the company's stock price soars.  Fewer employees are likely to get restricted stock than got stock options, which made millionaires of everyone from top executives to secretaries at companies such as Microsoft when stock prices were soaring. "The typical company went down [the pay scale to employees earning] $60,000" when issuing stock options, says Ira Kay, head of the compensation-consulting practice at Watson Wyatt Worldwide. "With restricted stock, it might go down to people who earn $80,000 or $100,000."  There are also significant drawbacks with that approach. You'll have to come up with cash to pay the taxes even though you can't sell the shares to cover your tax bill. Worse yet, if you forfeit the stock, say, you change jobs, you can't get a refund. The result? You'll have paid the IRS for income you never received.
