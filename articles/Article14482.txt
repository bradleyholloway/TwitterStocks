 Zenith Labs Files For Revamping Under Chapter 11   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1988  RAMSEY, N.J. -- Zenith Laboratories Inc. filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, hours before a bank group was expected to file a petition in a New Jersey state court seeking to put the company into receivership.  Zenith Labs, which has been plagued by financial losses stemming from the recall of its drug products, previously disclosed that a group of five banks was seeking a court order for receivership because the company refused to pay off a significant portion of their loans beyond the regularly scheduled payments. The company said it had been "current" on payments of principal and interest to the banks until last Sunday, when, upon learning of the banks' intentions, it withheld $200,000 in payments due on that date.
