 Industrials Slip Amid Doubts About Gains   By McKay, Peter A, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  The Dow on Friday shed 16.48 points, or 0.1%, to end at 11850.21, giving back all of Thursday's gain. The average finished up by more than 171 points, or 1.5% on the week, and is up 10.6% for the year. Shares in GM, a component of the blue-chip average, sank 6.3% after Jerome York, an ally of GM's largest individual shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, abruptly resigned from GM's board.  In a sharply worded letter, Mr. York wrote: "I have grave reservations concerning the ability of the company's current business model to successfully compete in the marketplace with those of the Asian producers." He also said the board hasn't been "receptive" to gathering information from sources outside GM management.  "The earnings are really going to become the dominant issue in the weeks ahead," said S&P economist David Wyss, who expects third-quarter corporate profits at S&P 500 companies to grow more than 10%. "We're going to shift our focus from the general economic news to the specifics at the companies."
