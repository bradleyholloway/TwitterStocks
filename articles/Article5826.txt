 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2000  JOEL KLEIN, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, was misquoted in Friday's Washington Wire. After mentioning efforts to fend off antitrust budget cuts last year, Mr. Klein said, "Politics can have no place in enforcement of the antitrust laws." The column incorrectly quoted Mr. Klein as saying "politicians" have no place in such enforcement.
