WASHINGTON, March 22â€” It is fast becoming a familiar Washington scene: the mix of political celebrities, corporate chairmen and stars from the worlds of the dance, opera, country music, Hollywood and Broadway.  Last night's fund-raising festival for the benefit of Ford's Theatre here had that and more. In the audience were President and Mrs. Reagan and Vice President and Mrs. Bush as well as six members of the Reagan cabinet; on stage were superstars like Luciano Pavarotti, Natalia Makarova, Itzhak Perlman, Lena Horne, Johnny Cash and Loretta Lynn. There were a total of 75 corporate sponsors, from Alcoa to Xerox.  The evening began with a 5 o'clock White House reception, continued with a three-hour show at Ford's Threatre and ended with a postmidnight supper at the Organization of American States, paid for by Procter & Gamble.  ''It's a marathon,'' said Penny Durenberger, wife of David Durenberger, the Republican Senator from Minnesota, at midpoint in the evening. The show was taped and will be aired on NBC Thursday.  At the White House, some of the evening's artists said they hoped to lobby the President a bit on the question of Federal support for the arts. '' I will beg him,'' purred Miss Makarova. ''It's too much, too much,'' said Mr. Perlman, referring to the proposed 50 percent cut of the arts endowment budget.  Representative Sidney R. Yates, Democrat of Illinois, who will chair the House hearings on the arts budget beginning on Wednesday, was sanguine, saying, ''Those are just recommendations by the President. I don't think most members of the Congress will accept so drastic a cut.''  Loretta Lynn, in a ruffled red chiffon gown, was with her husband, Mooney, whose black tie was in his pocket. He was questioned about his apparel as he arrived at the White House. He said, ''But I told them I had been here a dozen times and hadn't worn it yet.'' A frequent guest during the Carter Administration, Miss Lynn said, ''I'm a Reagan fan too, you can love more than just one man, can't you?''  Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to the President, sipped his drink and confirmed that for the evening at least he was ''an arts patron, ex officio.''  Mrs. W. H. Krome George, wife of the chairman of Alcoa and a member of the White House Preservation Fund, thought that the White House had changed a great deal under President Reagan. ''There's an aura of expectation,'' she said. ''Yes, we feel welcome here now - it's been a long time,'' said Joan Ketelsen, whose husband, James L. Ketelsen, is chairman of Tenneco.  Ford's Theater was restored in 1968 and its executive producer, Frankie Hewitt, has turned the once deficit-ridden theater into a thriving operation. She attracts celebrity-studded audiences and has tapped the world of corporate money. Ford's board of governors now lists 48 corporate members who have pledged $5,000 a year for a three-year commitment. Last night's affair netted $400,000 for the theater's production fund, which will permit Ford's to continue to commission new works.  For last night's gala Mrs. Hewitt had lined up Nancy Reagan as honorary chairman; Joy Baker, wife of the Republican Senate Majority Leader, Howard H. Baker Jr., as festival chairman, and Mildred O'Neill, wife of the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., as general chairman.  ''We hit high C when we got Pavarotti,'' said Mrs. Baker, who enlisted the assistance of her manicurist, Elena Milesi, who comes from the same region of Italy as Mr. Pavarotti. ''I went roaring down and asked Elena if she would write a letter in Italian asking him to appear at Ford's, and she attached a little note of her own. We airmailed it to him in London on a Friday and received an answer the following Tuesday.'' Miss Milesi was somewhere in the milling throng, she said, ''and she's so thrilled she's about to bust her buttons.''  Mrs. Baker and Mrs. O'Neill lined up regional chairmen like Ronald Lauder of Estee Lauder, Bernard J. Lasker, the former president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Robert Mosbacher Jr. of Mosbacher Production Company to help them in their goal.  ''I told Millie, you take the Democrats and I'll take the Republicans,'' said Mrs. Baker. ''You know, it's not like they are contributing to a political campaign because we can't accept corporate funds anymore, and we just said, 'We know you wanted to contribute more to our husband's campaign but since you couldn't, this is a way you can help.' ''  President Reagan jokingly told the Ford's Theatre audience: ''Millie and Joy work so well together that I've got a couple of projects I'm going to suggest to their husbands - it's worth giving it a try.''  Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, was seated with J. D. Rauth, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation; Max L. Friedersdorf, congressional liaison at the White House, was a guest of the Northrop Corporation, and Senator and Mrs. Strom Thurmond sat with Harry Le Vine Jr. of General Electric.  ''This is where the action is,'' said Dr. Armand Hammer as he looked about. His company, Occidental International, had underwritten the post-rehearsal party at the Corcoran Gallery the previous evening. ''If the government cuts back on the arts budget,'' he said, ''it means corporations are going to have to pick up the slack.''  Illustrations: Photo of President and Nancy Reagan
