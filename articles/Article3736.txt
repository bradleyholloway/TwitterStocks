 In Volatile Region, a New Prosperity; Kazakhstan's Economic Comeback Offers Anchor of Stability, if It Can Keep Up the Act   By Pope, Hugh, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2003  "I felt very good [in August] when we paid our debts to the International Monetary Fund eight years in advance," Mr. [Nursultan Nazarbayev] said during an interview in his new, $80 million Boeing 767 presidential jet. "They closed their office and said: 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. You don't need us here anymore.' "  "It's a dramatic breakthrough on the economic front, even if we're not out of the woods on the politics," said Fiona Hill, an analyst at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. Corruption scandals "have poisoned the well," she said. "But they've really done a lot to promote a new elite."  Meanwhile, scandals have clouded the country's economic success. Mr. Nazarbayev said he "paid no attention" to a recent U.S. indictment of his former American adviser on oil deals, investment banker James H. Giffen, who allegedly directed a bribery scheme. U.S. prosecutors also are looking into $78 million paid by oil majors into Swiss bank accounts, including one in the president's name. "American companies should be grateful [to Giffen] because he brought them to Kazakhstan," Mr. Nazarbayev said.
