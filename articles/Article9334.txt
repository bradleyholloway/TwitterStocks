 The Americas: Haiti's Aristide Says `Show Me the Money'   By By Mary Anastasia O'Grady, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2001  Over seven million impoverished Haitians confront life in Mr. [Jean Bertrand Aristide]'s morass daily; many have tried to flee. Last week Reuters reported that a Haitian vessel built for 15 passengers but carrying 93 had run aground off a Bahamian island. Sharks devoured 11 of the migrants. "They risk their lives on the open seas because there is no food, no money and no work in Haiti," said a deacon from a local Bahamian church. The same week a U.S. Coast Guard patrol picked up another 183 Haitian refugees on a 40-foot wooden sailboat. A week earlier 25 shipwrecked Haitians were rescued by the Bahamian navy; four of their shipmates were found dead.  There is no proof of this, but the allegation reflects suspicion that is not unwarranted. After all, high-priced Patton, Boggs is schmoozing the Washington elite for its client even as Mr. Aristide's hitmen continue to target his political opponents. Just about the time that the OAS was announcing a successful Aristide "agreement" at its annual meeting in Costa Rica in June, the Haitian president was arresting adversaries and inciting his notorious street gangs to new violence back home; in one week six people were burned alive in the streets.  This is a shame. The U.S. has already spent $3 billion on Mr. Aristide, first to reinstall him as president and later to "reform" his police department. Yet Haiti's institution building is no further along than it was in the days of post-coup President Raoul Cedras. And it's not uncommon to hear Haitians pine for the good old days of the Duvalier dictatorship. Six years of placating Mr. Aristide have advanced few but him, and possibly his telephone company associates Joseph P. Kennedy II, former Democratic Party finance man Marvin Rosen, and Clinton pal Thomas "Mack" McLarty III.
