 IPO Outlook: New Issues Could Set Upbeat Tone; The Likes of Qimonda, GNC, Aircastle and Evercore Offer Size or Brand Recognition   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2006  "The top three reasons to be interested in Qimonda are Vista, Vista and Vista," said Kevin Landis, chief investment officer at Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif. The firm hasn't decided whether it will invest in the IPO.  The offering likely has a better chance for a strong pricing and debut than Qimonda's. Two investment banks that made debuts earlier this year had very different public receptions -- Thomas Weisel Partners Group rose 33% on its first trading day in February, while Cowen Group lost 1% last month -- but Evercore's business niche in M&A generates a far higher profit margin than those two companies.
