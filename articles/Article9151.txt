 Avigen Reports Hemophilia Drug Shows Progress   By By Ralph T. King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1999  Avigen Inc. said its gene-therapy treatment for hemophilia B appeared to benefit patients in an early-stage trial, a preliminary finding that may help restore public confidence following the recent death of a gene-therapy patient in an unrelated experiment. The news lifted the company's stock 15%.  Avigen, an Alameda, Calif., biotechnology company, said the treatment, Coagulin B, "is showing early indications of therapeutic benefit" in a so-called Phase I trial that began six months ago. The results were reported yesterday at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology in New Orleans.
