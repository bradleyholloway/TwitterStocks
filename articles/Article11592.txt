 Technology (A Special Report) --- Movie Magic: For a Few Companies, the Movie Theater Of the Future Is Already Here; Now They Just Have to Convince Hollywood   By By Richard Turner, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1992  Mr. Aaron has a vested interest in making that point: Showscan, based in Los Angeles, is one of three companies that sell a movie theater of the future. So far, the theaters are on the fringes of the entertainment world -- in theme parks and casinos, for instance, and museums. But proponents believe it is only a matter of time before they move into the mainstream. Sharper images, giant screens, advanced sound -- this is the movie-going experience of the future, they say.  All of which frustrates Mr. Aaron and his counterparts at Iwerks Entertainment and Imax Corp. For them, a real event has to start with something more basic: the experience of going to a movie itself. At the least, they say, more movies should be shot in 65 millimeter rather than the usual 35 millimeter. Because the frame being projected isn't blown up as much, the picture is much crisper, much cleaner.  So why don't filmmakers use it? Some say it is because 65-millimeter cameras are heavier and harder to manage, though recent improvements make the latest cameras more portable. Others blame it on the costs, although Mr. Grazer says it added only $900,000 to "Far and Away," which he says had a total budget of $40 million. He isn't including film-printing costs, which are about $2 million more with 65 millimeter, but that's still a relatively small amount in a business where Mr. Cruise or Arnold Schwarzenegger can command more than $10 million a film.
