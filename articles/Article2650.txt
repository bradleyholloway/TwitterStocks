 No-Nonsense Paper Firm Bets on `Calming Sandalwood' --- Georgia-Pacific, Tired of Commodity-Price Gyrations, Focuses on Branding   By By James R. Hagerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1999  Competing with the likes of Procter & Gamble Co., GP has managed in recent years to grab market share in the consumer-products arena with its Sparkle paper towels and Angel Soft toilet paper. Now GP is venturing further into consumer marketing by introducing a liquid hand soap called Pacific Garden. And GP officials say they will begin testing more consumer products soon.  Not that GP is turning into another P&G. The vast bulk of the company's revenue still comes from commodity items. Despite its size -- sales are expected to exceed $22 billion next year -- GP is far from being a household name. A former director jokes that GP ought to change its name to Plywood R Us so people would at least know it makes building products. And GP has traditionally been run by men who spend their time dealing with such macho things as chopping down trees and finding cheaper ways to make particleboard.  Then, under the direction of Michael C. Burandt, a former grocery-chain manager brought in as a senior marketing executive to help GP understand consumers, the company improved the quality of its tissue products and began seriously promoting its brands. Over the past six years, the company says, its tissue-product sales have grown three to four times faster than the overall market. GP's Angel Soft brand is now the No. 3 brand in toilet tissue, behind P&G's Charmin and Fort James Corp.'s Quilted Northern, according to Information Resources Inc., Chicago. That market-research firm also puts GP's Sparkle paper towels as No. 3 in their category, following P&G's Bounty and Fort James's Brawny.
