 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1998  IRS officials are challenging more people who use family limited partnerships and similar tools to lighten estate-tax and gift-tax burdens. Treasury officials also are deeply concerned by what they see as abuses in this area. In a typical case, a husband and wife contribute property, such as stocks and bonds, to a partnership. They then donate partnership shares to their children, valuing each unit at far below a proportionate share of the property's overall value.  Karen Lewallen Sumler, IRS director of estate- and gift-tax administration, says in an interview that some people are taking large valuation discounts without supplying a detailed explanation. "It's not uncommon to see 50% valuations," with some as low as 10%, she says. Ms. Sumler also says the IRS has begun increasing the number of gift-tax returns that it audits. She urges people using family partnerships to provide more details on how they calculate valuation discounts.  Beating the IRS in court is tough enough. But it is even harder to convince a court that the government should pay a taxpayer's legal expenses. Frank and Janis Lewis, represented by Ross Kochenderfer of Auburn, Calif., recently did just that in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court said the Lewises incurred more than $15,000 in legal fees in a successful effort to recover $1,794.92 the government finally conceded was due them.
