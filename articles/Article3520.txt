 VW Ends Plans for Ties With Proton   By Joe, Edwin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  "We had a very specific idea on how we wanted to proceed there. Unfortunately, the Malaysian government, Khazanah and Proton had different ideas," VW Chief Executive Bernd Pischetsrieder said last week. "Therefore, what we wanted in the cooperation with Proton will not materialize."  Mr. Pischetsrieder also dismissed any possibility of further joint ventures with Proton. "What we are investigating now is whether on a few isolated projects we can support Proton, and I'd like to put the emphasis on exactly that word, to support Proton, and not to have any joint programs or joint ventures or so, but to support Proton," he said.  Proton said in an exchange filing Friday that the VW announcement had "come as a surprise," as it hadn't been "informed officially" by VW. It revealed that both parties had agreed that any decision to conclude talks "would only be announced either concurrently or through a joint statement from both companies." Also, last month they had agreed to a mid-January timeline to decide on their collaboration.
