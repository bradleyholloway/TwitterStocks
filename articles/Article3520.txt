 Talk Collapses Just as Strategy Was Taking Root   By By Matthew Rose and Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  Similarly, Eoin Colfer's "Artemis Fowl," a young-adult fantasy tale, was brought to the book division after it had been shopped as a film idea to Miramax. The film company has plans for a movie version, and Talk Miramax plans to release a second "Artemis Fowl" book in May. The book division, which is wholly owned by Miramax, remains intact with Ms. [Tina Brown] as its chairman, at least for the time being.  Miramax's parent, Walt Disney, didn't intervene much as the magazine stumbled. Mr. [Harvey Weinstein] and his brother Bob, who together run Miramax, have a level of independence that is unprecedented within Disney, having generated big profits and award-winning movies for the company. The fact Talk was even launched was testimony to the Weinsteins' independence, as Disney at the time was retreating from the magazine business.  Mr. [Ron Galotti], the Talk Media president, says he is talking to Mr. Weinstein about a role at Miramax. Miramax is "going to allow us to mourn a little, and then we'll figure it out," he says. Executives at Conde Nast, where Mr. Galotti was the former publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and Mademoiselle, say there have been talks aimed at bringing him back. Mr. Galotti denies that's the case, and a Conde Nast spokeswoman wouldn't comment.
