 Installation of a New Leadership Team Gives Ford an Edge Over Its Competitors   By By Fara Warner, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1998  With William Clay Ford Jr., 41 years old, as nonexecutive chairman, and Jacques Nasser, 50, as president and chief executive officer, the No. 2 auto maker will have its top leaders positioned to run the company for well over the next decade. They are to succeed Alex Trotman, 65, when he retires Jan. 1, a year earlier than had been expected. Mr. Trotman became chairman, president and CEO in November 1993.  Ford is also way ahead of GM and the proposed DaimlerChrysler in restructuring itself as an efficient, competitive, global auto maker. When he took over as chairman five years ago, Mr. Trotman set off a massive global reorganization dubbed Ford 2000, essentially combining separate North American and European automotive units into a single organization. Admittedly, it didn't get off to a great start, and a worried Ford board two years ago asked Mr. Trotman to stay an extra year, until Jan. 1, 2000, to help finish the job.  That he is stepping down on schedule underscores how much progress the company has made since Mr. Trotman two years ago put Mr. Nasser in charge of the company's global automotive operations. "Two years ago, we weren't certain who the new leaders would be, and Ford 2000 wasn't going swimmingly," Mr. Trotman said Friday.
