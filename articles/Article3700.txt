 Stormy Thomas May Be a Republican Liability; Hastert Is Advised to Curb Ways and Means Chief Ahead of Medicare Talks   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2003  Mr. [Bill Thomas] told colleagues he wouldn't "lie" by conceding the accusations and that he had only requested help from the Sergeant-at- Arms for fear of a fight breaking out with a Democrat who Republicans said was being physically threatening. But the Capitol police account of the incident suggests no such emergency, and Democrats may press for a fuller inquiry into why officers were summoned by one of the chairman's top staffers.  Unlike the Senate's leaders, Mr. [Dennis Hastert] didn't appoint himself to the conference committee and gave more leeway to Mr. Thomas. This was in large part because he is an officer of the full House -- but for that same reason he has the unique power to speak for the entire chamber and curb individual chairmen.  One irony to Friday's incident is that the pension bill that was the subject of the Ways and Means meeting enjoys bipartisan support, despite organized labor's criticism of some provisions. The $50 billion measure would expand access to tax-deferred savings accounts and enrich a savings tax credit for individuals, while also helping employers by temporarily adjusting the benchmark used to calculate a company's pension-plan contributions.
