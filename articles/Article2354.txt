 Lawmakers Waver Over Conservationist Land Purchase   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1997  The Baca property, located in the home state of Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, symbolizes a larger debate in Congress over the federal government's commitment to acquire -- and protect -- environmentally sensitive lands. Twenty years ago, the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund spent huge sums annually by recycling oil royalties to buy up new resources like the Baca. Today, the fund is a shadow of its former self, with a $12 billion paper balance but permission to spend only a few percent each year.  To jump-start this engine, last summer's balanced-budget pact called for a one-time $700 million expenditure for land purchases this year. Almost half, or $315 million, would go immediately to pay for President Clinton's election-year promises to acquire California redwoods and Montana mining property near Yellowstone Park. Congress would be left with nearly $400 million to begin purchases like the Baca. And so long as lawmakers provided the full sum, the money would be "free" and counted outside the spending caps dictated in the deficit-reduction plan.  For Mr. Clinton, the budget "promises" here back up his own as a candidate last year. Appealing to environmentalists and vote-rich California, Mr. Clinton pledged then to help acquire 3,500 acres of primeval redwoods in the Headwaters Forest, owned by Pacific Lumber Co., a unit of Houston-based Maxxam Inc. In the same vein, the administration also proposed to spend another $65 million to protect Yellowstone by acquiring the nearby New World Mine property controlled in part by a Toronto concern, Crown Butte Resources Ltd.
