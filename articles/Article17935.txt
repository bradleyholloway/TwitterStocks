 Amgen Faces Dispute With Major Partner Over Anemia Drug   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1989  Amgen said late yesterday that the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. unit of Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., asked a Delaware federal court "to interrupt Amgen's efforts" to win Food and Drug Administration approval for Epogen and to market the drug. Epogen is Amgen's trademark for its human-recombinant erythropoietin, or EPO, which is being tested as a treatment for severe anemia. Amgen expects FDA approval for Epogen "shortly."
