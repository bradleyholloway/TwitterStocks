 Former Executive Of Adelphia Plans To Plead Guilty   By By Jerry Markon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2002  James R. Brown's expected plea could be especially damaging to Timothy J. Rigas, son of Adelphia founder John J. Rigas, because Mr. Brown reported directly to Timothy Rigas when Mr. Rigas was Adelphia's chief financial officer, the people said. Mr. Brown is cooperating in the case against all three Rigas family members charged in the case.  Like the Rigas family members, Mr. Brown is charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud and bank fraud. Another former Adelphia executive, Michael C. Mulcahey, is charged on the same counts. He has indicated no desire to plead guilty, people familiar with the case said.
