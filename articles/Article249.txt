ARLINGTON, Va., Sept. 2â€” A stolen Rubens painting valued at $350,000 was recovered yesterday from a motel room in Arlington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.  The bureau said that David N. Raymond, 27 years old, of Waldorf, Md., had been charged with interstate transportation of the painting from Maryland to California, then to Virginia.  The painting was stolen from the home of Arthur Houghton near Queenstown, Md., last December. Mr. Houghton is a former president and chairman of the Steuben Glass Company.  The painting, ''Triumph of Constantine,'' was completed by Peter Paul Rubens around 1627, Edward Hegarty of the bureau said.
