 Eurodollar Bonds Close Little Changed After Opening Higher   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1987  Fixed-coupon Eurodollar issues opened firmer but closed little changed following afternoon declines in the dollar and U.S. Treasury issues.  The #100 million ($178 million), 27-year issue represented the bank's debut in the sterling mortgage-backed sector. Guy Heald, a Chemical managing director, said the issue "fits into what we are going to be doing in the international capital markets." Although Chemical doesn't expect to be an extensive underwriter, it will launch new issues on occasion when it is asked to do so by clients, he said. In this case, the client happened to be another subsidiary of Chemical Bank involved in residential mortgage finance.
