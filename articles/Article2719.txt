 Of Computer Bugs, Sticky Keyboards And the Orkin Man --- There Is a Price to Be Paid For Eating at Your Desk; Maybe Steelcase Can Help   By By Kevin Helliker, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2000  Spill is an alarming word in the chemical industry. But John Grissinger, chief executive of Zea Chemical Corp. in Kansas City, Mo., was unfazed while talking on the phone with a supplier, when a black liquid oozed across the carpet of his office. It was coffee, overheated in the microwave next to his desk and streaming out from under the oven door.  "There went the tan carpet," says Mr. Grissinger, who actually is rather lackadaisical about the mishap. "Now I'm taking phone calls instead of going out to lunch, and it's no accident that the company is booming."  But there is a price to be paid by the crumbs-in-the-keyboard crowd. First of all, a spill can take a toll on some pretty delicate office equipment. "A woman here just dropped an iced tea on a thousand-dollar digital phone," says Marie Platowski, director of sales at Execuspace in Chicago, who sounds indignant until asked whether she has ever done anything like that herself. "As a matter of fact, I spilled a whole glass of ice water on a phone and trashed it," she says.
