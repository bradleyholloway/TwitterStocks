 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Mark Robichaux, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1991  Lineups, reflecting the sports world's vastly increased focus on money, include "Sport and the Law," "Labor Relations in Sport," and "Managerial Accounting in Sports." The courses teach the art of negotiating player contracts, cutting broadcast deals and managing stadiums. Higher education officials estimate the number of colleges offering sports management degrees at 140, up from about 40 a decade ago. Enrollment is up, and some have added master's and Ph.D. degrees.  But the rush to get in has resulted in some dubious programs, with courses taught by athletic directors who lack business backgrounds. "That's given a black eye to the good programs," says Stan Brassie, head of the University of Georgia's program. A battle has erupted over whether the business-education or the physical-education departments should run the programs.  Dai-ichi Mutual Life plans to complete a $312 million, 9.6% investment in Lincoln National Corp., Fort Wayne, Ind., by June. It would be the largest investment by a Japanese insurer in a U.S. counterpart. Sumitomo Marine & Fire recently assumed direct control of its U.S. branch, which had been operated under contract by a unit of Chubb Corp. U.S. firms have long provided management for Japanese insurers with U.S.based Japanese clients.
