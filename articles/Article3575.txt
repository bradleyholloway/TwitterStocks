 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Street Sleuth: Investors Sour on Exchange Shares; Decline in Once-Hot Stocks May Pressure Merger Deal Between NYSE, Euronext   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  Since NYSE Group Inc., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, earlier this month unveiled a deal to merge with Euronext NV, investors have sprinted away from shares of publicly traded exchanges on both sides of the Atlantic. Shares of NYSE, whose chief executive is Mr. [John Thain], have slid about 20% in that period; Euronext's stock is down about 7%.  On June 2, the first trading day after the deal was announced, NYSE's higher stock price put the value of its proposed offer for Euronext slightly above that company's then-market value. But that premium has since been replaced by a small discount. Yesterday, when Euronext shares finished 8% lower, NYSE's mostly share offer valued the European exchange at about 0.75 euros (94 U.S. cents) less than Euronext's market price.  Today, NYSE's Mr. Thain is scheduled to meet with some of the European companies in Paris that have expressed concern about regulations at a combined exchange operator, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Thain and Jean-Francois Theodore, the chief executive of Euronext, have said repeatedly that tough U.S. accounting regulations wouldn't extend to European companies as a result of the merger.
