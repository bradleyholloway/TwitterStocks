 Wickes Breaks Off Talks on the Sale Of Its Hosiery Unit   By By Jill Bettner, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1988  SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Wickes Cos. said it broke off negotiations to sell its Kayser-Roth Hosiery unit.  Wickes declined to say why it ended the talks, which it began last month with a hosiery management group and Narrangansett Capital Inc., an investment firm based in Providence, R.I.  In a statement, Wickes said it now will review the timing of the sale to "maximize the proceeds realized" from the hosiery operations. The hosiery unit, in Greensboro, N.C., makes No Nonsense, Liz Claiborne, Supp-Hose and other brands. It had sales of about $500 million last year.
