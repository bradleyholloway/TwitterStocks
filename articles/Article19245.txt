 Wanted: Greeks Who Can Hit The Curveball --- As Host of 2004 Olympics, Greece Is in Training To Field Baseball Team   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2000  The host country of the 2004 Summer Olympics is trying to put together a baseball team for the Games, but the sport isn't exactly well-known here. The only baseball diamonds in Athens are two weed-clogged sandlots at a former U.S. military base.  So, to get help in organizing and recruiting a team, Greece has turned to America, Major League Baseball and Peter Angelos, the Greek-American owner of the Baltimore Orioles.  "Most Greeks with whom I've talked say, 'Baseball -- we can't figure out what's going on,'" said the U.S. ambassador to Greece, Nicholas Burns. "If I were a Greek and heard about baseball for the first time, I think I'd be confused by it."
