 Siemens Steps In to Help Ex-Unit; German Firm Will Create A $45 Million Fund to Aid Workers During Insolvency   By Esterl, Mike, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  BenQ Mobile announced last week that it will file for insolvency, just one year after BenQ Corp. agreed to acquire the handset business from Siemens. At the time, Siemens said it agreed to pay BenQ Corp. about 350 million euros to take the unit off its hands, in addition to transferring patents to the Taiwan company and allowing it to use the Siemens brand name for five years.  In an interview, Siemens Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld said yesterday that management had been "put in a corner" over the 30% pay increase and that it had hoped BenQ could turn the business around for the benefit of the former Siemens workers. Mr. Kleinfeld added that Siemens, in addition to providing financial help, will treat BenQ Mobile's workers like internal candidates for 2,000 job openings at Siemens.
