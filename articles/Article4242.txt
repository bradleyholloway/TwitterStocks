 The Americas: Eastern and Western Rebels Hard to Unite in Nicaragua   By By Marc Rangel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1987  Significantly, the Miskitos were the first citizens to take up arms against the Sandinistas. This occurred in 1981, when they realized that the revolutionary regime was determined to destroy the sociocultural autonomy that was guaranteed to them by treaty after the 1894 annexation that ended the independence of their previous homeland, the Kingdom of Mosquitia, a British protectorate established in 1640. Since 1981, the Miskitos have waged a sporadic five-year guerrilla war against their oppressors. Although underarmed and underfunded by the Reagan administration because they have refused to join UNO on the latter's terms, they have forced the Sandinistas to the negotiating table on two occasions, in failed attempts to iron out their differences.  Historically and ethnologically, Nicaragua, both prior to and since its colonization by Europeans in the 16th century, has always had two distinct tribal groups: the Toltec/Chorotegans who originally migrated from Southern Mexico and populated the Pacific Coast and west-central highlands, and the Carib-related Miskitos who populated the eastern Atlantic region. The former evolved into Spanish-speaking West Nicaraguans, and the latter into Miskito/English-speaking East Nicaraguans through their centuries-long British connections. Today, these two Nicaraguas shape up roughly as follows: West Nicaragua, with a population of about 2.5 million, covers some 34,547 square miles, while East Nicaragua has an estimated population of about 300,000 and an area of about 22,062 square miles.  Unlike all previous governments -- including the various Somoza regimes, which were content with merely violating the economic aspects of Miskito autonomy -- the Sandinistas saw the Miskitos' autonomy as a threat to the total state control required by their Marxist system. Thus, the Sandinistas' need to destroy the sociocommunal structure of the Miskitos and their tribal brothers, the Sumo and Rama Indians, which they proceeded to do with singular brutality.
