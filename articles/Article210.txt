"We cannot let our unfortunate mistake of not taking prompt action, when in April we learned of one unauthroized bid at a February Treasury auction, to harm the firm. We are taking this action to protect the firm, its 9,000 people and its clients." -- John H. Gutfreund and Thomas W. Strauss, announcing they would resign the top positions at Salomon Brothers.
