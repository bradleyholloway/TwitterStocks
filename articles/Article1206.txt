 Fast Track: SolarCare Bets 'Big Brother' Will Be Helpful, Not Heavy --- Alliances Between Start-ups and Big Companies Are in Vogue Despite Risk   By By Cecile Sorra, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1989  SolarCare hopes it has found a big brother. The risk, of course, is that it has found Big Brother. But if the relationship works, little SolarCare estimates that its new product, called SunSense, will jump from $1 million in sales this year to $3 million next year. The product is a towelette moistened with sunscreen lotion and wrapped in foil that is aimed more at outdoor sports players and spectators than at beach goers.  Schering says it jumped at the chance to market SunSense. And Schering, maker of Coppertone, will also have access to any future products developed by SolarCare. Gerard Nobrega, a senior vice president of the Plough unit that forged the agreement, says about the tie-up, "We don't have to think twice about it."  Strategic alliances between small and big companies are very much in vogue these days, and may become more prevalent in the future. The big company gets access to innovative ideas; the small company gets marketing and financial muscle. Many of these alliances are too new to evaluate -- something that's true of the SolarCare deal with Schering. It's still in the "honeymoon" stage, says one SolarCare executive.
