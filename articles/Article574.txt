 Concern Negotiates To Join Edelman On Datapoint Bid   By By Timothy J. Carroll and Mark Zieman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1985  Continental Telecom Inc. said it is negotiating to join New York investor Asher B. Edelman in his bid to buy the Datapoint Corp. shares he doesn't already own for $23 a share, or $416.3 million.  As previously reported, Mr. Edelman, who owns about 2.1 million, or 10.8%, of Datapoint's 20.2 million common shares outstanding, has said that he secured the backing of a major public company in his bid for Datapoint, but he hasn't identified the possible partner. Datapoint, a San Antonio, Texas-based maker of computer and office-communications products, rejected a bid by Mr. Edelman on Sunday.  A spokesman for Atlanta-based Continental Telecom said that the company has had negotiations with Mr. Edelman regarding Datapoint, but said that an understanding hasn't been reached. Mr. Edelman declined to confirm that Continental Telecom is his possible partner.
