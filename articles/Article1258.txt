 Increased Spending On Medicine to Fight Drug Abuse Is Urged   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1989  Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) proposed sharply increased federal spending as part of a plan to speed the research and development of new medicines to treat drug addiction.  Mr. Biden recommended that the FDA accelerate its approval process for anti-drug abuse medicines, as it has done for treatments for AIDS. He also proposed that Congress provide exclusive marketing arrangements to companies that develop medicines to treat drug abusers, as is already done for makers of treatments for rare diseases. The senator, who based his proposals on a 38-page report by his staff, said he would introduce bills to carry out his plan when Congress reconvenes in January.
