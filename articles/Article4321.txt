 Fleet Applies to Start New Hampshire Bank Under a Recent Law   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1987  New Hampshire Banking Commissioner Roland Roberge said he would process Fleet's application without regard to the planned merger. But he said he doesn't believe the New Hampshire law would allow Fleet to maintain a bank in New Hampshire should the Norstar merger be completed. The Norstar merger has been approved by Fleet and Norstar shareholders and is expected to be completed next year.
