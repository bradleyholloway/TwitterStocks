 France Is Waking Up to the Urgency Of Solving Environmental Problems   By By Amy Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1989  EVIN-MALMAISON, France -- A few months ago, Gerard Debreyne took one of France's worst corporate polluters to court and won. The court ruled that metal residue spewed out by this town's huge lead foundry had made Mr. Debreyne's land unfarmable.  But Mr. Debreyne's victory hasn't made him a local hero. Instead, locals stand by the factory owner, Metaleurop S.A., which provides most of them with a livelihood.  Mr. Beauvois's viewpoint may help explain why France and other European countries are having trouble ending severe industrial pollution. For decades, France has placed economic growth above most other concerns. Predictably, the environment has suffered. Less predictably, the process has forged a paradox: Since those most at risk from pollution are those most dependent on income from local factories, they often become the polluters' greatest defenders.
