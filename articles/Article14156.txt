 Smoking May Cut Uterine Cancer Risk In Older Women --- But Effects Are Outweighed By Dangers of Cigarettes, Medical Journal Reports   By By Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1985  Cigarette smoking may protect some older women from uterine cancer, but the protective effect doesn't outweigh the harmful effects of smoking.  A team of scientists from several medical centers report in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine that they compared the smoking habits of women with endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus) with the smoking habits of women with other forms of cancer that weren't linked to cigarette smoking.  For older women who had gone through menopause, they found that endometrial cancer was less common among those who smoked a pack or more of cigarettes daily. Statistically, the heavy smokers appeared to have about half the risk of nonsmokers of developing endometrial cancer.
