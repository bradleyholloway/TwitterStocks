 Airbus Sets Plan to Sell 30 Planes to a Relaunched Ansett   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  Tesna plans to shed Ansett's old Boeing fleet along with its costly maintenance problems in favor of Airbus craft. Initially, it plans to use Ansett's existing A320s. Tesna would then supplement or replace those planes with 16 to 20 factory-fresh A320s on two-year leases from United Airlines, and then buy 30 A320, A321 and A319 aircraft direct from Airbus. The sale could be worth about $1.5 billion for Airbus.
