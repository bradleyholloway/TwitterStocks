Officials of the Madison Square Garden Corporation are scheduled to meet this morning with representatives of the 17 labor unions whose members work at the Garden and tell them how the corporation stands in its negotiations with the city.  The Garden corporation, saying that its arena is losing money, has threatened to move the Rangers to New Jersey unless the city reduces the building's annual real-estate taxes of $3.9 million and provides other assistance to cut costs.  Before the city acts, it wants assurances of help from the unions and New York State. But it was unclear whether the Garden, at this meeting at its Hall of Fame Club, will present the unions a package of demands.  The meeting will be attended by Allen Schwartz, who has been negotiating with the Garden for the city; Sonny Werblin, the corporation's president, and Vincent McDonnell, the Garden's labor lawyer.
