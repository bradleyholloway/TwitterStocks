 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: Private Properties   By Casselman, Ben, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2006  MGM acquired Shadow Creek as part of its $4.4 billion purchase of Mr. [Steve Wynn]'s Mirage Resorts in 2000. As part of the deal, Mr. Wynn, who now runs Wynn Resorts, was allowed to remain in the house for five years; he moved out last year, a spokeswoman says. MGM Mirage has already sold the other home on the course, which belonged to former Mirage executive and current Wynn Resorts chief operating officer Marc Schorr. Mr. Wynn's spokeswoman said he was traveling and not available for comment.  The approximately one-acre property is in the Kuki'o development, a private golf and beach community on the Kohala coast of Hawaii's Big Island. The 6,500-square-foot, five-bedroom home features a central great room, covered lanai, swimming pool and lava-rock ponds. The Kuki'o development includes a spa, fitness center and two [Tom Fazio]- designed golf courses (one is 10 holes, the other 18). It is run by the San Francisco-based Discovery Land Company, which operates similar communities in several states and in Mexico.
