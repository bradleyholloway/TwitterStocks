NEWARK (AP) - A Federal judge, saying it was ''the fashion'' for some politicians to blame their corruption on Government informants, sentenced the former Mayor of Kearny to eight years in prison for extortion Tuesday.  ''It has become all the fashion lately for public officials caught stuffing their pockets with cash to claim that they're victims somehow,'' the judge, Herbert J. Stern, said in sentencing the former Mayor, 38-year-old David Rowlands. Mr. Rowlands, who left office in 1980, had been convicted of extorting $12,000 from a businessman in 1979 who sought Planning Board approval to expand his furniture store. He had contended that he was lured into the scheme.
