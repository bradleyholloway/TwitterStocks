 Hollywood Journal: A New Tune for `Flower Drum Song' --- Musical Courts the Audience It Had Long Offended; No More `Egg Rolls'   By By Lisa Gubernick, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2002  It all comes at a time when, despite a tough economy, Broadway ticket sales are up nearly 9% this season, to $220 million. Even if "Drum Song" succeeds in updating its image, it still faces one of the most-crowded markets for musicals in years. Of the 23 shows officially opened on Broadway, 17 are musicals. Eight more musicals -- including "Drum Song" -- will open by year's end.  So, come Oct. 17, "Fan Tan Fanny" will be strutting her stuff on Broadway for the first time since the show closed in 1960. After playing to sold-out crowds in a Los Angeles run that ended earlier this year, the $8 million show boasts fairly healthy advance Broadway sales of more than $4 million. Ronald Lee, who heads Group Sales Box Office, says "Drum Song" is "selling like hotcakes for groups and theater parties." The surprise: Many sales are coming from the Asian-American community that once eschewed the show.  Disney, producer of "Moonlight Mile," the last [SUSAN SARANDON] film out of the gate, professes not to be worried about star-overload "because our movie is so different from the other movies," says Oren Aviv, head of marketing for Buena Vista Pictures. Ms. Sarandon's role as a bereaved mother in "Mile" is the only dramatic turn of the three -- in "Igby" she plays an uptight Mom and in the "The Banger Sisters" she's an ex-groupie. "Her exposure in those other films is good for us because it makes her more of a presence in the marketplace," adds Mr. Aviv.
