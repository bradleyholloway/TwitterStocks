 Bank United Says: Don't Fire (Cash) Until You See the Colors of Their Eyes   By By Rick Brooks, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  As part of a pilot program, three ATMs equipped with the iris-recognition device are expected to be unveiled tomorrow at Bank United branches located within Kroger Co. supermarkets in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas.  Similar ATMs are being used in tests outside the U.S. by other banks. One big question confronting bankers is how quickly customers will embrace the technology, since it involves the inconvenience of going to the bank for a picture to be taken prior to using the ATM for the first time. Other potential hurdles include concerns from some customers that their eyes could be injured by the camera, and worries over banks creating a vast database of account holders' irises.
