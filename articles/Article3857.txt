 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2004  The current tax system is "needlessly complex, making it susceptible to abusive tax avoidance schemes," said a Treasury Department memo in late 2002.  "It penalizes hard work" and "discourages savings and investment." That memo was written by Pam Olson, then assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy to then-Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill.
