 Sightings: Sue and Be Doomed; In Detroit, public-radio listeners strike a blow -- for regress   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2006  If the plaintiffs and their supporters fail to get their way, they plan to picket the station -- for openers. "We should have a say in what is aired on WDET, our public radio station in Detroit," they declare on their own Web site, www.savedetroitradio.com. That's no laughing matter. The financial contributions of WDET's listeners account for 90% of the station's annual budget. Should enough of them stop sending money, whatever the reason, WDET will go out of business.  Behind this nasty quarrel lies the sad fact that most of today's public-radio listeners don't want to hear music, or any other locally produced arts-oriented programming. Dozens of surveys have shown that they consistently prefer national news and talk radio, and NPR and its affiliates are giving it to them. In recent years, one station after another has scrapped its local shows in favor of "Morning Edition," "Fresh Air" and "Democracy Now" (all of which can now be heard on WDET each weekday). Litigation may slow down that process, but it won't stop it.  The protesters accusing WDET-FM of fraud have caught the same bug. "Music is art, and it is also an integral part of Detroit's rich and noteworthy history," they claim on their Web site. "Therefore, it should remain a large part of WDET, our public radio station." Period. Not only do they think WDET should continue to air programs whose ratings are plunging, but they refuse even to consider the possibility that there might be newer, better ways for them to tune in the music- oriented radio shows that they love. Instead, they've embarked on a course of action that could shut down WDET altogether. That's what I call a losing cause.
