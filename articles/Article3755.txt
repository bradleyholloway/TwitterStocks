 Indexing & ETFs: ETF Lifecyle Funds: Low Fees, Tax Efficient   By Laise, Eleanor, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  Another advantage: It's easy to look under the hood of the new lifecycle ETFs. Lifecycle mutual funds often invest in other funds, so an investor who wants to look at all of the fund's stock and bond holdings may need to do substantial legwork. It can also be tough to tell how much the underlying funds' holdings might overlap. But ETFs often post all of their holdings online every day. And the new TDAX funds invest directly in stocks and bonds rather than in other funds.  Investors should also take a close look at lifecycle funds' asset allocation and how it changes over time. The TDAX Independence 2040 ETF begins with a relatively aggressive 96% stock allocation and moves to a conservative 10% stock weighting at the target date. Then, in a strategy that's unusual for lifecycle funds, the stock allocation climbs back up to more than 30% five years after the target date. "Why, five years later, are you able to take substantially more risk?" asks Greg Carlson, analyst at investment-research firm Morningstar.
