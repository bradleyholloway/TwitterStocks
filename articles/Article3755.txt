 Openwave Jumps As Tech Outlook Fuels Broad Rally   By Pasha, Shaheen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2004  "The Russell 2000 is the stock market's version of the TV show 'Survivor,'" said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Only companies that had real innovative products, were best funded and had money managed to make it through the washing out. . . . The stocks that are now comprised in the index are part of the leadership group."  Analysts seemed to agree regarding individual companies. Openwave Systems, Redwood City, Calif., finished up $1.61, or 11%, at $16.84 after Schwab Soundview upgraded the stock to "outperform" from "neutral," citing new infrastructure spending in the wireless industry and a burgeoning market for mobile data handsets and services.  At Road, however, shed 1.22, or 7.3%, to close at 15.60 after J.P. Morgan downgraded the stock to "underweight" from neutral and reduced its fiscal 2004 projection, citing potential costs that the Fremont, Calif., Internet information-services company may incur after a decision by large-cap AT&T Wireless Services and Verizon Wireless to migrate from their cellular digital packet data networks.
