 School Choice Showdown   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1998  The Supreme Court of Vermont will hear arguments today on the constitutionality of the state's school-choice program. The "tuitioning" program, as it's known, is aimed at students living in rural areas of the state where there are no public high schools. Parents receive a sum of money -- approximately $6,000 -- to send their children to the public or private school of their choice in or out of state. The program covers 4,259 students in public schools and 2,077 in private ones.  Vermont's choice program dates to 1869, and for the first 91 years, parents had the option of using the tuition money to send their kids to religious schools. In 1960, around the time the judicial system was reinterpreting the Constitution to mean freedom from religion instead of freedom of religion, the Vermont Supreme Court decided to exclude religious schools. It changed its mind in 1994, when it reinstated them. The state Board of Education, however, decided it knew better, and found a technicality on which to continue to bar religious schools, leading the Chittenden Town School District in central Vermont to bring suit. The same five judges who ruled unanimously in 1994 will be hearing the case today.
