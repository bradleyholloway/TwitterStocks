 Room Glut Puts Thai Hoteliers in a Bind --- Five-Star '80s Spawned an Ill-Starred Building Boom   By By Miriam Jordan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1993  Tourism is rebounding in Thailand this year, after a two-year slump caused by the Gulf War and 1992's antimilitary demonstrations in Bangkok. Even so, "hoteliers in the Land of Smiles have a long face," says Jatuporn Kathakul, president of the Thai Hotels Association. The reason: a severe oversupply of rooms.  Mr. Jatuporn of the hotel association says room rates, adjusted for inflation, are even lower than in the worst months of 1991 and 1992. Five-star hotels in Bangkok are offering rates as low as 2,000 baht ($78.86). A four-star room in Chiang Mai typically costs 900 baht, with breakfast and airport transfers included.  At Bangkok's Landmark Hotel, marketing director Charles Sittichai scans the cityscape and counts 10 other hotels in sight. "There are so many," he laments from the Landmark's granite steps. He recalls when his was the only hotel in a new Bangkok new commercial district: "In 1987, people were pleading, `Please give me a room at any price.' Now they say, `I'll take a room if you give me a bargain price.'"
