SEOUL, South Koreaâ€” Beginning in the early 1970's, foreign buyers and manufacturers flocked to South Korean shoe factories, attracted mainly by the low wholesale cost of footwear and the factories' high production.  At the same time, demand for South Korean footwear, particularly running shoes, soared in the United States as jogging gained in popularity.  But the tide has turned for Korea's shoe industry, perennially one of the nation's biggest earners of foreign exchange, and it is now facing a second consecutive year of hard times. Buyers are now beginning to bypass South Korea in favor of other producing countries with cheaper wage rates and more stable political conditions.  Economic slowdowns in the United States and Europe have also resulted in declining order rates, industry leaders say. ''Last year was not a good year for us,'' said Kim Young Joo, president of the Samhawa Company, the country's second-largest footwear maker. Until February Mr. Kim was also chairman of the Korean Footwear Exporters Association. Outlook for 1981 Production  ''We will have about the same level of production in 1981 as last year,'' he said. ''Nobody is expanding their capacity.''  According to figures of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, production by South Korean shoe makers rose from 180 million pairs in 1975 to 326 million in 1978, the peak year. Last year only 296 million pairs of shoes were made in South Korea. Meanwhile, exports grew from 160 million pairs, or $425 million, in 1975, to a high of 209 million pairs, or $680 million, in 1978. Last year, exports fell to 190 million pairs, or $868 million.  The footwear association predicts that production this year will be worth about $1.2 billion, 70 percent of which will be exported, mainly to the United States, Japan and Western Europe.  Numerous United States companies do business with the more than 35 Korean companies that account for 95 percent of the shoe business. Such famous brand names as Nike, Adidas and Converse roll off the assembly lines in huge shoe plants in Pusan. The J.C. Penney Company and Sears, Roebuck & Company also do substantial buying here. Japanese Companies' Plans  A few Japanese shoe makers, such as the ICC Corporation, the largest producer, hope to shore up business by expanding ties with American buyers. ''We want to produce in big volume for them,'' said S.B. Yoon, ICC's general manager.  Last year, ICC produced more than 60 million pairs of shoes and exported 40 million, worth about $200 million. This year's goal is $300 million in exports, but Mr. Yoon said, ''It would be difficult to reach.''  The industry's growth was good for dozens of small and medium-size companies, nearly 300,000 workers in the factories and parts suppliers. But that very success caused the United States footwear industry to complain that imports from South Korea and other Asian countries were starting to squeeze American companies.  Those complaints led to the imposition in 1977 of an orderly marketing agreement by the United States International Trade Commission. The agreement, which was also applied to Taiwan, restricted the number of pairs of shoes South Korea could export each year to the United States. The agreement, South Korean shoe makers say, has been a major factor in the industry's current slump. Additional Problems Noted  But there are other problems. In addition to large increases in the cost of synthetic rubber, leather and nylon, Mr. Kim of Samhawa estimated that real wages rose an average of 30 percent in 1980 while productivity climbed only 5 to 10 percent. This year the South Korean Government has taken a hard line on wage increases and insists on an industrywide goal of 15 percent increases to hold down the inflationary spiral.  And domestic political instability, following the assassination of President Park Chung Hee in October 1979, cut South Korean consumer demand. Political stability was restored only recently after President Chun Doo Hwan's meeting with President Reagan in Washington, and industry analysts now assume there will be some pickup in the pace of overall economic activity in Korea.  South Korean shoe makers are also concerned about the potential threat of China in world markets in a few years. ''They have every condition to make shoes,'' said Samhawa's Mr. Kim, ''but whether they are able to meet fast-changing styles in shoes is another question.'' End of Agreement Sought  The Koreans hope to persuade the United States Government that it is now time to end the orderly marketing agreement, and they tried to do just that at recent hearings conducted by the International Trade Commission on whether to extend the import restraints, which expire this year.  ''We don't want to see an extension of the orderly marketing agreement,'' said Kim Sul Chun, a senior official of South Korea's Ministry of Commerce and Industry. ''We don't think it is justified.''  Leaders of the South Korean shoe industry agreed. ''Continuing the agreement will add to U.S. inflation and will cause a lot of our companies to lose money,'' said Mr. Kim, whose own company, Samhawa, reported substantial losses for both 1979 and 1980.
