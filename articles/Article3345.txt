 Health Watch: Picking the Right Health Plan for You   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2004  -- Health Maintenance Organizations: A surprising development in health insurance during the past few years is the comeback of the HMO. The plans, which reached their height of popularity in the mid 1990s, were criticized by lawmakers and consumer groups for restricting patients' access to care. But experts say the current crop of HMOs appears far more user-friendly. The biggest change: Many HMOs now let patients see certain commonly used specialists like gynecologists without a referral from their primary-care doctor.  POS plans can work well for "people who just want the safety net to say 'if I ever want to go out of network, I can,'" says Abbie Leibowitz, co-founder of Health Advocate Inc., which advises patients on health-insurance issues.  Also, some employers offer health savings accounts for employees with high-deductible PPO plans. HSAs let employees set aside pretax money that's saved for out-of-pocket health expenses. Such high- deductible plans, though, only really benefit employees who won't need much health care. Otherwise, they'll be spending a lot on medical costs before insurance kicks in.
