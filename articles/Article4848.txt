 Cruise Lines Enjoy Smooth Sailing Despite Recession --- After a Year of Scrimping and Saving, Vacationers Are Booking in Droves   By By Laurie M. Grossman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1992  In fact, cruise lines are booking customers in record numbers. January was the biggest month ever for Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. The Miami company booked 261,400 vacations, a 40% increase from its previous record, set in January 1990. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., also based in Miami, had the about same number of bookings as Carnival, 77% more than in its previous record month of July 1991. Norwegian Cruise Line, also based in Miami, had nearly double its usual bookings. And Premier Cruise Lines, a unit of Dial Corp., says January bookings were 30% higher than its previous record.  January wasn't just an aberration. It follows a year that was surprisingly strong for a business whose underpinnings are travel and luxury. Carnival, the industry leader, posted an 8% increase in earnings from continuing operations, the bulk of which is cruise business. Overall, the number of cruise line passengers rose 10% in 1991 from 1990.  In large part, the industry's success was the result of heavy price-cutting. Carnival, for instance, is slashing $300 off each ticket between now and May. At Norwegian, two can travel for the price of one on several three-day and four-day cruises to the Caribbean and Mexico. Its lowest discount ticket for a seven-day cruise, excluding airfare, is $687, 40% less than the advertised rate in Norwegian's brochure. The average discount on a cruise has been running about 30%, estimates Jay Lewis, president of Market Scope Inc., a consulting firm. All of the cruise lines are doling out upgrades to entice more bookings. And they aren't shy about still larger discounts on a particular cruise as departure time nears.
