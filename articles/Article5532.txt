 Actuaries defend process, assumptions used in review of Clinton health plan   By Wartzman, Rick, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1993  In a letter to senior White House aide Ira Magaziner, a group of independent actuaries that reviewed aspects of the Clinton health-care proposal certified that the methods and assumptions used to calculate the private-sector premiums in the plan were "sound and reasonable." The letter was careful to note that the review did not cover the cost or savings for the entire plan and that policy issues were outside the scope of the study.
