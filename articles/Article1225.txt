 Firm's Bid to Export Machine to Iraq Under Italian Bank Credit Is Studied   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1989  An Alabama company with letters of credit from Banca Nazionale del Lavoro is seeking a U.S. export license to ship to Iraq a precision machine that has raised concerns among U.S. officials because it has applications in making nuclear weapons.  The Atlanta branch of Rome-based BNL had issued some $2.64 billion in unauthorized letters of credit to Iraq, using an off-the-books accounting system to conceal the transactions. Iraq used the letters of credit to guarantee payment to U.S., British, and European companies for exports to that country.  XYZ Options Inc., a small Tuscaloosa, Ala., company that has a contract to build a turnkey machine-tool plant in Baghdad for state-owned Machinery Trade Co., has had difficulty getting an export license because U.S. Commerce Department officials and an interagency group overseeing nuclear export controls haven't ascertained who ultimately will use the machine in question. XYZ said the machine is considered an essential part of the plant.
