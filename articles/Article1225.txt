 Business Bookshelf: How Detroit Can Speed Along Its Learning Curve   By Yates, Brock, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2007  In "How Toyota Became GBP 1," [David Magee] tracks the rise of this once-obscure Japanese company, giving special attention to its success in North America. His subtitle suggests that he is offering "lessons from the world's greatest car company." Admirers of Daimler-Benz, Honda and other car makers may feel that "world's greatest" is going a bit too far. But Mr. Magee, often citing Jim Press, Toyota's North American president, plays a strong hand.  When it comes to Toyota's success, Mr. Magee credits the company's internal realities. He acknowledges that Toyota's competitive edge, like that of other foreign companies, owes something to its labor costs, so much lower, per car, than those of American companies. But he celebrates Toyota's willingness to acknowledge production problems quickly, to adapt its methods to varying markets (thus defying a stereotype of management rigidity), and to ask for feedback from its workers -- thereby "empowering" them and offering "hands-on teaching in something of a democratic environment." When Toyota began manufacturing in America, Mr. Magee notes, it put its core precepts into play immediately: "be practical and avoid frivolity" and "strive to create a warm and homelike atmosphere." The trick, one supposes, is combining both precepts without the one canceling out the other.
