 Norfolk Boosts Conrail Offer To $1.9 Billion --- Road's Chances of Clearance By House Appear Dim; Dingell Calls Bid 'Dead'   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1986  Robert Claytor, chairman of Norfolk Southern, announced Friday that the company had acceded to Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole's request that it raise its bid for the government's Conrail stock. Previously, the company offered the government a $1.2 billion base bid, and proposed to pay $375 million for the 15% owned by Conrail employees.  But House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, whose panel has jurisdiction over the sale, said the increased bid hasn't altered his strenuous opposition to Norfolk Southern. "As far as I am concerned," he said in a statement Friday, "the notion of selling Conrail to Norfolk Southern is dead."  Of the $700 million increase in the bid, Norfolk Southern will have to cough up $200 million of its own money. The rest will come from $360 million in excess Conrail pension funds and $140 million in Conrail cash reserves. Norfolk Southern also agreed to Mrs. Dole's proposal that the transaction be reviewed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for potential anti-competitive effects.
