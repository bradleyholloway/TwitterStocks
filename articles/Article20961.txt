 Bell Canada Posts 6% Fall in Profit, Sees Lower '86 Net   By By Jacquie McNish, The Wall Street Journal,  May 2, 1986  Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. reported a 6% decline in first-quarter earnings and said a "significant" decline in its gas pipeline unit's earnings will put its profit for the year below 1985's.  A. Jean de Grandpre, chairman, said the profit decline reflected lower earnings at its 52%-owned Northern Telecom Ltd. and 47.8%-owned TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. Mr. de Grandpre said he expects "a significant drop" in TransCanada's earnings in 1986 will reduce Bell Canada's profit this year from 1985. Bell Canada reported net income of $1.05 billion, or $4.23 a share, on revenue of $13.26 billion last year.
