 GOP Takes Aim At Bill's Provision On Plant closings   By By Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1988  When the trade bill reaches the House floor today, Republicans will try to strip it of the plant-closing provision that has provoked a presidential veto threat.  Both sides expect the vote to be close. Even if Democrats beat back the effort, the narrow margin expected will illustrate that they won't be able to override a veto.  However, Republicans last night were working to craft their motion in a way that could win Democratic votes, and considering whether to push for removal of the plant-closing provision or propose a compromise version. Some Republicans, particularly from industrial, oil and agricultural states, want to be able to vote for the bill without offending the president.
