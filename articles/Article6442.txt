 Judge Delays Oil-for-Food Probe; A 10-Day Restraining Order Is Set, Keeping U.N. Papers Out of Congressional Hands   By Dreazen, Yochi J, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2005  Michael Holzman, a [Paul Volcker] spokesman, praised the ruling for preventing the dissemination of documents "that we believe will put the safety of witnesses and the integrity of our investigation at risk." Another Volcker official said that Mr. [Richard Parton], whatever his motives, had effectively "stolen" documents that belong to the panel. Mr. Parton, in a statement through his lawyer, defended his actions as an attempt to keep a record of his long-running disagreement with Mr. Volcker and his two fellow commissioners. The investigator said he kept duplicates of certain documents "because of my concern that the investigative process and conclusions were flawed."
