 Power-Supply Forecasts Grow Pessimistic --- Can Independent Suppliers Pick Up Slack as Utilities Plan Fewer New Plants?   By By Bill Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1988  Like many utilities, Consolidated Edison Co. of New York was rationing power to stave off blackouts. If some power-supply forecasters are correct, it was only the start of reliability problems likely to plague the nation in the form of widespread power shortages by the early 1990s.  "Electricity is the flame of life and it will never go out. But it is about to flicker in the wind," crimping economic growth and inconveniencing millions, warns Andrew Hines, chairman of Florida Power Corp.'s parent, Florida Progress Corp.  Not all forecasters agree. Some say non-utility or "independent" power producers will make up for utilities' increasing reluctance, despite growing electricity demand, to build more power plants. But the long-term reliability of independent producers has yet to be tested. And whoever builds the next generation of power plants must struggle with environmental problems that make it increasingly difficult to choose an acceptable fuel. "The uncertainties and pressures on the electricpower industry are going to grow," says Richard Zaren, planning director at the Electric Power Research Institute, the utility industry's research and development arm.
