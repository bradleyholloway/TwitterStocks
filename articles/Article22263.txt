 Clinton's nominee for antitrust chief is viewed as unlikely to block mergers   By Wilke, John R, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1997  President Clinton's candidate for Justice Dept antitrust chief, Joel Klein, is a cautious appellate lawyer who is unlikely to stand in the way of the current tidal wave of mergers. Klein, whose nomination as assistant attorney general was announced Feb 28, 1997, is starkly different in style from his outspoken predecessor, Anne Bingaman, and antitrust attorneys on Mar 2 said they expected he would take fewer risk in bringing big, difficult cases before skeptical federal judges.
