 Maryland Passes Law Assisting Suit Against Tobacco   By By Ann Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1998  The measure allows Maryland, which has a lawsuit pending, to use statistical evidence to attempt to prove that smoking contributed to residents' health problems and to quantify damages it is seeking from the industry. The provisions are similar to a Florida law that authorized the state, suing on behalf of an entire class of Medicaid recipients, to use statistics to prove that smoking causes cancer. Florida settled its suit against the industry for $11.3 billion last year.
