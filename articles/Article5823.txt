 Dollar Drifts Lower in Skittish Trading As Traders Take Breather After Plunge   By Patterson, Rebecca H, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1996  Mr. [Hillel Waxman] said several economic in dicators, including trade figures today, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report tomorrow, inflation data Friday and retail sales next week, should reinforce the U.S. economy's positive outlook and thus "bode well for the dollar."  Ed Witt, a trader at Deutsche Genos senschaftsbank in New York, echoed Mr. Waxman's dollar outlook, but noted that "there's a certain amount of skepticism in the market." Mr. Witt said investors "are looking to coming indicators for a clearer picture" of the U.S. economy.  While interest-rate speculation favored the dollar yesterday, selling by Japanese exporters and U.S. hedge funds in Asian dealings pushed down the U.S. currency. In addition, bearish comments by U.S. economist C. Fred Bergsten helped push the dollar lower.
