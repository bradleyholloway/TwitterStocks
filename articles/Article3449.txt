 Disney Studio Chief Schneider Resigns After 18 Months in Job   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  Disney said Mr. [Peter Schneider]'s move was his own decision, and that Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Eisner tried to persuade him to stay. Disney said Mr. Schneider plans to start a Broadway theater production company, in which Disney will invest. Mr. Schneider wouldn't comment.  Disney's studio will operate for the foreseeable future under the guidance of three existing managers. Richard Cook, a 30-year company veteran and chairman of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, will play a key role, generally overseeing many of the business units that are included in the Disney studio. Thomas Schumacher, president of Walt Disney Animation and a longtime player in Disney's animation franchise, will continue to be the creative leader of that group and Disney's theater operation. And Nina Jacobson, president of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, will guide live-action film production.  Mr. Schneider had just taken over the position of Walt Disney Studios chairman in January 2000, following 15 years as a top Disney animation executive. As chairman of the entire Disney studio, Mr. Schneider oversaw live action and animated film production, video and DVD, music, and live theater.
