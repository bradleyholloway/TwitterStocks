 Flaws Are Found in Cisco's Web-Calling Software   By Richmond, Riva, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2005  Neel Mehta, team leader for Internet Security Systems' X-Force advanced research group, called the flaws "very severe" because they "allow you to compromise the core of voice over IP infrastructures." He said crafting attacks would be "a matter of hours" for a hacker with knowledge of the flaws, information that can be deduced by studying the software patches.  While easy to use, VOIP systems involve technology that, as with other Internet technologies and software programs, are susceptible to programming errors. Mr. Mehta said "implementation mistakes" such as those it found in Cisco's product are fairly common and not unique to Cisco.
