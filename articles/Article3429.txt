 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Hollywood Report: 'Heaven' Can Wait; Why Did Epic Film Stumble? Ask Star's Younger Fans; Shrugging Off Crusades   By John Lippman and Amir Efrati, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  Jessie Svec, a 16-year-old high-school sophomore from Ames Iowa, says Mr. [Bloom] is "really hot," but she'll have to stay away. "I've gotten carded for R-rated movies before," she says. In Lake Elmo, Minn., 14-year-old Sara Lizakowski, who has hung a poster of Mr. Bloom in her bedroom, says that if she decides to see the movie, "I'll get a parent to get me in." That may not work. Her father, Terry, says: "If it's rated R, we wouldn't let her see it."  Demographics and disturbing scenes are also potentially an issue when it comes to young fans of the next big summer film, opening at midnight showings early Thursday: the final "Star Wars" movie, "Revenge of the Sith." Images of a severed hand and a half-burned face helped land it a PG-13 rating; the five other movies in the series were PG. At the same time, producer Lucasfilm is appealing to kids who might be too young to see it by cutting promotional deals with companies such as Kellogg's. (Lava Berry Explosion Pop-Tarts and Corn Pops cereal boxes feature "Sith" characters.) A Lucasfilm spokeswoman says that "parents know 'Star Wars' has a very positive influence, and they are the best judges about whether their particular children should see this movie."  Mr. Bloom also gained young fans from his turn as a humble blacksmith in "Pirates." According to Disney, the movie's producer and distributor, 36% of that movie's audience was teenagers, and 60% of them were female. Teen People magazine last year named Mr. Bloom "GBP 1 Hottie" and one of the "25 Hottest Stars Under 25." He's one of the most popular stars on the Web, bumping Britney Spears as screensavers.com's "top celebrity download."
