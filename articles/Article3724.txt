 Trade Double-Cross Update   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2007  So we're glad to say that on a visit to our New York offices this week, U.S. drug czar John Walters pulled no punches. "The opposition of Democrats to free trade and military resources for Colombia at this time is reprehensible," Mr. Walters said. By "resources" he means money for helicopter lift and other things that Senator Pat Leahy and House Democrat Nita Lowey are threatening to withhold from annual U.S. aid for Colombia.  "[Alvaro] Uribe is the Nelson Mandela of Colombia," Mr. Walters said about the popular two-term president, whose anti-terror policies have helped reduce violence in nearly every part of his country's life. "I would challenge anyone to show me a country that has done more for human rights than Colombia," the drug czar said, adding that Democrats who claim otherwise are merely "mimicking left-wing non-profits" whose allegations "are lies." He specifically mentioned the hard-left Washington Office on Latin America.
