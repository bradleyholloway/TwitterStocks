 North Korea's Missile Test Unsettles APEC   By Tom Hamburger and Michael M. Phillips in Bangkok, Thailand, and Gordon Fairclough in Seoul, South Korea, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2003  "It's fairly low on the scale of provocations," said Lee Chung Min, a North Korea specialist at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. But it is clear, he said, that the North Koreans wanted to signal APEC "that they are still here" and send a message to the U.S. and South Korea that while the six-party talks may go on, Pyongyang "still has the option of going down the road" to conflict.  That call came just before Japan's Defense Agency said it had received a report that North Korea had fired the missile into the sea earlier in the day. The [Bush] administration viewed the launch as characteristic of Pyongyang's foreign-policy gestures, and wasn't overly concerned that it signaled an outright rejection of the Bush initiative. But White House officials said such actions would serve only to further isolate North Korea.
