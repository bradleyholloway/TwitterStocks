 West German Firms Admit Supplying Nuclear-Weapons Material to Pakistan   By By John J. Fialka and Thomas F. O'Boyle, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  Two small West German companies admitted supplying nuclear weapons-related materials to Pakistan, and disclosed that one of their unwitting sources for the materials was India, Pakistan's arch rival.  Albert Farwick and Reinhard Huebner of the state prosecutors office in Hanau, West Germany, told a special investigations committee of the West German parliament that the companies obtained almost $5 million worth of zirconium from India and France, relabeled it "prime-quality steel," and reshipped it to Pakistan.  The two prosecutors said witnesses have told them that Pakistan appears to be using the zirconium to build a large nuclear reactor that could be used to produce plutonium, the explosive metal used in most nuclear warheads. The reactor, they said, also will be used to give Pakistan a large and steady supply of tritium, a chemical relative of hydrogen that is used in modern nuclear weapons.
