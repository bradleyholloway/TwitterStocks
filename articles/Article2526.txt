 Smaller-Size Fund Outlets Face Squeeze To Combine   By By Pui-Wing Tam and Charles Gasparino, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1999  The squeeze is on for smaller fund outlets as the nation's largest mutual-fund companies continue to gobble up a bigger share of the mutual-fund pie, making it more difficult for smaller firms to compete in an already crowded marketplace, industry experts say.  Through November 1998, the market share of the top 10 mutual-fund companies -- including the biggest two, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group -- had spiked to 52.2%, from 46.5% in 1993, according to Financial Research Corp. As a result, smaller mutual-fund organizations -- generally those with less than $50 billion in assets -- will have to spend more money on marketing, distribution and advertising if they are to remain independent, analysts say.  While some small fund companies might prefer to remain independent, consolidation may be welcome news for many fund investors. By merging with a bigger firm, a fund company can, at least in theory, lower expenses to investors by creating economies of scale. Moreover, mergers may lead to the folding of poorly performing funds into ones guided by managers with hotter hands. And it isn't as if there aren't plenty of other funds to choose from, should consolidation eliminate some. By Lipper Inc.'s count, there are 12,600 available.
