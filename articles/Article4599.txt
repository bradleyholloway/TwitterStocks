 Texaco Eurobonds Plummet Further Following Ruling   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1985  The debt securities of Texaco Inc. and its subsidiaries took another beating in the Eurodollar bond market after a Texas judge upheld an $11.1 billion jury award, including interest, against the U.S. oil giant in favor of Pennzoil Co.  Traders at Goldman Sachs International Corp., for example, said negotiated prices on Texaco's Eurodollar bonds to clients were cut nearly five points after Judge Solomon Casseb upheld the jury award. Texaco's 11 7/8% convertible bonds due in 1994 were quoted as low as 92 1/2, down from 97. In less than a month, the bonds have tumbled about 15 points, or $150 for each $1,000 face amount.
