 As Indian Index Tops 20000, Challenges Loom; Is the Country's Economy Versatile Enough to Weather a Slowdown in the U.S.?   By Tariq Engineer in Mumbai and Vibhuti Agarwal in New Delhi, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2007  "We have been able to decouple growth [from the U.S.] in China and India," said Jigar Shah of Mumbai-based K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities. "The market has more believers in the decoupling than in the [impact of a] slowdown in the U.S."  Meanwhile, Asian stocks rose ahead of the Fed's move, with banks and property issues leading the way. In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies ended 0.8% higher at 16044.72. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.8% at 6680.4 and South Korea's Kospi advanced 1% to 1925.07. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 725.74 points, or 2.5%, to 29226.84 while the China Enterprises Index, or shares of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, added 1.8% to 17497.77. Shanghai's Composite Index rose 0.3% to 5175.07.  Others see clouds on the horizon, figuring that a slowdown in the U.S. still would deal a significant blow to India's prospects. A Morgan Stanley report yesterday forecast a 26% decline in the Sensex in 2008, to less than 15000. It cited the prospect of a U.S.- recession-led selloff in global stocks, slower earnings growth in Indian companies and lower trading volumes, among other factors.
