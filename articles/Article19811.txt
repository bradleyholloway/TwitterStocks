 Vioxx Recall Raises Questions on FDA's Safety Monitoring   By Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2004  In June, House and Senate committees asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to examine the relationship between the FDA's drug-review divisions and the agency office that focuses on drug safety, to determine whether safety researchers' views are taken seriously enough. The broad inquiry was sparked by the FDA's response to the potential risks posed by antidepressants, but the Senate Finance Committee has since asked the FDA specifically about Vioxx.  Though FDA officials have said they believe that they took the proper actions with respect to Vioxx, based on the information they had -- including warning language added to the drug's label in 2002 -- others are raising questions. "I'm concerned about how the agency has been handling matters of drug safety," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement. He added that in the wake of Merck's voluntary recall of Vioxx he was worried that the FDA might have been "foot dragging" in its handling of the drug.  The FDA, for its part, said it has taken a number of recent steps to improve its ability to detect adverse drug reactions or side effects, and has acted against drugs when the evidence warranted. "We are stuck in the middle of a very contentious and fractious debate that has on one side people saying 'we want more cures, shorter development times' . . . and we have people on the other side saying we're too lax," said Dr. Galson, who is also an assistant surgeon general in the U.S. Public Health Service. He added, "we're not sitting back and saying everything's OK and perfect" in the agency's risk-detection tools.
