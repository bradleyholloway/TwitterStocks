 Business World: Ethanol Liberation Movement   By Jenkins, Holman W, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2007  Administration officials have been generous with assurances to the farm lobby that last week's Brazil agreement is no prelude to repealing America's egregious 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on most imported ethanol. Washington simply wants to help Brazil export its technology so other nations can become low-cost producers of ethanol. But the U.S. isn't looking to welcome all this cheap motor fuel into its own market. Banish the thought!  President [Bush]'s heart appears to be in the right place -- he doesn't keep mentioning switch grass for nothing. Switch grass is a prime target for fans of cellulosic ethanol, derived from agricultural waste and non-food plants. It would be cheaper to produce than corn ethanol and wouldn't compete with food crops for prime agricultural land. His Brazilian gambit suggests he understands America's true security lies with a thriving and diverse trade in biofuels based on the combined strength of all the world's consumers and producers.  That's why the ethanol interests, beginning with corn-country Republicans Sen. John Thune and Sen. Charles Grassley in a conference call with reporters last week, are gearing up for a fight over Mr. Bush's Brazilian ethanol policy. Mr. Bush says the tariff isn't an issue, but of course it is. Every step consistent with U.S. support for a global market in ethanol is a harbinger of tomorrow's battle to repeal the tariff and let the domestic ethanol industry defend its place in the market on its real virtues not its ability to pull political strings.
