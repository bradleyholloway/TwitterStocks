 United States v. European Union   By By Robert B. Zoellick, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  As we have waited patiently for European leaders to step forward to deploy reason and science, the EU moratorium has sent a devastating signal to developing countries that stand to benefit most from innovative agricultural technologies. This dangerous effect of the EU's moratorium became evident last fall, when some famine-stricken African countries refused U.S. food aid because of fabricated fears -- stoked by irresponsible rhetoric -- about food safety.  Overwhelming scientific research shows that biotech foods are safe and healthy -- a conclusion that the EU's own Directorate-General for Research reached two years ago. The National Academies of Science and Medicine in France concur. So do the Scientific Academies of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. Dr. C.S. Prakash of Tuskegee University presented me with a statement signed by more than 3,200 scientists world-wide, including 20 Nobel laureates, supporting agricultural biotechnology.  Some claim that we are "forcing" biotech foods on European consumers. Yet all we ask is for consumers to have the right to make their own decisions, a right they are now denied because the EU is blocking access to foods that EU regulators and scientific associations acknowledge are safe. The legal case for biotechnology is clear, the science overwhelming, and the humanitarian call to action compelling. We hope this debate will lead the EU to finally lift its moratorium without imposing new barriers.
