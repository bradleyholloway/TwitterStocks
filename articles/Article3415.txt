 Slim Selection Is Seen for Takeover Targets   By By Vanessa O'Connell, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2001  Bcom3, the Chicago parent to Leo Burnett Group, has said it plans to go public when market conditions are right. But in this environment, there's no telling when that might be. A spokeswoman for Bcom3 says that "market conditions will have an impact" on its plan. She notes there has been speculation about Bcom3's future since the ad-holding concern was created in March 2000. "That will probably continue," she adds.  Michael Bungey, chief executive at Cordiant Communications, says that if somebody made an offer, the company would give it serious consideration. However, he notes that he and the board aren't soliciting offers. "There is life and a future for a high-performing, nimble operator in the ad sector," he says. Cordiant may be best known in the U.S. for its Bates Worldwide ad firm, whose clients include Wendy's International, the burger chain.  General Motors is one of the big marketers the advertising world is watching. It spent a whopping $2.88 billion on advertising last year, according to CMR, a New York research firm owned by Taylor Nelson Sofres. That was 2.5% less than what it spent in 1999. For now, the auto giant has no plans to direct its entire budget to one holding company. "We're going to continue to operate the way we are," says a spokesman for GM. The company relies on agencies owned by Interpublic Group and Bcom3, among others, to develop its ads.
