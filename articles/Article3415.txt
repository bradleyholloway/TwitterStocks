 Hynix Creditors Mull Refinancing Amid Recovery; Proposed $1.97 Billion Deal Would Mean an Early End To Restructuring Process   By Yun-Hee, Kim, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  At the meeting, Korea Exchange Bank outlined a proposal for Hynix to complete its debt-restructuring program this year instead of in 2006. Once the debt-workout program is completed and creditors sell their stakes, the creditors' oversight of Hynix's management will end.  Hynix's fortunes have turned around since the beginning of last year as demand in the semiconductor industry improved following a bruising 2001, when chip prices plunged below production costs. Hynix shares fell 2.5% to 13,500 won each in closing trading.  Hynix moved to a fourth-quarter net profit of 186.1 billion won on revenue of 1.34 trillion won. At the end of 2004, Hynix had 927 billion won in cash and cash equivalents, and its interest-bearing debt stood at 1.83 trillion won.
