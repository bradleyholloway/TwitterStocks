 Ahead of the Tape   By Lahart, Justin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2006  J.B. Hunt is expected to report earnings rose to 37 cents a share in the latest quarter from 35 cents a share a year ago. But a disappointment shouldn't surprise. The Arkansas trucker's business is dependent on the housing market and retailers. It gets about a fifth of its revenue from shipping building materials, glass and forest and paper products. Another two-fifths comes from retailers.  Its biggest customer, accounting for about 15% of sales, is Wal-Mart Stores -- which sits about 10 miles from its headquarters. The giant retailer has reported weak sales growth for September, which doesn't bode well for J.B. Hunt. Other retailers saw healthy sales, but with the outlook uncertain, they seem unlikely to stock up heavily before the holidays.
