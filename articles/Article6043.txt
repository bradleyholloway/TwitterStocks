 Wide Price Swings in Pulp, Paper Prices Smoothed Out by Use of Hedging Tools   By By Nicholas Elliott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1998  U.S. pulp and paper producers and consumers, buffeted in recent years by extreme price volatility, are taking advantage of hedging tools being offered by a small number of companies.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., part of Enron Corp., International Forest Products Corp., and Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, are offering customized swap agreements which allow buyers and sellers of pulp and paper products to offset some of their price risk.  Enron and Citibank have been marketing their contracts for about two years, but there has been a surge of interest in recent weeks. International Forest Products, which is offering its hedging program in partnership with Southern Co., signed its first deals in December. Increase in Price Quoting "Over the last six or eight weeks there's been a big acceleration of active pricequoting," said Steven Schoch, vice president and treasurer at Times Mirror Co. The Los Angeles publisher now has a hedging program for its purchases of newsprint and lightweight-coated paper.
