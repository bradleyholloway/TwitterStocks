 Tastings: A Wine Lover's Guide to Valentine's Day --- We Offer Some Suggestions To Help Make Your Wine As Special as Your Evening   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2000  Unfortunately, ordering wine, especially at a fancy restaurant with a big wine list, is an unsettling experience for many people. They're afraid of looking stupid, or cheap, or unsophisticated. That's why too many people immediately fall back on overpriced Bordeaux, overpriced California cult wines or overpriced common wines they're already familiar with.  Check the Internet. It's a whole new world. We're hardly high-tech experts, but we just plugged in "wine list" to the popular search engines and dozens of wine lists, from all over the world, popped up. Spend some time browsing through them, getting a feel for what various wine lists look like. Restaurants rarely give you enough time to get comfortable with their wine lists. Now you can do it at home, on your computer.  Preorder your wine. Yes, we know this seems scary, but at least think about it. Drop by the restaurant sometime before Valentine's Day; tell them you have a reservation, and ask if you can look at the wine list now. Have a seat and choose a bottle (truth is, the restaurant will likely be so charmed by this that someone might come over to give you some advice). Ask them if the bottle can be on your table when you arrive. Trust us on this: When you're led to your table and there's already a bottle of wine sitting there that you took the time to choose ahead of time, your date will be impressed, and touched. Dottie sure was when John surprised her this way on our first anniversary.
