 Philippine Elections Will Test Arroyo's Clout   By Hookway, James, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2004  The Philippines's economic struggles have aggravated the political fault lines between rich and poor. The middle class and the country's business elite largely are behind Ms. [Gloria Macapagal Arroyo], a U.S.-trained economist and the daughter of a former Philippine president. Many poorer Filipinos are backing Mr. [Fernando Poe Jr.], who, like Mr. [Joseph Estrada], built a movie career portraying downtrodden working-class heroes.  Still, Several recent opinion polls suggest the 57-year-old Ms. Arroyo is getting her message of continuity and disciplined management across to poorer Filipinos. According to a Pulse Asia poll conducted April 26-29 and reported this week, Ms. Arroyo led the presidential race with the backing of 37% of voters surveyed; Mr. Poe scored 31%. Another recent poll by Social Weather Stations showed that 35% of the people it surveyed said they would vote for Ms. Arroyo, while 31% favored Mr. Poe.
