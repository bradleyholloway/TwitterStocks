 Year-End Review of Markets and Finance: Flood of Corporate Restructuring Moves Contributes to Record Year for Financing   By By Ann Monroe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1987  Restructuring was the year's buzzword, as companies struggled to squeeze every penny of financing power out of their assets. The result was another year of unprecedented financing volume. A record $318.3 billion was raised by U.S. issuers here and abroad, almost twice 1985's $171 billion.  Robert G. Scott, head of the fixed-income syndicate at Morgan Stanley & Co., estimates that as much as a third of last year's financing volume stemmed from just one type of restructuring -- the buyback of high-coupon debt. Many corporations also bought back preferred stock and unwound high-coupon interest rate swaps.  According to industry estimates, about 45% of the $26 billion in junk securities issued through Sept. 30 was related to acquisitions and leveraged buyouts. However, as a result of the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, there is some disagreement about whether that level can be sustained. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is by far the biggest player in the highyield market. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating, among others, Drexel and its junk bond operation.
