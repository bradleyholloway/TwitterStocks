 Who Says the World of Business Has Too Much Regimentation?   By By Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  PLYMOUTH, Mich. -- Sixteen somber men in blue business suits line up four abreast under the blazing sun, briefcases in hand. Suddenly, they break into an a capella version of the old rock favorite "Do Wah Diddy Diddy," marching in cadence past applauding crowds.  The Fred Hill Haberdashers Briefcase Drill Team is not your normal parade entry. Formed in 1985 by Frederick W. Hill, owner of a men's clothing store here, the group has become the hit of this Detroit suburb's annual July Fourth celebrations.  Mr. Hill recruits marchers from among his customers. He provides the routines, matching silk ties and pocket handkerchiefs. The men provide their own suits and briefcases and attend two brief practices before each appearance.
