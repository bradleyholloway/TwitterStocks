 Familiar Ring: Deutsche Telekom Is On the Prowl Again To Buy Global Heft --- After Several Fizzled Deals, Telephone Titan Needs A Qwest-Type Trophy --- Others on the Target List   By By William Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2000  BONN -- Just last week, Ron Sommer, chief executive of German phone titan Deutsche Telekom, faced Europe's technology elite in a darkened conference hall and asked bluntly: "Will we plow the global economy or will it plow us under?"  With its home market, which still accounts for more than 90% of revenue, under attack by companies large and small, Deutsche Telekom has been trying to go global for years. But its minority stakes in Asian telecommunications firms were nearly wiped out by the Asian financial crisis. Its Global One alliance with Sprint Corp. and France Telecom SA, which aimed to provide telecommunications services to multinationals, produced nothing but losses and now belongs entirely to the French. And a bold bid to acquire Telecom Italia SpA flopped. Turning a state-owned monopoly, still 65%-owned by the German government, into a fleet-footed competitive enterprise is tough.  So now Mr. Sommer is eyeing a couple of big fish in the U.S. -- including Qwest Communications International Inc., U S West Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd., which is building an underseas telecommunications network intended to link five continents. If he reels one of those companies in, he will transform Deutsche Telekom overnight. Associates say he has never been more determined to complete a deal and achieve his goal of creating a global powerhouse from what was once a piece of the German post office.
