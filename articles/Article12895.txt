 Prescriptions: When a Sense of Control Vanishes   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2003  "Every one of my patients is affected," says Rona Fields, a Washington practitioner who is an expert in trauma psychology. Fear resulting from the onslaught of "anonymous, ambiguous and unpredictable" threats is triggering all sorts of emotional distress. "People feel like there is nothing they can do," she says, "and that leads to anxiety and anger, and even depression and physical illness."  Gilbert Reyes, a psychology professor at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, says many people are suffering because the current situation is so unusual. He says people are reacting to what he calls "threat activation." Normally a threat subsides, but these days the activation is constant and coming from numerous sources, meaning there is little opportunity for relief. "If you are threatened, you want to control that threat," Dr. Reyes says. "But if you can't, you may try to be controlling in other ways, such as getting angry or being self-destructive."  Dr. Reyes suggests several helpful responses. People on edge should reduce the amount of bad news they are exposing themselves to, simply by turning off the television. Many people are drawn to the media hoping for some good news, but get another dose of threat activation. Instead, he suggests, people may find relief by taking "positive" actions, such as being nice to someone at work. Exercise, eating well, getting enough sleep or meditating also are "positive responses" beneficial at times like these, he says.
