 Color MSNBC Red, White and Blue   By By Sally Beatty and Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2002  In a wide-ranging memo sent to news staff yesterday morning, MSNBC President Erik Sorenson tried to define the channel's mission in the post-Sept. 11 world as to "serve the American people." As a result, MSNBC will now be known as "America's NewsChannel." The cable property is owned jointly by NBC and Microsoft Corp.  Patriotic displays may not be enough to help the channel, which is an also-ran compared with rivals Fox News Channel, a unit of News Corp., and CNN, a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. MSNBC's ratings among the coveted 25-to-54-year-old audience are down 9% in prime time this year, compared with a year ago. Part of the network's problem is that it shares programming with sister channel CNBC. Its strategy has also flip-flopped. Recently, MSNBC moved from a mix of documentaries and news toward a Fox News-style mix of opinion shows and news.
