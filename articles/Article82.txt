MANILA, Feb. 16â€” Three Philippine soldiers were charged today with kidnapping and murdering the nephew of a general accused of involvement in the killing of the opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino Jr.  A police spokesman said the three were charged in connection with the death of Alfredo Olivas, 25 years old, whose beaten body, bound with telephone wire, was found Thursday in a remote area south of Manila.  He was the nephew of the Metropolitan Manila police commander, Maj. Gen. Prospero Olivas, one of 26 people accused of involvement in the killing of Mr. Aquino and Rolando Galman, who was named by the military as Mr. Aquino's killer.  The spokesman said the soldiers seized Mr. Olivas on a street corner in central Manila last Tuesday after a group of young men shouted abuse at them. He said the men had been identified by witnesses.
