 German Opposition Party Unveils Cautious Plan   By Walker, Marcus, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2005  Under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left government since 1998, Germany has tried to boost growth and job creation through cuts to welfare benefits while leaving most of the nation's traditional economic arrangements in place, including strict protections against worker layoffs and a strong role for unions in setting pay. But Mr. Schroeder's popularity has collapsed this year as unemployment has risen to about 11.6%.  While Mr. Schroeder's Social Democrats have shifted to the left in the current election campaign, pledging higher taxes for the rich, the Christian Democrats are treading a fine line between making serious proposals for change and not allowing Mr. Schroeder to tar them as antiworker. Overall, the party doesn't propose to cut down the size of the state but to shift the burden of funding it away from employers.
