 Deals & Deal Makers: Venture Firms In Europe Fear Liability Suits   By By Charles Fleming, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2001  European countries' bankruptcy laws tend to be harsher on company directors than U.S. laws. In the U.S., company directors have most to fear from disgruntled minority shareholders and will generally hold "directors and officers" insurance policies to protect themselves. In a number of European countries, however, individual corporate directors can be held personally liable by the court-appointed receiver for a failed company's debts. In addition, few European insurance firms offer so-called D&O policies (although U.S. insurers such as Chubb and American International Group now market them in France).  The growing concerns have prompted some French venture capitalists to re-examine the way their investments are structured. "We're looking at this very closely," says Olivier Protard, a partner at Sofinnova Partners in Paris. He adds that Sofinnova is looking at restructuring some of its portfolio companies to adopt a two-tier board system, with a supervisory board for outside shareholders and a management board for company employees. The advantage is that supervisory-board members are less likely to be personally liable for a company's debts.  Continental Europe came relatively late to the venture-capital game, having long relied on bank loans to finance its young companies. During the past two years, there has been a sudden rush of money into the sector as banks, insurance companies and industrial groups have looked to get a piece of the action, spurred on by the hype surrounding the Internet revolution. Right from the beginning, however, many French institutional investors were uneasy about the U.S. model of accepting a seat on the board of directors. (In Germany, external investors can only take a seat on the supervisory board, since the management board is reserved for internal officers.)
