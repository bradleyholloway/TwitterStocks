 Texas Air Co-Founder Carney Sells Stake For $11 Million to Focus on Travel Firm   By By Steve Frazier, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1986  Robert J. Carney, who helped Frank Lorenzo found a tiny airline-consulting firm 20 years ago and build it into one of the nation's fastest-growing airline operators, has sold his stock in the financial holding company that controls Texas Air Corp.  Mr. Carney, 45 years old, sold his 32% stake in Jet Capital Corp. for $11 million and resigned as chairman of Texas Air's executive committee. He remains a director of Texas Air, which operates Continental Airlines and New York Air and which has agreed to acquire Eastern Airlines.  Mr. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, purchased part of the Jet Capital stock that Mr. Carney sold, solidifying his voting control of the web of airline companies controlled through Jet Capital.
