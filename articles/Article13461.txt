 Airfares Rise as Price of Oil Soars; Higher Fuel Costs Emerge As a Test for AMR, Rivals In Newly Profitable Sector   By Trottman, Melanie, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  "Given surging crude prices, fare increases are occurring at a stepped up pace," said J.P. Morgan airline analyst Jamie Baker, who said he has also witnessed stepped up efforts from smaller airlines, including AirTran Holdings Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. in the past week.  Of the 10 broad fare increases made so far this year, six have occurred in the past two months, Mr. Baker said. Five broad attempts this year have failed. Despite the industry's fare increases, domestic ticket prices still remain some 12% to 13% below their all-time peak levels in 2000, he said.  Other airlines are feeling the pressure, too. Continental Airlines Inc. recently raised its quarterly jet-fuel forecast to $2.50 a gallon from $2.35. And jet fuel is now the leading expense for airlines, accounting for 25% of their costs in the second quarter, according to the Air Transport Association, a U.S. trade group.
