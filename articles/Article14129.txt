 The Kids Are Not All Right   By By Helen Dudar, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1985  Bret Easton Ellis has just become a published novelist, and he'd probably be totally nervous about the event if it weren't for schoolwork. So here he is, down from Bennington College in his city clothes (notably, a suit jacket whose sleeves stop before his wrists start), sitting in his publisher's office over the usual breakfast (Diet Coke and unfiltered Camels), talking disarmingly about the "sort of saving grace" of such distractions as term papers and catch-up reading in Proust and Dostoevski.  Still, there have been jolting moments. Mr. Ellis is 21, a Bennington junior, and for a person who's been working toward this occasion since he mastered the written word, he has a lot to learn about the ego-feeding rewards of the book business. Fledgling authors have been known to pass up food, drink and sex for a view of their work on display in bookstores. Mr. Ellis encountered a great stack of his in the campus shop one day and hasn't been back since. "It's really tense," he says, by which he could mean something more elemental; Bret Ellis is not into heavy emotional verbal display.  Well before publication, word around the publishing industry was heralding "the new" Jay McInerney ("Bright Lights, Big City") or "the next" David Leavitt ("Family Dancing"). Bret Ellis was the young literary find of this season. Although Mr. Ellis considers the comparisons agreeably flattering, they are hardly fair to an original, abundantly talented, if not fully mature, voice. Mr. Ellis was 18 when he began his book and set down his opening sentence, a compelling metaphor for a place where everybody has relationships and nobody connects: "People are afraid to merge on freeways in Los Angeles."
