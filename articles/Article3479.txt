 BP Sets India Venture, Explores China Tie-Ups   By Chip Cummins and Jason Singer in London, Bhushan Bahree in New York and Kate Linebaugh in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2005  BP has invited bids from international banks related to advisory work for a possible partnership with a Chinese company, according to two people familiar with the invitation. One person familiar with the request said the partnership being explored would involve BP and Sinopec jointly bidding for energy assets in the Americas, excluding the U.S. BP's move to invite bids from bankers suggests these plans are in the early stages, according to another person preparing a bid for the work.  Mr. [John Browne] has sought out avenues for broadening the company's access to the Chinese market. These have included exploring an additional tie-up with energy giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The concept for the partnership, proposed by BP, envisioned BP providing Sinopec supplies of crude for Sinopec's extensive refining operations, according to these people. In exchange, BP would get greater access to China's market for refined petroleum products, such as gasoline, these people said.
