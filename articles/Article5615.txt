 World Cup 1998: The Finals: Watching the Cup   By By Steve McKee, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  Ratings kick? For once, the soccer gods have been kind to ABC. A Brazil-France Sunday final is as good as it gets. We can already hear Brent Musburger: "The best team vs. the home team!" Now, will anybody watch?  Praiseworthy. ABC/ESPN's don't-blink coverage has been wonderful. Only complaint: Too much jingoism -- until the U.S. team exited. As promised, the networks let the Cup tell its own story. Guess what? It's been a great story -- and we didn't need a report on, say, the restaurants of Paris to make it one.  This portion brought to you by... A GOAL BY RONALDO! ESPN's Roger Twibell was reading his thank-you-sponsors-for going-ad-free card when the Brazilian struck 21 seconds into the second half of Brazil-Netherlands. A chuckling Mr. Twibell made the call, then finished the card. Univision was in commercial and barely got to Andres Cantor's Goool! call. Univision says the French TV feed started 20 seconds early.
