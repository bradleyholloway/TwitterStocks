 Hindu Nationalists Search for Finance Minister --- Choice Will Affect India's Credibility   By By Jonathan Karp, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1998  The Bharatiya Janata Party got a boost at the polls by putting forward Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a respected moderate, as its candidate for prime minister. Now that the Hindu nationalists are close to forming India's government after having won the most seats in India's elections, a tussle is under way over how to fill an equally important post: finance minister.  Faced with a sharp slowdown in India's economy, the BJP has been courting accomplished technocrats, including at least two former central-bank governors who are considered reformers. But in recent days, party members have sought to reclaim the post for a politician. The choice will be critical to the new government's credibility with foreign investors, and it will be the first test of whether the BJP's pragmatists or protectionists dominate.  "The principal challenge for the new government is the restoration of (economic) confidence internally and internationally," says Jaswant Singh, a BJP moderate who was finance minister in the party's abortive 13-day government in 1996. "The leadership of our party is mindful of this responsibility. The right man will be chosen."
