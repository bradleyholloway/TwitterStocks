 MCorp Seeks Federal Bailout After U.S. Audit --- Latest Texas Bank Rescue Could Require $2 Billion To Stave Off Auction   By By Leonard M. Apcar, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1988  "It's sad to see what has happened to InterFirst Corp., RepublicBank Corp. and others who were so dynamic now being operated by companies outside the state,"said a glum Gene H. Bishop, MCorp's chairman and chief executive officer, who sat quietly fingering his ever-present cigar at a news briefing late last Friday.  Mr. Bishop put up the scrappiest fight of all to preserve MCorp, Texas's second largest banking company with $20.1 billion in assets, as a Texas institution. Now, he wants the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to bail out his bank -- without the help of another corporation. "It's important to have a strong, locally owned institution" that is "closer to the needs and demands of the Texas economy," he said.  Mr. Bishop would only discuss MCorp's bailout proposal in vague terms, but said he thought the company had given regulators a plan they could act quickly on. The plan to restructure and recapitalize the bank holding company's 25 banks, it is understood, would involve about $1 billion in federal aid. The most ambitious feature of the MCorp plan involves raising about $300 million in fresh capital, mostly from unidentified Texas sources, although one prominent potential investor is a corporation controlled by Cincinnati banker and financier Carl Lindner.
