 Legal beat: Will promises of silence pass tests in court?   By Jacobs, Margaret A, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1995  Although companies expect employees who sign confidentiality agreements to remain silent, when employers ask courts to enforce such agreements, judges are beginning to balance a company's right to protect its secrets against the public's right to know about corporate wrongdoing--especially when it involves public health and safety. In the most high-profile example, the Kentucky Supreme Court is expected to hear a challenge on Dec 14, 1995 to a temporary restraining order barring former Brown & Williamson executive Jeffrey S. Wigand from disclosing "trade secrets and other proprietary information" to federal and state authorities investigating the tobacco industry's handling of safety questions involving cigarette smoke.
