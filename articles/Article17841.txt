 Amdahl Unveils A Faster Line Of Computers --- New Mainframe Machines Are IBM-Compatible; Shipments Start in June   By By James P. Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1988  Amdahl Corp. leap-frogged its competitors by introducing a new series of high-end IBM-compatible mainframe computers that it says are faster than any other mainframes in the market.  Amdahl said the 5990 models are as much as 50% faster than its earlier-generation 5890 series. The 5990 will come in two versions, with shipments of one beginning in June and the more powerful version available before year end.  While the price-performance relationship -- the price of the machine divided by its computing power -- isn't increased by the new models, Amdahl said the more-powerful mainframes will permit customers to "do more with fewer machines," an advantage in itself. Amdahl will now be able to boast that its top-end machines not only offer a better price-performance ratio, something that its current models already do, but are now faster as well.
