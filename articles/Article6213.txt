 WorldGate Has Internet Service Using Cable TV --- Cable Viewers Can Click Between On-Air Ads, Company Web Sites   By By Dinah Wisenberg Brin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1999  BENSALEM, Pa. -- Hal Krisbergh and a colleague chewed on the idea over lunch in late 1994: a low-cost, high-speed Internet service that customers could reach through their television sets and standard cable-converter boxes.  Less than five years later, Mr. Krisbergh's WorldGate Communications Inc., based outside Philadelphia, is making inroads in U.S. and overseas markets, offering a cable-TV-based Internet connection and electronic-mail for $4 to $12 a month, less costly than typical Internet services.  Besides potentially bringing the Internet to millions who don't have personal computers or, in some cases, phone lines, Mr. Krisbergh said, WorldGate's technology turns TV into an interactive medium.
