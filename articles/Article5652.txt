 In U.S. Courts, the Whole Truth Is Often Anything But   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 9, 1998  A case in point: Esther Rodriguez vs. Mars Inc., maker of candy bars. Ms. Rodriguez, a custodial worker at a Snickers plant in Chicago, filed a federal lawsuit in 1996 against Mars alleging sexual harassment. During the proceedings, Mars lawyers asked her how she had spent her time during certain intervals of her career. She replied, in a sworn deposition, that she had been caring for her sick father. Later, Mars discovered that during the time in question she had been in prison, convicted of felony theft.  "It happens all the time," says Samuel B. Kent, a U.S. district judge in Galveston, Texas. Last month, the judge prevailed upon the plaintiff in an insurance case to drop his suit after it became clear that he had a history of filing suspicious fire claims and, according to the judge, "very likely burned down his own house."  Perjury -- defined as the intentional misrepresentation of a material fact -- is tough to prove and usually not a priority for prosecutors operating on a limited budget. Still, some perjury cases are vigorously prosecuted, and some courts do come down hard on those who lie. This past summer, a psychiatrist at the Boise (Idaho) Veterans Administration Hospital was convicted of obstructing justice and sentenced to home detention and probation after lying about a sexual liaison with a patient who had sued the hospital for malpractice. And in Washington, D.C., an orthopedic surgeon who had been a much-used expert witness for plaintiffs in car-wreck cases just finished up an 18-month term in a federal prison camp and halfway house for falsifying his credentials.
