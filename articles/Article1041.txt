 Surgeon General's Stature Is Likely to Add Force to Report on Smoking as Addiction   By By Ed Bean, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 1988  On Monday morning, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop is expected to issue a powerful indictment of tobacco with the release of a report that characterizes smoking as a drug addiction.  The idea that tobacco use is a clinical addiction isn't new. However, Dr. Koop will give it added legitimacy at a time when his leadership in the AIDS crisis has established him as perhaps the nation's most highly regarded health advocate. "When the surgeon general puts his Good Housekeeping seal of approval on a set of scientific facts, it is beyond reproach," says Jay Winsten, assistant dean of the Harvard School of Public Health.  Walker Merryman, head of the Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group, says he's "expecting the worst." Not surprisingly, Mr. Merryman doesn't agree with Dr. Koop's addiction thesis. "I've not heard of anybody holding up a liquor store or mugging an old lady to get the money to buy cigarettes," he says. But he concedes that anything the surgeon general says about tobacco will become almost canonical to many people.
