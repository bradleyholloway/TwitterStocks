BOSTON, April 7â€” A Superior Court judge said today that he would appoint a special master to determine how much money was available in Boston's treasury to keep schools open for the full school year.  At the same time, Judge Thomas Morse Jr. put off until Friday at the earliest a decision on whether to order the city to continue classes through June 19.  The state's Board of Education has filed suit seeking to force the city to operate the school system, which is nearly broke, for the 180 days required under state law. City officials said that they would close the schools when the school department ran out of money, which is expected to happen on April 17.  Mayor Kevin H. White has insisted the city does not have the estimated $38 million needed to run the schools for the rest of the term, but others have questioned the figures used to document that contention. The Boston Teachers Union maintains the city has $50 million to $75 million available from uncollected parking tickets and property taxes and from other untapped sources.
