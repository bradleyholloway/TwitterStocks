 Our Savior?   By Swanson, Bret, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2003  The world's expectations of Google, however, are grander still. In an IPO wasteland, where offerings this year hit a 29-year low, some in Silicon Valley view Google's suspected 2004 public debut as a second coming. A $20 billion IPO could reinvigorate the Valley and part the waters for a new round of Internet capital. (Not to mention single- handedly salvage a nearly wiped-out $2 billion venture fund for top- flight Kleiner Perkins.) Still not satisfied, some are hoping Google uses its exalted platform to transform the entire hierarchy of the closed and clubby IPO system.  Activity in the sector both reinforces [Google]'s strategy and portends greater competition and even peril. Last month Amazon introduced "Search Inside the Book," a standard feature that takes your phrase and finds and displays scanned pages from more than 120,000 books. Amazon's entire catalog of several million books will soon be searchable online. Meanwhile, fellow Seattle giant Microsoft will embed powerful search features in its next operating system, code-named Longhorn. Even as it seeks to emulate Google's functionality, Microsoft recently met with Google to explore a partnership or even an acquisition. Google is said to have resisted, but CEO Eric Schmidt must replay the Netscape case study in his mind every day.
