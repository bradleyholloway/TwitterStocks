 Small-Stock Focus: Accredo Health Falls 21% on Revenue-Target Cut   By By Nick Baker, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  Accredo Health sank 21%, or $8.01, to $29.50, reaching small-cap status, after the Memphis, Tenn.-based health-services provider cut its revenue target for the fiscal year ending in June to between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion after revenue for the December quarter came in shy of the analyst forecast. The company's profit for its fiscal second quarter nearly doubled to 35 cents a share.  Health-care providers, a group that includes Accredo, fell amid concerns about government reimbursement under President Bush's budget. LifePoint Hospitals shed 4.5%, or 1.15, to 24.55, and Province Healthcare (NYSE) lost 2.7%, or 18 cents, to 6.42.  BankUnited Financial rose 5.3%, or 84 cents, to 16.64 on word that it will join the S&P SmallCap 600 Index tomorrow, replacing struggling Luby's (NYSE), which shed 6.6%, or 13 cents, to 1.85.
