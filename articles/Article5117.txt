 Defense & Business -- A Special Report --- A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By Compiled by Lynn Asinof, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1990  Fewer than 20% of the large defense firms convicted of corrupt activities in the past year have been cut off from any of their lucrative military business. Boeing Co., Grumman Corp., Raytheon Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft unit, among others, pleaded guilty to illegal information-swapping on the condition that prosecutors recommend they remain eligible for contracts.  Investigators say the law doesn't permit suspension from bidding unless a firm refuses to cooperate with prosecutors and balks at imposing tighter management controls. Thus, deciding to plead guilty "is strictly a money issue for the corporations," says Washington defense attorney Joseph Covington. He says fighting the charges may make the Pentagon get tougher.  Small high-technology firms that subcontract with major defense companies expect many of their contracts to be dropped or canceled as the defense budget is chopped over the next few years. If a rumored freeze on defense spending occurs, "small businesses will be hurt first," says Donald Grigg of the Association of Small Research Engineering and Technical Services Companies.
