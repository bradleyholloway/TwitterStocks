 PURSUITS; Leisure & Arts -- Masterpiece: Mackintosh's Sweet Success; The Willow Tea Rooms of 1903 marked the zenith of his career   By Coles, Bill, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2007  It was Cranston's brother [Stuart Cranston], a tea merchant, who had set up the world's first tea room in Glasgow in 1875, and it had proved an instant hit. The tea rooms were not just teetotal (in a city infamous for its alcohol abuse), but also eminently respectable. In starchy Victorian Britain, the tea room had become the only place where a middle-class lady could dine without a chaperone.  She first teamed up with [Charles Rennie Mackintosh] in 1896, commissioning him to decorate the walls of her first tea rooms. Cranston wanted her tea shop to leave customers open-mouthed with wonder -- and in this Mackintosh more than succeeded. The celebrated English architect Edwin Lutyens wrote to his wife-to-be: "The result is gorgeous! And a wee bit vulgar! . . . It is all quite good, all just a little outre, a thing we must avoid and shall too."  Mackintosh was just 27 when in 1897 he won a prestigious competition to design Glasgow's new art school. It was a job that was to make Mackintosh's name, but very nearly broke him. Every day was spent locked in battle with the soul-destroying art-school building committee. Cranston, by contrast, was "delighted with everything [Mackintosh] suggested" for her new rooms at the Willow.
