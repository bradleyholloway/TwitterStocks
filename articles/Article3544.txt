 Why 'The Number' Hasn't Quite Added Up   By Trachtenberg, Jeffrey A, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  The Free Press hasn't given up on "The Number." "We still think this book can sell as a hardcover for the remainder of the year," says Martha Levin, Free Press's publisher. To give the book a boost, the Free Press is buying 30 15-second ads that will air around Jim Cramer's "Mad Money" TV show on CNBC starting April 3 and lasting two weeks. Although Free Press won't comment, it's likely that the book has already turned a profit.  Some retailers also remain optimistic. Dave Hathaway, the business book buyer at Barnes & Noble, says he bought "The Number" and hasn't returned a single copy. "I had hoped it would sell like crazy," he says. "Did a little part of me feel down? Yes. But this is a book that hasn't been done before and we believe in it."  While reviewers were mostly kind to "The Number," the book was criticized in this newspaper and the New York Times, which found that "the breakthrough promised in the subtitle - a completely different way to think about the whole subject - is also not in the book." On Amazon.com's Web site, "The Number" received an average customer review of three stars out of a possible five. One irritated reader complained that "what needed to be said could easily have been stated in 100 pages or less."
