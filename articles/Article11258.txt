 When Franchisees Go Their Own Way --- Dairy Queen Seeks to Rein In Unruly Empire   By By Barbara Marsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1989  The owner of a Dairy Queen franchise in Wilmette, Ill., refuses to march in lock step with other outlets. He insists on serving hamburgers instead of the standard Dairy Queen food menu of hot dogs and barbecued beef. He doesn't provide chairs or benches; customers can sit on a guardrail near a busy road.  Few franchise operations illustrate the problem as well as International Dairy Queen Inc. Over the years, the system has had so many problems getting franchisees to operate in unison that Ray Kroc, the late founder of McDonald's, once said the secret of success in franchising was to avoid doing everything Dairy Queen did.  Mr. Campbell and other critics focus mostly on the company's lack of consistency, such as the menu variations from one Dairy Queen to the next. Some franchisees serve meals in addition to the soft-ice-milk treats; others stick to the treats, depending on the area, franchise agreements -- and the whims of franchisees.
