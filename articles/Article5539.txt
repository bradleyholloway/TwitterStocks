 Chock full o'Nuts Plans to Re-Enter Coffee Shop Market --- Company Going Back to Roots In Crowded Gourmet Field, Raising Analysts' Doubts   By By Dave Kansas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1993  Chock full o'Nuts wants to rediscover its past by going back to the future.  After leaving the coffee shop business in the early 1980s, the coffee roasting company said it plans to compete with the popular gourmet coffee market, where such chains as Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. are showing bustling sales. Chock full said it plans to open its first store in Manhattan in early 1994.  The decision to re-enter the coffee retail market, especially at the luxury end of the business, raised some doubts among analysts who follow the luxury coffee business. "There are a lot of people out there trying to sell coffee," said John Rohs, an analyst with Wertheim Schroeder. "{Chock} knows the coffee business, but I think we're talking about another level here."
