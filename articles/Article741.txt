 Ford Is Said to Pick Whipple to Head European Operations, Succeeding Lutz   By By Amal Nag, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1986  Ford Motor Co. will send its vice president for corporate strategy and analysis to run its European operations, a surprise choice that indicates Ford may rethink its approach to the intensely competitive European market.  Mr. Whipple hasn't had any operating experience at Ford -- a background that had been considered essential to running the European unit in the past. Described as an "articulate" executive, he has held positions in international finance and at the Ford Motor Credit unit, and was named vice president, corporate strategy, for Ford in March 1984. He joined the company in 1958 as a financial analyst.  Mr. Whipple's career path contrasts sharply with that of Ford's past European chiefs, including Mr. Lutz, whose entire career at Ford has been in operations. As previously reported, sources close to Ford said Mr. Lutz, the 54-year-old chief executive officer of Ford of Europe Inc. and executive vice president of the parent company, has been offered the top truck post in the U.S.
