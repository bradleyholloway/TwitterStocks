 An 'Obbligato of Bias' Throbs in Background of Any BBC Broadcast   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  Robin Aitken's tempered critique of the consistent and pervasive bias of the BBC's news coverage hit the mark with this listener since 1960 ("The Beeb's Bias," editorial page, June 30). The era when one got a kick from picking up a clear SW signal to hear "This is London," Lilliburlero and Greenwich pips is long past; and, most of all, the expectation of fair, insightful treatment of world events, unavailable anywhere else, is quite over. In fact, listening today to BBC World Service news is much more reminiscent of tuning into "Moscow Mailbag," that lumbering propaganda screed of Radio Moscow, circa 1965-70.  Like others, I will continue to listen to many of the fine feature programs still broadcast from London. Even so, I regretfully conclude that Mr. Aitken is right in saying that until BBC News honestly engages, rather than dismisses, his and others' critique of that broadcaster's lapse from "impartiality and overall fairness, it will not be prudent to trust the BBC." It may be that management at Bush House doesn't care a fig, so long as it can still use its inherited, if now-tarnished, aura of authority and fairness to recruit discontented audiences by giving them what they want to hear. But what does it take to push a nearly five-decades-long listener to the conclusion that BBC is no longer a trusted source of news? A good reputation is built in small increments over time, but can be destroyed rather rapidly. The BBC seems blind to this notion.
