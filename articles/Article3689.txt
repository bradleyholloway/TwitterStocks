 Bargain Basement: Foreclosure Rise Brings Business To One Investor; Mr. Barnes Buys Dregs From Worried Lenders; A Dozen for $35,250   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2007  Mr. [James Odell Barnes] and his investor friends don't fix up the properties. They tack up handwritten "For Sale" signs informing potential buyers of required down payments and monthly payments -- usually just a few hundred dollars each. In essence, Mr. Barnes and his cohorts sell the houses on 15-year installment plans. The interest rates they charge are a steep 12% -- about double the rate of 15-year fixed-rate mortgages for people with strong credit -- and the late-payment penalties are tough. The shaky credit of many buyers warrants it, he say. "Nobody gets cheated," he says.  Mr. Barnes and his partners normally sell the loans to other investors within six months, at a steep discount. George Kastanes, Mr. Barnes's lawyer, estimates that about 30% of buyers eventually default on the loans. So far, the trouble in the subprime market hasn't dampened investor appetite for buying the kinds of loans Mr. Barnes and his partners sell, says Bob Repass, managing director of Bayview First Funding, a Dallas-based buyer of such loans. The seller financing extended by Mr. Barnes, which doesn't involve any banks, is very different from the subprime mortgages made by financial institutions, he says.  Mr. Barnes's associates run credit checks on some potential buyers, but they don't interpret credit reports the way banks do. "Not paying your hospital bill I don't hold against you," says Mr. Barnes. He says he wants to know: Have you cheated people? Do you have a job? And are you paying your rent? "You do a whole lot on the seat of your pants, just listening to people talk," he says. "It don't take long to figure out if they're running a game on you."
