 United Telecom and Sprint Consolidate Business to Curb Costs, Boost Efficiency   By By Mary Lu Carnevale, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1989  United Telecommunications Inc. and its US Sprint Communications Co. unit announced a long-awaited consolidation to curb costs, improve efficiency and react more swiftly to the market.  The realignment, which essentially splits the business into its long-distance operations and its local telecommunications operations, comes nine months after United Telecom brought controlling interest in Sprint from GTE Corp. United now owns 80.1% of Sprint and has options to acquire the rest.  Analysts speculated that United Telecom not only is concerned about curbing costs but also wants to get its top management in place in anticipation of the retirement next spring of Chairman Paul H. Henson, who along with Mr. Esrey has reshaped United Telecom from a local telephone concern to a rapidly expanding long-distance carrier. Mr. Esrey is expected to be named to the added post of chairman once Mr. Henson retires.
