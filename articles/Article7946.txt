 American Express Plans Huge Shearson Recapitalization   By By Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1989  The proposal includes a public sale of between 10 million and 22 million new Shearson shares and an investment of about $300 million by American Express, which currently owns 61% of Shearson, according to people with knowledge of the plan.  In a possible third, separate transaction, American Express is holding talks with Revlon Group Inc. Chairman Ronald O. Perelman about his buying a minority stake in Shearson. Under discussion is a plan for Mr. Perelman to pay about $250 million for a 9.9% stake in Shearson. But the rest of the proposed recapitalization isn't contingent on a deal with Mr. Perelman, which isn't certain, the people said.  If it succeeds, the proposed recapitalization would alter the ownership of Shearson. Following the public offering, and assuming Mr. Perelman agrees to purchase the Shearson shares, American Express's stake in Shearson would drop below 50%, probably to between 45% and 48%, the people said. By dropping below the 50% mark, Shearson's assets and liabilities would be removed from the financial statements of the credit-card, travel and financial-services company. That has been a goal of American Express for several years.
