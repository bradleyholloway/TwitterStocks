 Woolwich Purchase Allows Barclays To Focus Elsewhere   By By Wade Lambert, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2000  The Woolwich takeover, announced Friday, will double Barclays's presence in the U.K. mortgage sector to 8% and boost the bank's total client base to 16 million from 13 million, making it the third-largest financial institution in the U.K. based on the number of customers. The takeover also gives Barclays one of the U.K.'s most successful online-banking ventures. Though Barclays already has more online customers than any other bank in the U.K., Woolwich's Internet service is considered far more advanced.  Under Friday's agreement, Barclays will pay 164 pence ($2.45) and 0.1175 Barclays share for each Woolwich share. That amounts to 348 pence a share based on Barclays's latest stock price, a 29% premium over Woolwich's closing price Tuesday, the day before the takeover talks were announced. In trading on the London Stock Exchange Friday, Woolwich closed at 341.5 pence, up 4 pence, and Barclays was down 11 pence at GBP 15.70.
