 New Leukemia Drugs May Prove More Potent Than Gleevec   By Ron Winslow and Jeanne Whalen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2004  The new medicines -- one from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and the other from Novartis AG -- were tested in separate studies of patients with a deadly blood cancer called chronic myeloid leukemia and whose disease had relapsed while they were on Gleevec. In each case, the drugs proved more potent than Gleevec and a substantial percentage of patients went back into remission.  Meantime, UCLA's Dr. [Charles Sawyers] and his colleagues, in research funded by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, determined that resistance to Gleevec resulted from mutations in the BRC-ABL gene that changed the shape of the receptor targeted by the drug. Using techniques to profile the molecular structure of the receptor, Dr. Sawyers and other researchers have identified more than 15 different mutations, each of which, they say, can undercut Gleevec's effectiveness in bIocking the target.  In the Novartis trial, Dr. [Francis Giles] reported that AMN107 led to significant responses in a majority of the study's 65 patients, who had either accelerated or advanced forms of the disease. Audrey Thomas, 69, of Houston, started taking Gleevec during the drug's clinical trials in 1999, when she was in a wheelchair and given about three weeks to live. Gleevec proved remarkable, but after about 18 months, it stopped working. Since she entered the AMN107 trial last June, her health has improved dramatically, she says. "I think it will help a lot of people," she says. "Of course we don't know if this one will quit working like the Gleevec did."
