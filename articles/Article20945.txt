 GATX Gets Proposed Offer For $42 a Share --- Gabelli's Bid of $571 Million Is 1 of 3; Leucadia Meets Adler Price Level of $40   By By John Koten, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1986  The latest proposal came from Gabelli & Co., a New York-based investment firm that said it wanted to form a group that would acquire GATX for $571 million, or $42 a share, in cash and notes.  GATX said it also received a sweetened, $40-a-share proposal from Leucadia National Corp., whose initial $38-a-share proposal three weeks ago triggered the bidding war. Leucadia, an insurance and consumer finance concern that has made hostile takeover bids in the past, agreed that it will refrain from any moves in that direction while GATX considers its bid. Leucadia currently owns 8.9% of GATX's common shares.  The other suitor GATX has identified is a group led by Adler & Shaykin, a New York-based investment banking firm, that late last week proposed paying $40 for each of GATX's 13.6 million shares outstanding. The group includes Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., New York, and Oppenheimer & Co., a New York-based investment concern.
