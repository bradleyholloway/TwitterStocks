 When Dividends Are Sweet, Be Choosy   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2005  Some analysts urge investors to be wary of other companies that sport attractive dividends but are facing challenges in their businesses, such as General Motors, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, ConAgra Foods and Packaging Corp. of America. Still other big dividend payers, including many real-estate investment trusts and utilities, have run up so far in price that they now are quite expensive or don't provide nearly the dividend advantage they once did.  Some say Seattle's Plum Creek Timber falls into that category. This REIT is one of the largest private land and timber owners in the U.S., and pays a generous dividend of close to 4.2%. The company also is expected to see earnings expand about 6% in the next year -- not blockbuster growth, but respectable. When timber prices are high, Plum Creek cuts down more trees to sell; when they are low, it lets them grow, adding value. An added advantage: investing in a timber company can help diversify a portfolio. One reason for caution on Plum Creek is that the stock trades at about 22 times next year's expected earnings, suggesting that it isn't cheap.  GM, for example, has a seemingly healthy dividend of 5.8%. But the big auto maker had a loss of $1.1 billion in the first quarter, and is meeting some resistance from unions in its attempt to reduce onerous health-care benefits. Some say GM may be forced to trim its dividend at some point to conserve cash. "It would be best for them in the long run to cut the dividend," says Mr. [Rahul Sharma]. A GM spokeswoman said there currently are no plans to change the dividend.
