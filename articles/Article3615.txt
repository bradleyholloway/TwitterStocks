 Matador Combines Several Tools to Keep All Your Spam at Bay   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  Once you install Matador, it adds a few buttons to Outlook and begins scanning your incoming e-mail. It compares every e-mail against both a "whitelist" of approved senders it creates from your address book and your sent-mail folder, and a "blacklist" of known spammers it keeps. It also looks for specific phrases and structural characteristics in each e-mail to see if it looks like junk mail. If so, Matador places the e-mail in a special Outlook folder called Matador Junk Mail.  Similarly, if you find a message in your inbox that should have been treated as spam, you can click a "junk" button that will move it to the junk-mail folder and add the sender's address to the blacklist. When you do this, Matador also adds the characteristics of the message to its community spam database.  There are some downsides to Matador. Unlike ChoiceMail, the permission-based program I reviewed a few months ago, Matador doesn't entirely keep spam or possible spam from invading your world. It still sits there in Outlook, taking up space, even though it's in a junk or challenged folder. And because Matador is tied to a single computer, junk mail can still appear on other computers you use to check your e-mail, where Matador isn't running.
