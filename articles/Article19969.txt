 Stocks Decline Amid Inflation Worries [1]  By McKay, Peter A, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2006  Ahead of trading Friday, the Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls rose by 193,000 jobs in January, shy of economists' expectations for a rise of 250,000. Still, the report, including upward revisions for previous months, contained enough strength to prompt concern that the Federal Reserve will have to keep raising short-term interest rates.  In reaction to the jobs news and other hints of economic strength, the yield curve inversion between two-year Treasurys and 10-year Treasurys modestly deepened. Such inversions, which mean short-term Treasurys are paying higher yields than longer-term Treasurys, are unusual and often indicate bond-market pessimism about future growth.
