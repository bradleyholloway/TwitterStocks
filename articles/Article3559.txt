 What My Faith Means; What It Accomplishes   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2006  In his April 6 editorial-page commentary "Theocon Moment," Ross Douthat insinuated that politics and, in particular, the Republican Party, was becoming overwhelmed by so-called "Theoconservatives" like myself who, according to him, brought little to the table regarding the battle for American ideals. In particular, he urged today's leaders to compromise what can only be described as moral values in lieu of "a rhetorical mode that is moral without being moralistic, religious without being sectarian -- and finding a new generation of leaders who are more articulate and less polarizing than the last."  As to "Third World poverty," "Operation Blessing International," which I helped found, has grown into one of the country's top 50 non- governmental organizations providing humanitarian relief to needy people both in the U.S. and abroad, taking in some $240 million annually to provide disaster relief, medical aid, hunger relief, clean water and community development around the world. In the U.S., OBI operates a fleet of trucks that provides some two million pounds of food to needy Americans every week. OBI made headlines in 2004 as a first responder in the Tsunami disaster in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, and again last August when we were on the ground staging supplies along the Gulf Coast days before Katrina hit and then rushing in critical supplies to victims the day after the storm hit.
