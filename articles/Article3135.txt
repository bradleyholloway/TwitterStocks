 Review / Books: The Irishman Who Invented Englishness   By By Claude Rawson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1998  Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816), the author of "The Rivals" and "The School for Scandal," was the most brilliant English dramatist of the 18th century, if you exclude another Anglo-Irishman, William Congreve, whose last play -- "The Way of the World" -- came out in 1700.  Sheridan's plays were developed from the 17th-century tradition of Restoration wit-comedy, which culminated in Congreve's masterpiece. If Sheridan's plays were chaster than the originals, they were almost as sharp and brilliantly amusing. Two of them, "A Trip to Scarborough" (1777) and "The Critic" (1779), were rewrites of Restoration originals. As manager of the Drury Lane Theatre, Sheridan revived and adapted the plays of Congreve and others, defying and placating a genteel public unsympathetic to the old glittering bawdiness.  Fintan O'Toole's lively biography, "The Traitor's Kiss," presents Sheridan as a dramatic innovator. Perhaps. What he did do was to ease the transition to a more bourgeois style of social comedy, which became one of the distinctive marks of the British stage. This comedic style was, to a remarkable extent, the creation of Anglo-Irish writers: Congreve, Goldsmith, Sheridan himself, (Oscar) Wilde, Shaw.
