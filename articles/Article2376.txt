 Homeowners Are Rushing To Refinance --- But Fed's Interest-Rate Cut Hasn't Spurred Frenzy In Loans to Buy Houses   By By Mitchell Pacelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1992  The increase in home mortgage refinancing kicked off by the latest cut in interest rates has grown into a broad surge, fueled by homeowners who missed their chance earlier this year. But the lowest interest rates in 19 years have yet to revive home sales.  To some mortgage lenders, the refinancing scene is already reminiscent of the frenzied activity of January. Last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of refinancing applications jumped to 846, up from 576 a week earlier, and 401 three weeks ago. The Washington trade group expects the index to climb still higher in coming weeks. In January, the index, which is seasonally adjusted, peaked at 1,428.  By contrast, mortgage applications for home purchases haven't picked up nearly as much. The mortgage bankers' index of purchase mortgage applications rose to 137 last week, from 112 a week earlier. That index peaked at 153 in February.
