 Cisco Earnings: Powerful, but No Thrills --- Stock Slips in Late Trading As Tiny Cracks Appear In Mighty Sales Engine   By By Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  It was difficult to determine if such words were part of what Mr. [John Chambers] calls his "healthy paranoia," or new signs of bearishness at one of the country's fastest-growing businesses. For every small sign of weakness, there was an equal sign of strength. For example, Chief Financial Officer [Larry Carter] said Cisco had sharply increased the amount of revenue it deferred from sales through resellers or Cisco's financing arm, suggesting continued strong revenue growth ahead.  Cisco reported its results after regular trading hours. In 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Cisco shares fell $1.63 to $55.13. In after-hours trading, shares continued falling to $54.38. After doubling, on average, in each of Cisco's first 10 years as a publicly traded company, its shares have fallen 33% since their March 27 high.  Also, a Cisco spokesman confirmed that Cisco had agreed to purchase most of the assets of American MetroComm Corp. for $19 million, ending a tangled web of litigation between the two companies. American MetroComm, New Orleans, had sued Cisco earlier this year, claiming that Cisco equipment it purchased didn't work. Cisco countered with claims that officials of American MetroComm had been involved in a scheme to defraud Cisco and its financing arm, through a middleman. American MetroComm had filed for creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in August.
