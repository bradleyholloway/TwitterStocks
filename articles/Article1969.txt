 Business World: Japan's Bid for a Bigger Monetary Role   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1989  When President Bush touches down in Tokyo Thursday to attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, he will know that frictions are building again between the U.S. and Japan. Japanese efforts to reduce their large trade surplus have bogged down and some U.S. officials believe it is because the Japanese remain mired in a mercantilist philosophy that regards surpluses as a measure of economic success. Even the new Japanese tax reform, some argue, penalizes consumption, thus working counter to U.S. demands that the Japanese buy more of the world's goods.  For some time now, the Japanese surpluses have fanned demands from U.S. politicians for stronger trade-protection measures, and no doubt played a part in winning passage of last year's Omnibus Trade Bill. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher is threatening to employ the act more vigorously against the Japanese. This kind of conflict is a threat to world trade and hence to the U.S. economy. Now friction is increasing as well over how the Japanese will employ all the dollars they have been earning. Here again, some Americans are charging mercantilist imperialism.  Now, the Japanese have the large dollar supplies. But the Japanese are managing their own money, by and large, and trying to avoid the errors U.S. banks made in the 1970s. They are trying to protect themselves by forging close working relationships with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other multilateral lending agencies. Resulting efforts to have a stronger voice in these agencies are becoming a challenge to U.S. influence over international monetary policy.
