 Rival Exchange Files Countersuit Against Nymex in Antitrust Case   By By Alexei Barrionuevo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2003  Last November, the Nymex sued Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange, claiming ICE had used Nymex prices that were works of "authorship" protected by copyright law. Yesterday, ICE fired back, suing Nymex to try to stop it from "abusing its monopoly power" by claiming its prices were proprietary.  In its countersuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ICE says the Nymex suit is part of an effort to undermine the credibility of Intercontinental's platform and divert market players to Nymex's new OTC platform. Since May 2002, Nymex has been "systematically adding new services that directly compete" with ICE, the suit says.
