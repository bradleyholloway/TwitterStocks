 Commodities Report: Red Winter Wheat Off Sharply On Large Export Subsidy by EU   By By Lisa Kallal OsterDowJones Commodity News, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 9, 2002  Contributing to the low figure, Egypt, the largest buyer of U.S. wheat, canceled 35,000 tons of soft red winter wheat sales. The U.S. soft wheat market recently has lost sizeable Egyptian business to France because of a lack of price competitiveness.  Jeff Hainline, a grain analyst with Advance Trading, a commodity brokerage and consulting firm in Bloomington, Ill., pointed out that just last year the U.S. exported significant quantities of soft red winter wheat to Spain and that there is some talk that this may "flip-flop" this season and that the U.S. may actually need to import some soft wheat because of tight supplies.  In the past couple of months, U.S. wheat prices have surged on estimates of sharply lower U.S. production, as well as crop problems in other large wheat-exporting nations such as Canada, Australia and Argentina.
