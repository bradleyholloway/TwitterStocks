 Home Isn't Where the Best Returns Are   By By Mara Der Hovanesian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1999  If anybody should have bought shares of Seattle's Amazon.com Inc. last year, it was mutual-fund manager George Hosfield, whose charge is to invest in the best companies the Pacific Northwest region has to offer.  But there is no trace of Seattle's online bookseller in Mr. Hosfield's portfolio. Too bad for investors of the Aquila Cascadia Equity Fund, which might have ridden Amazon.com's dizzying stock ascent from last January's 52-week low of $25 to $360 by year end. Instead, investors got a woeful 3.24% for the year ending Dec. 24, 1998, according to Lipper Inc.  Mr. Hosfield isn't alone in delivering a weak performance for a regional fund. Only a handful of regional funds managed to beat their peer-group averages or the Standard & Poor's 500 index in 1998. Most posted single-digit gains, and some lost money. Among the two dozen regional funds, which account for about $2.7 billion in assets, most invest in small and midcapitalization companies, which worked against them in a year when the market favored large, blue-chip and Internet issues.
