"Fund boards aren't behaving like lap dogs anymore," Mr. Phillips said. "Boards are asking managers to justify fees and are getting back to what they're designed to do."  Although fund companies are suffering a brain drain as more managers jump ship for the more lucrative world of hedge funds, Mr. Phillips noted "your IQ doesn't go up 20 points just because you say you're a hedge-fund manager."
