 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Guilty Whatever Charged   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1990  The independents charge that the retail price of gas charged at some stations owned by the big oil companies is less than the wholesale price independent stations are charged. The oil companies say they can most effectively hold down retail prices at stations they control directly, if indeed "holding down" prices is what's expected of them. Until recently, the Atlantic Richfield Co. was charging 10 cents a gallon less than other stations because most of the oil it markets is its own. In any event, it finally had to put its prices back up when its lower pump prices caused huge lines and caused it to run out of supplies in some areas.
