 Railroad Costs Of Flood to Top $100 Million   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1993  The estimate by the Association of American Railroads, a Washington trade group, was roughly in line with earlier consultants' calculations of the damage inflicted on the U.S.'s railroads. The rail industry has been hit particularly hard by the flooding because many routes lie in river valleys and more than 25% of the nation's rail traffic originates, terminates or passes through flood-ravaged areas.  Meanwhile, some major railroads said that flood-caused delays have led to a nationwide shortage of rail cars to haul coal, grain, ocean containers and truck trailers. Union Pacific Corp. said it is encountering freight train delays of as long as 48 hours in the St. Louis area and equipment shortages from Chicago to Los Angeles and Seattle. The company said it still has some track segments under water but expected to have a key route between St. Louis and Kansas City back in service today.
