 Politics & Economics: In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2007  The European Union and Canada began negotiations on an aviation deal aimed at cutting fares and boosting access to more trans-Atlantic destinations. An "open skies" deal would scrap many market restrictions for airlines and set common standards for safety and security. The EU has reached a similar deal with the U.S. that will allow EU airlines to fly from anywhere in the bloc to any point in the U.S., and vice versa for U.S. airlines. It will take effect March 30.
