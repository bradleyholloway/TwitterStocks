 Church's Is Asked To Meet With Sonic To Discuss Merger   By By Thomas Petzinger Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1987  Church's, a restaurant chain based in San Antonio, Texas, didn't immediately comment on the request by C. Stephen Lynn, chief executive officer of Sonic Industries Inc. But a source close to Church's said the company was baffled by Mr. Lynn's request for a meeting, which explained neither the type of transaction being proposed nor the manner of its financing.  Church's, which operates a network of about 1,500 restaurants, has long been the subject of intermittent takeover speculation and has, on occasion, discussed merger proposals that never came to fruition. The source said yesterday that the company remains open to any proposal that would enhance the value of its shares -- but that in Church's opinion, Mr. Lynn's proposal for a meeting was too vague to merit a formal reply.
