 Facing More Competition, Palm Explores Options   By Dennis K. Berman and Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  In February 2006, one of Palm's biggest individual shareholders, Mark Nelson, sent a letter to the board urging directors to explore a sale of the company. Mr. Nelson, who owned more than 6% of Palm's shares at the time, said the company was in a competitive market that faced "slowing innovation, commoditization and choked margins." In November 2005, another major shareholder, Swiss hedge fund Sagio Investments SA, wrote a letter to the board decrying the company's stock price at the time.  A person familiar with [Palm] said a sale of the company wasn't on the table as of late last year because Ed Colligan, Palm's chief executive, wanted to keep the company independent. Since then, the competitive landscape has grown harsher with news of Apple's imminent entry into cellphones.
