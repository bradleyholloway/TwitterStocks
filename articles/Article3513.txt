 Barron's Insight: Park GM Money in Bonds   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2006  Many listed long-term GM bonds yield about 12%, more than the company's common shares, which, currently trading at around $21, carry a dividend yield of 9.5%. Given GM's losses, which probably totaled more than $2 billion last year, the auto maker's dividend could be in jeopardy. But short of a bankruptcy case, GM is apt to continue paying interest on its $30 billion of debt. So given their high yields and low prices, the GM bonds are likely to provide upside potential if GM's situation improves. And they offer more protection than the stock if GM's situation worsens.  One GM bond, trading under the symbol GMS and maturing in 2048, trades around $15.50, for a yield of 12.25%. This price is equivalent to 62 cents on the dollar because the face value is $25, not the $100 that is standard for bonds targeted to institutional investors. Other GM bonds with similar yields carry the symbols XGM, HGM, RGM and BGM. GM bonds carry junk-grade ratings and yield about six to seven percentage points more than those of top-grade companies like General Electric.
