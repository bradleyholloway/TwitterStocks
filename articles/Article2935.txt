 Taste -- Review & Outlook: Our Man From Havana   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2001  Cmdr. [Carlos Del Toro], you see, was born in Havana and fled Cuba when Fidel Castro, who once imprisoned the commander's father, came to power. At about the same time the Del Toro family left for America, Castro was trying to push America out of its military base at Guantanamo Bay. The commander of that base was Rear Adm. [John Duncan Bulkeley].  In 1964, Fidel accused the American base on Cuba of stealing water even as he cut off the flow. Bulkeley responded by taking reporters out to the two water pipes, cutting off a section of each and showing that the insides were dry -- and that Castro was a liar. Such was the Cuban communists' appreciation for Bulkeley that they honored him with a wanted poster offering a bounty for a man they described as "a guerrilla of the worst species."
