 Donna Karan Posts Disappointing Net, Citing Inventory --- By Teri Agins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1998  Citing costly excess inventory and continued weakness in Asian economies, Donna Karan International Inc. reported a lower-than-expected third-quarter profit and forecast that 1998 might be "break-even."  In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Donna Karan shares fell 56.25 cents, or 6.9%, to $7.5625.  In an interview, John Idol, chief executive officer of Donna Karan, attributed the profit shortfall to problems here and abroad. Business at the company's 57 outlet stores "deteriorated more quickly than we had planned for," he said. Offprice retailing in general has been sluggish, he added, forcing wholesalers like Donna Karan to liquidate merchandise at discounts of as much as 60%. And business in Asia, which will account for roughly 13% of the company's revenue for 1998, has yet to rebound, Mr. Idol said.
