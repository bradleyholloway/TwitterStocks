 Catalog Critic: Flying Into a Blind Panic   By By Lisa Gubernick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2002  As the blinds business keeps expanding, so do potential hassles. Hoping to dress up our windows for summer, we spent a month and a half ordering blinds, drilling holes, installing brackets, pulling hair -- and then ordering still more blinds and drilling more holes . . . At the end of it all, we've decided it's appropriate they call them "blinds" -- because ordering them sight unseen made us feel like we were flying blind.  Interestingly, one company was way ahead of us. The blinds from American Blind and Wallpaper, our cheapest at $113, were 3/8-inch narrower than the measurement we'd given. "Customers are forgiving if it's a little narrow," says the company's president, Steven Katzman, "as long as they can install it and it fits." Amen. Because these were the cheapest blinds -- and they looked good and fit the first time around -- they're our Best Value.  It took several days and phone calls to arrange a return to Country Curtains, and when our blinds came back, the instructions were missing, and they only faxed them to us after we revealed our professional affiliation. The YourBlinds.com experience provided more hair-pulling for us. When we called to order, a clerk said the computer was down and they'd call back. They didn't, so several days later we rang again to place our $188 order. After making five calls to arrange a return, waiting 20 minutes on hold and leaving a message, we finally gave up on getting a cut-down set. ("The person who handles honeycomb blinds was out sick," says the call center's manager. "Someone should have gotten back to you.")
