 Local Landlords Move Into Faraway Markets; As Many Hot Areas Cool Off, Real-Estate Investors Seek to Cash In on Rising Rents in Other States   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  Here's one cautionary tale. Tracy Tippetts, a 55-year-old investor who lives near San Diego, decided in 2004 it was time to take profits on about 55 rental units he owned in that area. "I knew that Phoenix was going to be the next big market," Mr. Tippetts says. A classified newspaper ad led him to a Phoenix broker representing Eddie Klugman, a veteran owner and manager of apartment buildings there. Mr. Tippetts met Mr. Klugman aboard the latter's yacht in San Diego Harbor and later made a quick trip to Phoenix to inspect properties. Mr. Tippetts then invested $2.3 million in four buildings managed and partly owned by Mr. Klugman.  Mr. Tippetts says the value of the buildings has jumped as much as 50% since he invested. But, he says, the rental income he has received so far has been far lower than what was projected in the sales material from Mr. Klugman's broker and that Mr. Klugman has failed to respond to questions about the performance. When Mr. Tippetts made an unannounced visit to one of the properties in March, he saw police making arrests and wrecked cars in the parking lot. Phoenix police confirmed the building had more than 400 police calls in the past two years, including more than 20 involving gunshots or assaults. Mr. Tippetts says he now is reviewing his options on what to do with the investments.  Mr. Klugman concedes that income from some of the properties has been lower than expected. But he says Mr. Tippetts should be happy because the value of the properties is up sharply. "The bottom line is Tracy is stupid" to complain about the situation, Mr. Klugman says.
