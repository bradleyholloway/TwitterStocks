 Gold Prices Begin the Year by Falling; February Futures Drop to Contract Low   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1997  Gold for February delivery dropped $2.60 to $366.60 a troy ounce yesterday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The close marked a new contract low for February gold futures and came 60 cents short of a three-year low on the nearby contract. Spot gold in London fell to a three-year low.  But selling pressures from commodity funds and world-wide producers continued to weigh on the price of gold, which had fallen $2 a troy ounce Tuesday. What made the fall surprising to some traders was that it occurred during two days of losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The two-trading day drop of $4.60, or 1.24%, corresponded with two days of declines in blue chips. The Dow industrials fell more than 100 points Tuesday and fell substantially again yesterday before recovering some of its lost ground. The Dow industrials ended down just 5.78 at 6442.49.  Nonetheless, traders said gold prices usually receive some slight bounce when equities and bonds fall. Charles Bingham, head of the metals trading desk at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., a unit of J.P. Morgan & Co., attributed some of the decline in gold prices during the last two trading days to a lack of trading volume. "The holiday trading session means we had less volume, and the market moves more when there is less volume," he said.
