 Slumping Prices Are Expected to Bruise Aluminum Makers' 3rd-Quarter Profits   By By Chris Adams, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1998  With aluminum prices falling to levels not seen in more than four years, North America's aluminum makers are expected to turn in a lackluster third quarter, with most of the big companies seeing profits drop from the year-earlier period.  "These are difficult times for aluminum makers," said Thomas Van Leeuwen, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. In recent months, the spot price of aluminum on the London Metal Exchange -- a major determinant of profitability -- has hovered near its lowest level since early 1994. In the third quarter, the average LME spot price was 60 cents a pound, down from 74 cents a pound in 1997's third quarter.  The world's largest aluminum maker, Aluminum Co. of America, has already reported its third-quarter results, handily beating Wall Street expectations. But the Pittsburgh company couldn't top last year's numbers, even though it benefited from a strong cost-cutting effort and the inclusion of Alumax Inc., which it acquired earlier this year. Alcoa earned $1.21 a diluted share, compared with $1.22 a diluted share a year earlier, adjusting for a one-time gain. The results, announced Tuesday, topped the First Call Corp. consensus estimate of $1.06 a diluted share.
