 LEISURE & ARTS -- Bookshelf: Unprepared   By Woolsey, R James, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2003  A few examples: Congress makes it illegal to deny visas to members of terrorist groups. Sixteen boxes of plans for Islamist terror taken from Rabbi Meir Kahane's assassin in 1990 sit unopened in New York Police Department custody for years. Law-enforcement authorities conclude promptly that a lone, deranged individual is responsible for any given terrorist act even if substantial leads point toward backing from the Middle East. The CIA and FBI fail to talk to one another; both fail to talk to the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the State Department. Arabic documents are mistranslated by the few overworked linguists, substantially delaying investigations. Politically correct guidelines keep the CIA and FBI from recruiting terrorist informants. American universities go on jihad against the INS's efforts to obey the law and keep track of basic information about foreign students. The White House turns down offers of important information from Sudan about al Qaeda and misses opportunities to grab or kill bin Laden. Fund raising for terror, such as the Holy Land Foundation's and an amazing North Carolina cigarette-smuggling ring, elude the FBI and INS for years. Three major national commissions tell the government to get serious about terrorism and are ignored. Counterterrorism budgets are cut. Insightful FBI agents, working to delve into potential airline hijackings, are thwarted by headquarters and don't learn of one another's efforts. The CIA fails to tell the State Department about two terrorists being tracked in Malaysia -- they get visas and become 9/1l hijackers.
