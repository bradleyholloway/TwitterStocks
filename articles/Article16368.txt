 Home Economics: Where to Park Your Big-Screen TV; As Furniture Options Improve, We Find Some Good Models; Think Wire Management   By Swisher, Kara, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2004  For sets of up to about 50 inches, BDI and Bell'O make a range of solid and attractive pieces. At BDI, the Axis line used a range of curved woods and tempered glass (a must), in a variety of tables and shelf configurations. BDI seems to be focused on being understated, which can sometimes seem boring, but the simplicity is appealing too. BDI's angular Vector line is a slightly different option for those who want a fashion-forward look. BDI units cost from $500 to $800 depending on the size, both in retail stores and online at specialty Web sites like www.racksandstands.com.
