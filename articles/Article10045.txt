 U.S. Seeks Pact on Climate, Hoping to Salvage a Victory   By John D. McKinnon and Marcus Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2007  In a separate interview, one of Mr. [Bush]'s top aides, environmental adviser James Connaughton, suggested the compromise likely would accelerate negotiations on a post-Kyoto accord. The U.S. had previously proposed starting negotiations in the fall and continuing through much of 2008. Mr. Connaughton said talks could begin sooner and perhaps feed into a climate-change summit that United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon plans for the end of the year.  If Ms. [Angela Merkel] helps to achieve a compromise between European Union and U.S. proposals for combating global warming, it would be another example of her mediation skill. Within Europe, her successes include brokering a compromise in a row between France and Britain over how to fund the EU. Ms. Merkel was unable to resolve a litany of disputes this year between Russia and some EU members in Central and Eastern Europe, however.
