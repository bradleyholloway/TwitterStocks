 Comsat, AT&T Reach Accord On Traffic Level   By By Laurie Hays, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1987  Communications Satellite Corp. forged a multiyear agreement with American Telephone & Telegraph Co. that would guarantee Comsat the telephone concern's business in the face of growing competition from fiber-optic cables.  The companies say they hope the agreement resolves a sticky issue before the Federal Communications Commission. The issue involves how much international telephone traffic AT&T would switch over to fiber-optic cable networks from Comsat's satellite services. The companies said they are asking the FCC to accept their agreement and use it in place of current regulations requiring most of AT&T's international traffic to go through Comsat.  Washington-based Comsat is negotiating similar agreements with MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc.
