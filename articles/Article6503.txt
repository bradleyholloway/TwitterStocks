 E-Business: What Sept. 11 Taught a New Telecom Rescue Team --- Locating Signals From Phones Buried Beneath the Rubble Could Help Find Survivors   By By Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2001  Typically, a cellphone is only as good as its connection to the closest radio tower -- which can't be made if the tower has been destroyed, a victim is trapped underground or is perhaps too injured to find a working signal to dial 911. But that doesn't mean the phone itself has stopped working. An activated cellphone consistently sends bursts of radio waves as it scans the ether for a tower to which it can connect. For a disaster victim, those invisible emissions become something of a rescue beacon, a sign of possible life to rescuers who can identify where the signals are coming from.  For rescue operations, the cellular-phone networks can operate almost like an electronic roll call, scanning affected areas for the signals from the wayward or injured. Because the cell towers in and around Ground Zero had been crushed, phone companies brought in mobile cellular towers on wheels. To know whom to look for, the wireless team solicited victims' mobile-phone and pager numbers from the public. Over 5,000 reports rolled in; these were forwarded to the various carriers, who began monitoring their net works for any activity from the devices. Paging networks sent out a remote "ping" to victims' pagers, instructing the pagers to emit an electronic beep every two minutes.
