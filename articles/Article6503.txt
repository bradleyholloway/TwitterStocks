 Morningstar's Earnings Soar 84%; Firm's Dominant Position In Ranking Mutual Funds For Consumers Pays Off   By Arden, Dale, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2005  "From where I stand, straddling the consumer and the professional part of the mutual-fund industry, they don't have any competition," said Roy Weitz, publisher of FundAlarm, a Web site that tracks mutual funds. "Standard & Poor's has tried but not gotten any traction; Lipper has a name and reputation; but most consumers, when they look for a rating, look for Morningstar," said Mr. Weitz. (Standard & Poor's Corp. is a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos.)  The Advisor Workstation is a Web-based investment-planning system, which, along with Principia, a CD-ROM-based, investment-research product, dominates Morningstar's adviser segment. Advisor Workstation licenses in the U.S. increased to 102,606 as of Sept. 30 from 72,190 as of Sept. 30, 2004. Revenue from the Advisor Workstation Enterprise Edition, offered to financial advisers affiliated with large firms, benefited from continued growth in license agreements in the past several quarters, according to Mr. [Joe Mansueto].
