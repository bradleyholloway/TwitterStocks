 Head and Shoulders Above the Rest   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1987  When Bill Bradley was a high-school basketball star in Crystal City, Mo., the "experts" said he should go to Duke instead of Princeton. He'd get just about as good an education, and could be an All-American on a team likely to make the Final Four championships.  After Princeton, the experts said he shouldn't pass up a once-in-a-lifetime, lucrative pro-basketball contract for a Rhodes scholarship. Some years later he was told that if he was interested in politics he should run for a House seat, and that he couldn't start a political career by going for the Senate. Five years ago the experts told him that tax reform was a legislative and political nonstarter.  Bill Bradley ignored the experts each time and became a professional basketball Hall-of-Famer after his stint at Oxford, easily won his initial contest for the Senate and was the architect of the sweeping tax-revision plan adopted by Congress last year.
