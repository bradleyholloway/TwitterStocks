 Answers for Grandparents About 529 Plans   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  This variety prompted one reader to ask: Must the money be invested in a state program -- or "can such funds be placed simply in a certificate of deposit or a savings account under the grandchild's name?" Joe Hurley -- an accountant whose Web site, Savingforcollege.com, is one of the best sources of information about 529s and other savings vehicles -- says there's "no such thing as a 'self-directed' 529. You can't pick and choose your investments." Rather, parents and grandparents have to stick with the states' offerings.  One reader wondered whether a 529 established by a grandparent would "disqualify . . . grandchildren from financial aid to which they would otherwise be entitled." For the most part, the answer is no. Typically, a grandparent's assets aren't reported on financial-aid applications and, thus, have no impact on a student's eligibility for such benefits.
