 U.S. to Challenge EU Moratorium On Genetically Modified Foods   By By Neil King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  The EU imposed a moratorium on approving new biotech products in 1998, reflecting deep concern among European consumers and environmental groups about perceived health issues surrounding genetically modified foods. The move has roiled trade relations with the U.S. ever since. Farm exporters say the ban has blocked sales of genetically modified corn, soybeans and cotton. U.S. corn growers contend the ban has stopped about $300 million in annual sales of bioengineered corn.  Coming amid continued bitterness over the Iraq war, a biotech suit against the EU threatens to strengthen anti-U.S. sentiment in many parts of Europe. EU officials warn that European consumers would respond with a boycott of U.S. food products -- a threat many U.S. food exporters take seriously.  A fight over biotech products would join a lengthening list of high-profile WTO disputes between Europe and the U.S. The EU last week got WTO approval to impose as much as $4 billion in sanctions on U.S. imports in retaliation for a system of export tax breaks for U.S. companies that the international trade body has determined to be illegal. The EU says it will move ahead with the sanctions later this year unless Congress ends the tax breaks. The EU is also fighting to overturn the [Bush] administration's wide-ranging tariffs on imported steel.
