 Will Viewers Vote For Jesse Jackson As Talk Show Host? --- Jane Fonda Is Also Said to Be In Line for Morning Spot In the Glutted Gab Arena   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1989  The already over-populated talk-show arena is about to get a bit more crowded with the entry of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the actress Jane Fonda.  Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution, a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc., has called a news conference for this morning, where TV insiders say it will announce a weekly talk show hosted by the Rev. Jackson that it hopes to sell to television stations through syndication.  Meanwhile, Coastline Partners, a joint venture of MCA Inc. and King World Productions Inc., is developing a weekday morning talk show for Ms. Fonda. While it won't actually star the health-conscious actress/fitness instructor, Ms. Fonda will appear regularly and the title of the show will likely include her name.
