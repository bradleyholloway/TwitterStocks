 Philly Teamsters   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2000  At his hearing, Mr. Morris dismissed the 1998 Clinton-demonstration melee that involved his members beating up teacher Don Adams, by saying he was a right-to-work supporter who had insulted President Clinton at a rally. As for the shotguns, stun guns, combat fatigues and vehicles found on union property and paid for with $700,000 in union funds, Mr. Morris claimed the combat fatigues were for warmth on cold picket lines and the stun guns were to defend his men during strikes. He accused the Hoffa regime of retaliating against him for backing disgraced Teamster head Ron Carey. Edward Keyser, the trustee now running Local 115, responded that Mr. Morris was "running a cult, not a damn union." All this was the basis for the November raid on his office by the national Teamsters office under its new president, James P. Hoffa.
