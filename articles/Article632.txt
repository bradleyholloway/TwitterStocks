 Crain Brothers Take on Tough Turf With Their New York Business Weekly   By By John Koten and Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1985  Although his picture occasionally graces the front pages of magazines he edits, Rance Crain has never quite attained celebrity status.  Yet if putting out such magazines as Advertising Age, Electronic Media and Laundry Digest hasn't brought Mr. Crain fame, it has brought him fortune. Together with his Detroit-based brother, Keith, he has been building one of the fastest-growing companies in publishing.  The Crains also are facing tougher competition with their flagship publication, Advertising Age. Responding to an increasingly feisty Adweek, a six-year-old journal operated by former New York magazine publisher Clay Felker, the Crains last year switched the frequency of Advertising Age to twice a week from weekly. The change, however, has been slow to win reader acceptance and hasn't dented Adweek's paid circulation of 41,000. Advertising Age has twice had to reformulate the edition it now distributes on Thursday; its latest effort as a creative, feature-oriented magazine represents an almost complete reversal of the original concept, which was to offer its readers twice as much news.
