 Business Technology: Google and Salesforce.com Team vs. Microsoft   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2007  An initial joint service will allow Salesforce.com customers to place advertisements alongside Google search results using Salesforce.com's Web site. In other words, Salesforce.com will resell Google AdWords, acting as a distribution channel for that popular service. Salesforce.com's revenue will come from selling the new service; the firm will also receive a cut of Google's revenue from ads placed through its service, but a spokesman described that amount as "negligible" and "not material."
