 Firms Outsource Computer Projects At Increasing Pace   By McWilliams, Gary, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2004  Peter A. Allen, TPI's managing director of global practices, said if the current quarter's forecast of $7 billion in such deals is achieved, it should exceed the $80 billion in big outsourcing contracts approved in 2003. "It looks like it will be quite a strong year for these megadeal outsourcing contracts," he said.  Winners in these big contract awards tend to be the biggest outsourcing firms. "When we look at who is getting the lion's share of BPO deals, it is IBM [Corp.] and Accenture [Ltd.]. Everyone else is a distant second," said Mr. Allen.  "Our interactions with clients say they are ambivalent to the election process," said Mr. Allen. "Boardrooms care about productivity; if it comes on the back of outsourcing, that's an appropriate tool."
