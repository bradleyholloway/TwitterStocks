 Stressed Out: Can Workplace Stress Get Worse? --- At Verizon Call Centers, Stress Is Seldom on Hold --- No Matter How Irate the Caller, Reps Also Must Make Pitch, Often Under Observation   By By Kris Maher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2001  "We are very aware that it can be a challenging job," acknowledges Ellen M. Corcoran, Verizon's vice president of consumer sales, who oversees the company's roughly 15,000 representatives. Verizon was formed by last year's merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp.  One outcome of the 18-day strike by the Communications Workers of America against Verizon last August was a new contract that promises less forced overtime and more flexibility. But for the representatives who work in Verizon's call centers, some of the stresses never reached the bargaining table, including rigorous requirements for every call and more focus on selling new products rather than just answering complaints and offering service.  Verizon reps say the contract that came out of the strike in August should provide some relief from the pressures they face. A representative's overall performance rating can no longer be tied to sales performance. Beginning March 1, reps will be guaranteed 15 minutes off the phone each day, and another 15 minutes starting July 1, so they can complete paperwork at their desks. Verizon also has boosted its training program and now offers flex time. In addition, under the new contract, reps can only be required to work 7.5 hours of overtime per week, and since Jan. 1, managers have been required to give prior notice of an observation on the day it is to occur.
