 Orthopedic Firms Discount Talk Of Consolidation   By Kamp, Jon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2006  Mr. [Daniel Hann]'s comments were interesting considering the company's April announcement that it had hired Morgan Stanley to help explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. That closely followed the surprise retirement of Dane Miller, Biomet's co-founder and chief executive, and stoked much of the merger and acquisition chatter.  Smith & Nephew's Mr. O'[Donnell] said being a smaller-scale company doesn't pose a concern or disadvantage. "We don't think that size is a barrier or a threat in that way," he said.  Zimmer's Mr. [Raymond Elliott] suggested "outsiders might come into the industry" to make acquisitions. When Biomet announced the Morgan Stanley hiring, analysts said medical device giant Medtronic Inc. -- with a market cap topping $61 billion -- was another potential Biomet suitor.
