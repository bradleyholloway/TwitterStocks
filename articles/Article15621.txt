 U.S. Vehicle Sales Fell 1.6% in October But Annual Rate Is Still About the Same   By By Angelo B. Henderson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1997  Despite the soft spots, industry experts said vehicle sales last month continued at about the annual rate they have been running, reflecting continued high consumer confidence and the healthy economy. October sales were equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.7 million vehicles, down slightly from the recent sales pace of about 15 million vehicles a year.  The U.S. Big Three auto makers led the industry's sales decline. No. 1 General Motors Corp. posted a 4% decline to 383,489 cars and light trucks; No. 2 Ford Motor Co., a 2.1% decline to 327,472 vehicles; and No. 3 Chrysler Corp., which reported sales Monday, an 8% decline to 188,263 vehicles. Among leading foreign auto makers, Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales rose 2.9%; Nissan Motor Corp.'s sales gained 4%; and sales of Honda Motor Co., which reported results Monday, jumped 11%.  For example, even though its total car sales were weak, GM said sales of its new midsize models rose 21% in October. This included robust increases in sales of the Buick Century and Regal, Chevrolet Malibu, Oldsmobile Intrigue and Cutlass, and Pontiac Grand Prix, according to Donald R. DeVeaux, GM's director of North American market analysis. Meanwhile, GM's sales of small cars continued to suffer in the face of stiff competition; the subcompact Cavalier, which was a hot seller a year ago, posted an 18% sales decline this October, despite rebates, Mr. DeVeaux said.
