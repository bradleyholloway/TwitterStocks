 Global Dogfight: World's Major Airlines Scramble to Get Ready For Competitive Battle --- American and United, Aided By Hubs Such as Chicago, Seem the Best-Positioned --- The Bane of Political Control   By By Asra Q. Nomani, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1992  However, mergers or other maneuvers -- such as the possible British Airways/KLM/Northwest consortium -- could quickly change the race. In addition to American and United, more than 20 other major international airlines are at the starting gate. They range from European giants such as British Airways, Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France to Asian lines such as Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Singapore Airlines.  A British Airways booklet, "Manifesto for Civil Aviation in the 1990s," depicts the tail of a British Air plane, dwarfed next to gigantic tails of American, United and Delta jets. The point: All three have a fleet more than twice the size of British Air's current 235 planes. American has the largest, at 622 -- more than British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa combined.
