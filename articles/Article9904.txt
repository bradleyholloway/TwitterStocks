 Dangerous Decision: In South Africa, Poor AIDS Patients Adopt Risky Ploy; To Get Disability Payments, Some Skip Medications, Putting Lives in Peril; Aiming to Be 'Very, Very Sick'   By Phillips, Michael M, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2006  [Zolile] hasn't told her mother that she has AIDS. She's worried the news would kill the older woman, and that, she says bluntly, the family would lose its only source of income. "What job can I get without a high school diploma?" she asks. "All I can do is wipe off tables at a restaurant."  So Zolile says she stopped taking her AIDS drugs with the intention of forcing her CD4 count below 50, a point at which she's sure the doctor will approve her disability certification. "The doctor will realize very quickly and write a grant for me when I'm very, very sick," she says. "I'll take my kids with me and he'll see."  AIDS counselors in Durban say they are frequently asked by patients with high CD4 counts to identify patients with lower immunity so they can game the system at South Africa's overcrowded and overworked hospitals. In the usual scam, counselors say, a person whose CD4 count is above the hospital's threshold will pay about $80 to $160 to hire someone with a dangerously low CD4 count to take the blood test for them, using the healthier patient's ID card. The healthier AIDS patient will then turn up to get the results, pretend to be dismayed and ask to be certified for a disability grant, according to the Durban counselors.
