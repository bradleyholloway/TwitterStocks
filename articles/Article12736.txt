 A Piano Man Turns From Pop to Classical   By By Greg Sandow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2001  BILLY JOEL has been writing classical music. He writes it like a fan, which is hardly a surprise, since he's not a classical-music sophisticate. He took classical piano lessons when he was a kid and then got turned on again eight years ago or so, when he listened to Beethoven. "I let these symphonies pound over me," he says. "Last time I felt like this was the first time I listened to Led Zeppelin. I felt puny. I am nothing, I am insignificant."  This year he released a CD of classical piano pieces called "Fantasies and Delusions" (a joint product of Sony Classical and Columbia, one of Sony's pop labels, for which Mr. Joel has recorded since the start of his pop career). It sounds like the romantic music Mr. Joel has listened to -- like Chopin, most of all, but also like Schubert, Rachmaninoff and sometimes Debussy. When I first heard it, I unkindly thought that Mr. Joel was just an imitator. He wants to write classical music exactly like the classical music he loves.  The melodies are genuinely beautiful. They might not stick as quickly in my mind as Mr. Joel's best pop tunes, perhaps because he hasn't yet found a classical voice that's entirely his own. As a pop songwriter, performer and personality, Mr. Joel can get in your face; as a classical composer, he's retiring. When I worried that he sounded more like Chopin than he should, I compared him with real Chopin, and got a shock. Next to other classical composers, Chopin seems yielding and romantic; back to back with Mr. Joel, he's muscular. Mr. Joel only emulates the sound of Chopin. In its heart, his music is his own.
