 U.S. Considers Giving $200 Million to AIDS Fund   By By Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  The likely pledge, which the White House says isn't yet a done deal, falls short of what United Nations officials had hoped the U.S. would contribute. The U.N. envisions a sweeping developing-world health campaign costing $7 billion to $10 billion a year. But the U.N. remains hopeful that in the coming years the U.S. donation will grow as the fund establishes a track record of promoting prevention and treatment of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.  So far, no government has publicly pledged a contribution. But the idea of a fund to fight AIDS and other diseases has rapidly gained momentum, making it awkward for the U.S. to remain silent much longer. "There has got to be significant new money," said Mark Malloch Brown, head of the U.N. Development Program.  "There is definitely a sea change emerging among businesses in the U.S. in responding to AIDS," said Georgia Franklin, head of public affairs for MTV Networks International, a unit of Viacom Inc. Her company leads the Global Business Council on HIV/AIDS, which is coordinating the private-sector response to Mr. [Kofi Annan]'s rallying cry.
