 Microsoft Corp. To Buy Pioneer Of `Agent' Software   By By Nick Wingfield The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1998  Microsoft Corp. agreed to buy closely held Firefly Network Inc., in a move that could accelerate adoption of a technology for privately exchanging personal information over the Internet. The company didn't disclose terms.  Firefly, formerly called Agents Inc., is a pioneer in one of the most-hyped technologies of recent years -- so-called "agent" software that searches the World Wide Web for goods and services based on computer users' interests, making the results more personalized. Its founders, former classmates from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, and an undetermined number of its 70 employees are expected to move to Redmond, Wash., where Microsoft is based, to join that software giant's interactive media group, which includes the Microsoft Network online service.
