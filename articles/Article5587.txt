 A Nuclear Fleet Sinks Into a Money Pit --- Even Technologically Adept Japan Has Its Share of Flops   By By David P. Hamilton, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1994  SEKINEHAMA, Japan -- At this remote port at the northern tip of Japan's main island, construction workers are getting ready to bury one of the nation's most expensive industrial-policy failures.  That project is the nuclear ship Mutsu, which Japan once envisioned as the flagship for a proposed fleet of nuclear-powered merchant vessels. The Mutsu, however, has sailed under nuclear power successfully only four times in 25 years -- and has absorbed more than $300 million along the way. Having decided to throw in the towel, the Japanese government now plans to bury the ship's reactor here in Sekinehama and recommission the Mutsu as a nonnuclear ocean-research vessel.  Consider Japan's massive, long-term investment in HDTV. Thirty years ago, when television pictures were frequently blurry and cloudy, the idea of a new TV format that would produce breathtakingly sharp images had considerable appeal. Even as Japanese companies and the quasipublic Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) labored on HDTV, however, conventional TV broadcasting made huge strides, narrowing the difference to a point where some people have trouble distinguishing the two. As a result, Japanese electronics firms have managed to sell only about 20,000 of the expensive HDTV sets in almost three years.
