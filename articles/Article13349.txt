 Bloodied Investor Icahn Returns to Flying Solo   By Susan Pulliam and Jennifer S. Forsyth, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2006  This week Mr. [Carl Icahn]'s partners pulled out of a $4.6 billion bid for Reckson Associates Realty Corp., a real-estate investment trust. Mr. Icahn initially pressed ahead with the Reckson bid on his own. Late Monday night, the Reckson board rejected Mr. Icahn's offer in favor of a merger with SL Green Realty Corp., a rival real-estate trust. Yesterday, Mr. Icahn said he would back out.  Mr. Icahn's bid, by contrast, may have been too high, some analysts say. After due diligence, [Mack-Cali] found the offer wasn't "in the best interests of its shareholders." Mr. [Harry Macklowe] backed away partly because he couldn't secure the amount of bank financing at the terms he desired, according to a person familiar with the matter. When Mr. Macklowe informed Mr. Icahn that he wasn't prepared to pay $49 per share, Mr. Icahn stayed firm, prompting the partnership's termination. Mr. Macklowe didn't return calls for comment.  In a twist, Mr. Icahn is trying to buy shares in companies a step ahead of private-equity players, who profit by buying and selling companies. "It's no secret which companies are set up well for leverage buyouts," he said. Mr. Icahn says investment bankers call him and say: "This is a good one" for (a private-equity firm) -- "why don't you look at it?"
