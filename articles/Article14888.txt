 Schneider Says First-Half Net Decreased 28% ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1991  Schneider S.A., a French industrial group, said consolidated net income fell 28% in the first half to 302 million francs ($53.2 million) from 418 million francs a year earlier.  Schneider said its earnings were affected by changes in the group's structure, including its acquisition of controlling interests in Federal Pioneer Ltd. and Square D Co. of the U.S.  The decline chiefly reflected a steep drop in non-recurring items which made a negative contribution of 77 million francs to group earnings in the first six months of 1991, compared with a net gain of 166 million francs a year before.
