 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review --- What's Your Fund Doing? Some Managers Don't Say --- Many Reports to Investors Leave Out Discussions About What's Behind Performance   By By Tom Lauricella and Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2002  He first went to the Brazos fund family's most recent shareholder report for an explanation of the fund's performance. But all Mr. [Geoffrey Foisie] found in the semiannual report dated May 30 was a letter from one of the fund's managers discussing general topics such as investor disillusionment, bemoaning terrorism and ruminating on what foreign investors have been up to lately. Not a word was spent discussing what had happened to Brazos Micro Cap Fund or any of the firm's other funds.  Mr. Foisie checked further back to the Brazos annual report dated Nov. 30. The Micro Cap Fund, one of five with the Brazos name, was mentioned only in a single sentence of the manager's report to shareholders.  In the Brazos annual report, what caught the eye of Mr. Foisie, the adviser, was that the management discussion made passing reference to the performance of each of the Brazos funds, but only in general terms. For example, the report, released in late 2001, noted that small stocks had better returns than large stocks during the preceding 12 months. "This outperformance by the smallest stocks partially explains the excellent results for the Brazos Micro Cap Portfolio in 2001," it said without providing any other information on the fund.
