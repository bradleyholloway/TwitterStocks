CHICAGO, July 13â€” The Bally Manufacturing Corporation, a leading maker of coin-operated amusement and gaming machines, has been enjoined by a Federal court in Nevada from manufacturing, selling or leasing a video poker machine. District Judge William Foreman granted the temporary restraining order in favor of International Game Technology, which already makes such a game, in connection with litigation over competition between the two companies. Bally is planning to appeal the ruling.
