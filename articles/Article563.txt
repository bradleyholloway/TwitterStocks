 Big Board Weighs Link With Pacific Stock Exchange   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1985  The New York Stock Exchange is holding "serious discussions" with the Pacific Stock Exchange on potential joint ventures that could lead to the merger of the exchanges, a Big Board spokesman said.  The Pacific Stock Exchange, with trading floors in Los Angeles and San Francisco, remains open until 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, a half-hour longer than the Big Board; trading in many Big Board-listed stocks often continues on the Pacific exchange after the close of trading in New York, especially in the event of a news announcement affecting Big Board-listed companies.
