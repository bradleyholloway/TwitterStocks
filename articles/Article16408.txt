 Financing Goes Just-in-Time; Instant Online Settlements Grease the Global Supply Chain   By Kahn, Gabriel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2004  Previously, every time Hi-Tec issued a purchase order to one of its suppliers in China, it had to open a letter of credit with its bank, a process that required presenting a stack of documents. The bank would then courier the letter of credit to the manufacturer's bank, a journey that could often take a week. The Chinese bank would then review the documents and inform the factory it could receive payment as soon as it shipped the order. The entire transaction could take as much as two weeks, during which time Hi-Tec's money had left its accounts but hadn't yet paid for the goods.  Paper Weight  In a world of just-in-time inventories, common systems for paying suppliers remain slow and complex.  -- Cost of processing trade documentation is more than 5% of the total annual value of world trade.  -- Cost of processing a simple transaction is about $400.  -- Up to 24 forms must be completed for each transaction.  -- Half of all letter-of-credit transactions are rejected by banks because of incorrect information from the buyer or seller.
