 Home Builders Brace for a 'Simmering Down' of Sales as Few Fear a Serious Decline   By Carlton, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  David Seiders of the National Association of Home Builders predicted housing starts would fall by between 6% and 7% from last year's torrid pace of about 2.1 million units -- amid high home prices and rising mortgage rates. Although Mr. Seiders, the association's chief economist, characterized the projected drop as only a "simmering down" of the white-hot housing market, his forecast included what he called the remote possibility of "sizable house-price declines" if the investors and short-term-interest borrowers who have helped fuel the boom start rushing for the exits. "The real question," he told the audience, "is where do we go from here."  It is a different story on the cost side. Labor costs are rising amid falling unemployment. Labor, along with land acquisition, accounts for the biggest cost of building a home. Amid a scarcity of labor in some fast-growing markets like Florida, construction workers' pay and benefits in September were up 3.5% from a year earlier, compared with an average of 3.1% for all workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Construction workers are likely to remain in heavy demand this year, with many dividing their energy between building subdivisions and helping to clear rubble in the Hurricane Katrina zone. "The labor shortages are serious, but they are less serious for the big builders," says Jerry Starkey, president and chief executive of WCI.  Despite the challenges, most builders remain upbeat. "The mood is generally optimistic," says Samuel Cypert, executive director of the Public Home Builders Council of America. "But they tend to be optimistic anyway."
