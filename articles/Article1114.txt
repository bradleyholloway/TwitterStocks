 If This Catches On, It Won't Pay To Hurry Through Law School   By By Amy Dockser, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1988  In a decision published in October, the court wrote that despite Mr. Parkins's reputation and experience as a bankruptcy attorney, a man his age shouldn't be charging $250 an hour. The judge compared the two lawyers' fees with those of Arthur L. Moller, a 75-year-old lawyer at the firm and former bankruptcy judge who also had asked $250 an hour. "If {Mr. Parkins} is entitled to the rates requested," wrote the judge, "we can scarcely comprehend the level of compensation of a . . . lawyer {with 30 years' experience} or a former judge." The judge set rates of $190 an hour for Mr. Parkins and $150 an hour for Mr. Dawson.
