 Sweden Sweeps Into EU Presidency With a Cause   By By Matthew Kaminski, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2001  As EU president, Sweden has limited powers and a big bureaucratic burden. Stockholm must arrange and set the agendas for some 1,700 EU meetings at all levels. The president is meant to be an impartial broker among the EU members; it is considered impolitic to force decisions on others. On enlargement in particular, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, negotiates on behalf of the member states.  Yet Sweden's stewardship of the EU comes as a relief to many countries further east. Popular opinion in Sweden, which is among the three EU countries that don't use the euro common currency, looks askance at deeper integration among the members. By contrast, Swedes support "broadening" the union, regularly scoring the highest in support for enlargement in Euro-barometer polls. It's one of the few EU issues Stockholm can champion without alienating its own electorate.  "The presidency can play quite an important role in pushing negotiations faster or allowing them to drag," says Boris Cizelj, the former Slovenian ambassador to the EU, who lobbies for Slovenian businesses at EU headquarters in Brussels. The three Baltic neighbors Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, swallowed by Stalin's Soviet Union 60 years ago, are especially upbeat. "Sweden is a regional champion for Baltic integration," says Vygaudas Usackas, Lithuania's chief negotiator.
