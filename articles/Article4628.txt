 Bond Yields Drop to Eight-Year Lows As Powerful Rally, Euphoria Continue   By By Tom Herman and Edward P. Foldessy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1986  The yield on actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds closed yesterday at 7.90%, the lowest level since December 1977. Only about a month ago, the yield was 9.29%. Prices of many long-term Treasury bonds surged about 1 1/4 points, or around $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount.  The economy's apparent lethargy is likely to prompt the Federal Reserve System to push interest rates lower, according to many economists. Some economists predict the Fed will cut its discount rate another notch before midyear in an attempt to rejuvenate the economy. Friday, the Fed reduced the discount rate, which is the fee it charges on loans to financial institutions, to 7% from 7 1/2%.  Government economic statistics to be released over the next few days are likely to "add fuel to the bullish sentiment," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Figures on retail sales, industrial production and producer prices will show the economy is "weaker than generally expected," she said. She expects the Fed to lower its discount rate again within another few months.
