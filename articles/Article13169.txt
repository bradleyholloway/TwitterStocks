 IPO Outlook: IPOs Are Absent From Top 10 List Of Stock Issues; No Big Global Sales Come From Newly Public Firms, As Follow-On Deals Reign   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2005  U.S. investors gave a tepid reception to two IPOs last week: Greek shipper Aries Maritime Transport Ltd. and California biopharmaceutical firm XenoPort Inc. Both priced below their original range of $14 to $16 a share -- Aries at $12.50, and XenoPort at $10.50. Aries ended its first day of trading Friday at $12.97, up 3%, while XenoPort ended its first day, Thursday, at $10.39, down 1%.  Outside the U.S., investment bankers aren't certain anything specific is holding back the flow of megasize IPOs. Although average deal sizes for IPOs world-wide are lower than in 2004, the decline has been even steeper for follow-on stock offerings, according to Dealogic. In addition, some of the largest global IPOs -- from Russia's Sistema, U.S.-based Huntsman Corp. and Germany's Premiere AG -- had good debuts, closing up from their offer prices on the first day of trading.
