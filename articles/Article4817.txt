 Jesse Jackson Enters Presidential Race Vowing an End to 'Economic Violence'   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1987  RALEIGH, N.C. -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who came of age in a time of racial violence, declared that he is running for president to end "economic violence," done by multinational corporations, "merger maniacs" and big defense budgets.  In a long and emotional rally here in the heart of his Southern base, Mr. Jackson seemed to try to dispel any notion that he is a fringe or protest candidate, as many considered him during his first run for the office in 1984. He delivered a message rich in mainstream themes such as patriotism and service to country, and ringing with a basic Democratic call for economic populism.  Indeed, Mr. Jackson enters the race as the best known of the Democratic candidates and, in many national polls, the leader of his party's field. To tumultuous cheers from supporters, Mr. Jackson departed from his prepared remarks and attacked the assertion that he leads only because he has more name recognition than candidates who haven't been prominent on the national scene as long.
