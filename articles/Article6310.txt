 Why University Gave Its Nod To Rail Plan   By By Brooks Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2000  University of Washington officials say they softened their long-held, hard-line stance against the construction of a light-rail station on university property last week in order to give Sound Transit a chance to secure crucial federal aid for the Link system.  The university's position is that the transit authority can't possibly fulfill its pledge to UW -- that the station at the corner of Northeast 45th Street and 15th Avenue Northeast won't make traffic and parking problems in the neighborhood any worse than they already are -- unless the line ends somewhere else: Namely, the Northgate Transit Center some three miles away, where there are park-and-ride lots for the hundreds of Metro buses that pick up and drop off commuters every day. The school's regents had until recently been committed to refusing to allow the 45th Street station until a Northgate station was a sure thing.  Though Sound Transit officials don't agree with the university's assessment of the traffic impact, they are just as eager to see Link trek all the way to Northgate. The problem: Northgate wasn't included in the first-phase plan submitted last week to the FTA because the cost has long been considered prohibitive. And Sound Transit hasn't come close to figuring out how to fund the extension's estimated $450 million price tag.
