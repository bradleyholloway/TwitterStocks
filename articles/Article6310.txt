 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 2004  HERE ARE SOME things the narrator of Plum [Plum Sykes]'s giddy, tiresome first novel gamely goes without: blond hair, any visible means of support for her high-fashion habit and a first name (she refers to herself simply as "moi"). In fact, this doughty young woman, looking for love, great skin and the perfect outfit in the mean streets of Manhattan, Paris and Cannes is a brunette blend of Cher in "Clueless," Elle in "Legally Blonde" and Anita Loos's gold-digging, husband- hunting Lorelei Lee, in this case Lore-lite.  The British-born Sykes, a contributing writer at Vogue, is an able chronicler of a certain upscale milieu. She knows about the 400- thread-count pistachio-colored sheets on the beds at the Mercer Hotel, the fluffy peach bathrobes at the Ritz in Paris, the French fries cooked in truffle oil at the chic New York restaurant JoJo. But as a satirist, she is so last year. Given how high "Sex and the City" set the bar, a character in "Bergdorf Blondes" mistaking a dermatologist for a psychotherapist is far short of Swiftian. It's not that Ms. Sykes lacks for material. The thin, rich, idle and style-obsessed are always grand targets. Regrettably, there isn't enough poison in "Bergdorf Blondes" to fill a Botox needle.  The delights of "Poplorica" are in the details. In these pages we discover, for example, that [Joe Pyne], "The First Angry Mike Man" and a disabled World War II vet, led off an interview of rocker Frank Zappa with "I guess your long hair makes you a woman." Zappa shot back: "I guess your wooden leg makes you a table."
