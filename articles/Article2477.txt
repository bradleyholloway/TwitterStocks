 Lands' End Loss Surprises Wall Street; Saks, Gap, Kmart Report Better Results   By By Robert Berner, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  Lands' End of Dodgeville, Wis., reported a loss of $61,000, or less than a penny a diluted share, well below the profit of 13 cents a share that had been anticipated by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. and off sharply from the year-earlier quarter's net income of $3.4 million, or 11 cents a share.  Because it sold fewer items per catalog page, Lands' End's selling, general and administrative expenses shot up 19% in the quarter ended July 31 from year-earlier levels, cutting into earnings. The company also ended the quarter with inventories that were 47% higher than a year earlier, which suggests that the third quarter's results may be hurt by markdowns of excess merchandise.  For the three months ended Aug. 1, the New York luxury retailer posted a loss of $11.1 million, or 17 cents a diluted share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $14.2 million, or 22 cents a share. The latest quarter included a charge of $3.8 million, or six cents a diluted share, relating to a litigation settlement; excluding the charge, the results were in line with analysts' estimates.
