 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Review & Outlook: Yanqui Doodle Dandy   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2004  It's hard to know who is being the bigger baby here: John Henry or George Steinbrenner. In an e-mail sent to reporters about the deal that puts Alex Rodriguez in pinstripes, the Red Sox owner whined that "baseball doesn't have an answer for the Yankees." Mr. Steinbrenner fired back that this was just "sour grapes" because the Sox had failed to broker a deal for A-Rod back in December.  Mr. Henry is right that the lucrative New York market underwrites a Yankee payroll (somewhere in the $190 million ballpark) that helps guarantee its dominance on the diamond. But Mr. Steinbrenner rightly finds complaints about the lack of a salary cap hard to take from a fellow owner whose Sox payroll (somewhere in the $130 million range) is second only to his own. It's a pity that Yankee lovers and Yankee haters alike can't see past A-Rod to one of the looming opportunity costs represented by the fate of the Expos.
