 Oil Is Farther From $100; Broader Pressures Relax World-Wide; A Return to $90?   By Meyer, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  The fall startled traders, who last week had come close to pushing the benchmark oil contract to $100 a barrel. Yesterday oil futures traded as low as $90.13 a barrel, down 9% from the record intraday high of $98.62 reached last Wednesday. The slide in oil prices came in spite of a weaker dollar, which can lend support to crude futures. "Last week the question was whether we can touch $100," said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA in New York. "This week it's, 'Can we touch $90?' What a difference a week makes."  Also burdening futures prices were comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, that the kingdom didn't foresee a recession in the U.S. and that the world economy remained resilient. Mr. Naimi added that he was skeptical about claims of worsening tightness in the world's oil markets given that oil stockpiles are trending around their five-year-average levels. "I believe the latest inventory numbers . . . are in the middle of the five-year average," he said. "I don't see the tightness that pessimists are talking about."
