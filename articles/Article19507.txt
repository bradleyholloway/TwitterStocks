 Letters to the Editor: Has the Church Been Cynical?   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2002  Mr. [Philip Jenkins] is correct in stating that the church's problem is not celibacy nor is it simply isolated cases of pedophilia. If celibacy were the issue, adult women would be the victims and rape the charge. He laments that the church is stuck between a hard place and Peter's Rock in its efforts to attract and retain qualified priests, especially in North America, and throws out the sad fact (but red herring nonetheless) that other denominations also struggle with abusers within their ministerial ranks. I see the problem as the contempt the official church, starting with its bishops and ending with the pope, has for its parishioners' physical and spiritual well-being and their money. Since we are all sinners, it can be expected that priests will sin. It is also true that just as God forgives sinners, humans are commanded to do likewise. What a Catholic should not expect is for their leadership to repeatedly and cynically foist known abusers upon their children or even their older teenager or adult homosexual sons and then, to add insult to the grievous injury, to pay for either silence or settlement with church money that has but one source -- the parishioner victims themselves. For while individuals are brutally victimized by the abuser, it is all of Catholicism that is victimized by its leaders.
