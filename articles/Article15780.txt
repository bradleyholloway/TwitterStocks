 Home Office: Where Printers Aren't Peripheral --- Away From the Workplace, A Printer Guru Struggles `Just Like Everyone Else'   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1999  That is the number of machines that have made an appearance over the years at the home office of Mr. Perez, vice president and general manager for Hewlett-Packard Co.'s multibillion-dollar Inkjet Products Group. Mr. Perez, 53 years old, is one of H-P's product testers and tire kickers of last resort for his company's printers before they get shipped out to the marketplace.  Except that in Mr. Perez's case, he can call up teams of H-P engineers and dictate instructions for last-minute design changes. He says he has done just that on several occasions, after printers in his home office malfunctioned or otherwise proved disappointing. In some cases, he says, it was simply a matter of demanding easier-to-use setup software; in other cases, he has canceled proposed models outright for being too slow or too hard to use or too noisy.  Right now, there are three machines -- one high-end, one low-end, the third a specialized printer designed for color photography -- in the Perez home office, located in the family's modern Spanish-rancho-style house in the eucalyptus-covered hills above Mission Viejo, Calif., due north of San Diego. (H-P is based in Palo Alto, but the ink-jet-printer division is based in San Diego.)
