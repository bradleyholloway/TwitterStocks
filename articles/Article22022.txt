 Form plus function: Designers do Mother Nature one better, for profit   By Pierson, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1995  The trend in which lifelike reproductions of nature--trees, shrubs and flowers, as well as rocks, streams, wild animals, even men and women--are increasingly seen adorning casinos, hotels, theme parks, office buildings, shopping centers, clinics, restaurants, golf courses and private homes is discussed. California Country Trees makes real-looking arboreal plants, and some 200 of J. Seward Johnson Jr's life-size figures of men and women can be found in parks and other places.
