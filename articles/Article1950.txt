 Saatchi Shareholders Seek to Cut Chairman's Compensation, Duties   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1994  Saatchi & Saatchi PLC's board is expected to meet in London later this week to consider proposals from angry shareholders that could greatly reduce the compensation of Chairman Maurice Saatchi, compel him to step down from the board and even remove the family name from the British-based advertising-agency holding company.  This is the latest squabble about senior management at Saatchi & Saatchi. Earlier this year, under pressure from shareholders, a plan was devised to cut Mr. Saatchi's salary to #200,000 from #625,000. Shareholders, unhappy with Saatchi & Saatchi's financial performance, bristled at the lavish compensation of the parent company's top executive. The options package is based on Mr. Saatchi's former, higher salary.  Mr. Saatchi has a high-profile, opulent lifestyle that rankles some Saatchi shareholders. Mr. Saatchi and his wife, Josephine Hart, the author of "Damage" and "Sin," are profiled in the January issue of Architectural Digest magazine. The 11-page spread shows the couple's 152-year-old home, Old Hall, in Sussex. To furnish the estate, the article says, Mr. Saatchi "ransacked the auction houses of England, France and Italy." Mr. Saatchi also "flooded" 13 acres of pasture to make a lake with three islands, a swimming jetty and a boathouse.
