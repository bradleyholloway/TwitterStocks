 My Wife, Nurturing America's Future   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2007  My wife, Kathy Francica, graduated from college as a Phi Beta Kappa and chose to work among the ranks of raising children full time. The bottom-line result was to encourage and foster the young men who are our sons. Two of those men were National Merit Scholar Finalists and the third scored above 1500 in his SATs.
