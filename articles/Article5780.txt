 Deals & Deal Makers: Thomas H. Lee Leads Investment Of $50 Million in Wine Web Site   By By Paul M. Sherer, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1999  Buyout firm Thomas H. Lee Co. is making its first Internet splash, leading a $50 million venture investment in online wine retailer wine.com.  The investment, through a venture with Putnam Investments, Boston, is part of a rush into the new economy by old-line buyout shops, including recent investments by Forstmann Little & Co. and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Since the heyday of the leveraged buyout in the 1980s, the firms have focused on taking over industrial, service and consumer businesses that generate steady cash flows. Now they are taking minority venture-capital stakes in Internet firms with cash flows that go one way: out the door.
