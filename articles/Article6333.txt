 Online Investing (A Special Report) --- The People: The Moderator --- Bob Zumbrunnen makes sure online chat stays on topic and helpful; Sometimes, he has to play rough   By By Erin Schulte, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2000  Besides responding to e-mail complaints, Mr. [Bob Zumbrunnen] also will bookmark threads where there has been a lot of squabbling and where members frequently get off a thread's topic. After talk got ugly on the thread devoted to e.Digital, a San Diego, Calif., maker of electronic media storage devices that, among other things, can download audio files from the Internet, Mr. Zumbrunnen posted this: "The fighting has reached a point where it barely involves [e.Digital]. Please bury all of the hatchets and get back on-topic right now."  When a stock-options thread got embroiled in an argument on whether "PMs," private e-mail messages, could be publicly posted, Mr. Zumbrunnen stepped in to remind the participants of their manners. Though posting PMs isn't a violation of the rules, Mr. Zumbrunnen suggested that members refrain from doing it. "I feel it's one of the worst possible breaches of netiquette to disclose the contents of private communications," he wrote in a posting on the thread. Calm returned to the thread, and Mr. Zumbrunnen no longer has it bookmarked.  None of the threats have been directed at Mr. Zumbrunnen, though investors who take risks they can't afford have been known to get hotheaded, especially if they're banned from a site for which they've paid. That's part of the reason Mr. Zumbrunnen won't say exactly where he lives.
