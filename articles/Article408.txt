It is the largest increase since 1998, according to the study, which was based on data from more than 450 qualified respondents. There now are 7.5 million millionaire households in the U.S., breaking the record set in 1999 of 7.1 million. The study excluded the value of primary residences, but included second homes and other real estate.  A separate study, also released yesterday, by Boston Consulting Group found that the U.S. continues to lead the world in creating new millionaires. The number of households in the U.S. with liquid assets of $20 million or more is increasing by 3,000 households a year.  Europe also showed growth in affluent households and millionaires, according to the Boston Consulting Group study. Europeans with more than the equivalent of $100,000 in investible assets rose 4%. The number of households with more than $20 million in investible assets in Germany rose by 1,000 a year in 2004.
