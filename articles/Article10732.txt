 Dollar Reaches 12-Year High Against Mark --- U.S. Currency Also Sets Record on French Franc, But Swiss Franc Gains   By By Stephen Grover, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1985  The U.S. dollar rose to a 12-year high against the West German mark and a record against the French franc yesterday, but eased slightly against the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.  In late New York trading the dollar stood at 3.2220 marks, up from 3.2155 marks Monday, and climbed to 9.8375 French francs from the previous record of 9.8225 French francs the day before. But the U.S. currency slipped to 2.7355 Swiss francs from 2.7415 Swiss francs on Monday and to 259.50 yen from 259.68 yen the day before.  "It was an unwidening of cross positions," explained Ronald H. Holzer, an assistant vice president and chief dealer of Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago. He said that while dealers were selling marks and buying dollars on Monday, when the U.S. currency toppled several records, they were selling marks and buying Swiss francs and the yen yesterday.
