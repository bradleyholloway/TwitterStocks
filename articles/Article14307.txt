 London Market Probes Trading Of LCP Shares   By By Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1986  The London Stock Exchange launched an investigation into possible insider trading in LCP Holdings PLC prior to a recent hostile bid by Ward White Group PLC, equivalent to $213.3 million.  In an earlier edition of The Wall Street Journal, Philip Birch, Ward White's chairman, said the announcement of his company's bid for LCP was accelerated after LCP's stock suddenly jumped on a single block trade. According to Mr. Birch, an unidentified party, acting after normal London trading hours, bought 25,000 shares of LCP at 8% above the previous trading price, as Mr. Birch was putting the final touches on the company's plans to acquire LCP.
