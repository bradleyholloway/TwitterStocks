 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Who Will Carry Bill Miller's Mantle?; With Streak Near an End, Six Team-Managed Funds Are Poised for Limelight   By Ossinger, Joanna L, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2006  This year, less-than-stellar performances from shares of Internet, managed-care and home-building companies have hurt Mr. [BILL MILLER]'s fund. "No one's happy" that Mr. Miller's streak is likely to end, says Michael Mauboussin, senior vice president and chief investment strategist with Legg Mason, "but at the same time, we remain very focused."  "It's been very disappointing," Mr. [Manu Daftary] says about his fund's trailing performance so late in the year. He says the fund started the year doing well, but "we got concerned about the U.S. economy" while at the same time betting the global economy would be fine. The fund held onto its energy and commodities bets, while raising cash and selling a lot of U.S. shares of companies dependent on consumer spending.  Katinka Domotorffy, a manager of Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy, says her fund's structure as an asset-allocation product -- with about 80% of its money invested in stocks and 20% in bonds -- "by design should always beat an index like the S&P 500 over the long term," but "it's really just a lucky coincidence" that the fund topped the benchmark for seven straight years.
