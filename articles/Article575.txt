The Masonite Corporation, the nation's largest producer of hardboard, announced yesterday that its board had approved a plan of partial liquidation of the company subject to certain conditions and approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Robert N. Rasmus, chairman and chief executive officer of the Chicago-based company, said that, under the plan, 361,00 acres of timberlands in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and California, with certain liabilities, will be distributed to a limited partnership of stockholders that will sell the assets and distribute the proceeds.  Income from Masonite's lumber and woodlands represented almost half of the company's operating income in 1981, Mr. Rasmus said in a telephone interview. Masonite earned $27.1 million, or $2.01 a share, on revenue of $537.6 million in its 1981 fiscal year.  The partial liquidation plan also provides for a 3-for-1 reverse stock split of Masonite's common stock in order to more accurately reflect the value of the company's timber and woodland assets. On Friday Masonite closed at 23 1/4, up 1, on the New York Stock Exchange.  Mr. Rasmus said a proxy statement describing the plan in detail will be sent to stockholders as soon as it has been cleared by the S.E.C.
