 Democracy Remains Distant Goal in Myanmar --- Release of Activist Ends Lengthy Confrontation With Military Rulers   By By Barry Wain, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2002  YANGON, Myanmar -- By freeing democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, the country's military rulers have signaled the end of a lengthy confrontation with their political opponents. But the regime's failure to announce concrete measures for a return to civilian leadership suggests that democracy is still a distant goal.  The regime's official comment, a statement by military spokesman Hla Min, didn't mention Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi or the NLD, or even acknowledge the discussions that have taken place since October 2000. In an interview, Col. Hla Min said Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's release is the start of a process that will ultimately lead to "our common national objective, which is to have multiparty democracy."
