 To Harry Macklowe, Winning Is All --- New York Tycoon Now Is Battling Lenders Over His Empire   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1999  Real-estate types currently are agog at the developer's months-long battle with one of his two big lenders, CS Holding's Credit Suisse First Boston, which he tried to dispossess of a $20 million-plus stake he had earlier granted in three of his buildings on prime sites near the famous Grand Central Station. On top of that, Credit Suisse First Boston had to employ lawyers recently to try and recover a claim on one of the buildings, which somehow wound up in Mr. Macklowe's name, contrary to a court order, a person close to the investment bank says. That's a matter of interpretation, says Steven Simkin, a lawyer for Mr. Macklowe.  The crossing of swords with Credit Suisse First Boston comes as the empire Mr. Macklowe built has taken some hits. After expanding apace during the past two years, he is struggling with steep interest charges on more than half a billion dollars in debt, much of it short term. He has been scrambling to get longer term loans, at a time when lenders have grown cautious about taking on more risks.  Mr. Macklowe insists, "I have no debt I can't handle." But the person close to Credit Suisse First Boston says, "He has had some defaults" -- failures to pay and breaches of loan agreements. Mr. Macklowe's lawyer, Mr. Simkin, explains that Credit Suisse First Boston had been advancing Mr. Macklowe funds to pay the interest on its loans and temporarily stopped doing so, causing the technical default. In the meantime, Credit Suisse First Boston has reached a tentative agreement with Mr. Macklowe, who owes $250 million to the lender and much more to Deutsche Bank Securities.
