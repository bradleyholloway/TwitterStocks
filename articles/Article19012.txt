 Monsanto Wins Verdict Over Mycogen In Crop-Biotechnology Patent Dispute   By By Scott Kilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1998  Monsanto Co. won a closely watched crop-biotechnology patent fight against Mycogen Corp. over a way to make hot-selling insect-resistant plants.  Mycogen said it's considering whether to appeal the verdict, which industry executives widely expect it to do. Dow Chemical Co. of Midland, Mich., owns 63% of Mycogen, which is based in San Diego.  For Monsanto, the verdict means it won't have to pay royalties to Mycogen for selling to farmers its highly profitable seeds for raising insect-resistant crops. Monsanto expects farmers to plant about 10 million acres of its bug-proof plants this year, which would make it the largest supplier in a burgeoning business. Wall Street expects the fledgling crop-biotechnology industry to reap more than $200 million this year in fees for insect-resistant crops.
