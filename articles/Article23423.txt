 Potent Product: Narcotic 'Lollipop' Becomes Big Seller Despite FDA Curbs; Actiq Is Only for Cancer Pain But Cephalon Pitches It To Many Types of Doctors; 'Like the Most Delicious Candy'   By Carreyrou, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2006  Dr. [Stephen Leighton] says he thinks the FDA-approved usage of Actiq is too narrow. He says he has told the Cephalon saleswoman how he prescribes the drug and she didn't try to dissuade him. Mr. [Robert Grupp] of Cephalon says Dr. Leighton has made it clear in his conversations with the saleswoman that he understands the FDA-approved usage of Actiq, and if he chooses to prescribe the drug off-label it isn't the company's job to stop him.  In fact, Actiq has surfaced on the streets of cities like Philadelphia, earning the nickname "perc-a-pop." Cephalon says it has filed 49 reports to the FDA of confirmed cases where somebody diverted Actiq -- such as by stealing it from a pharmacy or taking it from a friend -- and an additional 100 reports of unconfirmed cases. Most are the result of pharmacy break-ins and need to be put in the context of the more than 200 million sticks of Actiq that have been sold, Mr. Grupp says.  Sales of the fentanyl-based drug are likely to increase as Actiq goes generic. In late September, Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. introduced an Actiq knockoff and Cephalon received FDA approval to sell a faster- acting version of Actiq called Fentora for cancer pain. Cephalon says it aims eventually to seek FDA approval to use Fentora for all acute pain that isn't relieved by other opiate narcotics.
