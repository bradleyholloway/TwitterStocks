 Taste: The Fonda Effect --- Harvard gives bad ideas new life. How? By taking a celebrity's money.   By By Christina Hoff Sommers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  When Ms. [Jane Fonda] read Ms. [Carol Gilligan]'s work she found it all to be profoundly true. "It rocked me to the core," she says. Ms. Gilligan persuaded her that our children need to be rescued from the constraints of masculinity and femininity. "The damage done to boys and men a result of these gender strictures is very profound," Ms. Fonda claims.  Harvard, which normally defends academic standards and rules of evidence, has traditionally made an exception when it comes to its Graduate School of Education. Ms. Fonda took advantage of this, shrewdly insisting that the new center have "Harvard" in its name. "When Harvard takes a step, a path is created," she noted. By accepting Ms. Fonda's money, Harvard has put itself in an academically untenable position.  Ms. Fonda "has taken Harvard by storm," said Jerome Murphy, dean of the education school. The center will be "influencing educational practice," said Harvey Feinberg, the excited Harvard provost. Yes it will, and that is why Mr. Murphy, Mr. Feinberg and the other Harvard enthusiasts should have thought twice before conferring institutional respectability on a movement that escalates the gender war in elementary schools and has nothing to do with education.
