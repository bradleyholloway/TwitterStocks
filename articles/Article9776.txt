 Fed Officials Worried in 1999 About Managing Stock 'Bubble'   By Rebello, Joseph, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2005  Transcripts of the Fed's policy meetings, released with the customary five-year lag Friday, also show that even though the Fed's staff forecasters regarded U.S. stock prices as irrationally high, they underestimated the size of the bubble. They concluded that in the event of a stock-market crash, the unemployment rate wouldn't rise much higher than 5% and inflation would climb to about 2.5%. As it turned out, the jobless rate peaked at 6.3% after stock prices crashed and the economy sank into recession in 2001.  Mr. [Alan Greenspan], however, was skeptical about that assessment. "If someone were to say that a bust in stock-market prices would leave us with a 5% unemployment rate and an inflation rate of 2.5%, some might say 'Bring it on!'" he said at a February 1999 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Even so, he said, "were these types of shocks to occur, I suspect the end results would be quite different."
