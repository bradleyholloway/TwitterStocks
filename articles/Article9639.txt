 Workspaces   By Holt, Nancy D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2004  What you see: A Brahman bull executive chair. In a Western-themed office with embossed furnishings and dozens of bronzes, this longtime rancher presides over a temporary-staffing service with some 425 franchises world-wide. The privately held company recorded sales of $1.03 billion in 2003, despite the fact that its chairman and chief executive says he doesn't like sitting behind a desk. Mr. [Robert A. Funk] would rather be outside, so he fills his wide-open workspace with figures of animals, wild and domestic. A buffalo roams across a cabinet. A bronco bucks its rider. Game birds take flight all around. No Remingtons in here; many of the works are pricey, but none are famous. He simply buys sculptures he relates to, like the one of a cowboy sitting at a computer, reading the instructions.
