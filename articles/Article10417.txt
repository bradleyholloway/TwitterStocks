 Arts & Entertainment -- The Pop Scene: Roots, Rock and Reggae   By Fusilli, Jim, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2010  Los Angeles-based Ozomatli is one of the country's great bands, blending just about every kind of music you'd hear in Southern California, ranging from cumbia, funk, merengue and salsa to R&B, pop, hip-hop, ska and reggae. On Saturday, Rich Pagano and the Sugarcane Cups and Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk close out a program that begins at noon; Sunday's headline is singer/songwriter Steve Forbert, who is scheduled to go on at the oddly precise time of 7:24 p.m. The festival is kid-friendly with arts & crafts, face painting, rides and the obligatory ice cream.
