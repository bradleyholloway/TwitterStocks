 Big Brother-in-Law: If the FBI Hopes to Get The Goods on You, It May Ask ChoicePoint --- U.S. Agencies' Growing Use Of Outside Data Suppliers Raises Privacy Concerns --- A Fugitive Rents a Mailbox   By By Glenn R. Simpson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  The FBI's Investigative Information Services unit, which helps agents obtain information on individuals for their investigations, relies heavily on ChoicePoint's services. On the Web, FBI agents also can go to www.cpfbi.com -- "ChoicePoint Online for the FBI" -- for help in conducting their own searches. On that Web page, the company's logo appears alongside the FBI's official seal.  That business has contributed to ChoicePoint's impressive financial performance. Since it became a standalone company four years ago, ChoicePoint's stock price has more than doubled. Yesterday in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its shares rose 65 cents to $35.50, down from its 52-week high of $44.67 in December. Last year, ChoicePoint's business and government division had revenue of $292.4 million, up 24% from 1999, and its operating income more than tripled to $45.3 million. The division now accounts for more than half the company's total revenue.  While they decline to discuss details of their relationship with ChoicePoint, the FBI and other agencies say they aren't doing anything new except retrieving data electronically instead of digging through various far-flung paper files. Before ChoicePoint, "We went all over the place going to the same sources of information as ChoicePoint is going to," says Greg Gagne, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which paid the company $1.5 million last year.
