 Clinton Seeks Major Medicare Expansion --- People Aged 62-64, Workers Laid Off Over Age 55 Could Pay Fees to Join   By By Christopher Georges and Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1998  A key element of the Clinton plan would let uninsured people between 62 and 64 years old buy Medicare coverage for $300 a month. Upon reaching 65, the current Medicare eligibility age, that fee would be ended. But those who had opted for early coverage would be required to pay an additional monthly fee -- between $10 and $50 -- on top of the Medicare premium for as long as they remained in the program.  Besides the plan for covering 62- to 64-year-olds, Mr. Clinton proposed two other significant options for older Americans. One would give workers 55 and older who are laid off the ability to buy Medicare coverage for $400 a month; that would primarily benefit people with medical conditions who may not be able to afford private insurance.
