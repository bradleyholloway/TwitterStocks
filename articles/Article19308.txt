 Disney's Profit, Aided by ABC, Increases 20%   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2000  These days, Disney prefers to focus on results that exclude Go.com, its Internet unit, whose performance is tracked by a separate stock. Excluding Go, Disney's profit was 30 cents a share. Go.com, which is changing its name to Walt Disney Internet Group, reported its results separately on Wednesday.  The strong advertising market, combined with good ratings at the ABC broadcast network, propelled Disney's broadcast unit to big gains. Operating income jumped by 36% to $662 million, with revenue rising by 20%. ABC's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" has been a big part of that story, and Disney President Bob Iger said he has confidence in the show's longevity, despite competiton from shows such as CBS's "Survivor." And Disney's chief financial officer, Tom Staggs, said that for the first nine months of the fiscal year, profit at ABC's radio operations are up 50%.  Disney's consumer-products unit also continues to be a problem. Operating income for the quarter dropped by 48% to $59 million, with Disney blaming a decline in merchandise licensing and an increase in advertising costs. But Disney did note that its problematic Disney Stores unit showed some improvement, with stores in North America showing improved margins although sales were lower at stores open more than a year.
