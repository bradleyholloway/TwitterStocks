 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: His Last Crusade   By Kengor, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 2004  How, exactly, did [Ronald Reagan]'s faith affect his presidency? In many ways, but perhaps most of all in his view of Soviet communism. Reagan was born not long before the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917, and he lived to watch communism's collapse. During his presidency he called for a "crusade" to undermine the Soviet regime. It wasn't just the regime's repressive nature that inspired a sense of mission in him, or its ghastly record of blood and suffering. It was the official atheism of Soviet communism that especially angered Reagan and convinced him that he was dealing with an "evil" adversary.  "There is sin and evil in the world," he told the evangelicals in March 1983, "and we're enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might." He saw his confrontation with communism as a spiritual one. He told a joint session of the Irish National Parliament in June 1984 that the "struggle between freedom and totalitarianism today" was ultimately not a test of arms or missiles "but a test of faith and spirit." It was, he said, a "spiritual struggle." The Soviets did not fail to notice such rhetoric. Their official news agency, Tass, declared: "President Reagan uses religion with particular zeal to back his anti-Soviet policy."
