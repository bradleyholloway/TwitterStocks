 Politics & Economics: Bush Sows South Asia Economy, But Fallow Land May Stunt Peace   By McKinnon, John D, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2006  Ms. [Condoleezza Rice] noted that compared with a few years ago, there isn't only a turnaround in U.S. relations with India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, but "you come here now and there's been a dramatic change in the relationships among the countries," at least in part because of increased U.S. engagement. She and Mr. [Bush] pointed to improved cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan in the hunt for terrorists in tribal regions. Mr. Bush also noted greater cooperation and trade between India and Pakistan, historically bitter rivals whose relations have improved somewhat in recent years, after they nearly went to war in the late 1990s, then confronted a common enemy in terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.  Still, U.S. opposition to the Indian nuclear deal was looming as a potential problem. Yesterday on ABC's "This Week," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said, "I think we really need to look at this one. And I'm inclined to think that . . . this type of thing is not good for us" because of future risk of proliferation problems. He said Mr. Bush was "trying to ride the nuclear tiger here. It's a tough job."
