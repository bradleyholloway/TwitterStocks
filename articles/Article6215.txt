 Art & Money: All That Glitters Isn't Expensive   By By Eileen kinsella, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1999  The recent sharp drop in gold prices may mean very good buys on jewelry this fall and holiday season.  To date, retailers have been reluctant to slash prices, despite gold's steep slide this year. But now that prices are hovering at historic lows -- gold prices slipped to their lowest point in 20 years on the New York Mercantile Exchange last week -- some retailers concede that consumers may see some bargains at the jewelry counter in the months ahead.  Some industry experts say shoppers may see other benefits too, including improved selection and better-quality gold in the jewelry they buy. "It's not an uncommon tactic in retail to change from 14-karat gold to 18-karat gold," to give the consumer more value when metal prices soften, says Michael Exstein, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
