 Convenience Stores Try Cutting Prices And Adding Products to Attract Women   By By Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1987  The 7-Eleven is just three blocks from Sheila Dallas's home in Denver. The Safeway is eight blocks away. But when the family runs out of milk, Mrs. Dallas, a legal secretary, would rather stand in line at the grocery store than pay more for convenience.  In many markets, 7-Eleven's prices for products such as milk, soft drinks, cigarettes and beer have been cut to compete with supermarkets. In Florida, Texas and parts of Arizona where competition is stiff, 7-Eleven has slashed some prices almost to cost and boasts the best buys in town. In Dallas, for instance, 7-Eleven sells two-liter bottles of soda for $1.39, compared with an average price of about $1.80; a 12-pack of beer goes for $5.79, compared with an average price of about $6.15.  The impetus for the change is demographic. Dallas-based Southland knows its median customer is a young man who shops at 7-Eleven about a dozen times a month. Its customers have tended to be blue-collar male workers who visit the stores for morning coffee, lunch-time burritos and after-work beer. But the growth of blue-collar workers is slowing, while the ranks of customers less likely to be 7-Eleven regulars -- such as working women, young professionals and people over 55 -- are rising.
