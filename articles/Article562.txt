Negotiations between the Koch administration and unions representing police officers, firefighters and correction officers broke down again yesterday, and the union leaders warned that there would be a bad reaction from their members.  The union chiefs also announced that they would hold a rally Thursday, their second in a week, to protest what they view as the city's ''stonewalling'' at the bargaining table.  The talks at the Vista Hotel, at the World Trade Center, broke down at 9 P.M., and each side blamed the other.  Bruce McIver, Mayor Koch's chief negotiator, said the city would not increase its offer of 4 percent a year in wage increases in a two-year pact until the unions lowered their demands. He said that the city could not bargain ''in the teeth of demands'' that exceeded a 70 percent rise in wages and fringe benefits.  The unions, which are seeking raises of 12 percent a year and a list of other improvements, said they wanted the city to move first in negotiations before they would lower their demands.  As the union leaders emerged from the talks angrily denouncing the city, they were asked if there would be a repeat of the sick-outs and the slowdowns in writing of summonses that followed the last collapse of talks on the night of June 30.  Philip Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he thought a ''human reaction'' was likely. ''There will definitely be more dissatisfaction, a negative reaction from the field,'' said Nicholas Mancuso, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association.  The coalition represents 34,700 uniformed workers. The contracts covering the uniformed workers and most other city employees expired July 1.
