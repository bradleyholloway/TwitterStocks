 Federal Officials Say Tightening Is Needed Now --- Market Rate-Rise Suggests Board Has Taken Action To Head Off Inflation   By By Alan Murray and Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1988  Top Federal Reserve officials have concluded that they need to nudge up short-term interest rates in order to head off inflation, and there are signs in the financial markets that a tightening of monetary policy may already have begun.  In interviews yesterday and Friday, several Fed policy-makers said they believe the economy may be at a turning point requiring action to keep inflation from accelerating. Some of the officials spoke for the record; others asked that their names not be used. But all agreed, in the words of Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, that "there's legitimate concern about inflation."  In addition, yesterday's rise in the federal funds rate, the key interest rate that banks charge on loans to each other, indicates a tightening may already be under way. "I think the Fed has in fact tightened," says Charles Lieberman, managing director of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
