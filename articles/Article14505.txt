 Beazer to Sell Chemicals Unit For $660 Million   By By Paul Hemp, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1988  If completed, the management buy-out greatly would reduce the debt incurred by BNS Inc., a Beazer-led U.S. shell company, in its highly leveraged $1.71 billion acquisition of Koppers last month. Although expected, the sale would come sooner and for a higher price tag than seemed likely at the time of the $61-a-share acquisition of the Pittsburgh-based aggregates and chemicals concern.  Koppers' Chemical and Allied Products division will be bought by an investor group led by members of the division's management and the Sterling Group, a Houston-based buy-out specialist. Sterling Chairman Gordon Cain will be chairman of the new company, to be called Koppers Chemical Co. Glen C. Tenley, who was Koppers president and chief operating officer before the Beazer takeover, will become president and chief executive of the new concern.
