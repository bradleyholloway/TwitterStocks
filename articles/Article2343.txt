 One Man's Death Is Another Man's Real Estate Windfall --- With French `Viager' System, The Sooner a Seller Dies, The More a Buyer Profits   By By Charles Fleming, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 20, 1992  Under a system known in France as "viager," property speculators can buy apartments from old people on open-ended installment plans that run until the seller dies.  For the investor who's in no hurry, and who isn't looking for any immediate return on his investment, the system has its own advantages provided, of course, real estate prices keep climbing. That's because viager -- or "Rentenkaufvertrag," as it's known in Germany -- allows a speculator to buy real estate at a heavily discounted price and then, after an initial downpayment, to pay for the rest in bite-sized monthly installments.  "All the appeal of viager lies in avoiding the most costly intermediaries in the world and in short-circuiting the banks," says Bruno Legasse, chairman of Foncial Viager, a Paris-based viager specialist.
