 UAL Unions Offer Givebacks For Ownership --- They Propose Concessions Totaling $3.6 Billion In Return for 60% Stake   By By Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1993  UAL Corp.'s three major unions are proposing a plan under which the airline's employees would grant some $3.6 billion in concessions over five years in return for 60% ownership in the parent of United Airlines.  Such concessions at the nation's second-largest carrier would amount to one of the largest givebacks yet in the struggling airline industry. In comparison, Northwest Airlines, a unit of Wings Holdings Inc. which is smaller than United, is seeking rank-and-file approval of concessions totaling $886 million over three years in return for up to 37.5% of the company.  The situation is delicate, partly because UAL hasn't even said whether it will negotiate on the union coalition's call for majority employee ownership. In addition, the final amount of any concessions and ownership would depend on the value placed on UAL shares.
