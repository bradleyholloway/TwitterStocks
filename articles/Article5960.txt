 Barney's loses bid for court approval of break-up fee   By Bird, Laura, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1997  A federal bankruptcy judge denied a request by Barney's Inc for approval of a break-up fee to potential investors, a move that could slow down the ailing retailer's campaign to attract higher merger bids than those it has already received. A break-up fee is given in the event a party makes an accepted offer and then is outbid.
