 Theory & Practice: AirAsia Founder Wants His Workers to Speak Up; Fernandes Aims to Change Rigid Management Culture; Trying to Tap '4,000 Brains'   By Prystay, Cris, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2006  The airline's success has sparked other budget carriers in Asia. This year, the Malaysian government stripped the country's ailing national carrier, Malaysia Airlines, of most of its domestic routes, and awarded them to AirAsia. One of Malaysia's most outspoken business executives, Mr. [TONY FERNANDES] has strong ideas on the way airlines should be run, and how Southeast Asia's top-down corporate culture should change. He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his style.  Mr. Fernandes: The management culture here is very top-down. There's less creativity and fewer people who are willing to speak out. They're more implementers than doers. There's less freedom of speech, and that impacts the business world. Even when they know things are not right, they won't speak out. They just do what they're told to do.  Mr. Fernandes: To get people to think. At AirAsia, we want 4,000 brains working for us. My biggest challenge is to get people to talk, to express themselves, to get people to challenge me and say "Tony, you're talking rubbish." That's what I want, not people who say "Yes, sir." I want the guy on the ramp to have the confidence to tell me what's wrong.
