 World Trade Pact Is Delayed In the Congress --- House Agrees to Put Off GATT Vote to Nov. 29, Giving GOP a Victory   By By Bob Davis and Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1994  The delay, approved last night on a 298-123 vote, was a political win for Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who blocked President Clinton and House Democrats from gaining approval of the trade pact this week. Republicans believe they can deliver votes for the pact later on, but want to keep Mr. Clinton from winning a victory going into the fall election. Mr. Gingrich has been consulting closely with trade pact opponent Ross Perot, to woo the Texan's support for Republicans in upcoming races.  The U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, put the best face on the delay, contending that the agreement by House Democratic and Republican leaders to vote after the election all but assured a victory. "What is critical is we'll ratify the agreement this year," Mr. Kantor said. "The vote will be overwhelming."  But the ploy represents a big gamble on the part of Republicans, who traditionally back trade-liberalization measures. The delay clearly energizes a grass-roots coalition of liberal and conservative trade activists trying to transform the trade pact, negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, into a populist issue on a par with last year's North American Free Trade Agreement. The delay is the first time that the coalition has been on the winning side of a trade dispute in Congress, after battling for years.
