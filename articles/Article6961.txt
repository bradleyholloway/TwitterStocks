 Antitrust Suit Could Reshape Residential Real-Estate Sector   By Hagerty, James R, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  Realtors say that they aren't thwarting competition but that brokers have "ownership rights" in their listings and should be able to determine how they are displayed on the Web. The trade group argues that the department hasn't fully taken into account changes to its policy that were announced last week in a bid to avert the suit. Justice Department officials "do not understand the real-estate industry," Laurie Janik, the group's general counsel, said in an interview.  The policy involves Internet displays of information from multiple- listing services, or MLS, which are local databases of homes available for sale. As revised last week, the policy lets brokers refuse to allow their listings to be displayed on other brokers' Web sites. If they exercise this "opt out," brokers must inform home sellers that their listings won't appear on rivals' sites and get written consent.
