 Packwood's Tax Plan Pleases Reagan, Would Raise Funds From Excise Levies   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Jane Mayer, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1986  Sen. Bob Packwood said he received a favorable reception from President Reagan for his tax-overhaul plan, even though it carries a huge rise in revenue from excise taxes.  The proposal to eliminate the deduction for excise taxes and tariffs is sure to raise howls from the business community as well as from consumer groups. Finance Committee aides defend the repeal as a way to broaden the tax base, but it has been criticized as a backdoor increase in excise taxes. Excise taxes are taxes on consumption, and critics are likely to claim that the tax change, though counted as a rise in corporate-tax payments, will ultimately be paid by consumers.  The Packwood plan also would curtail deductions for state and local taxes, which were spared in the House-passed bill. It would repeal the deduction for state and local sales and personal-property taxes and would curb the deduction for state and local income taxes for high-income taxpayers. The deduction for taxes on real property wouldn't be changed. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.) said the paring of the state and local deduction would raise $27 billion over five years.
