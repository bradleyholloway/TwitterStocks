 Lieberman Campaigns, With Gore in Mind --- Senator's Presidential Aspirations Complicated by Pledge to Defer to Former Running Mate   By By John Harwood, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2002  There is a little flaw in his testimonial, though: For Mr. Lieberman, American democracy 2004-style could well be a zero-sum game. If his 2000 benefactor, Al Gore, runs again for president, Mr. Lieberman has promised not to. But that trap door only underscores the drive that leads the Connecticut Democrat to run a mid-August New Hampshire gauntlet as punishing as two-a-days in a football training camp.  It is rare for one politician's fate to be so completely bound up in another's. Publicly and privately, reporters and would-be Lieberman backers almost invariably ask the Gore question, exploring whether Mr. Lieberman will keep the pledge he made more than a year ago or renege on it. Mr. Lieberman politely reiterates his commitment, but the queries grow wearying.  Steve Keefe, for one, doesn't think the pledge makes any sense. "I don't think Gore did him a favor" by putting Mr. Lieberman on the 2000 ticket, says the software engineer from Bedford, N.H. "He did it for a reason" -- and Mr. Lieberman should use a similar political calculus in planning his future, regardless of Mr. Gore's intentions.
