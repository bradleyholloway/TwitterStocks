 Senators Say They Will Intervene If Web-Music Battle Isn't Settled   By By Jill Carroll and Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said during a hearing yesterday that Napster Inc., MP3.com Inc. and other Web music sites must craft "fair and reasonable" licensing agreements with artists whose music they offer. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the panel's highest-ranking Democrat, echoed the chairman's call for close attention. Neither senator set a timetable for taking any action, but both called for a compromise that would allow consumers to get online music while guaranteeing that musicians and record labels are paid for their works.  The major record labels have sued Napster, of San Mateo, Calif., and have won one round in court against another company. In April, a judge found San Diego's MP3.com liable for copyright infringement because it was making digital copies of songs without permission. MP3.com has since settled with some major labels.  The issue also has spurred a series of hearings by various congressional committees. But so far, industry lobbyists and legislators have hung back from proposing sweeping initiatives. Many are reluctant to unravel compromises struck as part of a broad 1998 law meant to resolve ownership and copyright issues for content released on the Web. Instead, they are largely waiting for courts to resolve touchy issues, such as the legality of Napster.
