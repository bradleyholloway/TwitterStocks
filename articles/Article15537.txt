 North Carolina Rebounds To Pass Georgia on Jobs   By By Ken Gepfert, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1997  North Carolina, finally flexing its manufacturing muscle again, appears to have dethroned Georgia as the five-state region's job-creating king. And that reversal of fortunes -- while not a shocker given Georgia's inevitable post-Olympic letdown -- has economists debating another, tougher question: Can Georgia regain its long-held title as the best place to go to find work?  To some, like University of Georgia economist Jeffrey M. Humphreys, North Carolina's move is merely a one-year aberration -- a "statistical artifact of the Olympics" since Georgia's year-over-year employment gain was bound to be dimmed by its Olympic hiring binge.  "North Carolina is retrofitting its manufacturing base" with such growing industries as electronics and biotechnology, says Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak. Meanwhile, an increasingly congested Atlanta will be hard-pressed to match past gains as the region's business-service center. "Our ability to grow is slowly ebbing," Mr. Ratajczak says.
