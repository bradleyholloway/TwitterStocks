 Letters to the Editor: `I Will Bless Those Who Bless You'   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2002  Ask why they love Israel and you'll get passionate citations from the Hebrew Scriptures, verses that could as comfortably be quoted by an Orthodox rabbi like myself. I know this because the organization I serve is the nation's only coalition of traditional Jews and Christians, advocating Bible-based solutions to modern American problems; and so my contact with Christians has been intensely personal. My Christian colleagues and I have often talked about Israel and the Bible. They refer to Genesis 12:3, where God gives his promise Abraham: "I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse." Anybody that takes the whole Bible seriously, as evangelical Christians do, will have a hard time reconciling this verse with supporting the cause of militant Palestinians, who indeed curse the Jews.
