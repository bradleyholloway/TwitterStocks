 World Watch   By Compiled By Lily H. Li, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1999  U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno endorsed Russian pledges to crack down on money-laundering, after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told G-8 countries he was determined to stanch the flow of "dirty money" out of Russia and into foreign banks. Ms. Reno said she was "delighted ... and gratified" by Mr. Putin's stance, and said a Russian promise to push through legislation on money-laundering and adopt international standards on fighting economic crime showed Moscow was committed to tackling the problem. Russia's parliament approved anti-money-laundering legislation in June, but President Boris Yeltsin vetoed it. A parliamentary commission is working on a new draft.  DaimlerChrysler's car sales rose 12% to $79 billion for the first nine months of 1999. The German-U.S. auto maker said world-wide sales of its Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars jumped 15% to $29.1 billion. Sales of Chrysler vehicles rose 10% to about $50 billion. Bayerische Motoren Werke posted a 4.8% rise in group sales for the period despite continued sluggish sales at its British unit, Rover. The German car maker said sales revenue rose to $26.7 billion although overall vehicle deliveries fell 1.2% to 895,932 units. Sweden's Volvo reported an 18% increase in operating profit to 4.46 billion kronor ($547.2 million) in part because of strong U.S. truck business.  Italy's Finmeccanica will join Aerospatiale Matra and British Aerospace in their Matra-BAe Dynamics joint venture. The move, which was expected, will create a fully integrated missile company with revenue of roughly 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion). Finmeccanica also expects its aerospace subsidiary, Alenia Aerospazio, to be invited to join Airbus Industrie once the partners have sorted out the consolidation of the European jet consortium. Separately, the U.S.'s Boeing will join MBD to develop its Meteor next-generation air-to-air missile.
