 VW's Scandal Carries Fallout; Labor Ills Shed Light on Germany's Rigid Power-Sharing Law   By Stephen Power in Frankfurt and David Crawford in Berlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2005  Prosecutors in the German state of Lower Saxony are looking into whether Volkswagen officials paid bribes to some of the company's top labor leaders as a way of securing their cooperation during recent contract negotiations, an official with the prosecutor's office confirmed yesterday. The disclosure, coming less than a week after the unexpected resignation of a top labor leader at VW, has triggered a media storm in Germany, where Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his ruling Social Democratic Party are in danger of being thrown from office by voters angry about the country's unemployment rate, which stood at 11.6% in May, a near-record in the post-World War II era.  Last week, one of the company's top labor leaders, Klaus Volkert, unexpectedly resigned as head of the VW works council, the main body that negotiates with VW management. The resignation followed German media reports that Mr. Volkert had business dealings with a midlevel VW executive who resigned last month and is suspected by VW of seeking bribes from parts suppliers. Mr. Volkert couldn't be reached for comment, though Reuters News Service, citing a written statement provided by his lawyers, reported late yesterday that he had denied any criminal wrongdoing. German prosecutors have said he isn't under investigation.
