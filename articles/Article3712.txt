 Supply Worries Lift Oil Price; Data Surprises Show Flat Gasoline Stock, Drop in Refining   By Masood Farivar and Roshanak Taghavi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2007  In a sign that refiners continue to struggle with unit shutdowns and other operational problems, refinery utilization fell by 0.4 percentage point to 89.2% of capacity, the lowest operating level for this time of year in 15 years, the EIA said. Analysts had projected a rise of 0.8 percentage point in refinery utilization -- the amount of refinery capacity in use.  Gasoline stockpiles' failure to rise comes after five straight weeks of builds that were preceded by three months of steady decline. Earlier in the year, gasoline prices surged on worries that the U.S. wouldn't be able to produce enough fuel to satisfy summer driving demand.  Doug MacIntyre, an analyst at the EIA, doesn't expect weak refinery- utilization rates to persist. The EIA has forecast the rate will reach about 93% later this month as refineries come back online. However, while gasoline prices are expected to fall through June and into most of July, "refinery issues and inventory levels are one reason we don't expect prices to go down dramatically," Mr. MacIntyre added.
