 Tambrands, Faced With Troubles, Is Putting Its Account in Review   By By Yumiko Ono, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1996  It seemed as if Tambrands was doing all the right things a growth-seeking consumer products company should do. The No. 1 tampon maker bombarded the long-staid market with popular new products with names like Satin Touch and Tampax Naturals and launched a barrage of television ads and generous coupons.  Tambrands has invited Interpublic Group's McCann Erickson Worldwide, True North Communications' FCB/Leber Katz and WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson to participate in the review, as well as its incumbent agency, Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. Tambrands is expected to decide on an agency in early fall.  Tambrands' current strategy is the work of its chief executive officer, Edward Fogarty, who vowed to revive Tambrands' then-sagging market share when he took office in 1994. Mr. Fogarty, a former executive at Colgate-Palmolive, soon stepped up the attack in the long-stagnant industry by launching a product called Satin Touch, which touted the superiority of its cardboard applicators over Playtex's plastic. Earlier this year, Tambrands launched its biggest-ever marketing campaign by spending $30 million to advertise and promote Tampax Naturals, its first all-cotton tampon that doesn't use synthetic material.
