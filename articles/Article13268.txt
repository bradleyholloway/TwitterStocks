 Oil Prices Rise as Gasoline Inventories Decline   By Bird, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2006  A key gasoline-producing unit at Motiva Enterprises LLC's Port Arthur, Texas, refinery experienced mechanical problems in an attempted restart last week. And a unit at a ConocoPhillips refinery in Belle Chasse, La., failed a restart attempt. The Belle Chasse plant has been shut since August because of damages incurred during Hurricane Katrina.  "We don't have all the refineries back yet from last year," said Tom Bentz, a futures broker with BNP Paribas in New York.  If heavy refinery outages continue through the month, supplies could tighten further, maintaining upward pressure on prices into the peak summer season. High prices already are underpinned by worries over problems that could arise as the industry switches to gasoline containing ethanol from methyl tertiary butyl ether.
