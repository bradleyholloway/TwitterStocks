 Study Links Asthma to Antibiotics; Babies Given the Medication Before Their First Birthdays Are Said to Be at Higher Risk   By Cherney, Elena, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  Clean, germ-free living may actually leave children more susceptible to developing allergies and asthma, a theory known as the "hygiene hypothesis." "We may be programmed to sample the microbial world so our immune systems can grow," says Homer A. Boushey, who directs the Asthma Clinical Research Center at the University of California at San Francisco. "Children are being raised with far lower exposure to microbes and the products that [microbes] make," says Joel Kline, director of the University of Iowa Asthma Center in Iowa City. Exposure to microbes and their byproducts "appears to activate the immune system," says Dr. Kline.  Antibiotic use in infancy could also hamper the development of a baby's immune response. Some studies have shown that babies who have taken antibiotics have different levels of disease-fighting cells in their diapers than babies who have not been on medication. That could signal a change in how the children's immune system is regulating its defenses against infection. "We may have altered the normal development of the immune system," says Fernando Martinez, a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson.  Other factors could also be clouding the studies. Young children with allergic respiratory symptoms that are precursors to developing asthma may be prescribed antibiotics "because people are misinterpreting their symptoms" as signs of a bacterial sickness requiring antibiotics, says Thomas Platts-Mills, chief of the department of allergy at the University of Virginia medical school. Those children might well have developed asthma anyway -- and were just more likely to be improperly prescribed antibiotics because of their early symptoms, Dr. Platts-Mills says.
