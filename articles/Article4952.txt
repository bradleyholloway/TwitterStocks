 World-Wide [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1988  The Ilyushin-76 was approaching Leninakan airport in Soviet Armenia when it crashed, and 69 soldiers and nine crew members were killed. The airport has been the scene of frantic activity since an earthquake devastated the region last Wednesday. More than 20 countries, including Iran, Israel and the U.S., have announced plans to send aid. Gorbachev wound up a two-day visit to the area, telling Soviet TV: "I have simply been shaken by everything I have seen in these two days." He urged rescuers to speed their efforts, warning that an epidemic of disease could break out within a few days. The Soviet health minister put the death toll at 50,000 to 60,000.  A Buddhist monk was killed and 13 people were wounded when police fired into a crowd seeking Tibetan independence in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, China said. Foreign travelers in the area reported seeing up to four dead. It was the third bloody confrontation between authorities and anti-Chinese protesters in Tibet since October 1987.  Palestinians staged a general strike in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip to protest the killing of two youths, and hospital officials said Israeli troops wounded 20 in clashes. Underground Palestinians had designated Sunday as a day for "unique escalation" of the struggle against Israel to mark the founding of a group in the PLO.
