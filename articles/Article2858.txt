 Hedge Funds in Asia Seek to Gain Some Respect, Shed Misperceptions Tied to '97 Financial Crisis   By By Karen Richardson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  Public understanding of these investment partnerships hasn't improved much since Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called George Soros an "immoral moron" three years ago, blaming the financier and his hedge-fund ilk for setting off the Asian financial crisis. Many people in Asia still associate hedge funds with the 1997 attacks on pegged currencies and tactics that pumped stock-market volatility.  With only about 20 hedge funds controlling about $10 billion in Asia, these small and nimble funds don't benefit from the public-relations and marketing departments employed by the traditional funds. Moreover, few hedge funds are authorized for distribution in Hong Kong, so they are often misconstrued there as stealthy operations that operate in the shadows.  Take the unloading by Cable & Wireless of its remaining stake in Pacific Century CyberWorks. Underwriter UBS Warburg designed a bond exchangeable for stock to sell to hedge funds and arbitrage desks, persuading Cable & Wireless to go ahead on the premise that short-selling of PCCW stock by hedge funds was preferable to the unmitigated free-fall expected if Cable & Wireless simply tried to dump its PCCW shares on the sagging open market.
