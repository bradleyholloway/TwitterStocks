 Some Retail Stocks Should Be Left On the Rack in the Short Term   By By Karen L. Tippett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  Why? Wall Street's anxiety comes from several factors, including the less-than-spectacular holiday sales that are expected to negatively affect the fiscal fourth quarters of those retailers that didn't attract as many last-minute shoppers. And though many retailers did, in fact, end the selling season on a stronger-than-expected note, some were hurt by tougher competition.  Although holiday-induced fears have caused shares in many retailers to tumble in recent weeks, analysts continue to caution against loading up on such stocks. While their seemingly reasonable valuations might be tempting, stocks won't be much of a bargain if the companies' earnings outlooks are less certain because of operating woes and industry conditions.  Though initial results were encouraging, the retailer's recent experiences indicate that Service Merchandise has a way to go before it is fully rejuvenated. After the company indicated last month that even jewelry sales, a big draw for its stores, were soft, Craig Weichmann of Morgan Keegan & Co. in Memphis cut his fourth-quarter per-share earnings estimate by 24 cents to 56 cents. For 1998, he reduced his estimate by a whopping 35 cents to 10 cents.
