 Sun Co.'s Moves To Restructure Are Paying Off --- Nimbler Petroleum Refiner Enjoys Higher Profits, Increase in Stock Price   By By Loren Fox, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1997  The Philadelphia company's first-quarter operating earnings jumped to 38 cents a share, wowing Wall Street after disappointing results in four of the five preceding quarters. The first-quarter profit, which compared with a year-earlier loss of 22 cents a share, far exceeded analysts' consensus estimate of nine cents a share.  Sun's cost-cutting and operational upgrades were responsible for the optimism among investors. The company has lowered operating costs by roughly $25 million, analysts estimate. And while Sun said it was pleased by the results, it still must prove that the operational improvement and lower costs are sustainable.  The first-quarter results signaled to many that Sun had finally realized it had to be a scrappy, nimble competitor like other independent refiners. "In the past, Sun had always had a `major oil' mentality, and thought it had the deep pockets to ride through the rough periods," said Paul Cheng, a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst.
