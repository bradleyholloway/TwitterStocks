 Infosys Plans U.S. Investment Of $20 Million   By Slater, Joanna, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 2004  The move to expand in the U.S. could help blunt criticism from politicians about the shift of U.S. technology jobs to nations such as India. "In our own small way, we are showing our commitment to the U.S. economy," said Kris Gopalakrishnan, Infosys chief operating officer.  Infosys said the new subsidiary, based in Fremont, Calif., would hire 75 employees in the first year and ramp up to 500 within three years. It also said it had hired four U.S. consultants to build the venture, led by Stephen Pratt, formerly a partner at Deloitte Consulting.
