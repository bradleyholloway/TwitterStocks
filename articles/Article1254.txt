 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Lynn Asinof, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1989  Wholesale prices to dealers are expected to slide 1.4% in the next six months, with consumer prices to tumble as much as 7.5%, says a survey by Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., distributor. The reasons: intense competition from office superstores and a slack paper market. Quill predicts a 7% drop in the wholesale cost of data-processing and word-processing paper and a 3% decline in the cost of general office paper.  But others say the slide will be less dramatic for consumers, especially big ones with contracts. Jim Miller of Miller Business Systems Inc., Arlington, Texas, says the real squeeze is on retail stores; contract stationers, he says, can keep prices steady by stressing service. Jack Macauley of Macauley's Inc., a 15-store Michigan chain, says he likewise holds prices and pushes "premium" service.  Sales of holiday lights are up 20% from last year, says Noma Industries Ltd., Toronto, which bills itself as the world's biggest holiday-light producer. "We find we're virtually recession-proof. People will always put up their lights," says Andrew Rafelman, marketing manager. General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., says it's having an excellent year with colored lights. "There is a significantly higher level of outdoor decorating," says Steven Willensky, general manager of specialty products.
