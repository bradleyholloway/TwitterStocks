 Home & Family: Shopping Around / Online   By Vascellaro, Jessica E, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2006  The biggest innovation is that some of the new services, including Mezi Media Inc.'s Smarter Companion and IAC/InterActiveCorp.'s Pronto, do most of the work themselves. While older sites require users to type the name of a desired product and scroll through a list of results, these programs shadow you as you shop. If you're at a site checking out a pair of pink sandals, for example, the services will shoot you (via a separate window on your computer screen) available coupons on that same item, or will suggest similar shoes that are available at lower prices. Smarter Companion, which is expected to be released today, also saves shoppers the trouble of remembering the cryptic coupon codes required with some offers by applying them automatically at checkout.  The new services also address privacy concerns: Smarter Companion, which includes an option to automatically fill in your profile and credit-card information at the checkout page, stores the details on your computer, not a remote sever. To use Zimini, you don't even need to provide your email.  Software/Company: Zimini/ Zimini Inc.
