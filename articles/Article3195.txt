 Lucent Executive Sees Rise in Revenue From Asian Markets   The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1999  Carly Fiorina, group president of Lucent's global service-provider business, said Lucent is seeing a "definite pickup in activity" in Asia this year. "We think the worst {of the economic crisis} is behind," she said, but cautioned that "it's going to be a long climb out" for some countries.  Lucent, which has made several acquisitions in Asia since last year, doesn't disclose how much of its total revenue -- which topped $30 billion in 1998 -- comes from Asia.
