 The Lawyers Say They Can't Take It With Them --- Occidental Petroleum Aides Allegedly Caught Raiding Armand Hammer Home   By By Amy Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1990  According to witnesses, not long after Dr. Hammer's body was removed for burial about a dozen Occidental representatives appeared at the large, cream-colored house and started hauling away document boxes and suitcases and loading them into their cars.  But officially, at the moment Dr. Hammer died a little after 7 p.m., the house had become the property of his late wife's niece and her husband. For the past few months they have been involved in a $400 million lawsuit against Dr. Hammer and Occidental.  Their suit claims that the company and Dr. Hammer defrauded his late wife, Frances, by using her separate property to accumulate vast wealth, including Dr. Hammer's Occidental stock and extensive art collection. Robert S. Weiss, husband of Frances's niece Joan, is executor of the Frances Hammer estate.
