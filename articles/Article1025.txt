 Catalog Retailers Are Seeking to Reduce Costs to Counter Rise in Postage Rates   By By Ann Hagedorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1988  That will be one result of the imminent 25% increase in third-class mail rates, which is forcing catalog retailers to change the way they run their businesses. In anticipation, many have already cut their mailing lists, purging borderline customers. Some are trying "piggyback" mailings with newspapers and magazines. A number are testing lighter weight paper and smaller catalogs. Others plan to cut out entire lines of low-margin merchandise that they can no longer afford to sell by mail.  "This will really change the complexion of the industry," says Marc Sroge, a catalog consultant at Marke/Sroge Communications, Chicago. The rate increase and 7% to 10% increases in paper costs this year will result in a 20% rise in the cost of producing and mailing a catalog, he adds.  Jay Walker, chairman of Catalog Retail Corp., of Ridgefield, Conn., says some companies are experimenting with "a piggyback mailing scheme" with magazines. Both catalog and magazine are mailed together in a plastic bag. Saks Fifth Avenue, the specialty chain unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, London, and Spiegel Inc., a large catalog operation based in Chicago, have already piggybacked with the business magazine, Inc. Selective Software, a Santa Cruz, Calif.-based cataloger, says it has mailed its catalog with numerous computer magazines, such as PC World. The cataloger can save 10% to 15% in mailing costs this way because it pays only a percentage of the total postage rate, says Howard Lee, a San Francisco catalog consultant.
