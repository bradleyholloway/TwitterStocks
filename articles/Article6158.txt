 South Korean Stocks Soar, While Other Markets In Asia Have Mixed Day and Europe Weakens   By By Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1998  South Korean stocks soared 7.8% as lower interest rates, the prospect of major corporate restructurings, and hopes of an improvement in the country's credit rating all helped to extend the market's recent strong rally.  Markets elsewhere in Asia had a mixed day, with Singapore up 1.1% and Indonesia up 1.2%, while Hong Kong shed 0.4% and Japan fell 0.8%. But, with European markets weaker, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 1.34 points, or 0.69%, to 194.27.  Despite news of a half-point interest-rate cut in Britain, London's stock market slipped 0.2%. But the corporate news of the day was Ericsson of Sweden, which shocked the market with a profit warning. Ericsson's share price plummeted 16%, dragging the Swedish stock market down 4.7% and hitting other technology-related stocks in Europe. Germany shed 0.6%, France lost 0.7%, and Switzerland fell 1.7%.
