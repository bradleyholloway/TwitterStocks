 Taste -- And Baby Makes Two: For celebrities, fathers are dispensable. Anybody have a problem with that?   By By Maggie Gallagher, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1998  Madonna did it. Michelle Pfeiffer did it. Rosie O'Donnell did it twice. So many celebrities are doing it that when Jodie Foster recently joined the ranks of celebrity unwed moms, the only thing that aroused comment was her refusal to name the father.  As Sara McLanahan, a sociologist at Princeton, sums up in an essay in "Lost Fathers" (St. Martin's Press, 1998): Even after controlling for factors such as race and socioeconomic status, "children who grow up apart from their biological fathers are disadvantaged across a broad array of outcomes. . . .They are twice as likely to drop out of high school, 2.5 times as likely to become teen mothers, and 1.4 times as likely to be idle -- out of school and out of work -- as are children who grow up with both parents. Children in one-parent families also have lower grade point averages, lower college aspirations and poorer attendance records. As adults, they have higher rates of divorce."  In the June 1998 cover story of Good Housekeeping, which gives Rosie the kind of gushing prose previously reserved for Princess Di, Rosie has the decency to say she hopes no one will be influenced by her behavior. "I'm not a role model. I'm a very, very rich woman, who has the luxury of endless supplies of help," she said. "I'm the exception to every rule that there is about single parenting, and I shouldn't be held up as any sort of example." So what is she doing on the cover of a stodgy magazine like Good Housekeeping? And why doesn't the fawning interviewer at least bring up the question of whether it's fair to deprive an eminently adoptable infant of the chance for an intact family?
