 Hasbro's New Chief Must Prove Himself   By By Joseph Pereira Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journl, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1989  PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- Two years ago top executives at Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy company, were introduced at an analysts' dinner in New York by Stephen Hassenfeld, then chairman and chief executive officer. But he failed to mention one: Alan Hassenfeld, his younger brother and company president.  Last week, after laboring for years in the shadow of Stephen, Alan was named chairman and chief executive officer of Hasbro. Alan, who remains president, succeeds Stephen, who died of pneumonia last month at the age of 47.  His succession didn't surprise analysts, though some have questioned his ability. To his critics, Mr. Hassenfeld responds: "Time will tell. I, as well as people in this organization, don't have doubts about my ability." Alan has worked for the toy company for two decades in various capacities.
