 ASML Results Show Lethargy Remains in Chips   By Knapen, Joon, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2004  The most recent profit figure included a 33 million euro charge for the initial payment ASML made to Nikon Corp. of Japan to settle a long-running technology patent dispute. ASML is one of the world's largest makers of lithography systems, which map out electronic circuits on silicon wafers; it competes with Nikon and Canon Inc. of Japan.  "Third-quarter results are a little light on shipments and bottom- line net profit," Bank Oyens analyst Bert Siebrand said. He noted that the only "real positive" in the earnings report is the value of ASML's order book.
