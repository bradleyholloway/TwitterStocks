 New Evidence Bolsters Use of Heart Scans; Controversial Calcium Tests Help Predict Coronary Risk For Many People, Study Says   By Burton, Thomas M, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2004  The new study focused on 1,312 people in California -- all of them over 45 years old and most in their 60s -- who got CT scans to measure coronary calcium. Researchers followed them for an average of seven years, and 84 of them had a heart attack or died from cardiac causes during that time. The question the researchers focused on was whether the imaging test could help improve the frustratingly imprecise traditional "risk-factor" analysis. After all, about 35% of heart attacks occur in people whose total cholesterol is below the accepted standard of 200. The conclusion was that the "calcium score" from the CT does alter that analysis, and can lead to more intensive treatment.  "There has been a sense of befuddlement about the intermediate-risk patient," says Philip Greenland, chairman of preventive medicine at Northwestern and an author of the study. "They don't quite meet the threshold for drug therapy. But if with a high calcium score they move up into the higher classification of predicted risk, they become a candidate for drugs." He recommends the CT scan be considered only after evaluation by a doctor, including cholesterol measurement.  The latest study is quite clear on the second point. "The current results . . . demonstrated that a coronary calcium score of zero does not routinely exclude risk of future coronary heart disease events," the authors write. In fact, seven of 75 people believed based on traditional risk factors to have a 21% or greater risk of heart attack in fact suffered one, or died of one, during the research, despite having a coronary calcium score of zero. So did seven of 195 people with zero calcium scores who were believed to be in the middle risk range.
