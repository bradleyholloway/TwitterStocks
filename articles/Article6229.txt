 Letters to the Editor: Malaysia and Foreign Investors   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1999  -- Reviewing the CLOB issue as a reflection of Malaysia's treatment of foreign investors is not justified and is prejudicial to the many long-term foreign investors who understand and support the Malaysian system. Furthermore, CLOB investors are not only foreigners, but include Malay-sians as well.  -- Malaysia's treatment of CLOB is in the interest of ensuring orderly and fair conduct of trading in Malaysian securities for all investors, local and foreign, at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Thus the issue is one of ensuring orderly and fair market conduct, rather than the treatment of any group of investors.  -- CLOB was unilaterally created by the Singapore authorities and Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) to effect the continued trading of Malaysian shares after Malaysia decided to delist Malaysian shares on the SES in 1990, thus frustrating the intention of the delisting itself.
