 Boston's Stock Exchange Seeks an Outside Investor   By By Jeffrey Krasner, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  The effort to find a partner comes two years after Boston Stock Exchange officials began holding a series of merger talks with other regional exchanges. Talks progressed furthest with the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. Morton says things didn't work out there because of differences in the customer bases. Cincinnati, he says, has a much stronger emphasis on "retail" trades. "What became an obstacle was a difference in strategy," he says, and there was "a happy parting of the ways."  Stock markets in general are undergoing wrenching transformations. Investors want faster trades, smaller commissions to brokers and narrower spreads between buying and selling ("bid" and "asked") prices. More investors are using Internet-based systems that let them buy and sell without speaking directly to a broker. Partly as a result, electronic competitors have sprung up rapidly in the past two years, notably ECNs, which replace the frenzied flailing of brokers on the floor of an exchange with the silent zapping of computers that link buyers and sellers. ECNs compete with traditional dealers on the Nasdaq Stock Market and now handle more than a third of Nasdaq-traded shares.  Regional exchanges such as Boston's survive by developing relationships with nearby brokers and financial institutions, and by paying brokers to send business their way. Still, all regional exchanges -- including the Pacific, Philadelphia, Chicago and Cincinnati exchanges -- handled only 8.4% of trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed shares on a recent day.
