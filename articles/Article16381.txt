 Americas: Time Is Running Out to Rescue Venezuela   By O'Grady, Mary Anastasia, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2004  Since winning a presidential election in 1998, [Castro]'s Venezuelan protege, President Hugo Chavez, has pursued precisely what the Russian researchers in Santiago described: the methodical consolidation of absolute authority under the guise of "democracy." Along with paramilitaries and community snoopers, the Chavez power grab has entailed converting the congress into a unicameral body, rewriting the constitution to enhance his rule and purging potential opponents in the military.  Bolivia is already at risk. I'm told that at one time, Mr. Chavez's military attache in Bolivia was holding meetings with police and military officers and providing funds to radical, militant groups. The supposedly spontaneous uprising by the Indian population that brought down the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003 was, more accurately, an organized coup d'etat. Some 5,000 agitators were bussed about the country for six weeks to set up ambushes and block roads. People close to the events say Mr. Chavez provided the money while Castro provided the organization.  Despite all the claims to "legality," Venezuelans know well what is happening to their country. That's why they have been committing brave acts of civil disobedience at the risk of losing their lives. Last week an unarmed protestor was allegedly shot in the back by the military. Yesterday the country's ambassador to the U.N. stepped down citing his government's disrespect for human rights. It is well past time for the Free World to make an equally forceful protest against Commandante Chavez.
