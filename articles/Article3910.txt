 Thinking Like a Bull in a Bear Market   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2008  [...] an investor targeting 20% to 40% of a portfolio in stocks, would gradually put more money into stocks whenever the market headed toward lows seen in the past month, like the 7552.29 level the Dow hit in November, until reaching the upper band of the allocation. Investors with stocks they don't want to sell, perhaps for tax reasons, can build protection against sudden price drops using positions in exchange-traded funds that profit when stock prices head lower, suggests Lawrence Glazer, an advisor at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.
