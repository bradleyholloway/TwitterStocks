 Retail Sales Jumped 0.6% in November, Buoyed by a Surge in the Auto Sector   By By Alejandro Bodipo-Memba, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1998  Better-than-expected November sales, buoyed by a surge in the auto sector, suggest that retailers may be in for a merry Christmas after all.  Overall sales rose 0.6% following October's upwardly revised 1.2% jump, the Commerce Department said. Only one of the nine major retail categories -- restaurants -- saw sales growth slip. Separately, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in November following October's 0.2% gain, held down by sharp drops in food and energy prices.  Excluding motor-vehicle sales, total retail sales climbed 0.4% in November. Despite falling fuel prices, sales at gasoline-service stations were unchanged. (Retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation.)
