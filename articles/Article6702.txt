 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste: Empire's Enthusiast   By L. Gordon Crovitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 2003  A gala evening in London last week took place as if nothing had changed since the death of Cecil Rhodes a century ago. At Westminster Hall, 1,000 Rhodes scholars gathered to mark the centenary of the scholarship he founded. The event was hosted by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was joined by Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton and other notables. Not least, by Nelson Mandela, who cheered the memory of "that great entrepreneur." The London Times headline captured the irony: "Mandela Praises Imperialist Rhodes." But hold on -- wasn't Rhodes a grasping colonialist and a racist to boot?  As the U.S., Britain and others in what Rhodes would have called the "English-speaking union" consider the meaning of empire these days -- and as President Bush tours an Africa littered with states that have failed since independence -- Rhodes offers some revisionist guideposts. Not all my fellow scholars will agree, but I think Rhodes deserves to be seen as the great champion of a well-intentioned and often effective imperial ambition. His vision of what it took "to lead the world's fight" -- as his scholarship's statement of purpose puts it -- could not be more timely.  The official history of Rhodes scholarships, written for the 50th anniversary, recalls the hysteria that came about when the first black American was elected a Rhodes scholar in 1907. A number of Rhodes scholars at Oxford protested, threatening to resign their scholarships. They sent a representative to urge the Rhodes trustees to cancel the award. "A vain hope," the history recounts. "He was reminded that there was plenty of 'color' in the British Empire; and no British subject was going to be debarred from a Rhodes scholarship on that ground. There was nothing in the will to justify such an action."
