 Getting Refund for Unused Vioxx Needs to Be Easier, States Say   By Barbara Martinez and Anna Wilde Mathews, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2004  When Merck announced the withdrawal of Vioxx Sept. 30, it estimated that roughly two million people were current users of the drug. More than 100 million Vioxx prescriptions have been filled since the drug was approved in 1999. In order to get a refund from Merck, a Vioxx user is required to return unused pills and submit a receipt of the purchase.  A spokesman for Merck said the company will be "working cooperatively" with the attorneys general to "ensure that patients have access to both the information and the resources they need to ensure that they can easily receive a refund for their unused Vioxx."
