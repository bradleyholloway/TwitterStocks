 The Man Within   By George Sim Johnston, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2004  Mr. Sherry, author of a massive Greene "life," now complete in three volumes, has certainly done his homework. But he writes like a dutiful literary executor who is far too polite to meet the complexities of his subject. In 2,000 pages -- a few more than are needed -- he reminds one of the narrator of John P. Marquand's novel "The Late George Apley," industriously quoting every letter and following every lead while never quite coming to grips with the enormities he has uncovered.  There was much toxic debris in the wake of all the promiscuity, and not surprisingly at least two of his lovers took to drink. And, oh yes -- there were children. Greene writes of his son, then age 24: "I had to sit up till 2 a.m. for Francis. How I dislike children." Mr. Sherry's two-word gloss on this passage -- "good grief" -- is a fair sample of his biographical artistry.  Greene's theological oddities were generally noticed only by lynx- eyed co-religionists like Evelyn Waugh. His politics were a different matter. He was loud in his praise for all things Soviet, while his virulent anti-Americanism went beyond caricature. In more tropical climes, dictators like Castro and General Torrijos of Panama found him an easy dupe. It is to Mr. Sherry's credit that he does not fudge Greene's political gullibility, although he could spare us his analysis of Cuba in the late 1950s: "The black pot of Batista had suddenly become the black kettle of Castro."
