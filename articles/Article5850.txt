 A Special Summary and Forecast Of Federal and State Tax Developments [1]  By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1996  IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson is stepping up efforts to win congressional approval for a new tool to discourage charities and many other tax-exempt groups from tax-law violations, such as giving excessive paychecks or perks to top officers. She wants the power to hit offenders with a new tax. Under current law, the IRS's only recourse is to revoke a group's tax-exempt status.  Because revocation is a drastic step, "we are very reluctant" to take it, Ms. Richardson says. "Unfortunately, our reluctance is well known, and sometimes taxpayers have taken full advantage of this reluctance by taking very aggressive stances." The House has approved a bill authorizing the IRS to impose a new tax.  If taxpayers with documented financial woes don't have the money to pay all their back taxes, the IRS may be willing to settle for much less than the full amount owed. This program, known as "offers-in-compromise," has attracted many more takers since early 1992, when the IRS streamlined its procedures. For the year ended Sept. 30, a record 99,078 offers poured in, up from 8,711 in 1991. The IRS accepted 26,668, up from 1,995 in 1991.
