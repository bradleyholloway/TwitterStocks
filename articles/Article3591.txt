 A Global Journal Report: Citigroup Inc. Deal With Chinese Bank Would Be Milestone   By By Karby Leggett in Shanghai and Paul Beckett in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2002  The New York financial-services company is in advanced negotiations to acquire a stake in government-owned Pudong Development Bank, according to people familiar with the matter. Talks between Citigroup's Citibank unit and Pudong, based in Shanghai, have been under way for months. But the discussions have heated up in recent weeks, these people said, and a deal could be completed in the next month or two.  The development comes as Citigroup, one of the most acquisitive financial-services companies in the world, has been hard hit in the recent stock-market slump amid investor concerns about its dealings with Enron Corp. as well as its involvement in broader conflicts among Wall Street analysts. Citigroup and other major U.S. banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. face potential legal liability in the wake of allegations that they helped Enron deceive investors and ratings agencies -- allegations the banks vehemently deny.  Even Citigroup's recent emerging-markets stumble doesn't appear to be deterring its interest. In this year's first quarter, Citigroup missed analysts' earnings estimates for the first time since it was formed in 1998 by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. because of big loan losses in Argentina.
