 Flight Risk: Laptop Dangers Draw Scrutiny From Airline-Safety Regulators; Five On-Board Battery Fires In Past Two Years Cited; Restrictions on Use Possible; Makers Say Problem Is Fixed   By Dade, Corey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2006  A series of fires dating back to 1999 led to a federal regulation in 2004 banning cargo shipments of an earlier generation of batteries from the bellies of passenger aircraft. These batteries, known as lithium batteries, differ from lithium-ion models in that they can't be recharged. The rule called lithium batteries on commercial airliners "an immediate safety risk" but did not prohibit them from carry-on or checked luggage. Today, the more-advanced lithium-ion batteries account for the majority of battery incidents. There are currently no controls on them in carry-on or checked bags, nor when they are shipped in the cargo holds of passenger planes.  The potential danger to airlines first surfaced in 1999 involving the lithium "primary" battery that preceded the rechargeable lithium- ion version. After two pallets holding 120,000 of those batteries unloaded from a passenger plane went up in flames at Los Angeles International Airport, the NTSB requested an investigation of the products by the FAA. In 2004, the federal agency that regulates the transport of dangerous substances, now called the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, ended the transport of those batteries in the cargo holds of passenger carriers. After the FedEx incident earlier in 2004, the FAA began a still-ongoing investigation into lithium-ion batteries.  -- Short circuits appear to be the primary cause -- Unexplained fires/explosions usually involve lithium-based batteries -- Almost all incidents involve unlabeled "nonregulated" or "excepted" batteries -- No incident involved batteries in retail packaging -- Almost all incidents detected on the ground
