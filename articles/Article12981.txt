 Gambits & Gadgets In The World Of Technology   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2003  That's exactly what Virgin Mobile is doing by enlisting help from so-called alpha teens to spread the word about the first MTV-branded cellphone: the Slider V5 MTV Edition phone. The new Kyocera phone, which retails for $159, features MTV content, including access to MTV's Web site, special MTV-logo screensaver and wallpaper designs, preloaded ringtones and the ability to send audio postcards of scenes from shows such as "The Real World."  Meanwhile, Bolt Inc.'s bolt.com teen site kicked off a competition yesterday designed to get young adults spreading news about the phone online. The site says it identified a month ago an undisclosed number of "alpha teens" or "connectors" deemed influential by their communication patterns on the site. Bolt aimed to get the teens to recruit as many other teens as possible to "teams" by having them answer questions correctly about Virgin. After a month, members of the largest team get a chance to win one of the new phones.  "The peace of mind would be that if you're sitting in Starbucks, you'll know that the wireless link is secure," says Janet Lill, a company spokeswoman. "No one can be sitting three tables away looking at your data."
