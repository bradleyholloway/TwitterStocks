 World Watch   By Compiled by David I. Oyama, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2000  Bridgestone/Firestone Canada, following last week's lead by its U.S. parent, announced a voluntary recall that could involve more than one million tires. The company, as in the U.S., is recalling radial ATX and ATX II tires, as well as Wilderness AT tires produced at the Decatur, Ill., plant. Bridgestone/Firestone Canada is a unit of Bridgestone/Firestone, Nashville, Tenn., which in turn is a unit of Japan's Bridgestone. The recall comes as U.S. regulators investigate 46 deaths and more than 300 incidents related to Firestone tires. Officials at Transport Canada, the federal department in charge of road safety, said it isn't launching a similar sweeping investigation. Meanwhile, Ford Motor's Canada unit estimated the tires involved in the recall were placed on 283,000 Ford vehicles sold in Canada since 1991. Thousands of the tires also were sold at Canadian retail stores. A Ford spokesman said Bridgestone/Firestone will reimburse Ford for replacing tires. Both companies declined to estimate the recall's cost.
