 Off the Beaten Track / Phoenix   By McBride, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  What to Do: Common wisdom holds that this desert city should be avoided at all costs during the summer. But if you can handle the heat, you can land some great deals, avoid the crowds and find some quirky ways to enjoy yourself. For a start, consider the Desert Botanical Garden, which through the rest of this month offers flashlight tours of the grounds at 7 p.m. on Thursdays and Saturdays, $25 per person. The roughly two-hour kid-friendly tour showcases flora and fauna, including night-blooming cacti, tortoises, snakes and scorpions. (1201 N.
