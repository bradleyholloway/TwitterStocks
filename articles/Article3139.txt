 WorldCom Creditors Back Plan To Reorganize in Bankruptcy   By By Rebecca Blumenstein and Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2003  WorldCom is expected to file its reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court today. The company in recent days has secured backing for the plan from 90% of its creditors, reaching a broader consensus more quickly than many expected in the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. In an effort to break from its scandal-ridden past, WorldCom also plans to change its name to MCI, the big provider of long-distance telephone service it bought in 1998. WorldCom also will move its headquarters to Ashburn, Va., from Clinton, Miss., where the company was founded.  Many in the telecommunications industry dread the resurrection of WorldCom after an accounting fraud that is expected to total as much as $11 billion in overstated revenues and profits. Some rivals fear a new round of price wars as the industry continues to reel from a huge glut of capacity while WorldCom and some smaller companies emerge from bankruptcy. Competitors such as AT&T Corp. and the regional Bells have said WorldCom is being rewarded for its fraud by being allowed to remove the debt from its books and stay in business. The Bells, which are owed money by WorldCom, lobbied the Federal Communications Commission, saying WorldCom should be liquidated and put out of business. WorldCom, which hadn't been profitable for two years, covered up its losses by manipulating expenses and reserves.  More than shedding its debt, WorldCom is seeking also to distance itself from its once-storied legacy that has since become an emblem of corporate greed. WorldCom was founded by Bernard J. Ebbers in the early 1980s as a reseller of long-distance services for hotels in Mississippi. Mr. Ebbers steadily expanded by acquiring more than 70 companies, culminating in a bidding war for MCI. WorldCom became one of the biggest stock-market stars in the late 1990s until the company admitted last June that it had inflated profits by $3.8 billion, a figure that has since grown steadily larger. Mr. Ebbers remains under investigation by federal prosecutors. WorldCom's former chief financial officer, Scott Sullivan, is expected to stand trial in September on charges related to orchestrating the accounting fraud.
