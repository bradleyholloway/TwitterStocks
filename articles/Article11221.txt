 The Eastern Strike: Uncharacteristic Solidarity Keeps Pilots From Crossing Picket Lines   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1989  The Machinists union is counting on -- and so far getting -- support from pilots to make its strike against Eastern Airlines effective.  It is the kind of backing that pilots have seldom provided and airline unions have seldom gotten in the past. Highly paid pilots are regarded by unionists as "the Cadillacs of the labor movement," an AFL-CIO official said. "Traditionally, they've taken care of themselves at the expense of their brothers and sisters in the airline industry."  The AFL-CIO official said he is "pleasantly surprised" that most of the pilots have honored Machinist picket lines in the first two days of the walkout, thereby keeping nearly all Eastern flights grounded. Fully 98% or more of the carrier's pilots apparently refused to cross picket lines over the weekend, according to spokesmen for the Air Line Pilots Association.
