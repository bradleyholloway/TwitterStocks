 Letters to the Editor: Regicide in Belgrade   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1987  "King" Marziano II ("Would-Be King of Serbia and Bosnia Bestows Titles for a Donation," international section, Dec. 30) may prefer to claim descent from Constantine the Great rather than to reveal the actual lowly origins of the Obrenovich family. The dynasty was founded by Milos Obrenovich, a prosperous Serbian pig merchant of the early 1800s who led a successful revolt against the Ottoman sultan and won autonomy for his country. Milos consolidated his power by having his rival Black George Petrovic (known as Karadjordje, Kara being the Turkish word for black) treacherously murdered. Milos then sent the severed head of Karadjordje on a platter to the sultan in Istanbul.
