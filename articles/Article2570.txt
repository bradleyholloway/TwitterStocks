 Microsoft, RealNetworks in Digital Music Moves   By By David Bank and Nick Wingfield, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1999  RealNetworks, which has a commanding share of the market for "streaming" media technology, embraced the popular MP3 technology for distributing high-fidelity music on the Internet by agreeing to acquire closely held Xing Technology Corp. for as much as $75 million in stock.  Microsoft, which is mounting an aggressive challenge to RealNetworks, announced its own alternative to MP3, which it said will offer both higher quality sound and faster downloads. But the software giant, frustrated in its efforts to attract recording stars and major labels to its new format, mustered only a few independent artists and labels for its launch event in Los Angeles last night.  Streaming technology enables Internet users to listen to sound files as they are downloading. That saves time, because the user doesn't have to wait for the complete download to hear the song, but it limits audio quality. MP3, in contrast, is being used by millions of fans on the Internet to download and store music of near-compact-disk quality on their computers. Much of the traffic in MP3 files has been in violation of copyright protections, generating concern among many recording industry executives.
