 The Road to European Unity -- 1992: Europe's Elimination of Barriers in 1992 Giving Consultants a New Playing Field   By By Paul Hemp, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 1988  "It's the greatest thing for the consultancy market in my career," says Stanley Crossick, chairman of C&L Belmont, a Brussels-based consultant that is half-owned by Coopers & Lybrand, the international accounting and consulting firm. Consultants see a legion of potential clients in companies nervous about the plan to eliminate trade barriers within the European Community and make Europe a single market by the end of 1992. So they are coining catchy phrases, setting up 1992 luncheon clubs and aggressively peddling advice to heighten -- and then ease -- companies' concerns.  -- Snips and Snaps. Consultants at C&L Belmont have developed a Strategy Ninety-two Initial Positioning, or Snip, grid that is supposed to measure how different industries will be affected by the single market. Their Strategy Ninety-two Awareness Program, or Snap, makes sure clients are properly tuned in. "Unless people are thinking European, they won't be able to perceive the changes in the European market and the effect on their organization," says director Michael Clarke.  -- Club 1992. Accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Whinney has formed a sort of 1992 support group under the "patronage" of 11 English lords. (Though they aren't experts on 1992, the lords lend prestige to the group, Ernst & Whinney says.) The club's 150 members, British business executives, meet regularly to listen to speakers and talk about their needs under a single market. Although the seminars help promote the firm's consulting services, "We don't ram Ernst & Whinney down their throats," says Malcolm Levitt, who heads the program.
