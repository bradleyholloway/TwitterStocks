 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1999  A 6:45 a.m. golfers' Mass at a chapel that serves the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, N.Y., draws about 100 people. The Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, N.Y., is open to nonmembers and says attendance swells to as high as 300 on summer Fridays and Saturdays, from 75 at other times. It holds a 5:30 p.m. beach service for children. For campers, the Pennsylvania Council of Churches holds nondenominational services at 40 sites.  In Yosemite Valley, Calif., the Rev. Denis Alvernaz, pastor of Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Church, offers a Mass in a historic schoolhouse and limits his sermons to seven minutes. The Rev. David Strang of St. Paul's United Church of Christ, Crystal Lake, Ill., ties sermons to summer movies. To help vacationers find churches, Bob and Phyllis Hummel of Key Largo, Fla., in 1994 created "1-800-Masstimes," an automated list of Masses across the U.S.  Although the economy is healthy, "the average American's income continues to be allocated mostly to the necessities of life," says Lynn Franco, director of the board's consumer-research center. The study uses 1997 and 1998 data and defines discretionary income as income that is above median expenditure levels for similar households. The last time the study was done, in 1993, it used different criteria, but found that the affluent had three times as much discretionary income.
