 Pan Am 1st-Period Loss Nearly Doubled As Trans-Atlantic Passenger Traffic Fell   By By Judith Valente, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1989  Pan Am Corp., stricken by a plunge in international passenger traffic, said its first-quarter loss almost doubled.  The loss was expected, to some extent: The company predicted in its annual report last month that the decline in international passenger traffic and increased expenses would produce lower first-quarter results. Industry analysts had projected a loss of $140 million to $170 million. Some analysts nonetheless expressed surprise at the extent of the loss, because Pan Am had picked up significant passenger traffic in March as a result of the strike at Eastern Airlines.  The company said its loss reflected a 16% drop in trans-Atlantic passenger traffic in the quarter, following the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last December that resulted in the death of the 259 people on board. Pan Am estimated that accident cost it $55 million to $60 million in first-quarter revenue. "It's hard to accept that Lockerbie has been as devastating as it was," a spokesman said.
