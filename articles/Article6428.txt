 SmartMoney: Compare College-Aid Offers   By Todorova, Aleksandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2005  To get a successful review, write a letter to the school describing your unusual circumstances, and provide independent documentation, says Mr. [Mike Kantrowitz]. If mom was laid off a few months ago, attach a notice from her employer. If possible, visit the school. "When the school sees that you've taken time out of your life to meet with them in person, it makes a significant impact," says Carl Buck, vice president of financial aid for Peterson's, the education-publishing unit of Thomson Corp.  Watch out for letters that list Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) and unsubsidized Stafford loans as part of the aid package, cautions Kalman Chany, president of Campus Consultants in New York and author of "Paying for College Without Going Broke." These are non-need-based loans that any student or parent can take out, and shouldn't be considered part of need-based aid. "With some schools, it may seem like they're giving you a package for 100% of the money, but they're just giving you loans you could get anyway," he says. That's not to say the PLUS and unsubsidized Stafford loans aren't beneficial: Their interest rates are much lower than those on a private loan.
