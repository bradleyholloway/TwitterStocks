 The Daily Fix: Buckeyes Clinch Big Ten Title, Set Sights on Next Two Goals Online edition  By Carl Bialik and Jason Fry, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2007  Greg Oden (the nation's most highly touted rookie) and Daequan Cook (who scores more than a point every two minutes) are tops in scoring, but it was point guard Mike Conley Jr., a high-school classmate of Mr. Oden's, who scored the winning basket in the game's final seconds. Afterwards, Mr. Oden proudly waved a sign that read, "Conley's Basketball Squad." It might be Conley's Basketball Conference -- Wisconsin senior Alando Tucker is a player-of-the-year candidate -- but it's the OSU teenager who leads the league in assist-to-turnover ratio, assists and steals.  With so much attention heaped on where Mr. [Kevin Durant] might be heading next year, San Antonio Express-News reporter Jeff McDonald provides a welcome look at where he came from -- most notably, the tutelage of Taras Brown, nearly every day for seven years. "The program Brown instituted made boot camp look like the Macy's parade," Mr. McDonald writes. "The first rule? No pickup games. In the world of Taras Brown, pickup games were the devil's workshop. Instead, he devised an endless series of drills for the young Durant to perform. Catch-and-shoot drills. Dribbling drills. Crab walks. Duck walks. Passing drills with a medicine ball. Defensive slide drills."  Kentucky didn't trail for 39:34 of 40 minutes against Vanderbilt yesterday. But the Commodores came from behind to win, 67-65. "In seven games this year decided by five or fewer points, yesterday was UK's fifth loss," John Clay writes in the Lexington Herald-Leader. "When teams win those close games, the coaches get the credit. When teams lose those close games, the coach blames the players." Indeed, Tubby Smith attributed the late losses to his "personnel," but Mr. Clay writes that "the head coach needs only to look at himself."
