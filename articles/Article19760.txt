 Terror Inquiries Are Clouded by Global Discord; Breakdown in Cooperation Threatens Years of Work; Case of Courts vs. Military   By Keith Johnson in Madrid and David Crawford in Berlin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2004  Those differences led to the release and pending retrial last month in Germany of the only person so far convicted in connection with Sept. 11: Mounir el-Motassadeq. Earlier this year, a Hamburg court acquitted another man of providing logistical support for the cell that converged around Mohamed Atta, the lead suicide hijacker in the U.S. attacks. In both cases, the U.S. refused to allow testimony in court by Ramzi Binalshibh, a top al Qaeda operative arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and now held in an undisclosed location. Defense lawyers argued that Mr. Binalshibh could have testified that their clients weren't part of the Sept. 11 conspiracy.  Now Spanish investigators say U.S. refusal to make available information from suspects in custody is hamstringing their efforts. "We could clearly prove the Spanish role in Sept. 11 if we had real cooperation. There are literally two or three elements missing to close the case, but as it is now, all of the suspects will go free," says the Spanish official.  One tug of war in the Spanish investigation centers on U.S. reluctance to share particular evidence linking Amer el-Azizi to the Sept. 11 conspiracy, Spanish investigators say. Mr. Azizi has links to the March 11 bombing cell, as well as key al Qaeda figures around the world. He left Spain in October 2001 and is wanted by Spanish police and the FBI.
