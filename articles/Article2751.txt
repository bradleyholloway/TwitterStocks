 Delays Disclosed in FDA Process To Approve Claritin, Other Drugs   By By Chris Adams, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2000  The application for Claritin was submitted to the FDA in October 1986 and approved 77 months later -- "almost three years longer than the average 42.5 months for similarly classified" drugs, the GAO said. During those six years, Schering said the FDA needlessly delayed the approval process by rehashing debates that, Schering said, had been settled. At one point, Schering said an FDA reorganization "resulted in inefficiencies and delay when new reviewers rereviewed data that had been accepted by the first reviewers."  A major sticking point was the interpretation of safety tests and whether they showed that the drug might cause cancer in laboratory animals. While Schering thought questions about the issue were resolved early in the approval process, they resurfaced late in the proceedings. The company contends the FDA's re-evaluation of the cancer data resulted in the company "losing about four years of effective patent protection," the GAO report said. The FDA said it was "uncertain that Claritin met the safety requirements . . . and investigated the drug until they were convinced" the cancer worry was unfounded, according to the GAO.
