 A Professor Teaches How to Turn Xeroxes Into Lucrative Profits   By By Thomas Petzinger Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1998  Winchester, Mass. -- IN A STOREFRONT under a blue awning along Main Street here, Morris Shepard operates a room full of Xerox machines. But don't expect him to copy your resume or daily lunch specials. The front door is locked so the townies don't barge in.  Dr. Shepard nevertheless extracts $3 million in annual revenue from those copiers, and his growth has only begun. He accomplishes this not by making copies but by adding value in a commodity business, with methods that reveal the entrepreneurial potential of these high-tech times.  Dr. Shepard -- his friends call him Moe -- loved the classroom but hated scholarly pretensions. He could shoot off at the mouth. He had no hope of tenure. He also resented the "tyranny of textbooks," with their high prices and uneven quality. He was maddened by ill-managed bookstores, which often failed to obtain teaching materials by the first day of class.
