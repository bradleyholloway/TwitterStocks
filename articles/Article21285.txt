 Easing the Mexican Interest Burden   By By Rudiger Dornbusch and Franco Modigliani, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1989  Mexico is at a crossroads. The 1980s have been a period of economic and social instability unrivaled in the postwar period. Unlike earlier presidents, however, Miguel de la Madrid used his last year in office to leave a positive legacy even at the cost of personal popularity. Since early last year, a major stabilization has been implemented requiring widespread sacrifices. The new president, Carlos Salinas, and his extraordinary economic team augur well, offering prudent management and a chance for a return to growth and stability. But the prospects for success are threatened by the overhang of external debt.  For internal stability and cohesion, Mexican growth of output must do more than keep pace with the extraordinarily fast 3% annual growth of the labor force -- there needs to be an additional 2% to 3% growth in per-capita income. This requires a level of capital formation no less than the 20% prevailing in the 1974-84 period. But a level of investment of that magnitude is unachievable while capital imports are at a standstill and Mexico must divert a large fraction of its resources -- about 7% -- from investment to the premature transfer of interest abroad. Accordingly, the rate of investment in the past four years has fallen to only 16%.  In addition, an aura of uncertainty caused by unending negotiations about the debt and Mexico's strained ability to service debt in the immediate years ahead cast a shadow over the nation's ability to avoid a major devaluation. This uncertainty discourages the return of Mexican capital held abroad and spurs fresh capital flight, reducing further the resources available for investment.
