 Jobless Rate Declined to 5.9% In September --- Lowest Level in Eight Years Suggests Strong Growth; Factory Jobs Increased   By By Rose Gutfeld, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1987  The decline, from 6% in August, put the rate at its lowest level since November 1979, when it was also 5.9%, the Labor Department said. There was a sizable increase in manufacturing jobs as well as a rise in service jobs. The 132,000-job rise in total non-farm payrolls was modest, but that figure would look stronger if the employment total included some 65,000 teachers and support workers who were out of work because of labor disputes.  The rise in business payrolls followed a revised increase of 152,000 in August. Previously the Labor Department put the August figure at 156,000. Manufacturing jobs grew by 56,000, with gains widespread among industries, after a 22,000-job increase in August. Factory employment in September reached its highest level since August 1985.  The factory work-week fell to 40.4 hours last month from 41 in August, with overtime down to 3.6 hours from 3.8. Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told Congress's Joint Economic Committee, however, the declines stemmed from the late Labor Day holiday, which this year occurred in the week the department took its employment survey. She said that "labor market developments remain encouraging."
