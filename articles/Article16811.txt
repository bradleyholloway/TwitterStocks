 Crude Futures Rebound to Top $81 a Barrel   By Landau, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2007  GOLD: Futures rose as the U.S. dollar gave up initial gains. Position-squaring ahead of today's jobs data was another factor. Analysts said the shuttering of Harmony Gold Mining Co.'s South African mine where thousands of miners were trapped temporarily didn't have much immediate affect on prices. Nearby October gold on the Comex division of Nymex gained $8.50 to $737.80 an ounce.  In determining whether oil prices are likely to stay above $80 a barrel, the immediate focus for the market will be the September U.S. employment report, set for release today. Strong employment numbers would initially support oil prices but might later "dash hopes of interest-rate cuts" and send a negative signal for oil, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
