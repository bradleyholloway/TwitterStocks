 Pfizer Makes Aid Pledge, Breaks Aid Pact   By Hensley, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2003  The licensing deal for Rescriptor, known generically as delavirdine, was hailed as path-breaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where it was unveiled in January by officials from Pharmacia and its not-for-profit partners. Later that day, during a panel discussion on intellectual property, Henry McKinnell, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, supported the concept, according to people who attended the session. In a written statement at the time, Pfizer said it welcomed Pharmacia's "innovative initiative" but would evaluate it further after completing their merger.  Rescriptor's limitations were well known from the beginning, says Joachim Oehler, chief executive of the Concept Foundation. "This is hypocrisy," he says of Pfizer's decision. Nobody at Pharmacia or the aid organizations, he says, considered Rescriptor's drawbacks serious enough to impede creation of a new model for humanitarian aid. Indeed, he pointed out that Pfizer announced in July that it would provide Rescriptor free or at deep discounts to state AIDS programs for the poor in the U.S.  Michael Friedman, a former Pharmacia executive, says Rescriptor is a "good drug but not a perfect drug." Now president of City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, Calif., Dr. Friedman helped construct the licensing deal and then, with a merger in the works, tried to persuade Pfizer to pursue it. "We knew the conduct of this experiment would depend on the enthusiasm, support and leadership of Pfizer staff," he says. "I hoped that we had addressed their questions."
