 Centennial Journal: 100 Years in Business --- A Hot Time in the Old Tub Tonight, 1968   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1989  ROY JACUZZI DISPLAYED HIS WHIRLPOOL bath in June 1968 at the Orange County, Calif., fair, and bathrooms were never the same.  His design was a descendant of a 1956 device that had been created by Jacuzzi Brothers to give Roy's cousin hydrotherapy treatment for arthritis. That early model was like a small portable outboard boat engine that fit on the side of the tub and stirred the bathwater. It was a new product for a farm pump company founded in 1915 by Roy's grandfather and six great-uncles who had come from Italy.
