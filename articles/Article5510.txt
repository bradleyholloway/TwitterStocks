 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The President and the Boy Scouts   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1993  Every four years the Boy Scouts of America hold a Jamboree traditionally capped by a visit from the President of the United States or his stand-in. And most Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt on have made it their business to find time to speak to the young members of this now venerable institution. Not this time.  The Boy Scouts is an organization now considered "controversial" in the circles that Mr. Clinton travels in because of its ban on homosexual troop leaders. This week the Scouts weren't privileged to receive a visit from the President or his representative. The White House's explanation -- Scouts' honor -- was that scheduling problems precluded Mr. Clinton's attendance at the event, held in Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. That left the National Scout Jamboree with the President's appointed stand-in, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Late Monday, Mr. Babbitt also canceled.  Spokesmen for the Boy Scouts of America have courteously declined to make any negative public comment about the shabby treatment accorded them. Messrs. Clinton and Babbitt and their staffs could profit by the example set by the Scouts. Among other requirements, the organization's rules state, "A Scout is polite to everyone regardless of age or position."
