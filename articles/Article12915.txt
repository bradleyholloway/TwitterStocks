 The SARS Outbreak: WHO Looks Beyond Beijing in SARS Fight --- Outbreak Appears to Be Too Advanced Near Capital To Be Rooted Out Easily   By By Peter Wonacott and Charles Hutzler in Beijing and Karen Richardson in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2003  While other countries and territories seem to be gaining the upper hand on the disease, China still is battling to contain an outbreak of unknown dimensions. The world-wide death toll from SARS -- 465 so far -- is minuscule compared with other infectious scourges, but it's that unknown dimension that is worrisome. The outbreak already appears to be too advanced in two rural provinces near Beijing -- Shanxi and Inner Mongolia -- to be rooted out easily.  China has reported a total 4,280 SARS cases, adding 160 probable patients yesterday. Shanxi and neighboring Inner Mongolia have 360 and 230 cases, respectively. Beijing reported 98 new cases and three deaths in the city yesterday, among the 160 new cases and nine fatal cases reported nationwide.  In the U.S., the number of probable SARS cases rose to 65 yesterday from 41 on April 25, but there have been no deaths, and only six of the cases have been definitively labeled as SARS by lab tests.
