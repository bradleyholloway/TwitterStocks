 Wonder Land: It's Not the Economy, Stupid   By Henninger, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2007  I could be wrong. Two weeks ago, Mike Bloomberg's turn in the center of the political conversation came when he divested the GOP and declared to a group of Google employees out West, "Whoever out of those 20 becomes president I think has to do something about a country that I think is really in trouble." The trouble, as the mayor sees it, has to do with the country's "reputation" and its "go-it-alone mentality."  The generalization that emerges from the Post survey's data is that independent voters (this includes Democratic and Republican leaners) have deep concerns about . . . everything. Combining those who say an issue is "extremely important" to them or "very important" puts the totals well above 50% for health care, the economy, terrorism, immigration, taxes, corruption and of course "the situation" in Iraq, with a combined 89% importance ranking, most of it negative.  This isn't an endorsement for [Rudy Giuliani]. It's an explanation for why this candidate, despite the presumed baggage, has polled strongly for months. In his meeting with us, Mr. Giuliani said something else unexpected: "George Bush's speech on September 20, 2001 is still the best road map for what to do about terrorism."
