 Senate, House Hearings to Assess U.S. Management of Intelligence   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2003  Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that without a full-scale investigation by the intelligence committee, other congressional panels should launch their own. "Regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction are found in Iraq or not, the issue of whether U.S. intelligence was shaded or embellished is critically important," Mr. Levin said. "If the United States is to gain international support for taking military action in the future, particularly pre-emptive action, the evidence the U.S. offers to back up its action must be totally reliable and trustworthy and be seen as such."
