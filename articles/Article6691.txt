 What's Behind the Stock Market Jitters?   By Gregory Zuckerman and Jaclyne Badal, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  In some ways, yields on U.S. bonds are simply keeping up with global bonds -- yields on European and Japanese bonds all have moved up in the last month. In the past, the fact that U.S. inflation is still running at a tame rate of about 2% might not have forced up U.S. bond yields. But the U.S. imports more than it exports and it has to borrow funds from abroad to pay for the difference. So yields on U.S. bonds must stay competitive with those abroad to keep attracting foreign investors.  The prognosis for stocks rests partly on the outlook for bond yields. And some observers say there is little cause for alarm. Martin Barnes, managing editor of Bank Credit Analyst in Montreal, argues that U.S. rates won't surge because the U.S. economy is too weak, and the housing market too troubled, to justify much higher yields. He also thinks inflation could ease a bit in the months ahead.  One that analysts are warming to and which still appears reasonably priced: Allianz, the huge Munich-based insurance and financial- services company that trades in the U.S. under the symbol AZ. Allianz is seeing continued strength in its property-and-casualty insurance business, and its U.S. life-insurance unit is stabilizing. The stock is up more than 50% in the past year, but Allianz still trades at an attractive price/earnings ratio of 9 times its estimated earnings for the next 12 months. Analysts have raised their earnings estimates for 2007 by more than 20% in just the past 12 weeks.
