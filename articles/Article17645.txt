 TV Preview: Yuks, Drugs, Geishas   By By Martha Bayles, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  Friday, Sept. 5, 12:30-2 a.m. EDT, on NBC: "Friday Night Videos." Here's your chance to see NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff in action, as he co-hosts the network's music video show with comedian Jay Leno. According to the press release, Mr. Leno will be taking satirical jabs at TV in general, and NBC in particular. Since he signed an exclusive long-term contract with the network last June, we can expect the jabs to be somewhat blunted.  Sunday, Sept. 7, 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on HBO (additional play dates include: Sept. 11, 16, 24, 29): "Yuri Nosenko, KGB." Based on the still-unresolved case of Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer who defected in 1964, this gem of a film manages to dramatize the case without resolving it. Nosenko (played by the Russian emigre actor Oleg Rudnik) claims to have useful information about KGB infiltration of the CIA, as well as the inside word on Lee Harvey Oswald's connection with the Soviets. Tommy Lee Jones plays the CIA agent who makes contact with Nosenko, and then -- because of inconsistencies in Nosenko's story and his disavowal of any KGB links with Oswald -- decides that he is a plant. On the psychological level, the film lacks depth. But it's compelling nevertheless, because both actors keep us guessing, and because the visual execution is so remarkable. It could be the first made-for-TV movie shot in black and white, and it's brilliantly done.
