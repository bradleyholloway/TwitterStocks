 Firms Facing Rule To Include Results From Minor Stakes   By By Elizabeth MacDonald, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1999  Although most companies must include profits or losses from certain minority holdings in their earnings, currently there is no requirement that they include other results, such as revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. Accounting professionals have argued that some companies deliberately avoid consolidating results by owning less than 50% of the voting stock in an entity, even though they effectively control it by hiring and firing management.  Specifically, the FASB proposal would force companies that "control" the "policies" and "management" of minority-held entities to add more of the companies' financial results to their own consolidated statements, according to Ronald Bossio, a senior project manager at FASB. The proposal also provides guidelines as to what constitutes control, which isn't spelled out in the current rules, he said. If adopted, the rule would take effect after Dec. 15, 1999.
