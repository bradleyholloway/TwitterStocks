 Overstock.com, Nuance Advance; Globalstar Plunges   By Curran, Rob, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  Losses mounted for several gaming issues as the earnings season proved unlucky for some. One negative influence was the fourth-quarter report from large-cap Las Vegas Sands, which was disappointed with its operations in Macau, a lucrative Chinese casino market. WMS Industries, which projected fiscal third-quarter revenue short of Wall Street expectations, fell 99 cents, or 2.5%, to $39.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. Multimedia Games fell 28 cents, or 2.7%, to 10.03.  Overstock.com rose 3.24, or 22%, to 17.90. First Albany boosted its rating on shares of the Salt Lake City online discount retailer to "neutral from sell," saying a "modest selloff" after a wide earnings miss Monday indicated the share price had reached its lowest ebb.
