 Smog Swapping: New Rules Harness Power of Free Markets To Curb Air Pollution --- Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, Firms Can Trade Credits To Emit Sulfur Dioxide --- Trading Futures on Vapors   By By Jeffrey Taylor, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1992  Actually, Mobil is helping usher in a new era in environmental protection. For about $3 million, Mobil's refinery here recently acquired pollution "credits" from the nearby city of South Gate, Calif. South Gate had acquired the credits from General Motors Corp., which closed a plant there in 1985 and sold the city the property. The Torrance refinery will be emitting far less additional pollution than did General Motors.  Commodities exchanges such as the Board of Trade are competing to run legally sanctioned markets that would trade rights to emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and reactive vapors like those emitted by Mobil's holding tanks. Utilities, refineries and manufacturers would buy and sell pollution rights, which are supposed to ease the transition to increasingly stringent emission limits. And investors will be able to use the instruments to speculate on the price of eliminating smog.  Southern California's air-quality regulator, struggling to reduce pollution that regularly violates federal health standards, is now developing markets in each of the three pollutants most responsible for smog. "Previous emission-trading programs, including the sulfur-dioxide program, are like playing checkers," says Joseph Goffman, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, who helped write the Clean Air Act. "What they're doing in California is more like elevating it to chess."
