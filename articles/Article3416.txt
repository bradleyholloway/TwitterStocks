 Opera: A Raw, Seething `Nabucco'   By By Heidi Waleson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2001  The first half of the opera was the most fun, as all the raging principals roared onstage, bellowing at each other and the audience. Bass Samuel Ramey, as Zaccaria, High Priest of the Hebrews, was pitted against baritone Juan Pons, as the conquering Nabucco. Mr. Ramey pumped out his customarily sonorous tones as he rallied his folk in the Temple; Mr. Pons sounded occasionally rough and dry, but he was properly tyrannical. Things flagged a little in the second half, once Nabucco was driven mad by a bolt from heaven for daring to proclaim himself God. Verdi didn't yet have pathos down quite as well as fury. Indeed, both the opera's religious miracles -- in the second, Nabucco renounces Baal in favor of Jehovah and gets his marbles back -- are entertaining rather than imposing.  Cantata 82 was both more literal and less cohesive. Ms. [Lorraine Hunt Lieberson] was cast as a terminally ill patient dressed in a hospital gown and socks, with an oxygen tube and intravenous lines attached to her face and arms. She sang most of the first aria, "Ich habe genug," flat on her back, a feat in itself. But the staging looked like an idea that hadn't been thought out entirely. It repeated some of the gestures from Cantata 199, and they seemed less powerful the second time around. It also had several awkward features: Getting up and down from the floor in the short gown looked difficult, and the principal source of illumination, a large bare bulb held above Ms. Lieberson's head by a black-clad male dancer, was blinding to the audience. One understood its symbolic importance -- Ms. Lieberson kept grasping for it -- but it was distracting. Her expressive singing was quite enough to show us the route into the next world. No extra hints were necessary.
