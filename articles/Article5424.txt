 Advertising: Experts Say Borden Has Milked Elsie the Cow for All She's Worth   By Goldman, Kevin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1992  Some marketing experts argue that Borden's move to revive its Elsie the cow symbol after a retirement of some 20 years may be too little, too late.

Borden fired the advertising firms of Tracy-Locke and M&H Advertising, and hired Grey Advertising and Saatchi & Saatchi's CME KHBB.
