 OTC Focus -- Small Investors Face Challenge By Institutions   By By Priscilla Ann Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1986  Big institutions that dominate trading on the New York Stock Exchange used to leave most small over-the-counter stocks for individual investors. No more.  But for individuals looking for short-term profits from genuinely underpriced stocks, the growing institutional investment in smaller OTC issues isn't good news. Small investors who think they're discovering promising little companies in obscure market niches may be surprised to find that some institutional bully has already staked out that territory.  Take the ice cream business, for example. Many people might expect an OTC company like Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. to have attracted much less institutional interest than a company like Borden Inc., the big food, dairy and chemical corporation traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But institutions own 51% of Dreyer's shares and only 41% of Borden's stock.
