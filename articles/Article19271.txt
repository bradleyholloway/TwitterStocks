 Treasury Prices Advance, Helped by Plunge In Tech Stocks but Capped by Labor Data Fears   By By John Parry and Sonoko Setaishi, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2000  Late yesterday, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 10/32 point, or $3.125 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 106 3/32. Its yield fell to 5.810% from 5.831% Friday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. Yesterday's was the lowest 30-year yield since May.  Treasurys opened lower as investors took profits after last week's gains. The market then fell further as the monthly National Association of Purchasing Management survey of manufacturing suggested that activity in that sector remained robust, with prices continuing to rise.  "The rise in the prices index may be disconcerting to some, but it is no more than a reflection of the rise in oil prices," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at New York-based research firm High Frequency Economics. The pricespaid component of NAPM's index is likely to decline next month, he said.
