 Getting Going: It's Time to Be Tax Smart -- for Next Year   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  In fact, you might be able to fund a tax-deductible IRA for 2006, cut the tax bill that's payable by April 16 -- and then put your refund toward your 2007 IRA contribution. Even if you don't qualify for a tax-deductible IRA, you may be eligible for a Roth IRA, which will give you tax-free growth. In both 2006 and 2007, the maximum IRA contribution is $4,000, unless you are age 50 or older, in which case you can sock away $5,000.  As an added bonus, your IRA will allow you to tap into market sectors that aren't available in your 401(k). "If you have an IRA, you can buy any asset class you like," notes Glenn Frank, a financial planner in Waltham, Mass. "Rarely have I seen REITs as an option in a 401(k) plan. You also won't see emerging markets, small-cap international or high-yield bonds."  Next, create a folder for the 2007 tax year and use it to store tax- related information such as charitable contributions, estimated tax payments, IRA contributions and property-tax payments. "Anything that could possibly be a taxable activity, put it in there," Mr. O'[Keefe] suggests. "Then, at the end of the year, you don't have to go hunting for it."
