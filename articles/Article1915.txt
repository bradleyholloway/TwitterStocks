 Judge Bars Campbell, Concern From Selling Research Tax Shelters   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1988  A federal judge has found that Allen F. Campbell and his company, A.F. Campbell & Co., should be enjoined from promoting research and development tax shelters that may have cost the government as much as $60 million in tax revenue.  In a 36-page decision, U.S. Judge A. Joe Fish wrote that Mr. Campbell grossly overvalued the research contracts he sold and made false and fraudulent statements about the contracts, which were sold through a Brazilian entity known as Coral.
