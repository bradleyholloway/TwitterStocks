The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2003  THE FED ISN'T ALTERING its intention to keep rates low for many months, despite recent upbeat economic news. Fed officials are focused on underutilized industrial capacity and high unemployment, factors that raise concerns that inflation could fall further. Separately, economists surveyed nudged up forecasts for first-quarter GDP growth to a 4.1% annual rate.  The U.S. trade gap widened to $41.27 billion in September due to a surge in imports, but U.S. exports also rose sharply.  Commodities: Oil futures $31.90 a barrel, $0.57; Dow Jones-AIG futures 129.233, 0.758; DJ-AIG spot 166.053, 1.348.
