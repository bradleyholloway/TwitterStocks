 Lenovo's Net Soars on Cost Cuts, Sales Push   By Luk, Lorraine, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2007  In April, the company began cutting jobs and moving some U.S. jobs to cheaper locations in a bid to save US$100 million for the fiscal year ending March 2008. The affected workers represented about 5% of Lenovo's global work force.  Since Lenovo acquired International Business Machines Corp.'s PC division two years ago for US$1.25 billion, it has been aggressively cutting costs to be more competitive in the cutthroat PC industry.  Goldman Sachs, however, warned that Lenovo's profitability in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the Asian-Pacific region seems to be weakening "despite top-line gains, implying fierce competition and greater margin pressure there."
