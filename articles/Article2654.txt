 United Air to Commit $5 Million to Promote Galileo's Web Site   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1999  The agreement, which takes effect Jan. 1, also reaffirms Galileo's role as host of United's internal reservations systems and as provider of Web booking services to United, including at ual.com. United owns 17% of Galileo. While United's long-term goal is to develop a reservation system that can host the internal reservations for itself and all the airline members of its Star Alliance, a United spokesman said the carrier is content for now to continue letting Galileo continue to host its reservations.
