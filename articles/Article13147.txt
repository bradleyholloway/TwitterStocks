 Employers Improve 401(k) Options Amid Poor Results   By Whitehouse, Kaja, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2005  The use of internal investment committees to review and monitor investments rose by 25 percentage points to 64% in 2004, according to the survey, sponsored by Deloitte Consulting and Pensions and Investments magazine. Meanwhile, the use of outside investment consultants to help select 401(k) plan investments rose by 10 percentage points in 2004 to 45%, the survey said.  Plan sponsors also seemed to be lacking in their understanding of 401(k) plan fees. While 88% said they have a clear understanding of the fees being charged to the plan, only 57% said they have a clear understanding of the revenue-sharing arrangements that record keepers and retirement-plan brokers often have with mutual-fund companies. Revenue-sharing payments are typically made to induce an investment provider to sell a particular group's products. The practice has come under fire from state and federal regulators in recent years, amid concerns that such polices can taint investment recommendations.
