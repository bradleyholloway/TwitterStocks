 Number of Imperiled Farm Banks Fell By 19% Last Fall From Summer Level   By By Scott Kilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1988  The number of imperiled U.S. farm banks dropped 19% last fall from the summer, the strongest signal yet that rural banks are pulling out of their deep slump.  Many agricultural lenders expect a recovery this year. Hefty government payments to farmers and rising crop prices are making it easier for farmers to catch-up with delinquent loans. Moreover, a rebound in demand for farm land is helping banks get rid of their repossessed real estate.  Yet rural bank earnings are seen rising only slowly. While many banks have finished charging off much of their bad loans against earnings, they face another problem. Few farmers are showing much interest in taking out new loans, the major source of income for most country banks. That is forcing many banks to park their cash in low-paying government securities and thrift accounts.
