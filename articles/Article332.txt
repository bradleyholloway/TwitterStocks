Kauffman, Kansas City, Mo., is matriculating for its seventh annual Kauffman Fellows Program. Fellows get schooling and, more important, on-site work at a venture-capital firm.

So far, there have been 62 Kauffman fellows, 85% of whom have gone on to become professional VC-ers, according to the center. High-profile graduates include Jason Green (inaugural class of 1994), now a general partner at U.S. Venture Partners.
