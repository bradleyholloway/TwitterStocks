 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2007  Techtronic Industries Co., the Hong Kong power-tools maker that acquired the Hoover floor-care business earlier this year from Whirlpool Corp., said it will close the main campus and some manufacturing operations of the vacuum-cleaner business by fall, resulting in 750 job cuts in Ohio. A Hoover distribution center and a vacuum-bag assembly plant in the area will remain open, but the local manufacturing work will be consolidated into Hoover manufacturing operations in El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico, the company said.
