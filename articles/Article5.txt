FAIRFIELD, Conn., Nov. 22â€” It takes a brave choreographer and an even braver dance company to produce a three-act narrative ballet these days, though there are signs of a return to such elaborate fare. It takes an even braver choreographer to set a work to the music of Gilbert and Sullivan.  Daryl Gray matches that deadly jolly duo joke for joke and beat for beat. But Mr. Gray's ''Pirates! The Ballet,'' performed by the Queensland Ballet on Friday night at the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University, is also enjoyably giddy and a compelling introduction to a very charming ballet company.  Currently on an American debut tour, the Queensland was founded in 1960 by an Australian-trained dancer and choreographer, Charles Lisner, in what was then the cultural wasteland of Brisbane. The troupe, the oldest ballet company in Australia, has something of the intimacy, ready energy and genial personality of the early Joffrey Ballet, and in fact began life as a hardy little touring group like the Joffrey.  The Queensland style is notable for its refreshing lack of mannerisms and its clean, clear classical technique, most visible in the dancers' precise footwork and nicely shaped, tapering feet. Given that this performance came at the end of a long tour, the performers' look of freshness and buoyancy was particularly impressive.  Their projection is broad, possibly because of the company's frequent appearances in small towns throughout Australia. But there was very little of the sort of mugging one might have expected with Gilbert and Sullivan as a guide.  Mr. Gray tells the story of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' straightforwardly, and he is much helped by a similar directness in his performers. As Frederic, the lovelorn young pirate-in-training, Josef Vesely managed to be dashing in both a 1990's and a period way. He was endearing in his moments of comical earnestness, as when Frederic tore around the lovely Mabel, circling her wide-eyed as if to study a newfound species from a safe initial distance.  Dione Ware was delectable as Mabel, a round-cheeked and cheeky young woman who knows her worth and enjoys watching others learn it. Anthony Lewis was a rubber-bodied Sergeant of Police who combined the physical techniques of silent movie comedians and Michael Jackson to fine comic effect. Anthony Shearsmith was a lovable, spry little rooster of a Major General Stanley.  The occasional thinness of the choreography was most evident in moments when Benita Whalley as the nurse, Ruth, and Julian Lankshear, as the Pirate King, were forced to mime long passages of busy gestural recitative. Only toward the end did Mr. Gray give his young leads sustained virtuosic dancing, in a grand pas de deux that soared with high, flowing lifts.  Four singers were ingeniously woven into the ballet to sing to taped orchestral accompaniment, playing audience members who sometimes interacted slyly with the dancers. Spirited and good-natured, they were Geoffrey Ashenden, Celia Mylne, Mark Penman and Susan Lorette Dunn.
