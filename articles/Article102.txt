NEW ORLEANS, April 8â€” Louisiana businessmen, civic leaders and politicians said today they had collected at least $14.4 million in pledges over the past four days in an effort to keep New Orleans from losing the 1984 World's Fair.  ''We feel confident that we have reached our goal of raising a minimum of $26 million in guarantees,'' said Floyd Lewis, president and chief executive officer of Middle South Utilities, who is chairman of the Louisiana World Exposition Inc., an organization of formed in 1976 to bring the fair to that state.  A frantic, last-minute scramble for financial backers began after an unexpected announcement Friday by Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige, at a meeting here, that the $11.6 million raised through last week was not enough to insure the fair's financial health. He said that a total of $26 million in pledges had to be raised by today before his department would give its approval to New Orleans as the 1984 exposition site.  The Commerce Department was scheduled to announce its decision of the New Orleans application last Wednesday. The deadline was extended to last Friday and later changed to today. If Mr. Baldrige approves the proposal, it would go to President Reagan and from there to the Bureau of International Expositions for consideration at a meeting in Paris next Wednesday. The 1984 exposition site is scheduled to be announced April 22. New Orleans is the only city seeking to hold the fair that year and the international organization has already given its tentative approval to the city. A Lot of Money in Short Period  ''It's been a tremendous undertaking,'' said Petr Spurney, general manager of the Louisiana World Exposition. Mr. Spurney left for Washington today to deliver the written and verbal pledges to the Commerce Department. ''It's phenomenal - and an awful lot of money in a short period of time,'' he said.  Mr. Spurney said last night in explaining Mr. Baldrige's unexpectedly stringent financial requirement, that when the Commerce Secretary assumed office; ''He found that prior world fairs were plagued with problems and one of those problems was financial security.''  The pledges of financial aid have come, Mr. Spurney said, primarily from businesses such as energy companies, hotels, and utility companies, ''many of the firms that do major business in the state.''  As the pledge money was being solicited, the New Orleans City Council voted to ask the state's Legislature to approve a special tax district for the proposed exposition site and to allocate $2.5 million to help subsidize it. State Against Idea of Fair  The State of Louisiana has fought the city's proposal since 1974 on economic grounds. An 80-@ to 90-acre warehouse district in downtown New Orleans along the Mississippi River has been designated as the fair's location.
