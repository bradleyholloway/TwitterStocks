 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1995  As the 104th Congress convenes today with the GOP in command for the first time in 40 years, Republicans planned bold steps to slash the federal government's scope. The focus will be on the House, where Speaker Gingrich has promised a "change-oriented, risk-taking, gutsy" leadership that will oversee a 100-day push to fulfill promises in the GOP "Contract With America." In the Senate, Majority Leader Dole was set to launch a two-front attack on Clinton's foreign policy, by proposing legislation that could overturn the U.S. approach in Bosnia and complicate Haiti operations.  Because of the slim GOP majoritiesa 230-204 House advantage and 54-46 in the Senate-Democrats are well-positioned to slow things down through floor opposition and the presidential veto.  Russians bombarded the capital of breakaway Chechnya with rockets and artillery shells, setting off huge fires in Grozny. The Russians, who were repulsed from the city's center Monday, seemed poised for a new ground assault. In Moscow, former reform chief Gaidar warned that Russia was facing the threat of authoritarian rule.
