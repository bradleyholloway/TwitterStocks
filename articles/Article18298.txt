 Critique: Sinister Stamp Put on Elvis and NEA   By By Raymond Sokolov, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1992  The U.S. Postal Service is gearing up to produce an Elvis Presley commemorative. This ticked off Washington Post columnist Jonathan Yardley, who thinks The King is a poor choice for such an honor. On Monday, Mr. Yardley dredged up every revolting thing he could about The Pelvis's drug-besotted later years. Clearly Mr. Yardley is not much of a rock fan and doesn't give Elvis's musical achievements the same weight he would give the higher-browed work of such swine as Richard Wagner or Ezra Pound.  Mr. Yardley is, of course, perfectly entitled to diss Elvis and the Postal Service. Yet he misses a couple of fundamental points. He is, of course, aware that the sole requirement of a commemorative honoree is that she or he have been dead for 10 years. But numerous alleged sightings of The King in recent months have convinced a growing throng of Americans that their singing idol is still among us. Even a brain-damaged lefty like me doesn't really believe it, but many of our fellow citizens do. How will these people feel when they walk into a post office next month and discover that a federal agency wants them to vote on which of two Presley images will join Benjamin Franklin and Louisa May Alcott in the philatelic pantheon?  I think it will irk them. Some zealots of the Living Elvis may even perform acts of civil disobedience against the Postal Service for its sacrilege. Mr. Yardley could find himself joined by some rude and unwelcome companions in the crusade against the Elvis stamp. Come May, he will wish he had looked at this matter from a higher plane, in the light of Eternity, just as a left-hander with the chill of the end of days on his neck. I mean that Mr. Yardley will come to see that the Elvis stamp, travesty or not, is only a small part of the aesthetic sinkhole that our Postal Service has become. This is my second point.
