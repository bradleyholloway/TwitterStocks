 OPEC Discord Seen Limiting Policy Options --- Big Producers Want Flood Of Oil; Others Seek Cuts As Group Meets on Crisis   By By Youssef M. Ibrahim, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1986  But growing discord within OPEC could severely limit its options in acting as a group. While Saudi Arabia and other big Arab oil producers gear up to flood world markets with cheap oil, smaller OPEC producers -- some nearly bankrupt -- are demanding sharp cutbacks in output, chiefly to replenish their treasuries.  Oil industry sources here to observe the meeting say that unless OPEC slashes output by three million barrels immediately, prices soon may drop close to the $15 level. But the animosities within OPEC, and the policy of high production recently promulgated by Saudi Arabia, appear to negate chances of a production accord at the meeting.  Meetings are being held here among OPEC economists, statisticians and other experts proposing policy for the group's oil ministers. In those sessions, Libya, Algeria and Iran have demanded that OPEC reverse its decision of last December to go after a larger share of world oil markets regardless of the downward pressure this puts on prices. The three specifically have blamed the current price collapse on Saudi Arabia's decision to more than double its October output of about two million barrels a day.
