 Bookshelf: Among Movers and Shakers   By By James B. Stewart, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  Let's start with the narrator and main character. Jack Broderick works as a Hollywood screenwriter, but, as a scion of one of America's richest families, he doesn't need the money. He labors in the illusion industry, but he is blessed -- he might say cursed -- with at least some ability to distinguish between illusion and reality.  Jack's father, Hugh, is a self-made patriarch with vast and largely frustrated ambitions for his offspring. He brings to mind Joseph Kennedy. Indeed, many of the characters and incidents resemble the real people and events that have defined America's public consciousness since the '60s, when the novel begins. Besides the Kennedy allusions, there's Jane Fonda, Vietnam, Dan White, Central America, Eldridge Cleaver, political assassinations, and the plight of the farm workers, all woven together in a story that moves cinematically backward and forward through time.  One element of continuity in this passing show is Leah, a Jewish political activist lawyer who meets Jack, marries and divorces him, then sleeps with his aging father, and who also has an ongoing but apparently unrequited love affair with Jack's older brother "Bro," a Roman Catholic priest.
