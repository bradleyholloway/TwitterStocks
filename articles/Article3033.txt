 Apple Gives High-End Line Two Chips   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2002  Apple has another motivation, Mr. [Tim Bajarin] says. The PowerPC G4 chips used in the Macintosh, made by Motorola Inc., have fallen behind the Intel Corp. chips used on most other PCs, at least by a heavily promoted measure known as clock speed. Intel's fastest Pentium 4 chip is rated at 2.53 gigahertz, compared with 1.25 gigahertz for the fastest chip in Apple's new machines. Mr. [Steve Jobs] contends that clock-speed comparisons understate the PowerPC chips' computing power, but agrees that dual-processing helps Apple's competitive position.
