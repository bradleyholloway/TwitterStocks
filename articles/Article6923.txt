 Entertainment -- The Weekend Adviser: TV Fetes 'Raymond' and Ponders What's Next; CBS Hunts for a Comedy, David McCullough's '1776,' And Jazz From a Sax Whiz   By Spencer, Jane, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2005  Also out soon: In Michael Connelly's latest noir-ish thriller, "The Closers," Los Angeles Police Department detective Harry Bosch, the hero of Mr. Connelly's 2004 best seller "The Narrows," comes out of retirement to tackle an unsolved case involving the murder of a 16- year-old girl. Mr. Connelly, a former Los Angeles Times crime reporter, is known for sophisticated high-velocity thrillers that incorporate contemporary social issues into the plotlines.  Mr. [Joe Lovano]'s new studio album, "Joyous Encounter," is a sequel of sorts to his 2004 album of low-key ballads, "I'm All For You." It was recorded with the same quartet, featuring George Mraz on bass, Paul Motion on drums and 86-year-old Hank Jones on piano. The new album includes covers of John Coltrane's "Crescent" and Oliver Nelson's "Six and Four."  That is the driving comic premise of his new movie, "Kicking & Screaming," a movie parodying hypercompetitive parents who treat their kids' soccer games like World Cup matches. Mr. [Ferrell] plays Phil Weston, a dad determined to coach his son's soccer team without getting hung up on winning. The producer got the idea after watching Mr. Ferrell berate a kid as part of a "Saturday Night Live" skit. Mr. Ferrell will return to "Saturday Night Live" this weekend as the host.
