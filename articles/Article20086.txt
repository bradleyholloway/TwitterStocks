 Super Bowl XLI -- and Other Market Oracles   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2007  The Dow has advanced in the third year of every presidential cycle since Franklin D. Roosevelt led the U.S. into World War II. (If you go back to the Dow's inception, the accuracy rate is 81%.) Since this is year three of George W. Bush's second term, the stock market is due for a boost.  This indicator doesn't guarantee a steady upward climb for the year. Remember October 1987's "Black Monday"? On that day in the third year of Ronald Reagan's second term, the Dow industrials fell more than 500 points -- a stunning 23%. The average did recover, but only enough to post a 2% gain for the year.  The inconvenient truth: Warm temperatures in December led to a snowless Christmas in Boston. That's bad news according to the Boston Snow indicator, which says a white Christmas in Beantown foretells a strong year for stocks. This predictor, sometimes disparaged as the B.S. indicator, is credited to staffers at Wall Street's defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert, who said that they found that the average market gain following a Christmas with snow on the ground was about 80% greater than that of years without snow.
