 Is Mexico Ready Now To Dig Up a Dictator And Repatriate Him? --- Porfirio Diaz Lies in Paris, But a Relative Finds Hope As the PRI Leaves Power   By By Peter Fritsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  "Political change is reshaping how we Mexicans view our past," says historian Lorenzo Meyer. He points to the gestures of rapprochement made by newly minted President Vicente Fox Quesada toward the Catholic Church, long considered an enemy by the PRI. "While [Don Porfirio] was one of the great traitors to democracy in Mexico, to bring him back and at least recognize him for his contributions would be an act of democratic maturity never possible under the PRI."  "Now that the PRI is gone, it's time Mexicans acknowledge Don Porfirio's accomplishments," says Mexican aristocrat Mary Bannister de Sloane, a friend of Mr. Diaz Pizarro. Her great-uncle was John Body, chief engineer to Weetman Pearson, Britain's first Lord Cowdray. The S. Pearson & Sons construction company made its name and stunning profits from Don Porfirio's public works (the Cowdray coat of arms features a Mexican peon). Today, Pearson PLC owns the Financial Times and Penguin books, among other enterprises.  Still, official Mexico so far has shown little interest in sponsoring the return of [Porfirio Diaz]. Letters from Mr. Diaz Pizarro to just-departed President Ernesto Zedillo weren't answered. Undeterred, Mr. Diaz Pizarro has approached Martha Latapi Fox, President Fox's aunt, hoping she can put in a good word with her nephew. He thought she might be sympathetic since she lives on land that was once part of Don Porfirio's imperial properties. Says Mrs. Latapi: Mr. Diaz Pizarro "called to tell me about his auction, but I'm an old woman who doesn't need any more things in the house."
