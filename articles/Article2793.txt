 Bill to spur Alaska oil exports is boon to Gulf of Mexico   By Reifenberg, Anne; Sullivan, Allanna, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1995  The Alaska Power Administration Sale Act, which ended the 22-year prohibition against selling Alaskan crude to foreigners, was a boon to the companies that pull oil and gas from the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A rider attached to the bill excuses deep-water gulf drillers from making federal royalty payments in the early days of their projects. Liberation from those payments promises to mean a lot more to US petroleum companies than permission to export crude from Alaska.
