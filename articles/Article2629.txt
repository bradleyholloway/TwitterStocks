 Jakarta Appears to Give on Peacekeepers --- Indonesia Assures the U.N. It Won't Block Australia; Its Own Role Is Unclear   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Jeremy Wagstaff in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Neil King Jr. in Washington., The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1999  With all sides emphasizing the need to act quickly, Indonesia assured the United Nations that it would put no conditions on an international peacekeeping force meant to bring order to East Timor.  The assurance by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas damped fears that Indonesia might try to block Australia's place in a multinational force, thus slowing a mission that officials hope will deploy in days. Australia is prepared to lead the force to the former Portuguese colony, where pro-Indonesia militias have been on a rampage since an independence vote two weeks ago.  After discussions in New York with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Mr. Alatas said it was the U.N.'s job to determine the composition of the peacekeeping force and that Indonesia was ready to cede responsibility for security in East Timor to the international body, though it still preferred that Asian countries take the lead and that Australia's role be limited.
