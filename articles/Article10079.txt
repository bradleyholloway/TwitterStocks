 Kazakhs Ratchet Up Pressure on Eni Over Oil Field; Government Wants Joint Role in Project On Caspian Sea   By Gabriel Kahn and Liam Moloney, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  Kazakhstan's new prime minister, Karim Masimov, said yesterday that state energy company KazMunaiGaz should become a joint operator of the project with Eni. He also called for face-to-face talks with Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni to resolve the dispute over Kashagan. Mr. Scaroni is expected to travel to Kazakhstan soon, though no date has been set, according to the company.  "In the last few days, we have heard the Kazakhs wanted to remove Eni; now they talk of it being a co-operator" with KazMunaiGaz, said David Stedman, a London-based analyst with the Daiwa Institute of Research. The statement is a "step in the right direction" for finding a solution to the Kashagan dispute, Mr. Stedman added.  As it seeks to resolve the dispute with the Kazakh government, Eni must shore up its position with the other members of the development consortium. Eni holds an 18.5% stake in the consortium, the same as Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA. ConocoPhillips has 9.3%, while Inpex Holdings Inc. and KMG each own 8.3%.
