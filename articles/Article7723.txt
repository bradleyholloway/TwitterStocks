 National City Takes A Charge but Expects Net for Quarter, Year   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1988  National City Corp. said it took a $45 million fourth-quarter charge for additional foreign loan-loss reserves, but still expects to report a profit for the quarter and the year.  The latest charge brings to $100 million the total international loan loss charged to 1987 earnings. National City said the allocated reserve equals about 64% of its $172 million of medium-term and long-term exposure to less-developed countries. These loans are less than 2% of its total loans, it said.
