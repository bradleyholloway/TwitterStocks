 Lap Belts May Increase Risk of Injury In Some Car Crashes, Safety Board Says   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1986  According to the report, "in many cases, the lap belts induced severe to fatal injuries that probably would not have occurred if the lap belts had not been worn." Of the 50 people, 32 would have fared "substantially better" with a shoulder-lap belt, the board said.  Since 1968, auto makers have been required to install shoulder-lap combination belts in front seats next to the doors, and lap belts in the rest of the seats.  Yesterday, the safety board urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a Transportation Department agency, to require auto makers to install shoulder-lap belts in back seats next to the doors. It also said the NHTSA should study the feasibility of installing combination belts for all seats.
