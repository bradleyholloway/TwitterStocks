 France's Bic Bets U.S. Consumers Will Go for Perfume on the Cheap   By By Andrea Rothman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1989  Societe Bic, which created the market for disposable razors, cigarette lighters and ball-point pens, is trying a similar strategy in the marketing of perfume.  The perfumes, to be sold through traditional Bic distribution channels like drugstores and supermarkets, were introduced last year in France, Italy and Britain. Bic declined to disclose how the new products have fared in Europe.  Sharon DuPuy, a spokeswoman for Bic Corp., a Milford, Conn.-based unit, described the new products as an extension of the "Bic heritage -- high quality at affordable prices, convenient to purchase and convenient to use." The perfumes are to be called Nuit, Jour, Bic for Men and Bic Sport for Men.
