WASHINGTON, Nov. 16â€” The Civil Aeronautics Board suspended flights into the United States by the Soviet airline Aeroflot for a week today as a penalty for flying over ''sensitive areas'' in New England.  The C.A.B. said it would bar Aeroflot flights from Saturday until Nov. 28 at the request of the State Department, which had complained that two Soviet flights, one inbound and one outbound, strayed from their agreed paths Nov. 8.  Aeroflot has two round-trip flights a week between Washington and Moscow.  The State Department complained that the two flights ''overflew sensitive areas of southern New England'' instead. Officials at both the State and Defense Departments were reluctant to discuss the sites that they consider sensitive.
