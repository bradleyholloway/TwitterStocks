 Love & Money: If You Could Start From Scratch. . .   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2006  Nevertheless, I'll bet that in just about every career there comes that point where you tell yourself you're ready for something new. But, then, time passes . . . and you awake to realize another year or 10 has gone by, and nothing has changed. And it isn't that you dislike your job. It's just that your job has come to define who you are, leaving you feeling that maybe you've lost sight of who you wanted to be.  "I had a meltdown on Sunday night," she told me. "I don't know if I have the confidence to do this, to wake up without a plan, to know that my friendships will change. To worry about the finances and what I can't afford, when I buy now without thinking about it. I'm still living like my paycheck will still be coming in, and I'm not sure when it will hit me that it's not. My boyfriend has been supportive, but I've been financially independent and I worry he might think I see him as a sugar daddy now. Basically, I don't know if I'm going to live up to my expectations."  Massive as those fears are, they haven't muted [Debra]'s motivation. She is set to turn 37, and all she has known since college is grabbing for the next promotion and the bigger paycheck. She has given short shrift to everything else -- including the possibility of having a family. She isn't the daughter, aunt or girlfriend she wants to be. "I'm proud that I have come so far in my career," she says, "but another promotion is not going to impact how I perceive myself. I want to be able to say I'm proud I gave just as much to other pieces of my life, because right now it's completely out of whack."
