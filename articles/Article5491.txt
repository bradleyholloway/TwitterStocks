 European Software-Pricing Formulas, Short on Logic, Develop a Rationale   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 1993  Quick: What's the cheapest way to buy software in Europe for a personal computer? Order it by mail from another continent.  For a bevy of reasons, the U.S.-based companies that dominate the world industry have long charged up to twice as much in Europe for their products as they do in the U.S. Higher European labor and distribution costs are one factor, but so is simple profit motive: "We were charging what the market would bear," says Peter Bayley, international marketing director in Europe for Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass.  In the past year, though, Europe's crazy-quilt pricing patterns have begun to unravel. Though bargains remain a rarity, prices for some big-selling software packages have gradually drifted downward. And software houses, under pressure from bargain-hunting multinational clients, are moving to standardize prices. Lotus and Microsoft Corp., for instance, recently undertook to set prices that differ by no more than 5% from one European country to the next.
