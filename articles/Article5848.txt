 Gains-Tax Repeal Faces Fierce Fight in Germany   By By Christopher Rhoads, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  That would still be a major improvement from the existing rate, between 50% and 60%, depending on different state taxes. But it would undoubtedly come as a major disappointment to investors and large German companies, primarily insurers and banks, which have their hopes set on abolition of the tax. Just this week, Deutsche Bank AG managed to avoid paying more than one billion euros ($961.5 million) in capital-gains taxes on the sale of part of its stake in insurer Allianz AG, using a set of complicated derivative trades and depending on the ultimate passage of a tax repeal or reduction.  The opposition wants to narrow the gap between the corporate tax rate and the personal tax rate, the level at which unincorporated firms would pay capital gains. The government has proposed lowering the corporate rate to 25% by next year, from 40% this year, and the top personal income-tax rate to 45% by 2005. The opposition wants that top rate lowered to 35% by 2003.
