 Apply Marshall's Principles to Clarence Thomas   By Robbins, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1991  James Robbins discusses the Senate hearings into the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the US Supreme Court. Robbins says if Thomas does refuse to answer explicit questions, he will be following not only the example of Justice David Souter but also of Justice Thurgood Marshall, who refused to express an opinion on the then-recently decided Miranda vs Arizona.
