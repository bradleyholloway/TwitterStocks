 Bond Prices Post Second Rise in a Row As Dollar Firms, but Trading Is Light   By By Tom Herman and Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1987  But trading was light as investors and securities dealers braced for this morning's government report on July's merchandise trade deficit. The trade report has become by far the most closely watched government report each month, often triggering big swings in the dollar as well as in stock, bond, and commodity prices.  According to the average estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the merchandise trade deficit totaled $15.6 billion in July. That would be little changed from June's $15.7 billion gap. But few forecasters are confident of their estimates, and predictions of the deficit range from $13.5 billion to $17 billion.  Even so, Mr. Giordano and many other analysts say bond prices could rally temporarily before resuming what appears to be a long-term slump. "My bias is still bearish, but I think we could have a rally before rates move higher," said John J. McDougall, senior executive vice president in charge of fixed-income operations at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
