 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Corralling La Quina   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1989  It is difficult to overstate the importance and significance of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's arrest Tuesday of the man who runs that country's oil-workers' "union." We use "union" advisedly because the organization run since 1961 by Joaquin Hernandez Galicia -- known throughout Mexico as La Quina -- is more than a mere union. To perhaps a majority of Mexicans, the oil-workers' union is the embodiment of the profound political corruption that, like some large dead stone, smothers the country's vast potential. With one unexpected, bold stroke, President Salinas has told Mexicans that national corruption is not preordained.  To be sure, the arrest of La Quina and about 50 of his top associates involves other complex factors in the politics of Mexico, and the success of the offensive is not assured. In particular, Mr. Salinas has put his own personal safety at significant risk. La Quina commands a personal army (at his home alone, the police reportedly found 200 Uzi machine guns), and his arrest offers a pretext for any aggrieved faction in Mexican politics to eliminate the new president. While security during the campaign was poor, it's noteworthy that the Salinas cabinet is stocked with such security-minded types as Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios.
