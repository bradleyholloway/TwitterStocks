 Big Issues For 2004 (Sixth In A Series): What Could Ease Sting of Health Costs   By Lueck, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2004  Many health insurers already have such programs, and the government is beginning an experiment with disease management in the Medicare program for the elderly. But some health-policy experts say that while it's a positive development for patients' well-being, disease management may not do much to reduce health costs. Spending will likely rise for preventive medications and tests, and sick patients will end up costing more because they'll live longer.  Mr. Bush also wants to increase the tax benefits associated with health-savings accounts, which were created as part of the Medicare drug-benefit legislation passed last year. The accounts let people with high-deductible insurance policies save up money tax-free and withdraw it tax-free for medical expenses. High-deductible policies are a linchpin in Mr. Bush's plan to reduce health-care costs. By requiring policyholders to pay at least the first $1,000 of their own medical expenses, supporters say, high-deductible plans will make patients spend more wisely. Money in the accounts rolls over from year to year, so they keep whatever they don't use.  Mr. Kerry says Mr. Bush's health proposals won't help middle-class families and are a sign that his opponent is "out of touch" with regular Americans, a frequent campaign theme. Mr. Kerry says his proposals will reduce people's annual health premiums by an average of $1,000.
