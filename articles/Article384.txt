 Letters to the Editor: Immigration Restrictionists Must Face Reality   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2004  Rep. [Tom Tancredo] and his colleagues also fail to offer a realistic alternative to granting legal status to the roughly 9.3 million undocumented men, women and children who already have deep roots in American families, communities and businesses. Do they propose decimating entire sectors of the U.S. economy, including agriculture and service industries, by deporting 5.3 million undocumented workers? Do they propose deporting three million native-born, U.S.-citizen children together with their undocumented parents, or having the state assume responsibility for the care of those children after their parents have been expelled from the country?
