 Your Lifetime Guide to Money: How to Manage the Real-Estate Balancing Act   By By Barbara Donnelly Granito, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1994  Generally, people feel driven to buy homes mainly for personal reasons, not because of cogent financial analysis. Indeed, the top two reasons that most individuals give for buying are that they "preferred a larger home" or "wanted the tax advantages of home ownership," according to a recent study by the National Association of Realtors.  But buying a home is, in fact, a significant financial decision. That's true whether you're a first-time buyer, an experienced homeowner trading up to a larger place or a retiree looking for a smaller, more manageable one. Some of the most important considerations for people in three age groups -- 20s-and-30s, 40s-and-50s, and 60s-and-older -- are discussed in articles {in this issue}. Another article describes how to figure out when it's better to rent (See related articles: "The Dollars and Sense Of Buying Vs. Renting" and "Making Smart Real-Estate Moves Through the Ages" -- WSJ, August 12, 1994).  From a financial-planning standpoint, few things can rival home ownership as a good savings discipline. Even if home prices were never to rise, paying down a mortgage creates a nest egg of home equity that can either be tapped for income in retirement or can provide a handsome legacy for heirs.
