 Auto-Safety Agency Focuses on Crash Prevention; NHTSA Hopes Technologies Can Help Improve Driving, Not Just Vehicle Protection   By Karen Lundegaard and Amy Schatz, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2004  The future will be about crash avoidance, according to the agency chief. "Frankly, NHTSA is behind," he said. "We're behind in our ability to research and keep up."  Under Dr. [Jeffrey Runge], NHTSA has encouraged several efforts by auto makers to agree on voluntary standards such as side-impact protection. However, Dr. Runge has also called for a number of new regulatory standards, including a requirement that auto makers install side curtain air bags and conduct more rigorous testing of vehicles in side-impact crashes. That new requirement is expected to be announced today. Dr. Runge has been relatively outspoken about certain issues, such as the high rates of rollover accidents involving sport-utility vehicles.  Auto safety advocate Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator who is now president of Public Citizen, said it is encouraging that the agency is beginning to focus on new technologies like electronic stability control that can prevent rollover crashes. But she says there's no reason why NHTSA can't also require auto makers to meet tougher safety standards that prevent traffic fatalities.
