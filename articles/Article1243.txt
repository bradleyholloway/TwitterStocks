 Comments by Bush Suggest Danny Wall Lacks President's Support in S&L Post   By By Paulette Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1989  Danny Wall told a congressional subcommittee that he foresees doubling the pace of seizing sick savings and loan associations, but his tenure as the nation's top thrift regulator appears to lack the full support of President Bush.  Mr. Bush, in an interview with editors of several Texas newspapers last week, wouldn't rule out calling for the resignation of Mr. Wall, who is the subject of an explosive series of congressional hearings over the demise of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association of Irvine, Calif. "I am not closing the door on it," Mr. Bush said, according to a transcript of the interview. "I just don't know at this juncture."  Mr. Bush was responding to an exhortation by Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the House Banking Committee, for Mr. Wall to step aside, at least while the committee explores why the thrift was allowed to remain open so long, piling up losses that will cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. Mr. Wall is scheduled to testify next week, along with Charles Keating Jr., the chairman of Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz.
