 In the Fray: Subtext Message: The Cellphone Video of Saddam's Execution   By Woodward, Richard B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  The execution of Saddam Hussein was by these standards a viewer- friendly spectacle. This time Rupert Murdoch did not judge the event to be "unseemly." Death by hanging is relatively bloodless, and images of the tyrant with a rope around his neck made the front pages of the tabloids ("Good Knot" read the jeering headline of the New York Post) and led network broadcasts around the world.  The visible end to a murderous dictator has one benefit: It quells theories that he escaped the reaper. Hitler's suicide was not photographed, allowing a belief in his survival to thrive for years. Behind bars and headed for the gallows, Saddam exercised a similar irrational grip of fear over his captors. Philip Shishkin reported Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was so worried last Friday that the Americans might spare Saddam's life at the last minute that he left his only son's wedding early to oversee the hanging.  In less than three minutes, the video undid that deliberate process. Saddam will now be frozen in time looking like a tested leader -- angry but resigned to his fate -- while the Iraqi government is seen hurrying to complete its nasty business before the new year. Even though that government granted him the kind of dignity he seldom granted the people he killed, his uncovered and unbowed head contrasts favorably with the masked executioners shouting "Muktada" and acting up for the camera as if this were a soccer match. Ironically, it is Saddam's stoic behavior on the scaffold that makes his hanging bearable to watch.
