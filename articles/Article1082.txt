 Free Advice for Ford   By Charlie Hughes and William Jeanes, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  -- Make the Ford brand the most successful brand in the world. Toyota is your new Airbus and you must beat them, world-wide. The creation of a dominant Ford brand is Job No. 1. As recently as 2000, four of the Top 10 best-selling vehicles in the U.S. were Fords. Today there is one, the F-series pickup. The Ford brand has always been the fountain of cash for the Ford empire. It provided the funds which allowed Ford to embark on its strange odyssey to purchase a collection of companies that ranged from Volvo to Land Rover to quick-lube companies to junkyards.  You have been told that Jaguar is a lost cause hemorrhaging money. You need to ask why. We say it's a product lineup that relies principally on Ford platforms. Its one technically brilliant platform is dressed like an old lady. The other is stablemate brands that stifle Jaguar. Having Aston Martin prevents Jaguar from building the world's finest sports cars, and Land Rover precludes its building stylish crossovers. Though difficult, these problems are fixable, and Jaguar can once again be a viable alternative to a BMW, something Lincoln will never be.
