 Love & Money: What's Our Son Saving For? Uh, Well...   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  Classically, we parents have our kids saving over the long haul for some undefined big-ticket item. Maybe in the back of our minds, we're thinking college or a car or a first house. Most likely, we're not thinking anything at all. We just know it's for something a long time away.  We parents struggle with this, in part because "saving for the future" is a nebulous concept for us as well. Sure, there are concrete reasons we all squirrel away a few dollars for the long term: a new house, a new car, a dream vacation, retirement. But there are just as many nonreasons that all boil down to a very limp "just because."  I don't think kids need a specific reason to save, and I don't think parents need to contort themselves to fashion goals that kids must strive for. If you want your children to save for college, fine; just don't expect them to truly grasp that until they're teenagers. If you want kids to experience the pleasures that saving can allow, such as occasionally splurging on an expensive item, great. Allow your kids to reclaim some percentage of their savings once a year to buy whatever they want.
