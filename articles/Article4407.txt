 Is New York Too Big To Notice a Monster Of an Arts Festival? --- The City Is About to Find Out As Martin E. Segal Opens His 20th-Century Tribute   By By Meg Cox, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1988  "Marty's Party" could easily enough turn out not to be "the celebration of the century." Marty is self-made millionaire, Russian emigre businessman Martin E. Segal, the former chairman of Lincoln Center. His party is the First New York International Festival of the Arts, an affair that's supposed to captivate New York City for a month starting tomorrow, with 4,000 performers from 30 countries putting on 350 events.  Many festivals fully underwrite the productions they present, but Mr. Segal cannily designed this one as an "umbrella," providing a context and marketing but just a bit of the money for most events. That has made the festival all the bigger, if not necessarily the better, and it has left the risks to be carried by sometimes-fragile non-profit arts groups, which may end up in the red.  On Wednesday, the Russian group's literary manager, Mikhail Stronin, came here to beg Mr. Segal for a bailout, but he refused them. "Mr. Segal says he only gives an umbrella for the festival," says Mr. Stronin. "In this case, his umbrella has lots of holes. I told him this could be taken as a political maneuver, and he said he can't help what people think. We are angry, but we aren't giving up."
