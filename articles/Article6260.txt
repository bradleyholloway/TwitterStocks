 Burnham Expected To Say It's Mulling All Alternatives   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1999  The San Diego-based real-estate investment trust, whose main holdings are shopping centers in the West, is also expected to report third-quarter results that are a few cents a share below analysts' estimates. A First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of analysts' estimates expects Burnham Pacific to report funds from operations -- a useful measure of a REIT's performance -- of 36 cents a share. The company posted funds from operations of 34 cents in the year-earlier quarter.  The possibility of Schottenstein launching a hostile bid has been hanging over Burnham since July, although REIT charters prevent any one shareholder from easily obtaining more than a 9.8% stake. Schottenstein already owns 9.4%.
