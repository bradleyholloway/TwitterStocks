 Speaking of Business: A Sluggish Economy Has Real Advantages   By By Lindley H. Clark Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1987  There has also been a major change in the way some people view the economy of the 1950s. At the time many analysts didn't think much of the decade. The inflation-adjusted gross national product skittered up and down quite a lot, bringing us three full-fledged recessions. Inflation was reasonably restrained, if you discount the Korean War surge in 1950-51. But the economy on average was surely sluggish. Again discounting the Korean War, the average growth for the decade was less than 2.6%. John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960 in part on a promise "to get this country moving again."  So it is with some surprise that I hear some economists say that, if we really try, we can manage the economy as well as those folks managed it back in the 1950s. In a recent Dean Witter memorandum, for example, Arnold X. Moskowitz writes, "As in the 1950s, stronger growth and low inflation can go together." He tries to cheer us all up by saying that if we get a new international monetary system, a "targeted floating currency" setup, there's a reasonable chance that the late 1980s will look like the late 1950s, not the late 1920s.  In the 1950s economic policy was aimed, first and foremost, at subduing inflation. There had been an inflationary blowoff in 1946 when World War II price controls were removed. From December 1945 to December 1946, the consumer price index zoomed upward by a frightening 18.2%. Things cooled off gradually in the next two years until the 1948-49 recession helped to produce an actual decline in the index in 1949. Then came the Korean War and, for a couple of years, prices shot upward again.
