 Japanese Stocks Rise 2.9% in Active Trading, Buoying Europe, as Other Asian Markets Weaken   By By Bill Spindle and Sara Webb, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1997  The bounceback in Japan boosted many of the European stock markets, which extended their rallies later in the day with added inspiration from Wall Street's opening gains. German stocks jumped 2.1%, France rose 1.1%, Italy jumped 1.4% and London closed 1.6% higher.  However, the rally in those markets was offset by some new, dramatic declines elsewhere in Asia, reflecting heightened concern about possible corporate failures and the continuing slide in Asian currencies against the dollar. Malaysia plunged 11.1%, Indonesia dropped 4.7%, and South Korea fell a further 2.8%. Thai stocks tumbled 2.8%, Singapore closed 2.4% lower, and Hong Kong slid 1%.  Though an estimated 850 million shares were traded, yesterday's rally wasn't as broad as some market moves earlier this week. Two shares rose for every one that fell, whereas on Wednesday, 20 shares fell for every one that rose. Among bank shares, for instance, 48 issues rose while 41 fell, whereas on Wednesday, nearly every bank share fell.
