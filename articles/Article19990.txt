 Politics & Economics: Firms Seek Pension-Bill Wrinkle; Provision in House Measure Would Repeal Conflict-of-Interest Rules [1]  By Schroeder, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2006  The House provision would eliminate the requirement for service providers to apply for Labor Department exemptions. Instead, they would need only make sure the transaction is done for "adequate consideration," an amount that the plan trustee and the service provider consider to be a reasonable, fair-market price. Critics say that scrutiny of the arrangement would come too late to protect workers. If new pension legislation lifted the exemption requirement, the Labor Department would still retain its authority to prosecute those behind transactions it considered improper or illegal.  "For some of our leading New York financial firms, the rules are proving so onerous that the providers are actually considering getting out of the pension-management business altogether," Mr. [Randy Kuhl] said. The result is that pension funds may lose access to "tools that are helping [other] investors manage their money more efficiently and safely," he added.  The provision would help plans "that are missing out on transactions that might produce a benefit" but would "also let a lot of really bad transactions go forward," said Norman Stein, a professor at the University of Alabama Law School with a specialty in pension law. Congress will "have to weigh the costs," he said.
