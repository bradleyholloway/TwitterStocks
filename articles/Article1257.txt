Holders Sue Over Financial Release ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1989  A trio of investors has filed a stockholders' class action in federal court here against First Interstate Bancorp. and four of its officers and directors for allegedly issuing a series of falsely upbeat statements about the health of a Texas subsidiary.  The suit was apparently sparked by the announcement earlier this month that First Interstate would add $400 million to reserves against losses arising mostly from problem real-estate loans and its First Interstate Bancorp. of Texas unit.
