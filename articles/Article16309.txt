 Dana Sues ArvinMeritor Adviser   By Frank, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2003  The suit, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, adds to the spate of lawsuits between Dana and ArvinMeritor over ArvinMeritor's $2.2 billion hostile bid. While highlighting new details about UBS's involvement with the two auto-parts makers, the suit isn't likely to affect the outcome of any possible deal. Dana rejected the offer from ArvinMeritor, based in Troy, Mich., saying the bid is inadequate. Dana's stock was at $15.50, up 10 cents, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  According to the complaint, UBS had been advising Dana on an undisclosed project since early 2002. UBS was also a major lender to Dana, and had access to sensitive financial information. The complaint alleges that UBS met with Dana on May 29, 2003, for a financial update. On June 4, ArvinMeritor CEO Larry D. Yost sent Dana's CEO a letter offering to buy the company for $14 a share. He sent a letter to Dana's board on June 16. On July 8, ArvinMeritor publicly announced its bid.
