 MarketWatch: Not Foreign Enough?   By Burton, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  International investing has been profitable, especially with the feeble U.S. dollar enhancing results for Americans. Markets outside of the U.S. returned an average of 23% a year in dollar terms over three years through September, and emerging markets returned 37%, according to index tracker MSCI. U.S.-based companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, meanwhile, gained 13%.  "There's no question that there's a significant diversification benefit to international investing," says John Ameriks, a principal in Vanguard's investment counseling and research group. "As a baseline, we think 20% gets you the largest part of that benefit."
