 Northern Exposure   By By Cheryl Benard, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2003  Turkey has two legitimate concerns -- and an unstated but well-known agenda. The Turkish military had to go into Kurdish Iraq, they had argued, to prevent an unchecked flow of refugees into Turkey, and to guard against terrorists. But the American presence, along with enhanced security on the Turks' own side of the border, could have prevented those problems. More likely, the Turks were in fact concerned about something different: the potential elevated status of Kurds in Iraq and the possible impact on their own Kurdish minority.  The Kurdish issue is a sideshow to most of the world -- but not to the Turks. They may yet see the war in Iraq as an opportunity -- a perception that could have a number of potentially catastrophic effects. A Turkish intervention against the Kurds could escalate. It could conceivably bring in the Iranians, with their own Kurdish issue. If the Kurds, presently fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the U.S. military, became targets of aggression, this time by a U.S. ally of long standing, it would be impossible for us to refrain from taking action -- but it's hard to imagine what that course of action could be.
