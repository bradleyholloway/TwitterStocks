 Deals & Deal Makers: Accounting Body Seeks Comment On Proposals for Non-U.S. Firms   By Burns, Judith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2003  The PCAOB proposal calls for the new U.S. oversight body to register accounting firms outside the U.S., while deferring routine inspections and discipline to non-U.S. regulators where appropriate.  A similar approach would be taken with investigations. The PCAOB proposed relying more heavily on probes by independent counterparts than industry self-regulatory organizations. The proposed rule would encourage non-U.S. regulators to collaborate and share information on probes with the PCAOB, while reserving the PCAOB's right to conduct its own investigations outside the U.S. Under the plan, the PCAOB envisions disciplining companies or individual accountants outside the U.S. if warranted.  PCAOB began wrestling with its boundaries early on, holding a roundtable discussion in March before announcing it would require registration of non-U.S. accounting firms whose clients include U.S. public companies or other companies traded in the U.S. A briefing paper released in October outlined the "sliding scale" approach to working with non-U.S. regulators.
