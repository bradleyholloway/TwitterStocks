 Letters to the Editor: Death and Disease, Up in Smoke   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1999  Robert Bork's arguments ("Tobacco Suit Is Latest Abuse of the Rule of Law," editorial page, Sept. 23) concerning the impending federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry are unscientific and specious. His assertion that smoking is "not addictive as medical science has long defined addiction" is presumptuous, if for no other reason than the tobacco magnates and their subservient "scientists" acknowledged the addictive nature of tobacco in their own internal memos. Speaking as a former clinician with 20 years of experience treating smoking-related diseases, the fact that only 10% of smokers are able to quit unaided should be enough testimony to their addiction to counter Mr. Bork's blithe dismissal.
