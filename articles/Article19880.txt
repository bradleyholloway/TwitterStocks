 American Men Just Shrug As They Take a Bashing   The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  If we were to market "Girls are stupid. Throw rocks at them!" T- shirts, would the certain-to-be-offended masses of women's rights/gender-neutral/psycho-socio babblers/university do-gooders accept an "It's darkly comic" response? Not likely. So, why should we? It's time to fight back. Make some noise. Demand respect. The "darkly comic" side ain't gonna take it no more.
