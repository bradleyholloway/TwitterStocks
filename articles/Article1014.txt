 Family Finances: Tips for Home Sellers Today   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2006  Time-tested advice still rings true: Sellers should focus on giving their home "curb appeal." The yard should be well-groomed and the grass green, and the exterior of the house should look attractive and well-maintained. Likewise, the interior should be immaculate. "The first impression is very important in this kind of market because buyers have so many choices," Mr. [John Wenner] says.  A competent real-estate agent should be able to gauge the market, but sellers also can do some research. Mr. [J. Lennox Scott] suggests looking at recent comparable sales in the neighborhood, and determining what percentage of those homes sold in the first 30 days on the market. If less than 20% sold, you're likely in a softening market. If 20% to 30% sold, you're in an equilibrium market. Over 30%, you're in an appreciating market.  Time horizon also matters. If you have several months to sell, you might try setting the price a bit higher. But there's a danger to that, says Phyllis York Brookshire, chief operating officer of a brokerage in Raleigh, N.C.: "There's always some backlog of buyers right when you put the home on the market." If you price your home too high, you might miss out on those buyers.
