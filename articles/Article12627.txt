 Firestone Parent Will Set Aside Cash for Claims --- Bridgestone Says Lawsuits Won't Force U.S. Unit Into Bankruptcy Court   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Todd Zaun in Tokyo, Joseph White in Detroit and Timothy Aeppel in Pittsburgh, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2000  As for Firestone's financial strength, Bridgestone President Yoichiro Kaizaki insisted the Nashville, Tenn., unit could weather the legal barrage. Firestone "is not in a state of insolvency" and has no plans to file for bankruptcy, Mr. Kaizaki said. "We have not even considered such a thing," he said at a news conference in Tokyo. In Tokyo on Tuesday, shares of Bridgestone fell 200 yen ($1.80), or 14%, to 1,252 yen.  Mr. Kaizaki said Bridgestone would continue to support Firestone to help it recover from the Aug. 9 recall of 6.5 million tires. Failures of those tires are allegedly linked to 119 deaths in the U.S. and more than 40 overseas. Mr. Kaizaki refused to elaborate on how Bridgestone calculated its $450 million estimate for legal damages, saying only, "our accountants and lawyers assure us this will be enough to cover damage awards."  Robert J. Patterson, a lawyer in Corpus Christi, Texas, said he believes Bridgestone's involvement in the U.S. operation would meet the test. He noted, for instance, that each separate business unit in the U.S. subsidiary had its own Japanese adviser who reported directly to Bridgestone in Tokyo. But just to be sure, he said, the next case he is preparing to file against the tire maker would name Bridgestone.
