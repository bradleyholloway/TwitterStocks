 Motorola to Buy Starfish Software; Terms Undisclosed   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1998  Starfish is the second major entrepreneurial venture of Philippe Kahn, a flamboyant Frenchman who built Borland International Inc. into a major software player that was once considered a serious rival to giant Microsoft Corp.  Starfish also had supplied software to Motorola, which already owned a small stake in the company. Mr. Kahn, during a briefing with reporters, said Starfish was very close to filing to go public before it was decided that becoming part of Motorola made more sense. Motorola already turns out a huge proportion of the cellular phones and pagers sold each year, and the company's finances and marketing muscle will be a major asset, Mr. Kahn added.
