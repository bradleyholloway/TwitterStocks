 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1987  The House speaker, who helped author the U.S. proposal, said the new accord "has to prevail." Reagan said he supported the accord signed by five Central American leaders Friday, but said Contra interests must be protected. The preliminary peace pact hands the Contras and their U.S. supporters a major diplomatic defeat and reduces chances that the anti-Sandinista rebels will win more U.S. aid after funding expires Sept. 30.  Managua said the peace plan will succeed only if the U.S. agrees to bilateral talks and an end to Contra aid. The Contras vowed to continue fighting.  Secretary of Defense Weinberger said recent mine-sweeping efforts have turned up "mines that Iran possesses." The efforts were mounted after the Bridgeton, a Kuwaiti tanker flying the U.S. flag, hit a mine July 24. It isn't known if Iran planted that mine. Meanwhile, three Navy-escorted Kuwaiti tankers moved quietly into the gulf Saturday, but shipping sources said minesweeping delayed them above Bahrain.
