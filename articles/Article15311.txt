 Business Backs Laws to Rein In Regulators   By By Jacqueline Bueno, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1995  State business groups are pushing a bill that would require legislative approval of all new rules. Another bill, also backed by business groups, would force state agencies to provide a financial-impact statement for any proposed rule expected to have an impact exceeding $1 million. It's considered likely that at least one of the bills will pass.  Meanwhile, similar trends in South Carolina and Georgia are stirring business groups in those states to erect hurdles to new regulation. South Carolina's Legislature already reviews proposed rules, but they automatically go into effect unless the Legislature votes them down. A bill pending in the Legislature, but not expected to be voted on this year, would require lawmakers' approval of any regulation before it becomes law.  In Georgia, George Scott is taking note of what is happening in North Carolina. Mr. Scott, director of Georgia's Administrative Procedure Division, where new regulations are filed, has seen the number of new rules filed annually double in the past decade.
