 Trial of Blacks Is Tucked Away in a South African Town   By By Roger Thurow, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1987  DELMAS, South Africa -- The brown brick courthouse is practically a neighbor of Norman's Hardware Store -- just turn left by the Checkers supermarket and you're nearly there. But listening to Norman, the courthouse might as well be on a different planet.  Inside the courthouse, in courtroom D, 19 black men are on trial for conspiring to overthrow the South African government -- in other words, for treason. Nearly every morning for the past 13 months, these men, attired in suit jackets and ties, have been bused into town from the prison down the road, and late in the afternoon they have been bused back.  Inside Norman's Hardware, one white man -- Norman, the proprietor -- is busy with his bookkeeping. He says he knows most everyone in town, but he's never met the 19 black men, known as the Delmas 19. They used to be the Delmas 22, but three have been acquitted. Norman never met them, either.
