 Cat and Mouse: SAT Coaching Schools Intensify Their Battle With College Board --- They Say the Trick Is Knowing How to Decipher the Test; Consider Fred's Theorem --- Are Poor Students Penalized?   By By Gary Putka, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1992  Named after Fred Bernstein, a former SAT coach in New York, Fred's Theorem holds that an angle only needs to look equal to be equal in SAT diagrams involving parallel lines. The 8-to-27 eliminator? On one mathematics section of every SAT, answer choice D is never correct on any question numbered eight to 27 that doesn't include a variable.  The postulating Mr. Glovinsky's first name is Paul, a Ph.D. who works for Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center Ltd., a big coaching school. Mr. Glovinsky analyzes verbal questions on old SATs for word patterns. More often than not, he says, the correct answer will be a cliche rather than an unfamiliar phrase in the SAT's multiple-choice format. How does one succeed on the SAT? "Stick to hackneyed usage," advises Dr. Glovinsky.  The College Board, which administers the test, insists that the test is valid in predicting college performance, while conceding that some forms of coaching help. So adept are the cram schools that the College Board and the Educational Testing Service, which writes the test for the Board, often make changes solely to thwart them. Many of the Princeton Review tips "constitute organized cheating," contends Arthur Kroll, the College Board's chief liaison with ETS.
