RICHMOND, Aug. 16â€” A Federal appeals court today upheld the murder convictions of Jeffrey MacDonald, a former Army captain, in the mutilation deaths of his wife and infant daughters at Fort Bragg, N.C., in 1970.  In 1980, the same court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, reversed Mr. MacDonald's conviction, on the ground that he was denied a speedy trial. After a reversal of that holding by the United States Supreme Court, Mr. MacDonald was returned to prison. Today's action came on a new appeal on other grounds.  ''Our canvass of the record gives ample warrant for the verdict,'' the court said. It added that there was insufficient evidence to support his claim that drugged hippies broke into the MacDonald home and committed the murders while chanting, ''Acid is groovy, kill the pigs.''  Mr. MacDonald, 38 years old, a former member of the Special Forces, was convicted by a Federal jury in North Carolina in August 1979 of the fatal stabbings and beatings of his pregnant wife, Colette, 24, and their daughters, Kimberly, 6, and Kristen, 3. He was sentenced to three life terms in prison. Returned to Prison  The appellate court's reversal of that conviction was based on the Army's failure to bring charges after its investigation. Mr. MacDonald was indicted by a Federal grand jury in 1975.  This March, the Supreme Court ruled that the delay had not violated Mr. MacDonald's rights. It reinstated his conviction and he was returned to the Terminal Island, Calif., Federal prison.  His new appeal was based on the contention that the trial judge improperly excluded the testimony of witnesses who might have corroborated the story that members of a satanic cult invaded the MacDonald home.  The judge's ruling strictly limited the testimony, for instance, of Helen Stoeckley, a police informant, on the events of the night of the killings.  Today, the court said the evidence showed that her memory ''was exceedingly poor and that she was constantly under the influence of narcotic drugs.''  Some of her statements, the court said, seemed to support Mr. MacDonald's account. But, it went on, ''The declarations were untrustworthy because Stoeckley's pattern of remarks in admitting and denying complicity rendered her hopelessly unreliable.''
