 When Eavesdropping Meant That You Had Some Nosy Neighbors   By Crossen, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2006  "You could tell if someone was listening in," a woman told Lana F. Rakow, author of "Gender on the Line," a 1992 field study of women's use of the telephone in a small Midwestern town. "There was a little click, and then you didn't talk the same. You didn't give out your family secrets."  Party lines were also a mixed blessing for the telephone companies. Party lines, wrote Claude S. Fischer in "America Calling," a 1992 social history of the telephone, had "low rates, technical complications and disagreeable clientele -- AT&T's president, Theodore Vail, called them 'the worst class of people.' " But once people became accustomed to having a telephone in their homes, they were ripe for conversion to private lines.  Today, party lines are all but extinct, and eavesdropping has become more technologically sophisticated. But despite the lack of privacy on party lines, some people enjoyed their sense of community. Michele Martin, author of the 1991 book "Hello, Central?" told of a Canadian woman who cut her finger and called a friend on her party line to ask for help. "Before the friend could answer someone else piped up, 'Bind it up in salt pork.' "
