 Asian Web Firms Are Getting Flack From Publicists   By By Connie Ling WSJ.com, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2000  "At the peak [of the Internet boom] we were getting calls from start-ups three times a day," recalls Lynne Anne Stevenson, Hong Kong managing director of Fleishman-Hillard International Communications, St. Louis. Fleishman-Hillard, like many other established multinational public-relations firms, was pursued by many Internet start-ups just six months ago. Ms. Stevenson turned down most of these companies because of limitations on Fleishman-Hillard's resources and doubts about the future of many of the start-ups.  The Hong Kong public-relations firm thought it scored big when it landed cn2u.com Ltd. as a client earlier this year. Eager to crack the competitive business-to-business and financial Web-site market, the Chinese financial portal began spending to build its brand by sponsoring events and placing giant advertisements on billboards. Within months, it racked up a marketing and advertising bill of nearly two million Hong Kong dollars (US$256,000), much of which was advanced to the advertisers by the public-relations firm, according to people within the companies. After months of not being paid, PR Concepts went to court in July seeking overdue payment from cn2u.com.
