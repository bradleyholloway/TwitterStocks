 Bush Suggests A 1-Point Drop In Tax Rates --- Various Cuts Are Outlined In Levies and Spending, Without Any Promises   By By David Wessel and Michel McQueen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1992  Hours before Mr. Bush delivered what aides had been promoting as a crucial speech, the president suffered another embarrassment over his stance on taxes, as the White House backed away from what appeared to be a pledge Mr. Bush made Wednesday never to raise taxes again. To a cheering crowd in New Jersey, Mr. Bush said, "I went along with one Democratic tax increase, and I'm not going to do it again. Ever. Ever" -- a reference to his 1990 deficit-reduction compromise with Congress. Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater insisted yesterday, however, that that "wasn't a pledge, no. He was saying, as he's said before, that he wouldn't make that mistake again."  Despite his recent flirtation with tax cuts, Mr. Bush continues to argue for deficit reduction. His aides said he wants to reduce spending by an additional $300 billion over five years for that purpose. But Mr. Bush has offered no specifics. Budget experts say he would have to cut deep into such politically popular programs as Medicare, veterans benefits and farm subsidies.  To counter the impression that his opponent, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, has a plan for the economy while Mr. Bush doesn't, the Bush campaign printed up a 29-page "Agenda for American Renewal," seven pages longer than Mr. Clinton's comparable document. In a five-minute Bush television advertisement that was to air last night, a toll-free phone number was to appear for viewers who want a copy of the new Bush plan.
