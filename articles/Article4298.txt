 LTV Creditors Are Seeking to Remove Big Aerospace Unit From Chapter 11   By By Cynthia F. Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1987  LTV Corp.'s banks and the federal pension agency are pressing to remove LTV's huge aerospace and defense unit from the company's bankruptcy-law proceedings.  Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., which insures the pension of workers at troubled companies, is LTV's largest creditor. Since filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code last July 17, LTV has dumped some $2.32 billion of unfunded pension liabilities on the agency, giving the agency a deficit of more than $4 billion. The banks have a $175 million unsecured term loan and a $50 million secured revolving credit line with the aerospace and defense unit.  On Monday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland will decide whether parties other than LTV can file reorganization plans for the company. Up to this point, LTV has had the exclusive right to file such plans and has succeeded more than once in having that advantage extended.
