 Pentagon Picks Up $77.6 Million in Sale Of Diamond Trove --- Proceeds From `Strategic' Gems Stockpiled in the Cold War Will Help in Base Cleanups   By By Warren Getler, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1993  The Pentagon's sale of nearly one million carats of diamonds fetched $77.6 million, and military brass said the proceeds would be put to such unceremonious uses as environmental cleanups at U.S. bases in Europe.  Officials with the Defense Logistics Agency, the Pentagon unit overseeing the sale of near-gem to gem-quality industrial diamonds, were beaming at a news conference Friday where the results of the closed-bid auction of the government's crown jewels were announced.  The sale, authorized by Congress last year, is part of an accelerated sell-off of the U.S. military's Cold War-vintage inventory of 91 "strategic" commodities -- an eclectic assortment including asbestos, bauxite, iodine, cobalt and other items once deemed vital to the nation's warfighting capacity. Some $203 million has been raised from the stockpile sales this year, including the diamond auction, Mr. O'Brien said.
