 Cleaning Up: Stopping Diaper Leaks Can Be Nasty Business, P&G Shows Its Rivals --- How Consumer-Products Giant Gets Millions in Royalties From a Disputed Patent --- Wetting in the Courtroom   By By Tara Parker-Pope, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1999  P&G and Kimberly, which together control about 75% of the $3.9 billion-a-year diaper market in the U.S., started off battling one another in court over their respective diaper-cuff inventions. But in a significant turnabout, they agreed in 1992 to call a truce. Now, the two behemoths receive royalties on the diaper-cuff from nearly all of their competitors -- except one another.  In part, the patent volume reflects the competitive nature of the diaper business: New products are introduced as often as every six months, racehorse speed in the world of consumer products. In the past nine months alone, P&G, the world's biggest diaper maker, has rolled out Pampers Rash Guard and Pampers Size 6 for children late to toilet training; No. 2-ranked Kimberly has introduced new-and-improved Huggies Supremes with "form-fitting leg elastics;" and fourth-ranked Drypers Corp. has unveiled a product with "Germ Guard."  By the spring of 1989, the two giants were slugging it out in federal court in Seattle. Finally, after a two year battle, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer ruled in 1991 that Kimberly, not P&G, was the actual pioneer of the diaper leg cuff. The judge cited Kimberly's work papers, which showed that its own inventor, Kenneth Enloe, had come up with the idea first, in April 1982. In addition, Kimberly had filed an early version of its patent with the patent office on July 2, 1984, more than a year before P&G's application.
