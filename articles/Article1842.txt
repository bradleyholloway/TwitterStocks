 Air Force Report Points Out Flaws In B-1 Bomber   By By Tim Carrington, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1988  According to a report on the Sept. 28 crash in southern Colorado, a large bird -- probably a white pelican -- collided with the plane, penetrated a thin section of its airframe, and started a succession of fires inside. While three crew members ejected before the plane crashed, the ejection seat of a fourth failed. He and two other crewmen who weren't in ejection seats were killed.  Brigadier General James Meier of the Strategic Air Command told reporters that the designers of the military's newest bomber had planned for possible collisions with birds weighing five or six pounds, but not for ones involving birds weighing fifteen pounds or more. In addition, the Air Force concluded that one part of the ejection seat system isn't reliable.
