 REIT Interest: Report Says Some REIT Results Appear Better Than They Are   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  While Green Street acknowledges that REITs are holding up better than most other corporations this year, the firm thinks investors have been misled into thinking REIT earnings are growing. The problem is that write-offs and nonrecurring charges are not being reflected in the financial statements of some REITs -- making results appear better than they are. Write-offs and nonrecurring charges incurred by REITs that Green Street covers as of the third quarter have cost the firms nearly $800 million. Mr. [Mike Kirby] says that figure could total more than $1 billion for the year. Many of the write-offs were technology-related. Others were write-offs on ailing business ventures.  Mr. Kirby thinks it's analysts' responsibility to make sure the earnings estimates they submit to Thomson Financial/First Call follow the guidelines to include nonrecurring charges. After all, Thomson Financial/First Call, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates, leaves it up to REIT analysts to decide what should be included in funds from operations.
