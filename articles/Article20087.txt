 Love and Money: Your Kids Break It. Do They Buy It?   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2007  Another friend, a mom of a young daughter, sees it differently. I told her I was leaning toward having my son foot the $32 bill. This was, after all, his mistake. Her comment: "I think you're being mean. He's a little kid, and he wasn't irresponsible. He didn't know the consequences of his actions. He was just playing and being a kid, and you are punishing him for not having enough life experience to understand that cars can go out in the rain, but electric scooters can't. I'm not even sure I would have realized that either, and I'm 40."  Conversely, both of [Erik]'s kids have been warned numerous times to either keep their toys off the floor or close their bedroom doors, or else the family's two puppies might gnaw the items to pieces. When a dog chewed up a prized, new American Girl doll accessory, "I told my daughter, 'Sorry, but you are paying to replace it,'" Erik says. "The dangers and risks involved were well-known. It resulted in her being more careful in the future."  "Life is about mistakes and what it costs you to make those mistakes," says Colleen. Her daughter is in the school band, and a couple of times has dropped her flute and bent the valves. "The first time, I didn't make her pay for the repair because it was a complete accident." But Colleen told the girl that such repairs are expensive -- about $150 -- and warned her that she needed to be more careful.
