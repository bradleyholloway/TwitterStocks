 Italy Approves Layoffs for Fiat, Risking Strikes   By By Alessandra Galloni and Luca Di Leo, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  In a concession to the government, Fiat agreed to close its Sicilian plant for only six months, instead of at least one year, which will allow many workers to come back to work in September 2003. Fiat also agreed to allow employees at other plants to work on a rotating basis, instead of staying home. But in return, Italy's center-right administration gave the green light for as many as 2,900 permanent layoffs for workers approaching retirement, compared with just 500 in a plan Fiat had originally presented Oct. 9.  Fiat, once Europe's No. 1 auto maker, steadily has lost market share in its home market to rivals such as Ford Motor Co. and PSA Peugeot Citroen SA's Peugeot and Citroen brands. In November, Fiat accounted for 28% of Italian car sales, less than half what it was a decade ago. Fiat's shares have lost nearly 50% of their value since the start of the year. Fiat shares fell 0.9% to 9.40 euros yesterday.
