 Your Career Matters: Help Wanted: Gujarati Speakers to Sell Insurance --- Recruiters Stake Out Parades, Temples as They Court Indian-American Market   By By Meera Louis, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1999  Mr. (Puneet) Seth and his counterparts at New York Life Insurance Co., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and other insurers are scrambling to tap into a hot market -- the surging ranks of Indian-Americans in the U.S. -- and that means building up their South Asian work forces.  Take the recent visit by Mr. Seth to the Bochasanwasi Akshar-Purshottam Sanstha temple in Edison, N.J. The temple serves around 3,000 Gujaratis, an ethnic group that originates in western India. If you visit the temple on a weekend, chances are you will encounter about 400 worshipers, says Mr. Seth. This close-knit, affluent community -- many in it still speak Gujarati -- represents a niche that Mr. Seth is eager to reach.  "I want to get a high-profile member already active in this community," says the New Delhi-born Mr. Seth. For about a year now, he has tracked Anil Patel, an accountant who also volunteers as a public relations officer at the temple. Mr. Seth woos him with letters, mails him newsletters and calls him at least once every three weeks. "I am trying to convince him to quit his job," says Mr. Seth. (For now, Mr. Patel says, he is not interested in making a change.)
