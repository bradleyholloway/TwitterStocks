 Hog Futures Rise in the U.S. On Europe Ills   By By Shella Calamba, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  In response to the foot-and-mouth outbreak in Europe, Japan has temporarily banned imports of pork, pork products and other meats from some European countries. That has some traders hoping for a spike in U.S. exports.  "Although the potential is there for the Japanese to completely switch [their sources of pork], the question of how much is unknown," said Dan Basse, analyst at consulting firm AgResource Co. in Chicago. Japan already is a big importer of U.S. pork, but it also imports from the EU.  Outside of potential export demand, however, the hog market should stay on solid footing with other strong fundamentals in tow. "Seasonally, we should be seeing highs in here," Mr. [Paul Georgy] said. Retailers typically stock up on pork before Easter. Also, another blast of cold in the U.S. Midwest could cause transportation problems for the animals, analysts said.
