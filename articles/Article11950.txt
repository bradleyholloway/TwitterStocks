 House GOP Clears the Way for Passage Of Ambitious Tax-Reduction Package --- Party Wins Critical Vote; Measure Called `Jewel' Of Republican Agenda   By By Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1995  In the most critical roll call, the House voted 228-204 yesterday to bring the measure up for debate and a final vote. Opponents in both parties had hoped to block it on that procedural motion. But of 230 Republicans, 219 voted to call up the tax package -- just two more than needed for a majority -- while 11 defected. Almost all Democrats voted to block consideration of the bill, calling it too costly and too generous to corporations and the wealthy, but nine of them, mostly Southern conservatives, broke ranks to support the measure.  To pay for the tax cuts' initial expense, the bill would mandate a $100 billion reduction over five years in projected spending on so-called discretionary programs. Those include most federal programs -- among them those for the arts, crime-control, education, science and public works, but not the entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare that are by far the fastest-growing portions of the federal budget. The bill didn't specify cuts; that will be done only as Congress passes appropriations bills this year and in coming years. Meanwhile, the discretionary programs will be targeted for additional cuts next month, when Republicans draft a fiscal 1996 budget that promises a balanced budget in seven years.  The proposal boosting federal employees' costs was one of two issues that threatened to doom the tax bill. More than a dozen Republicans from districts with high concentrations of civil servants objected that the bill imposed on their constituents what amounted to a tax increase -- something Republicans are sworn to oppose. In the end, after GOP leaders told complainants they would try to compromise later, less than half that group voted to block the tax bill.
