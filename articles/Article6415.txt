 Coke Is Ready to Work the Runways --- Soft-Drink Maker Rolls Out Fashion Line in Europe   By By Cathleen Egan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2001  Turns out Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta, known more for its carbonated soft drinks than its stitchings, is sashaying onto the continental European fashion scene -- and has an eye on the U.S. Coke isn't offering T-shirts, caps and sweatshirts, mind you, but a trendy collection of halter tops, skirts, vests, dungarees and nearly 180 other casual and sportswear items with nary a "Coke" or "Coca-Cola" on them.  Indeed, it has happened before for Coca-Cola, albeit with mixed results. In the mid-1980s the company hired Hong Kong-based Murjani International to produce a line of Coke sportswear both in the U.S. and abroad. The venture was judged to be quite successful, but for reasons that are unclear, Coke decided to end the effort in 1988. A spokesman for Murjani said at the time that the business had simply "fizzled" in the U.S.  "People have to step back and remember what this industry is all about," says Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a consulting firm. "The soft-drink industry has nothing to do with beverages. Coca-Cola is not something that comes bottled in a can. It's a set of values, a state of mind, a seminal part of society." With Coke Ware, he adds, the company is "cementing a relationship with the consumer. It collateralizes the brand so that a person reaches for a Coke next time they're in the store."
