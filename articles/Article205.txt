Q. Do conifers and deciduous trees have differences besides the shape of their leaves?  A. Deciduous trees usually shed their leaves in the autumn just before the tree becomes dormant for the winter.  Most conifers retain their leaves year round. But what makes a plant a conifer is not its dormancy cycle but its cones. Conifers are the most familiar members of the class of plants called gymnosperms. All gymnosperms bear their seeds openly, often on scales, which in the case of conifers take the form of cones. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, bear their seeds within an ovary.  Q. Why does a person's body weight vary two or three pounds each day?  A. Fluctuations in body weight throughout the day can be due to several different things. One's body weight can increase after a meal. Becoming dehydrated can decrease body weight by a couple of pounds, depending on how much one has perspired and whether the water has been replenished. When exercising, more energy is utilized (fat is turned into heat) and there may be water loss due to perspiration. Depending on how much bulk and fiber is in the diet, bowel movement can cause fluctuations in body weight.  Q. Why can't man fly like a bird even if he makes feathered wings?  A. Man has not been able to invent artificial wings that operate by flapping and are efficient enough to overcome the differences in anatomy. Birds and other flighted vertebrates have physical adaptations that enable them to fly. Birds have hollow bones and other structural alterations that lighten the skeleton. The muscles, especially the pectoral muscles, are dramatically modified to provide the power necessary. Because of the extreme physiological demands of flight, birds have high metabolic rates and use their energy efficiently.
