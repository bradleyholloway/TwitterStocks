 Coca-Cola President Stahl Is Resigning --- Move Comes Amid Effort By Firm to Reorganize; Follows Two Bad Weeks   By By Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2001  Mr. [Jack Stahl]'s resignation was announced by the company yesterday. It follows months of speculation that the 21-year Coke veteran, who had held the No. 2 post for about a year, didn't see eye to eye with Coke Chairman and CEO Douglas Daft on some things, and that he might leave. The company had been denying rumors of an impending departure by Mr. Stahl. His resignation came during a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Daft in New York late Friday afternoon, when the two men discussed the business strategy they have developed over the past year, and the management reorganization meant to serve it, according to people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Daft had been in Boston and New York meeting with analysts and media.  Neither Mr. Daft nor Mr. Stahl could be reached for comment. But in a company statement, Mr. Daft said, "Jack Stahl and I held a lengthy discussion about the exciting potential of this new model. Jack concluded that, having helped The Coca-Cola Company reset its agenda and priorities, he wanted to seek new leadership challenges elsewhere."  A protege of Coke's former chairman and chief executive officer, M. Douglas Ivester, Mr. Stahl spent much of his time on the road in the last year, and was said to have good relationships with Coke's bottlers and customers. While the second in command, he had never been identified as the heir apparent to Mr. Daft. His resignation, though sudden, didn't surprise some analysts. "Both Stahl and Daft came from different lineages within Coca-Cola," said Andrew Conway, analyst with Morgan Stanley. "What developed was two executives who at times had differing strategies and approaches to the marketplace."
