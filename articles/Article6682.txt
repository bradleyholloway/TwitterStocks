 Powell Walks Fine Line Between Praise and Pressure --- Secretary Tells Palestinians, Israelis to `Get Started'; High-Level Talks Likely   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  The Israeli authorities, meanwhile, announced a series of "confidence-building measures," such as easing travel restrictions on Palestinian towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, issuing more permits for Palestinians wishing to work in Israel and extending fishing rights in Gaza. Mr. [Colin Powell] described the moves as "very promising and helpful."  Israel is also insisting that the Palestinians drop their demand for a "right to return" for refugees who fled what is now Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Palestinians say that is a fundamental right, but Israel says it would cease to be a Jewish state if it had to take back millions of Palestinian refugees. Under the road map, the issue was supposed to be dealt with in the second phase of negotiations, but Israel wants it excluded from the outset.  The Palestinians, meanwhile, are demanding that Israel stop targeted killings of militants, end its military blockade of Palestinian towns and freeze all settlement activity. Mr. [Mahmoud Abbas] also called on Israel to lift travel restrictions on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has for more than a year been holed up in his ruined headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
