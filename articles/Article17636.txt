 Genex Corp. Expects To Report a 1986 Loss   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Genex Corp. expects to report a loss again this year, but improved sales of its Proto drain opener should help the company "turn the corner" and break even or show a profit by 1988, said president and chief executive officer J. Leslie Glick.  Mr. Glick wouldn't be more specific about the size of this year's loss. But for the first half of 1986, the biotechnology company posted a loss of $1.4 million that included a gain of $898,000 from the sale of land and other assets. Sales were $1.7 million.
