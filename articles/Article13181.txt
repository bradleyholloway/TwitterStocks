 Technology Start-Ups Scrimp to Get By   By Boslet, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2005  Robert Robinett's Modulus Video Inc. is one of them. "For two years, there were no salaries. We were paying for the privilege of coming to work," says Chief Technology Officer Mr. Robinett of nursing his Sunnyvale, Calif., company through its first 2 1/2 years. "That's the way start-ups used to be done."  "I think there are a lot of companies that are trying to hold off venture funding and look to bootstrap," agrees Brian Zanghi, chief executive of Pragmatech Software, a company founded in 1994 and funded by venture capitalists nine years later in 2003. "I think it's a control issue."  "There's some very creative bootstrapping going on," says Ms. [Heidi Roizen] of Mobius Venture Capital. "People have money," and experienced entrepreneurs are putting it to work, she says.
