 EA-Hasbro Tie Targets Casual Gamers   By Wingfield, Nick, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2007  While casual games tend to be easier to create than more-elaborate titles for high-end systems such as Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox 360, they encompass a dizzying array of devices. They run on everything from thousands of different mobile phones, personal computers and hand-held players such as Nintendo Co.'s DS to the Wii, Nintendo's hit game console for the living room. Hasbro executives said they believe EA, the world's largest videogame publisher by sales, will be able to bring Hasbro properties to a wider audience on the broad spectrum of devices casual gamers are using today.  EA was caught off-guard by the enormous popularity of Nintendo's Wii and DS among casual gamers, and has watched other publishers thrive with games for those devices. The company recently reorganized its game-making operations into four divisions, including, for the first time, one focused entirely on casual entertainment. EA says Hasbro's visibility will help it attract more consumers.
