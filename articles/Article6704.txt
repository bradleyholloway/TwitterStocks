 Deals & Deal Makers: Cerberus Approaches Clayton Homes About Deal   By Robin Sidel and Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 2003  In a letter sent late yesterday afternoon to Kevin Clayton, chief executive of Clayton Homes, Cerberus didn't make a formal offer, but indicated an expression of interest.  "Based on our review of publicly available information, we believe that our acquisition could provide greater value to your shareholders than the pending transaction with Berkshire Hathaway," Frank Bruno, a Cerberus managing director, wrote in the letter. He said Cerberus was prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement in order to scrutinize Clayton's nonpublic financial documents.
