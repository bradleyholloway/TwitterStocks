 The Fed: Dump the Dollar, Save the Economy   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2010  Should a weaker dollar be in the cards, that could help key U.S. stock-market sectors, such as technology, lift commodity prices such as gold and oil, and provide a profit tailwind for U.S. investors who put money overseas, especially in emerging markets. Many investors believe that as long as the Fed is in easing mode, the dollar will be under pressure, especially against key emerging-markets countries such as South Korea and Brazil, where economic growth is much stronger and bond yields are more appealing than in the U.S. The U.S. dollar has already fallen by 5% this year against the Korean won and 4% against the Brazilian real.
