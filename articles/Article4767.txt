 Universal Health Services Faces a New Hurdle With State's Plan to Cut, Freeze Hospital Fees   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1987  Universal Health Services, which earns much of its profits in Las Vegas, seems to be facing more grim news because of plans to cut commercial hospital rates there. But with the stock already depressed because of earnings problems, a few stalwart investors are betting that Universal can recover.  Universal shares have wilted in recent days as short-sellers and others started paying attention to Nevada legislators. The company stands to lose from a rollback in billed charges. Its Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas in 1986 earned about $22 million pre-tax, roughly two-thirds of all Universal's pre-tax profit, says Jerry Treppel, a Merrill Lynch analyst.  But even for Universal, a rollback might have more impact on investors' confidence than on earnings, says Merrill's Mr. Treppel. The rate cuts would only apply to so-called "private pay patients" at its Valley hospital who aren't covered by health plans or don't receive discounts. Such patients may represent only 15% to 20% of Valley's total patients, some analysts say.
