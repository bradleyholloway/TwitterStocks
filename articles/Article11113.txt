 On Sports: Kansas' Amazing Manning KOs Okies   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1988  KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Oklahoma basketball coach Billy Tubbs likes a good straight line as well as he does running up scores on opponents, so at a press conference the day before his team played Kansas in the NCAA championship game here Monday night he brightened when he was asked if he thought God might be on Kansas' side in the showdown to come.  Turned out that the heckler, and especially Danny, got the last laugh. The softspoken lad of 6-feet and 10-inches from Lawrence, Kan., by way of Greensboro, N.C., had a stellar if not celestial evening on Monday with 31 points, 18 rebounds and other wondrous stats. And, lo, in the end, underdog Kansas prevailed, 83-79, before a Kemper Arena full house that had adopted its flatland neighbor as its darling.  To be sure, the Kansas win did establish a few firsts. The Jayhawks' 11 losses during the season (against 27 wins) were the most for any NCAA champ, and theirs was the first title by a member of the Big Eight conference since 1952, when they also won it. An NCAA historian also figured out that Kansas was the first central-time-zone-based team to win the crown since Marquette in 1977.
