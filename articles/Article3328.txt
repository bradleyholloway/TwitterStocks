 Andersen Survivors at Huron Aim to Benefit From Scandals   By Gullapalli, Diya, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2004  Huron Consulting Group Inc., a financial and legal advisory firm founded by former Andersen partners during the company's death spiral in 2002, is set to go public with a $115 million stock offering by the end of the year. Its specialties include "forensic" examinations of companies with accounting blowups. That is, its consultants drill deep into particular accounting areas to figure out what went wrong, often working with audit committees and their law firms.  Since former Andersen partner Gary Holdren, who focused on Chicago- based clients, founded Huron, the firm has grown to employ more than 600 professionals, and has conducted over 1,000 engagements through its eight offices nationwide. But while revenue has more than doubled since the company began, Huron has yet to report any annual profit. In 2003 the firm was over $2 million in the red. In its latest regulatory filing for the IPO, Huron acknowledged, "We have experienced net losses for most of our history, and our limited operating history makes evaluating our business difficult."  Big Four forensic experts, however, disagree that they are lenient, maintaining that they typically aren't hired to review a prior audit. "We are doing fact finding," not "opining about audit procedures," says Richard Gigenti, head of KPMG's forensic practice.
