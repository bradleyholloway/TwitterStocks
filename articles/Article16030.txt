 Small-Stock Focus: Nasdaq Is Unable to Sustain Early Gains   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2001  Nasdaq stocks traded higher for much of the trading day but, in the end, posted another decline. Small-capitalization stocks were also pushed lower, although the group's losses, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, were significantly slimmer than those of the overall Nasdaq Stock Market.  The Nasdaq composite has fallen in five of the past six sessions and closed yesterday at its lowest level since Oct. 16, 1998. It fell 34.20, or 2.04%, to 1638.80, after posting an intraday gain of 25.21 yesterday, while the Russell 2000 index, at 425.74, slid 1.22, or 0.29%.  Pac-West Telecomm, a Stockton, Calif., provider of integrated communications services, jumped 38 cents, or 17%, to 2.56, retracing more than half of Tuesday's 22% decline. An analyst at UBS Warburg, who said that Tuesday's selloff was overdone, contends that the company has a strong balance sheet and is fully funded with a positive cash flow.
