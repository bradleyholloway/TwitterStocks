 Democracy for Palestine   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  'World to Bush: Get Real!" So read the headline of a June 30, 2002, media roundup in the Los Angeles Times, summing up enlightened reaction to President Bush's June 24 speech on the future of Palestine. "I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror," Mr. Bush had said. "I call upon them to build a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and liberty." Such conditions for U.S. support, said one British critic, were "stringent, indeed impossible."  Where do we go from here? It pays to understand how we've gotten this far. Begin with Mr. Bush's consistent refusal to negotiate with [Yasser Arafat], which was broadly lamented as a retreat from diplomacy. In fact, it was essential diplomacy. It signaled that the U.S. would not hazard its prestige by dealing again with a man who'd made a fool of President Clinton at the Camp David summit in July 2000. It also sent a message to Palestinians that Arafat's continued leadership would pay no dividends on the international scene.  Equally important was Mr. Bush's decision to junk the failed land- for-peace formula that had defined U.S. Mideast policy for decades. In this new reckoning, the problem in the Middle East was not primarily a function of territory, but of ideology and politics; that is, of the nature of existing Arab regimes. Israel can always be arm-twisted into giving up land. But what is the point of creating a Palestinian state that is a haven for terrorists and a springboard for continued aggression against its neighbors? By treating statehood as a reward for performance, not an entitlement for existence, Mr. Bush helped lay the groundwork for Sunday's elections.
