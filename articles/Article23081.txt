 Year-End Review of Markets & Finance 2003; Another Saga of the Running of the Bulls; Fabulously Low Interest Rates Help to End Markets' Decline; Investors Wonder About a Peak   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 2004  One of the biggest questions facing professional investors, aside from the market's overall direction, is whether these volatile companies can continue to lead the gains. It is an issue the pros call "rotation," and the question is whether market leadership is in the process of "rotating" to a new group.  Among the weaker stocks for most of the past year were those that are the most stable and benefit the least from an economic upturn. Those include makers of drugs and consumer staples like food and diapers, whose sales remain stable and predictable regardless of the economy's swings. At year's end, the volatile tech stocks hit headwinds, while the laggard "quality" stocks -- so-called because their earnings are so predictable -- began to catch up.  "Our models and analysis suggest that it will be very difficult for the stock market in 2004 to 'score' the same type of returns that it did in 2003," wrote Brian Belski, fundamental market strategist at brokerage firm U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, in a recent report to clients. Still, he forecasts that the S&P 500 will be up as much as 14% over the next year to 18 months, rising to the 1200-1250 range from the 1111.92 at which it finished 2003.
