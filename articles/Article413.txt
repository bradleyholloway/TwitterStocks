 Johnson Controls Agrees to Acquire York International   By Hallinan, Joseph T, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2005  The two companies are classic American industrial icons. York was founded in 1874 to manufacture ice-making equipment, and its brands include York, Frick and Coleman. Johnson was founded 11 years later by Warren S. Johnson, inventor of the first electric room thermostat.  Johnson Controls said that, by 2008, it expects to achieve more than $275 million of annual cost savings, or "synergies," through the deal, primarily because of cost efficiencies and a lower effective tax rate.  J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has served as financial adviser and Foley & Lardner has served as legal adviser to Johnson Controls. York's financial adviser is Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, and its legal counsel is Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
