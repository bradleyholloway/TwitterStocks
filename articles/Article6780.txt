 Oil Use Surges, But Output Cuts Still Are Likely   By Selina Williams, Sally Jones and Adam Smallman of Dow Jones Newswires, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2004  In part as a result of increased Chinese demand, the IEA increased its 2004 world-demand figure to 80.2 million barrels a day. The IEA forecasts the world will need 300,000 barrels a day more of OPEC oil in the second quarter than the agency predicted last month, bringing total demand to 23.9 million barrels a day. That still is 3.9 million barrels a day less than the IEA's estimate of OPEC's current output.  People close to OPEC said it is unlikely to alter a decision to trim supplies by a total of 2.5 million barrels a day starting April 1. The IEA's increased forecasts are "serious, but OPEC still remains afraid of the second quarter and a dip in demand," said a person close to OPEC policy.
