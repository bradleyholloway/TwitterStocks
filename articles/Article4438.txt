 With Frommer's, Google Taps Gurus   By Efrati, Amir; Trachtenberg, Jeffrey A, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2012  Google -- and its ambitions to capture more online ads related to travel and local-business information -- are under scrutiny by antitrust authorities, who are looking into allegations that the company directs its search-engine users to its Google+ business listings, undermining travel and online-review sites such as TripAdvisor and Yelp. Google generates about $2 billion to $3 billion per year from selling travel-related ads on its search engine and hotel- and flight-booking service, with travel sites Expedia Inc. and Priceline Inc. being among the top advertisers, according to Herman Leung, a stock analyst at Susquehanna International Group LLP.\n
