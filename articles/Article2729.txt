 OPEC Agrees To Claim Wider Market Share --- Members Promise to Keep Plans to Themselves After Oil-Price Tumble   By By Bhushan Bahree and Anne Reifenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1995  After years of losing oil customers to non-OPEC producers, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has reached an understanding here to claim a bigger share of the world oil market next year.  "It's not good to even talk about it," Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, said in an interview. It was too early, Mr. Aghazadeh said, to discuss what OPEC ministers would do when they meet here in November to complete their output plans for 1996.  Yesterday's caution followed a slide of as much as 60 cents a barrel in world oil prices Monday that resulted from a remark by Venezuela's oil minister, who let slip that OPEC might even go as far as to consider ending all output restraint and allowing its members to produce at will.
