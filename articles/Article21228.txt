 Economists Fret Over Consumer Outlays --- Delicate Balance Is Required To Avoid a Slump   By By Lindley H. Clark Jr. and Alfred L. Malabre Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1988  Through much of the economy's long expansion and especially after the stock market crash, many forecasters feared that consumers, burdened by debt, skimpy pay gains and low savings, would slash their spending and thus spark a recession. So far, that hasn't happened.  So, most economists hope that consumers keep spending -- because such outlays perennially account for about two-thirds of all business activity -- but that they won't spend too lavishly. Such hopes can produce odd-seeming analyses. In a recent report, Edward S. Hyman, the chief economist of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., called a brisk increase in retail sales in June "bad news."  "It's a delicate transition, getting from a consumer-led expansion to one powered by capital outlays and exports, and to do so without interruption in overall economic growth," says Donald Straszheim, the chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. But "the transition seems to be working. Capital spending is booming, as are exports, while consumer spending is neither racing ahead nor coming to a complete halt."
