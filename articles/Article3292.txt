 Yukos Tax Appeal Might Suffer Blow By Judge's Ouster   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2004  The Tax Ministry accuses Yukos of illegally using domestic tax havens to reduce its tax liability in 2000. Tax authorities also are investigating Yukos's tax payments in later years and have won a court order preventing Yukos from selling assets. Yukos has appealed the tax claim, saying the tax plans it used were legal and that many of the tax liabilities applied to companies unrelated to it.  The decision to remove the judge was made at the demand of the Tax Ministry, which contended that Moscow Arbitration Court judge Natalia Cheburashkina had demonstrated bias by not rejecting Yukos's appeal outright. The ministry had said that the signature on Yukos's appeal didn't come from an appropriate person, the Interfax news agency said.
