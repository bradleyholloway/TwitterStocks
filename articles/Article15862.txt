 Happy Gilmore: The New Politics Of Prosperity   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1999  Prosperity has sucked the anger out of the electorate, especially anger toward government. Surging tax revenue has eliminated budget deficits, which had become a symbol of political failure. And rising personal income has put more voters in a mood to spend a little more on what Steve Moore of the Cato Institute astutely calls "the luxury good'" of bigger government. All of this has helped Democrats.  Yet this week Mr. (Jim) Gilmore achieved what no Republican ever has in the cradle of the old Confederacy -- the capture of a majority of both Virginia legislative houses. The White House, naturally, called this a victory -- for President Clinton!  Republicans "won by promoting investment in education, patients' bill of rights, health care, things that have been traditional Democratic messages," said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, who needs a week or two of remedial spin class. Only two weeks earlier Mr. Clinton campaigned against Virginia Republicans for not running on these issues. The Washington Post added to the spin-fest by calling Virginia a victory for "moderation and money."
