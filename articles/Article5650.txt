 The Quest to Diversify: Where Did It Go Wrong?   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1994  The hired guns enlisted by major cities' chambers of commerce now constitute a small army of bureaucrats, spread out among some 70 separate economic-development commissions, committees and bureaus around the state. Their collective size is roughly equal to the entire Florida Department of Commerce, with its 300 employees and $33 million annual budget.  "I think we're struggling, just as 49 other states are, at a time when the corporate community is trying to reduce jobs and we're trying to get more of them," says Jim Breitenfeld, an Okaloosa County development official who is also president of the Florida Economic Development Council, a professional association of local groups.  Nevertheless, the failure of Florida's diversity efforts raises questions about the development strategies. Even the state's No. 1 business cheerleader, Robert McKnight, executive vice president of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, says: "An awful lot of time and money have gone into this dialogue of creating new jobs. We could have done a lot better, and we need to do better now."
