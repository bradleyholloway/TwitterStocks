 Most Music Is Swapped Illegally   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2003  The remaining one-third of the estimated 11.1 billion total music files is mainly attributed to copying tracks directly from compact discs. These songs also include downloads from paid sites such as RealNetworks Inc.'s Rhapsody or sending via e-mail. NPD, a Port Washington, N.Y., research group, said the most popular file-sharing services include KaZaA, with 21% usage, and WinMX, with 5% usage. These services allow users to swap music, most of it copyrighted, free of charge.
