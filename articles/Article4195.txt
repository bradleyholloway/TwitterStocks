 CFTC Extends Compliance Period For Audit Rule   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1986  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission gave nine commodity exchanges as many as nine more months to comply with its new rule requiring recording of pit transactions within one minute of the trades.  The CFTC said the nation's 13 exchanges plan to adopt "a wide range of systems" to comply with the rule, which is designed to establish a precise "audit trail" of futures trades. But the commission's decision to extend its original Oct. 1 deadline indicates that in many instances the exchanges need more time to put the complex systems into effect.  After 11 years of debate and some abortive attempts to require one-minute recording, the CFTC in January voted to make the systems mandatory. The rule, which had been staunchly opposed by most exchanges as detrimental to the efficiency of pit trading, is aimed at improving the ability of the CFTC and the exchanges to police possible trading abuses.
