 Chrysler Again Idles Premier Sedan Plant Due to Sagging Sales   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  Sagging sales of Chrysler Corp.'s Eagle Premier sedan has forced it to temporarily close its Bramalea, Ontario, plant for the third time this year.  The most recent shutdown began last week. The plant has been idled for two weeks each time it has been closed this year. Chrysler had a 111-day supply of the Premier at the end of March. A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal.  The modern Bramalea facility and the Premier was one of the main attractions for Chrysler when it purchased American Motors Corp. in 1986.
