 Vintage Warplanes Carry History Into the Sky   By Burrows, William E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2003  Mr. [Ralph Royce] flies vintage military aircraft -- a World War II Navy F6F Hellcat, an SBD Dauntless dive bomber, a T-6 Texan trainer, and a venerable B-17G Flying Fortress named Thunderbird -- at some of the scores of air shows that are staged around the country from April to November. He is the former owner of a paint and coatings business and is currently the president of the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston, Texas. The museum owns the four planes he flies, in addition to a meticulously restored P-47D Thunderbolt, a P-38 Lightning, a British Spitfire, and a twin-engine B-25 Mitchell. All of them, Mr. Royce is proud to say, are flyable.  The Flying Fortress may have been the "heavy" bomber of its time, for instance, but with a fuselage barely 75 feet long and packed with a crew of 10, stacks of bombs, and ammunition for 13 machine guns, it would more accurately have been called the Flying Sardine Can. Thunderbird's fuselage is so narrow that its two waist gunners would not be able to stand back to back. Its flight deck is so cramped that pilot and co-pilot have to do contortions to get into their seats. (Pulling himself up, legs first into the bomber's nose, the way Gregory Peck did in "Twelve O'Clock High," would probably send Mr. Royce and his cronies to the orthopedic ward.) There's no moving anywhere, in fact, without having to duck, squeeze, or squirm. And the cables that connect the controls on the flight deck to the tail's vertical and horizontal stabilizers run along the top of the fuselage like thick, vibrating, guitar strings. The noise from the R-1820s is horrendous. The plane's skin is only an eighth of an inch thick, which was no protection against attacking fighters over the Third Reich.
