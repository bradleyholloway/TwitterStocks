 U.S., EU Push Plan to Trade Aid for Open Markets   By Hitt, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  In the 148-nation WTO, where decisions are made by consensus, major economic powers have no special advantage. "You need to have everyone on board," said Mia Horn af Rantzien, Sweden's ambassador to the WTO, who has joined in the push for the aid-for-trade proposal. "It's rational to make everyone a net gainer."  The emerging aid program still has skeptics. The plan is a "post- dated" check "with insufficient funds," said Dipak K.A. Patel, Zambia's minister of commerce, trade and industry, in a statement. Zambia is a leader in the developing world.  While Washington and Brussels spar over agriculture, they are joining hands on the aid program. The idea has been endorsed by Treasury Secretary John Snow. EU trade chief Peter Mandelson in recent weeks has urged major players in the WTO talks to "greenlight" the initiative. "This is a concrete commitment we should all sign [on] to," he said.
