 Unsolicited Bid Prompts GenCorp to Develop Plan to Give Holders 'Full Value' for Shares   By By Gregory Stricharchuk, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1987  The Akron, Ohio-based company, facing an unsolicited tender offer of $100 a share, or $2.23 billion, has promised to unveil soon its own plan to give shareholders "full value" for their GenCorp investment. A. William Reynolds, chairman and chief executive officer of GenCorp, implies that he won't dismember the company, which has interests in tires, plastics, aerospace and broadcasting.  The stock has surged partly on hints from the suitor -- a concern formed by AFG Industries and Wagner & Brown -- that it might sweeten its bid. But analysts wonder just how much improvement is likely in that March 18 tender offer, which runs through April 14, and they aren't sure what GenCorp might do to counter it.  Without dismembering GenCorp, analysts wonder how Mr. Reynolds can compete against the unexpected suitors, who plan to finance their offer by selling off key GenCorp businesses, including Aerojet General, a prized high-tech aerospace and defense unit.
