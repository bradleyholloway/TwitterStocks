BUDAPEST, May 16â€” A monument to Raoul Wallenberg was officially dedicated Friday, nearly 40 years after an earlier statue was mysteriously removed on the eve of its dedication.  The bronze-and-granite monument, the work of Imre Varga, is a gift from Nicolas M. Salgo, the former American Ambassador here.  Mr. Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews, remains a subject of embarrassed ambiguity for the Hungarian regime, because he either died in a Soviet prison or remains a prisoner of the Soviet Union.
