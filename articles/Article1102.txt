 Many Business Travelers to Pay More As Airlines Eliminate a Discount Fare   By By Bridget O'Brian and Carolyn Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1988  Most of the industry, led by Continental and Northwest airlines, is eliminating discounts on tickets purchased three or seven days in advance and on unrestricted one-way fares. If it holds, the change will probably contribute even more to the industry's already stellar revenue and earnings performance. Most carriers posted record results for the quarter ended Sept. 30.  Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., Houston, said the move affects about 5% of its traffic. That figure might be higher for other carriers, as Continental generally hasn't been favored by business travelers because of a reputation for unreliable service, one analyst said. Northwest is a unit of NWA Inc., Minneapolis.
