 FTC Asked to Study Promotion Of More-Costly Brands of Drugs   By By Ann Zimmerman and David Armstrong, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2002  "These letters pre-empt the patient-doctor relationship, predisposing patients to a more-costly course of treatment before they have had a chance to speak with their doctors," Sen. [Charles Schumer] said in his letter to the FTC. He also complained the practice was deceptive because the drug pitches are sent on the pharmacy's letterhead. The role of the pharmaceutical companies in paying for the programs, and in some cases writing the letters, is usually disclosed at the bottom of the letter in small print.
