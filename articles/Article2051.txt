 Japanese Concerns Consider Ventures In U.S. Publishing   By By Patrick M. Reilly, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 1989  Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader's Digest.

Today, he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine, the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business. After a slick redesign, the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company, Keizaikai Corp., the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services, book publishing and a tourist agency.
