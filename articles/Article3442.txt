 Time Reporter Faces Grand Jury, Discusses Rove   By Laurie P. Cohen and Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2005  Mr. Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, has said repeatedly that he has been told by prosecutors that his client isn't the target of a criminal investigation, but questions remain about Mr. Rove's exposure. Whether, or to what extent, Mr. Rove identified the Central Intelligence Agency agent seems a murky and perhaps difficult-to-prove point. Mr. [Rove] has testified before the grand jury three times, and it isn't known what he said.  In an interview yesterday, Mr. Luskin -- Mr. Rove's attorney -- said that the email, first read to him by a Newsweek reporter, supports the notion that Mr. Rove wasn't out shopping a story that exposed a CIA operative's identity. Mr. Cooper called Mr. Rove initially to discuss welfare overhaul, and then changed topics to discuss weapons of mass destruction and Mr. Wilson's claims about the Niger trip, Mr. Luskin said.  "You have consulted with your client Karl Rove," the letter written by Mr. [Richard Sauber] read, "who has authorized you to represent to me and to my client, [Matthew Cooper]," that "Mr. Rove affirms his waiver of any claim of confidentiality he may have concerning any conversation he may have had with Matthew Cooper" in July 2003. The faxed letter was initialed by Mr. Luskin and returned by fax to Mr. Sauber at about 1 p.m. that day, half an hour after it was sent.
