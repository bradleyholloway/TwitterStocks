 Former Owner Of Rooney Pace Indicted in Fraud   By By Frances A. McMorris, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1998  Federal prosecutors contend that Randolph Pace, 53 years old, secretly controlled Sterling Foster, a now-defunct Melville, N.Y., brokerage firm, and charged him with securities fraud, conspiracy and making false statements. The 15-count indictment also charged the company's former lawyer, Alan Novich, who was once a dentist, as one of Mr. Pace's co-conspirators. Both men were released yesterday on bail.  Mr. Pace's lawyer, Robert Morvillo, said his client intends to plead not guilty. Mr. Novich's lawyer, Henry Putzel III, couldn't be reached to comment.  Messrs. Pace and Novich allegedly defrauded investors who bought securities as part of six fraudulent intial public offerings. Prosecutors allege that the two men secretly assisted Sterling Foster's former president, Adam Lieberman, in establishing Sterling as a broker-dealer by securing capital for it and obtaining a securities clearing agreement with Bear Stearns Securities Corp.
