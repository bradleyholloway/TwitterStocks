 Finally, some investors serenade Mexico's Bancomer   By Torres, Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1994  Despite a 46% decline in shares of Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA, which has always been the more-speculative play of Mexico's two biggest banks, investors are noting that Bancomer's Class C shares are down about 46% in dollar terms so far in 1994, compared with a 6.6% decline in the Mexican stock market. Investors are also intrigued by Bancomer because the Mexican government will sell its $1 billion stake in the bank, possibly through a public offering in New York early in 1995.
