 Letters to the Editor: Our Goal: Competition That's Fair and Equal   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1997  Albert Hunt's Oct. 23 Politics & People column "A Fighter for Tolerance" is an effort to bolster Houston Mayor Bob Lanier's opposition to Proposition A, the Houston Civil Rights Initiative, which will eliminate racial and gender preferences in government contracting and education. Good people on both sides of this debate want to achieve the same goal: a society where people have the opportunities to compete fairly and equally. We just differ on how our nation and our city should reach this goal.
