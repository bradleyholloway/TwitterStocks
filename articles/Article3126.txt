 Catalog Critic: Close-Knit and Irish   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2003  With our browser aimed toward Ireland, we turned up more than a dozen sites offering so-called Aran sweaters, named for the western islands where they were knitted for fisherman. The choices were broad: We found everything from sweaters made in Ireland (some knit by hand, others "hand-loomed" on a manual machine) to versions made in Scotland, and even found a site for an Aran sweater mill in India. We narrowed our choices to Ireland-centric companies that sold sweaters that were made in the country, and that promised easy payment in U.S. dollars. Our five picks (men's large crewnecks, in natural colors) averaged $120 apiece, about half as much as in U.S. stores.  On this point, we had reliable sources. We'd called on a couple experts of Irish heritage -- sculptor Brian Tolle, the designer of the Irish Hunger Memorial in downtown Manhattan's Battery Park City, and Timothy Carey, the president and chief executive of the Battery Park City Authority -- to model sweaters for coziness and fit. The thinner Mr. Carey and more robust Mr. Tolle both found the crew neck of The Irish Shop's sweater too tight. "It's hard to get over your head," Mr. Carey said.
