 IRS Rule to Close Loophole in Roth IRA   By By Karen Hube, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1998  Savvy investors have been taking advantage of a loophole in the regulations governing the new Roth IRA to reduce their 1998 tax bills. Since July 22, when the rules were adopted, the door has been wide open for investors to convert from a traditional individual retirement account to a Roth IRA, then undo the conversion and reconvert back to a Roth IRA, as many times as they pleased.  Because assets converted to a Roth IRA are taxed at regular income-tax rates, converting when the market -- and the value of the IRA -- has declined means a lower tax bill. People who converted to a Roth IRA only to see the market drop from its July peak, eagerly took advantage of the freedom conveyed by the IRS rules to undo the conversion, then reconvert to a Roth IRA when the value of their traditional IRA had fallen. Some people did this a number of times.  But yesterday, the Internal Revenue Service said enough. It issued new rules, effective Nov. 1, that restrict the number of times investors can reconvert to a Roth IRA to one time in each of 1998 and 1999 for the maneuver to be counted for tax purposes.
