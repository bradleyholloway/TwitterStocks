 Pillsbury Sale Of Godfather's Expected Soon --- Price Could Be $50 Million; Other Restaurant Units Still Present Problems   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1988  While investors led by Godfather's senior management say they have nearly completed negotiations to buy the 580-store unit, the transaction apparently won't be completed before Pillsbury closes its books on a very disappointing fiscal year next Tuesday. The prospective buyers are led by Herman Cain, president, and Ronald B. Gartlan, executive vice president of the Omaha, Neb.-based chain. The $50 million sale-price estimate comes from analysts.  Burger King USA, Pillsbury's biggest single business, also remains its largest problem. Despite a management shake-up and an expensive new advertising campaign, franchisees report disappointing sales. "Let's just say, it's not a roaring success," said one West Coast franchisee of the "we do it like you'd do it" promotional theme. "A successful ad campaign will drive sales, and we don't see that happening." A Pillsbury spokesman said Burger King sales in the fiscal fourth quarter have been "flat."
