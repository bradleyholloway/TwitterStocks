 Going for Broke: Hunt for Blockbusters Has Big Movie Studios In a Spending Frenzy --- Cash-Flush Film Chiefs Need Projects, So Even Scripts Are Selling for $1 Million --- Pricey Search for a Snowstorm   By By Kathleen A. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1990  The script itself, the executives were told, wouldn't be available until the following Tuesday at 9 a.m. That day, it took but 1 1/2 hours for the bidding to start. By nightfall, the script was sold to "Die Hard" producer Larry Gordon's company for a whopping $1.2 million. Just a few years ago, $250,000 was considered an astronomical price for a script.  On location, it seems no expense is too great. The producers of "Die Hard 2" transported cast and crew to three cities in a multimillion-dollar and largely unsuccessful attempt to shoot during a real snowstorm. The total cost of the airport thriller, being made for the film unit of Fox Inc., is said by some in the industry to be fast approaching $60 million. Joel Silver, the producer, insists those estimates are way too high.  Paramount Communications Inc.'s movie unit is said to have already spent between $50 million and $60 million on the new Tom Cruise movie "Days of Thunder." At that rate, what's an extra $5,000? So Paramount spent that much to knock down walls in the Charlotte, N.C., Hilton hotel so that director Tony Scott could have a suite (producers were occupying the existing suites) and so that a large office could be created out of about 10 small hotel rooms.
