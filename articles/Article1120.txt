 Widow Wins Round To Recover Artwork Sold for a Pittance --- Ruling in France Highlights One of Three Swindles Shaking Museum World   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 13, 1989  Last month, the court convicted the city of Strasbourg and its Museum of Decorative Arts of fraud in the purchase from Marie-Madeleine Falbisaner of an unsigned painting attributed to Simon Vouet, court painter of King Louis XIII.  "My family has lived for generations in Strasbourg and I wanted the family heirloom to remain here," Mrs. Falbisaner said in a telephone interview. "This is what I get for being sentimental. I was gypped."  Mr. Ludmann, the museum and Strasbourg have appealed. A decision is expected within two years and Mrs. Falbisaner hopes to recover the painting, now in storage at the museum.
