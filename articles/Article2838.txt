 Shanghai Is Preparing to Extend Its Boom --- Commerce Capital Is Canvas On Which Mayor Xu (And WTO) Will Paint   By By Karby Leggett and Reginald Chua, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2001  Despite the strong economy, Mr. [Xu Kuangdi] says he worries about the impact that WTO membership will have on Shanghai. He predicts the city's automotive and telecommunications industries will face the biggest challenge in post-WTO China. And to prevent a flood of trade and investment disputes, he's setting up a program to train city officials and is helping rewrite more than 20 local laws that conflict with WTO rules. The mayor is also pushing to reduce government interference in commercial affairs by forcing city officials to focus more on setting market standards than on managing businesses. "We want to create an equitable and fair investment environment," Mr. Xu says.  In some sectors of Shanghai, the country's impending WTO entry is already spurring reform. Later this year, Mr. Xu says, the city will drop restrictions that now prevent foreigners from buying certain types of residential property, effectively opening the market to all investors. The decade-old restrictions are partly responsible for the city's huge glut of vacant property. Once the restrictions are lifted, Mr. Xu says, the property market will grow strongly.
