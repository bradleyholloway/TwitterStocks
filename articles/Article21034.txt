Chairman John McKean made the announcement at the board's meeting yesterday, but refused to comment further. Other board members said they expect Mr. McKean to serve out his term as a board member until December 1991.  As previously reported, Mr. McKean has been investigated for recommending in 1984 that the Postal Service hire a San Francisco law firm that was a client of the chairman's accounting business.
