 Paper Tiger? Fidelity Tries to Build A Newspaper Empire; Delivers Only Losses --- Mutual-Fund Giant Spends Big, but Some Advertisers Aren't Buying Its Story --- It Sees Better Times Ahead   By By James S. Hirsch, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1998  Some critics suggest CNC still hasn't quite figured out what to do with its newspapers. CNC is owned by FMR Corp., the closely held Boston company best known for its Fidelity Investments, kingpin of mutual funds. Fidelity has been trying to build a community-newspaper empire in eastern Massachusetts for eight years. But despite a booming regional economy and expanding profits elsewhere in newspaper publishing, CNC has lost money every year.  CNC has stumbled in its efforts to draw major advertisers -- including Fidelity itself, which CNC once hoped would be a big source of ads for the papers. It has alienated many employees, in the newsroom and the advertising department. It has plowed millions into modernizing news and sales operations historically run on shoestrings. But without sufficient cost cuts in other areas, its cost structure has gotten out of kilter. The operation's new president, its fifth in the last four years, is under orders to fix the business within two years, or it will be sold, insiders say.  Mr. (William R.) Elfers says the plan was to create a "seamless carpet" of community newspapers surrounding Boston, offering advertisers a swath of affluent suburban readers. Mr. Elfers reasoned that Fidelity, through its trademark approach of heavy investments in technology, research and marketing, could bring efficiencies and order to the traditionally freewheeling community-paper business. Community papers typically rely on ads from small shops and other local businesses, but Mr. Elfers believed CNC could lure deep-pocketed retailers, financial institutions and health-care firms that usually advertise in the area's dominant paper, the Boston Globe.
