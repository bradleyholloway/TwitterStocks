 Cyberonics Rebuffs Bid From Medtronic, But Device Maker Is Effectively in Play   By By Thomas M. Burton And Steven Lipin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2000  Moreover, Cyberonics appears to have at least one major chink in its takeover armor. The full board is up for election at the annual meeting, which is typically held in January. It's unclear, however, whether Medtronic would proceed with a hostile takeover bid. Medtronic hasn't previously launched hostile takeover campaigns. But in making its bid for Cyberonics public, Medtronic is engaging in an aggressive form of brinksmanship, apparently hoping that big institutional investors will put pressure on Cyberonics to accept some form of Medtronic proposal.  A Medtronic spokeswoman said that it "continues to believe ours is an attractive offer," and that it still hopes to reach a negotiated deal. One possible natural competitor to acquire Cyberonics, St. Jude Medical Inc., said it has no intention of making a bid for the company now. St. Jude had an option to purchase Cyberonics in 1996, but chose not to exercise it. At the time, it held about 13% of Cyberonics's shares, an amount that has since dwindled to less than 5%.
