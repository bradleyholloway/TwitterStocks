 Love & Money: A Book Deal -- It's All How You Look at It   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2005  Regardless of the issue, that's a common divide in many relationships -- even if it isn't so clear-cut at the outset. And the thing is, neither perspective is necessarily wrong: You're just too busy defending your point of view to recognize the merit in your partner's arguments, and you're too quick to keep repeating the same tired logic, as though the umpteenth recap will finally convince the other person to alter their thinking. It's like speaking louder to somebody who doesn't speak your language; no matter how loud you talk, it isn't going to make any more sense than if you were whispering.  You can see the vicious cycle: You assume one thing because your partner hasn't objected. Your partner hasn't objected because you haven't talked about the issue yet. But you haven't talked about the issue because your partner hasn't objected. So, you just assume everything is dandy, while your partner assumes you're going to discuss the matter before making any commitment.  She would have none of it. "I don't care about the money," she said. "This is about us as a family and the time we need together as a family." She doesn't want our new daughter to see me disappear for months in my office. Nor does she want our 8-year-old son to endure that again; he has hit an age where he's torn between friends and family, and [Amy] wants us there for him now so that he knows we're there for him when he hits adolescence.
