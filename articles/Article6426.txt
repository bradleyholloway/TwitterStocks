 As New Internet Bug Threatens Your Privacy, Here's Some Advice   By By Thomas E.

Steven Bellovin, a respected researcher at AT&T Labs Research who has studied TCP problems, says Guardent's analysis appears to be correct.  The root of the TCP problem is complicated. When two Internet machines open a pipeline between each other, they use a random number to keep the conversation private. Suffice it to say that, according to Guardent, those numbers aren't as random as previously believed. Tim Newsham, a 29-year-old researcher for Guardent, stumbled on this fact while testing a new piece of networking equipment for a client.

One red flag: If the privacy policy states that the company shares data with nonaffiliated third parties, steer clear, Mr. Ponemon says. And if it doesn't mention data sharing, "assume the worst."
