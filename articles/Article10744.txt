 Factory Orders Declined 0.9% During January --- Fall Demonstrates Damage To the U.S. Economy From Rising Imports   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1985  New orders for manufactured goods dropped 0.9% in January, the Commerce Department said, demonstrating the damage to the U.S. economy from rising imports.  Government statistics issued recently suggest that consumer demand was strong in late December and in January. But the decline in factory orders placed with U.S. companies suggests that an increasing portion of that demand is being met with imported products. And with the dollar's continued rise, many analysts expect the problem to worsen.  "Imports are really taking a huge market share even in places they've never been before," said Robert Wescott, an economist with Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Mr. Wescott believes that worsening trade problems will probably make it impossible for the U.S. economy to grow at the 4% annual pace projected by the Reagan administration over the next few years.
