 Creative Executive At WPP Resigns Amid Controversy   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2005  He said few women become creative directors because they are married with children or intend to have children. "To be a creative director you have to give 100%, and having babies takes longer than a day." He added, "being a creative director is hard work and you can't go home at night. It's one of the sad facts of life. Somebody has to work, and somebody has to look after the kids."  In the interview, he said "I jumped, I wasn't pushed," he said. Referring to WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell, Mr. [Neil French] added: "He asked me, 'What should we do?' and I said, 'I will make it easier for you,' so I resigned." A WPP spokesman said, "Mr. French has offered his resignation" and declined to comment further.
