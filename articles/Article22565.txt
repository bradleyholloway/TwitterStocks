 MindSpring Goes Soft in $90 Million Blitz   By By Andrea Petersen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  The Internet-service provider unveils its first-ever TV advertising campaign on Labor Day, striving to leap from being one of the top half-dozen Internet-access providers to the No. 2 spot, behind mammoth America Online.  It is unclear if MindSpring's campaign will give the company an edge in the heated marketing battles now roiling the Internet-access business. Rivals such as EarthLink Network and AT&T's WorldNet service also are spending big bucks to try to beat back competition from companies that provide free Internet access even as a lot of Internet newcomers arrive online.  Set against soft and mushy background music, two of the slow and lilting spots feature an approachable young Everyman seated on a park bench, with a sad-eyed dog by his side. (Think Forrest Gump with a modem.) The young man starts speaking to an older stranger who is seated at the other end of the bench. In one spot, the young protagonist wonders aloud what ever happened to the person who decided it would be a good idea to put mints on hotel customers' pillows. "Well, he could work at MindSpring," he says. "They have a lot of nice people. They make it easy to get on the Internet."
