 Moving the Market: Ex-Marsh Aides Are Told to Expect Criminal Charges   By McDonald, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  Separately, Marsh & McLennan Chief Executive Michael G. Cherkasky relinquished his role as head of Marsh Inc., which he assumed after Mr. [Eliot Spitzer] sued the company in October, accusing Marsh Inc. brokers of cheating clients by steering business to insurers that paid Marsh large commissions. Mr. Cherkasky will hand the reins to Brian Storms, an executive with Marsh & McLennan's Mercer consulting unit. Mr. Cherkasky had always intended his stint at the insurance-brokerage unit to be temporary, and he will remain as head of Marsh & McLennan.  Among those facing criminal charges are William Gilman, a former top Marsh insurance broker. Mr. Spitzer's suit alleged a scheme "strictly enforced by Marsh through William Gilman." Mr. Gilman's attorney declined to comment.  Separately, Marsh & McLennan Chief Executive Michael G.
