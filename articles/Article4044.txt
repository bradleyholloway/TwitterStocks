 Rating the von Bulow Show   By By George V. Higgins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1985  One fine sunny day late last spring, the Rhode Island Supreme Court made then-Attorney General Dennis J. Roberts 2nd warmer than the weather, throwing out the 1982 attempted murder conviction of Newport social luminary Claus von Bulow. Mr. von Bulow had been found guilty by a Newport, R.I., jury after a spectacular trial on two counts of botching a pair of attempts to kill his wife, Martha (a.k.a. "Sunny"), by injecting her with insulin, each time putting her into a coma. Revived after the first episode, in 1979, she was irreversibly damaged in the second, a year later, and remains comatose to this day.  Mr. Roberts had not been widely envied by colleagues in law enforcement when in 1981 he found it necessary to prosecute Mr. von Bulow. Hobbled by Rhode Island law fixing terms of constitutional officers at two years, he was also circumscribed in his exercise of prosecutorial discretion (the prosecutor's absolute authority to proceed or not, guided by the interests of justice and the likelihood of conviction, normally permits him to pick only cases he thinks he can win) by the public appetite for indictment whetted skillfully by Mrs. von Bulow's two children by a previous marriage.  Alexander von Auersperg and Ala Kneissel had strenuously publicized their absolute assurance that Mr. von Bulow had attacked their mother in order to terminate his marriage (on ultimatum of his mistress) without all the bother of divorce proceedings, thus not only freeing himself for new wedlock to his then-companion, Alexandra Isles, but also positioning himself to inherit some $14 million of Sunny's $75 million estate. Mr. Roberts, pondering a juicy, far-from-ironclad, circumstantial case sure to come to trial during his 1982 campaign for reelection, could have been pardoned if he proceeded to its grand jury presentation with all of the enthusiasm of a man going to be hanged.
