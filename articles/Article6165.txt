 In Pearl Murder Probe, Much Remains Murky --- U.S. and Pakistani Officials Differ Over Who Is Holding Yemenis Suspected in Killing   By By Steve LeVine, Gary Fields and David Cloud, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2003  At the time of the arrest, Pakistani officials said that U.S. authorities flew Mr. [Binalshibh] and the four others to an undisclosed location out of the country days after their capture. Now, however, a U.S. official says that U.S. agents took only Mr. Binalshibh, and that the other four remain in Pakistan. Pakistani security officials continue to say they handed over all the men to the U.S., and that they have no idea where they were taken.  The U.S. has pressed Pakistan to find any of several hundred al Qaeda fighters suspected of slipping over the border after the 2001 U.S. attack on Afghanistan, and Pakistan says it has turned over more than 400 men to the U.S. If it is true that the men arrested with Mr. Binalshibh were left behind, they may be among just a few detainees with links to senior al Qaeda leaders or terrorist acts whom the U.S. hasn't ensured were exposed to extensive interrogation. A State Department official familiar with the situation says that, since the arrests, the FBI has sought no details from Pakistani authorities about any of the Yemenis arrested last September.  While the U.S. acknowledged that it took Mr. Binalshibh into custody, it won't say where he is being held, or whether he has been questioned about the [Daniel Pearl] murder. One U.S. official said the others arrested aren't under American control, but would give no further details. Another official said that Pakistani authorities did resist U.S. queries, but that the Americans weren't seeking information about the Yemenis or the Pearl case, but an unrelated truck-bombing of the U.S. Consulate in Karachi in May.
