 Thailand's Market Is Success Story   By By Sarah McBride, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2003  The market already is getting a boost from an announcement this week from the California Public Employees' Retirement System. The U.S. pension fund said it would consider reinvesting in Thailand after pulling out of the market, as well as from three other Asian countries, last year when it introduced a ranking system incorporating both political and market-attractiveness factors.  Asian markets tumbled again following overnight losses in the U.S., while European markets were moderately weaker. Latin American shares were mixed. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.06%, or 0.08 point, to 132.11. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.15%, or 0.15 point, to 99.61.  In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index ended down 1.5%, or 141.47 points, at 9173.43. U.S. export-oriented stocks were among the worst hit. Trading firm Li & Fung fell 3.8% to end at 7.55 Hong Kong dollars. Micromotor maker Johnson Electric sank 3.9%, or 35 Hong Kong cents, to finish at HK$8.65. Hong Kong's flagship airline Cathay Pacific declined 3.8%, or 45 Hong Kong cents, to HK$11.35.
