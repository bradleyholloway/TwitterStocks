 CEO Compensation Survey (A Special Report); Creative Compensation: A CEO talks about his company's innovative pay ideas; Free ice cream, anyone?   By Lublin, Joann S, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2006  DR. [Robert J. Shillman]: In a capitalistic society, you should get paid for your efforts. But after 2001, I didn't miss the money. I said, "Well, if I don't miss it, then why should I keep taking it? Let's just give it to charity." [Cognex donated Mr. Shillman's 2004 and 2005 bonuses, totaling $517,000, to a public charity but hasn't donated his forgone salary since April 2001. At his request, the company will donate his 2006 salary and bonus.]
