 Mexico clears creation of 5 banks in effort to spur market reforms   By Carroll, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1993  The Mexican government has moved to stimulate the economy by reversing the privatization of Mexico's banks and authorizing the creation of five banks in an attempt to open the market to more competition. Increased competition is expected to drive down interest rates, reduce the high levels of nonperforming loans and allow more involvement by foreign banks, one of the provisions of the NAFTA.
