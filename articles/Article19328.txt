 Squaring Off: Question: Should Texas' Sales-Tax Holiday Be Expanded?   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  Now, state officials are talking about expanding the tax holiday, which would require legislative approval next year. State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Democrat from Houston who sponsored the original legislation, would like to see the holiday expanded to two weeks, although there is also support for a nine-day holiday. And he would like to see back-to-school items like school supplies and backpacks included.  During the first tax holidays in some states, retailers admittedly experienced significant declines in sales immediately before and after the holidays. But now, most major retailers say they have learned to plan for and manage the sales-tax holiday in Texas, just as they do for other promotional events. Small-town retailers also love the tax holiday because, they say, it has re-created the back-to-school shopping season for main-street merchants.  When retailers need to attract customers, they advertise a sale: 20% off, 30% off, or even 40% off. Ads like these appeared before the sales-tax holiday, and they appeared after the sales-tax holiday, but retailers do not need to attract customers during the sales-tax holiday.
