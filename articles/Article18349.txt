 Some Olympians Are Taking Lead In the Race for Endorsement Gold   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1992  This time around, though, the endorsement picture isn't turning out as anyone had planned. Seemingly sure-fire stars have already crashed and burned, like gymnast Kim Zmeskal, who was touted for a gold but came in tenth. Swimmer Matt Biondi, with a 1988 gold-medal performance behind him, also saw potential riches evaporate after a relatively disappointing outing. And other highly touted athletes aren't even competing at the Games, including diver Wendy Williams and Reebok endorser and decathlete Dan O'Brien.  But marketers have their eye on a few unexpected stars, especially the underdogs, and particularly those come-from-behind athletes who also overcame personal tragedies. High on most lists is swimmer Pablo Morales, who in a stunning comeback snared a gold medal after failing to even make the 1988 team and subsequently suffering the death of his mother. Right alongside him is track star Gail Devers; thanks to heavy coverage by NBC, almost everyone by now knows that a year ago she almost had to have her feet amputated because of Graves' disease.  Perhaps the athlete with the most endorsement potential, though, is one familiar from the 1988 games: Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who Sunday won her second consecutive gold medal in the heptathlon. Ms. Joyner-Kersee already has plenty of endorsements under her belt, ranging from Bausch & Lomb's Ray-Ban to Xerox to Primatene mist. But "I don't think she's been overcommercialized," insists Mr. Disson, because she hasn't starred in many national commercials.
