 Farmers, Attacking Lending Practices, Are Taking Banks to Court and Winning   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1987  The real culprit, in Mr. Conlan's mind, was Wells Fargo & Co. He sued the San Francisco-based bank in state court, claiming it had illegally cut off his credit. Last month, he won $60 million in damages, one of the largest judgments ever against a financial institution. Wells Fargo plans to seek a new trial.  The banks claim the large judgments reflect juries acting on emotion rather than reason. Several days after the Wells Fargo verdict, another state court awarded $50 million in damages against BankAmerica Corp., also in San Francisco. The farm-owner plaintiffs included two octogenarian sisters, longtime BankAmerica customers who kept hundreds of thousands of dollars in low-interest passbook accounts. Furthermore, the sisters, members of a farm family from Sutter County, Calif., are distant relatives of BankAmerica founder A.P. Giannini, who bankrolled thousands of hard-pressed San Francisco residents after the 1906 earthquake.  Four months later, however, the bank told Mr. Conlan that it was pulling out, citing his continuing losses, according to court documents. In exchange for an interest in a second farm, it put off foreclosure proceedings, giving Mr. Conlan a chance to find another lender. But the search for help failed. Without a financial backer, he plowed under 1,000 acres of mixed vegetables, and headed to bankruptcy court, where in 1984 he filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the documents said. The filing blocked the bank; then Mr. Conlan filed the lawsuit against Wells Fargo.
