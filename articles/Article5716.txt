 Weak Dollar Aids Zurich Insurance's Shopping Spree --- Bidder for Kemper Seeks Stronger Life Operations and Global Expansion   By By Margaret Studer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1995  As Zurich Insurance Group prepares to put Kemper Corp. in its U.S. shopping basket, Chief Executive Officer Rolf Hueppi says the weak dollar is making it a lot easier for the Swiss company to realize its global expansion strategy.  While Mr. Hueppi says Zurich may make smaller acquisitions in the U.S. in the future, he adds that basically his U.S. shopping tour will end with Kemper, as it gives Zurich "the position we want in the U.S."  Since 1991, Zurich has bought domestic Swiss insurer, Genfer Versicherungs-Gesellschaft; acquired U.K. insurance company, Municipal Mutual Insurance; and last December, it proposed to take control of Home Holdings Inc. in the U.S. from Sweden's Trygg Hansa. Under that deal, Zurich has proposed to assume the healthy bits of Home Insurance Co.'s portfolio, leaving much of its existing liabilities in a rump company.
