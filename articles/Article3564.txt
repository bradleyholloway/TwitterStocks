 MarketWatch: How the Big Money Picks a Manager   By Burton, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2006  Every money manager Calpers hires must face a rigorous grilling, starting with a long questionnaire probing the firm's investment philosophy and how it aims to deliver solid long-term results. "There's got to be some edge," Ms. [Mary Cottrill] says. "We always ask 'What's the unique characteristic that your firm brings? What differentiates you from your competitors?'"  Some niche strategies, such as picking small stocks, can suffer if managers have too much money to invest effectively. "Our clients aren't concerned about whether a money manager's assets grow," Mr. [Roger Fenningdorf] adds. "They're concerned about performance."  Vanguard does retain 26 outside money managers for its actively run funds, and Mr. [Joe Brennan]'s unit supervises the hiring process. "We see hundreds of potential managers a year," he says. "Passion comes out in how they talk about what they do." Some managers gush about the number of new accounts or revenue their firms reeled in lately. Those aren't the priorities that Vanguard supports, Mr. Brennan says. "Most great managers, you can't shut them up about stocks -- that's all they want to talk about," he says. "Passion comes out in that way."
