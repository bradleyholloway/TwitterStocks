 Start-Up Lures Talent with Creative Pitch; Red 5 Studios Created a Wish List Of Its Ideal Job Candidates and Set Up A Campaign to Woo Each One Online edition  By Covel, Simona, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2007  Red 5 has struggled to compete against established, well-known companies to attract top talent. Traditional postings on industry Web sites didn't generate enough resumes. Placing ads next to big companies' or setting up booths beside them at industry fairs, Mr. [Mark Kern] says, "diminished the perception of the opportunity and didn't do us any good."  Last summer, a company board member quizzed the 39-year-old Mr. Kern about how hiring was going, and, he says, he could answer only that he had ads placed and recruiters working on searches. "The resume flow was very poor," he says. "No one had heard of us." With many competitors trying to double their team size, Mr. Kern adds, "it's pretty tough out there."  While Red 5's project drew the hires and interest hoped for, it was costly and time consuming, Mr. Kern says, and the firm doesn't plan to repeat it anytime soon. "Our resume flow is about 10 times what it was before the campaign," he says. The company lists job openings on its Web site, but it doesn't post paid ads on job sites anymore.
