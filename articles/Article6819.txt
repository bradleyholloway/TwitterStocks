 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: Private Properties   By Reed, Danielle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 2004  THE REAL-ESTATE developer Frank McCourt, who also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, has listed his Brookline, Mass., estate for sale at $22 million. If Mr. McCourt and his wife, Jamie, are able to get close to the asking price for the 4.5-acre property, it will be a record for the Greater Boston area. The current record, $18.5 million, was set in 2001. The McCourts are selling because they will be spending more time on the West Coast, now that Mr. McCourt owns the Los Angeles team.
