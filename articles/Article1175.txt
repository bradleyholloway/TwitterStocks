 New York City Apartment Vacancy Bill Is Slated for Committee Debate Today   By By Neil Barsky, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1989  A bill before a City Council committee would force landlords to put "habitable" apartments on the market within 30 days of vacancy. It would also require landlords to lower the rent on such apartments that aren't leased within 30 days.  The proposal will be debated in a public hearing today before the council's Housing and Buildings Committee. If it manages to get out of committee, the bill has an excellent chance of passage by the council. At that point, supporters would have to muster a two-thirds majority to override an expected veto by Mayor Edward Koch.  The measure is hailed by advocates for the homeless and low- and middle-income tenants. Advocates say that as many as 50,000 apartments are kept vacant by landlords wishing to convert their buildings to cooperatives, which would enable landlords to sell the vacant apartments at market rates. The bill's advocates argue that if those apartments were filled, even by middle-class tenants, the availability of low-income apartments would trickle down to low-income tenants and the homeless.
