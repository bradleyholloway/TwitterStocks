 Small Talk   By Spors, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2007  Don't enlist dealers without ample proof that they are financially responsible. You can check personal credit reports and scores with the three major credit bureaus and business credit ratings through Dun & Bradstreet, www.dnb.com. You also might ask for referrals from past clients. Keep high standards when choosing dealers so you aren't constantly fretting over whether you will get paid.  Mr. [Leonard Sklar] also says businesses should write up a clear payment policy that is signed by the dealers, laying out payment expectations, exactly how you will handle any overdue payments and the consequences of not following it. "You'd be amazed at how effective having a written policy can be at making sure you get paid," he adds.
