 On Sports: Pros See Red Over Augusta Greens   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1988  When it comes to golf's "majors" -- the four annual tournaments the winning of which has become "par" for entrance to the sport's elite -- par has become a battleground, defended by course-proud members of the clubs on which they are contended, and attacked by score-proud pros. If you're a fan, you know that the clubs usually win. The hand that guides the sprinkler and mower rules the scoreboard.  Sandy Lyle, an Englishman by birth and residence but a Scot by blood and choice, won the Masters tournament, a major to the core, by a stroke here Sunday. He did it in dramatic fashion, holing a downhill, 10-foot birdie putt on the 72nd and last hole. That came after he considerately made things exciting for audiences present and unseen by hacking things up a bit on the back nine and squandering a fair-sized lead.  For the previous three days at the Augusta National golfing shrine, however, the news was not the golf but the greens. They were too dry, too short, too hard, too fast, too goldarned difficult, the golfers moaned after watching their putts slide by the cups and their scores soar.
