 Will Nine Different Covers Help Sell a New Paperback?   By By Cynthia Crossen, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1988  In June, Fawcett will publish the paperback book, a novel by feminist writer Marge Piercy, with nine completely different covers. For male readers, there will be a cover depicting a haggard prisoner of war. For the traditional woman, there will be a cover depicting an army nurse shining her shoes. For feminists, a Women's Army Corps photograph. For war buffs, a victory parade. For romantics, a soldier bidding farewell to his girlfriend.  Although other paperback publishers have created as many as five different covers for the same book, the distinction has usually been only in the background color. Beginning in 1971, with the publication in several colors of "Future Shock," by Alvin Toffler, publishing companies have found that they can get more shelf space for slightly different permutations of the same cover. But none has gone so far as "Gone to Soldiers."
