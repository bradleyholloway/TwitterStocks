 Olympic Officials Sue To Get Domain Names From `Cybersquatters'   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2000  Mr. [James L. Bikoff] says the domain names -- some link to pornographic or gambling sites -- can mislead sports fans trying to locate authentic Olympic information. Additionally, he says, the sites may deprive the Olympic movement of revenue it gets from licensing its name to corporate sponsors. The lawyer says the problem continues; since the suit was filed, "there have been about 15 Olympic domain names a day being registered overseas."
