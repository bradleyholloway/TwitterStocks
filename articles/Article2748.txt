 IBM unit in Argentina tangled in a probe of irregular payments   By Friedland, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1995  IBM Corp's Argentina unit, IBM Argentina SA, is under investigation for irregular payments tied to a $250 million contract to modernize computer systems of Banco de la Nacion Argentina. Judicial investigators allege that IBM Argentina paid $14 million of the contract value to a shell company called Capacitacion y Computacion Rural SA, which, in turn, paid nearly $6 million to phantom firms. They suspect either a tax-evasion scheme or bribery of government officials.
