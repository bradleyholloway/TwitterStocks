 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2005  A: The answers are in IRS "Revenue Procedure 2004-71." For example, the deduction for each personal exemption for the 2005 tax year is $3,200. That's up from $3,100 for the 2004 tax year.  You may lose some or all of the deduction for your exemptions if your income tops a certain amount. This is known as the "personal exemption phase-out," which tax gurus call one of the "stealth" or "backdoor" taxes. For example, if you're married filing a joint return, the personal-exemption phase-out begins for the 2005 tax year when adjusted gross income exceeds $218,950. For most singles, the phase-out begins above $145,950.  The extra standard-deduction amounts for the elderly and for the blind are $1,000 each. These amounts rise to $1,250 "if the individual is also unmarried and not a surviving spouse," the IRS says.
