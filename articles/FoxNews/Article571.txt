Eastern  Further lessening of the cold over the Great Plains is the biggest weather news Saturday. A northward difflection of the jet stream is blocking any fresh inflow of cold air while at the same time fostering warming chinook winds eastward from the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Early afternoon temperatures are above freezing, even above 40 degrees, from Montana east into Minnesota. Farther south, the waming is less dramatic in comparison to normal temperatures for the time of year, yet it is significant. Eastward from the Mississippi River, the feel of the weather, in short, is still wintry. But things have quieted down along the Eastern Seaboard, and sun is shining over much of the South. Meantime, broad low pressure over the Midwest and adjacent Canada is bringing blustery weather having showers of snow and even even from Minnesota and Iowa east to Michigan. In the West, stagnant high pressure is bringing its usual weather quirks such as stubborn cold in the valleys and basins westward from the Rocky Mountain Divide. Then there is the "tule" fog fillling much of the California Great Valley, and the fog that was locally icy this morning in the Pacific Northwest. Low pressure off Southern Calfornia was being attacked by dry air out of the Southwest and so was failing to deliver any meaningful rain.  WEATHER ALMANAC 1878 Baltimore City — 28.73" barometric pressure - Dec. record.  1970 Madison, WI — 16.0" snow, greatest 24 hour snowfall for city (10th-14th).
