Eastern  A cold front sweeping through the East is bringing from the western Ohio Valley northward into eastern New England. The showers will continue to march eastward this afternoon, but will begin to diminish as the front encounters a dry air mass over the East Coast. This dry air is making for yet another warm and sunny day along the East Coast from New England to the Carolinas. Rain and a few thunderstorms are firing along the central Gulf Coast as a storm system races toward the Florida Panhandle. Thunderstorms are also firing in parts of the Florida peninsula as tropical moisture is lifting northward into the region. High pressure is promoting plenty of sunshine across the nation's midsection with warm air surging northward across the Plains. The Southwest will remain warm and dry. An offshore flow is beginning to weaken across Southern California, but is still going to be very warm this afternoon with plenty of sunshine. It is a different story across the Northwest, where yet another storm system is moving off the North Pacific bringing rain to the region and heavy snow in the higher elevations. Some mountain locations have picked up nearly a foot of snow in northern Idaho and western Montana.
