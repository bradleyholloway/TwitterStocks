Eastern  The main weather event this afternoon is occurring along the Northwest coast as a storm system over the northern Pacific Ocean sends yet another band of heavy rain and high winds toward the region. The heaviest rain is falling over northern California with lighter rain moving into Washington and Oregon. In addition to the rain and wind, rough surf is pounding much of the West Coast. The highest wave action is from northern California to Washington, but high waves are also moving onto the Southern California coast. Elsewhere, the weather is fairly tranquil from the Rockies to the East Coast. A weak upper-level disturbance is managing to trigger a few showers in northeastern Texas; otherwise, the rest of the Plains is mainly sunny with moderating temperatures. The sunshine extends all the way through the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states, but a chilly flow of air from the north is keeping early afternoon temperatures in the 40s and low 50s from the Carolinas to the Gulf Coast. Farther north, a cold wind is blowing across the Great Lakes and New England. Lake-effect snow is not widespread, but a few bands are set up off the western shores of the lakes.
