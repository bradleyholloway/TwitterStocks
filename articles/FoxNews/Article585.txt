Eastern  A significant snowstorm is slowly winding down across the Northeast. Cold air has been in short supply with this system, resulting in mainly rain right at the coast, but interior sections of the Northeast, particularly in southern New England, were walloped by 6-15 inches of heavy wet snow during the last 24 hours. This storm system will slowly head off the coast tonight, allowing the remaining rain and snow to end. Across the West, drier weather is finally taking hold after the sixth wettest day ever in Fresno, California, yesterday. While storm systems will continue to bring rain and snow to northern California and the Pacific Northwest over the next several days, a strengthening ridge of upper-level high pressure is building across the Southwest. This will prevent any additional storms from affecting central and Southern California anytime soon. Warm and dry weather will persist across the southern Plains, keeping conditions ripe for more grass fires.
