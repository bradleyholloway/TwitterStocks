Eastern  The most active weather this afternoon can be found in the Southeast where a tropical low pressure system slowly drifts to the northwest off the Atlantic coast of Florida. As this system approaches the Southeast coast it will produce heavy rain and thunderstorms from the Carolinas to George. Later tonight, this same storm will be close enough to the coast to produce rough surf with higher-than-normal tides and dangerous rip currents. Elsewhere in the East, the heat and humidity will be on the rise from the Midwest to the Northeast with most locations climbing well into the 90s. An interesting note is that temperatures this weekend across the Northeast are running 20 to 30 degrees warmer than last weekend when afternoon temperatures topped out in the 60s and 70s. Thunderstorms are beginning to fire from the Upper Midwest into the northern Plains as a cold front collides with hot, humid air. High-elevation thunderstorms are also forming over the Rockies. The Southwest remains hot, while the Northwest cools down behind a cold front that is moving into the northern Rockies.
