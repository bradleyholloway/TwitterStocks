Eastern  A look at the national weather shows an active weather pattern across the northern Rockies and Upper Midwest. A storm system entering the northern Plains is producing showers and thunderstorms across a large area from the mountains of Montana and Wyoming eastward across the Dakotas and toward the western Great Lakes. Meanwhile, a storm system poised over the northern Pacific Ocean is bringing a new round of rain into the Northwest. This system will bring more unsettled weather to the Northwest over the next few days. In the East, thunderstorms continue along the eastern Gulf Coast and near the Southeast coast as a frontal system stalls out across the region. A large area of high pressure anchored over the northern Ohio Valley is producing plenty of sunshine from the Midwest to the Deep South. This same high pressure system is helping to funnel cool air into the Northeast and dry air into the South, while at the same time producing a warm southerly flow across the central Plains. The Desert Southwest remains warm under a mainly sunny sky.  WEATHER ALMANAC 1883 Rapid City, SD — First day of 3 day flood in Black Hills.
