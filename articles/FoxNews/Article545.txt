Eastern  Saturday, a storm is gathering east of New England and south of Nova Scotia, Canada. Outer rain and wet snow have been chilling the coast of Maine to Massachusetts. Although some clouds are lingering elsewhere in the Northeast, the rest of the nation's eastern half is under the settling, drying spell of strong high pressure spread between the Great Lakes and the southern tier of states. Having affording a wide area with bright sunshine today, this high was set to make for another rather cold night including another bout of frosts and freezes. Farther west, southerly wind flow quickening about the western rim of the sprawling high is boosting moisture and cloudiness over the Plains. Showers have been found most widely in a belt from eastern Colorado to the Dakotas. Moistening from the west, not the south, is the cause for clouds and spotty rains from the Pacific Northwest east to the Rockies. Snow has been confined to the higher ground. Drying wind flow farther south is filling most skies with sunshine over the southern half of California and the heart of the Desert Southwest.
