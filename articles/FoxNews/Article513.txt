Eastern  Hurricane Katrina churned in the southeastern Gulf yesterday as it moved farther away from the Florida coastline and takes aim at the central Gulf of Mexico coastline. In Katrina's wake, tranquility returned to storm-weary South Florida. In the meantime, withering heat has once again spread over the South from Georgia and Florida, west to Texas. The northern rim of this heat helped to produce a few strong, drenching thunderstorms. Moisture from the Atlantic has bolstered some showers with hit-or-miss thunderstorms from the Carolinas, northward and inland to the eastern Great Lakes. Along differing lines, a wide area of the nation's middle has trended drier and moderate thanks to a cooler flow out of central Canada. Across the Intermountain West, the tendency is towards hotter weather with some locations in the Desert Southwest nearing record high temperatures. Other than stray thunderstorms in and about the southern Rockies, most of the west was dry with plenty of sunshine.
