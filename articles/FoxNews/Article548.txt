Eastern  A large area of high pressure situated over the Carolinas this afternoon is promoting bright sunshine from the Southeast to New England. A southwest flow, on the backside of this high, is pushing unseasonably mild air into the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. High temperatures will easily top out in the upper 60s and lower 70s in many locations which is a good 10-15 degrees above normal. Elsewhere, clouds associated with a cold front extend from the Great Lakes to Texas. Underneath these clouds, rain is falling on the mid-Mississippi Valley and thunderstorms are rumbling across western Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma and central and northeastern Texas. The storms in Texas have had a history of producing damaging wind gusts and hail. Meanwhile, gusty Santa Ana winds are blowing across southern California. These dry winds will boost high temperatures into the upper 80s and low 90s across most of the Los Angeles Basin. In contrast, a cool rain is falling over parts of the Northwest.
