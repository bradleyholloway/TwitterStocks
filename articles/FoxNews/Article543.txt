Eastern  The nor'easter that brought all the rain, wind and snow Tuesday will move toward Nova Scotia Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night. This will bring more windy conditions to New England along with a few showers. It will be cold enough for snow showers across interior parts of New England Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night, but little to no additional accumulation is expected. A cold flow off the Great Lakes is responsible for plenty of clouds and a few showers across the Great Lakes, but high pressure is dominating the weather across the Plains, bringing sunshine and warmer conditions. Another storm system is moving through the Northwest, bringing some clouds and a few showers, but high pressure is in control of the weather across the Desert Southwest with plenty of sunshine and a pleasantly warm afternoon. Temperatures across the Desert Southwest will top off in the 70s and 80s Wednesday afternoon. High pressure continues to bring dry conditions to Florida, but it is still cool for this time of year.
