Eastern  A cluster of strong to locally severe thunderstorms is making its way across the Ohio Valley this afternoon. Another batch of strong to locally severe thunderstorms is over northeastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri. Both of these areas of thunderstorms have had a history of producing blinding downpours, hail, damaging winds and deadly lightning today. Typical summertime thunderstorms have begun to blossom across the Southeast this afternoon. The greatest concentration of thunderstorms is along a stationary frontal boundary that stretches from southern Louisiana to northern Florida. Flooding downpours are likely along this front this afternoon. There are a couple of showers wetting the northern Plains, where temperatures are running well below normal. Much of the rest of the nation is experiencing quiet weather this afternoon. Bright sunshine and seasonable heat across the Southwest will continue to hinder firefighting efforts. Plenty of sunshine will make for a warm afternoon across the interior Northwest.
