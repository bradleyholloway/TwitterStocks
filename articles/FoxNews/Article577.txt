Eastern  The most active weather in the nation this afternoon is across the Northwest. Rain continues to fall along the coasts of Washington and Oregon with snow in the Cascades. In between the coastline and the Cascades, a pocket of below freezing air remains trapped across western Washington and western Oregon. As a result, places like Eugene, Oregon, and Salem, Oregon, reported sleet and freezing rain this morning. This led to dozens of car accidents across western Oregon this morning. Part of Interstate 5 had to be closed because of such accidents. Rain continues to fall, heavy at times, across far northern California too, with snow in the mountains. Elsewhere, much of the rest of the nation is having dry weather this afternoon. A couple of showers are wetting South Florida, while snow showers are occurring in parts of the Northeast. Unseasonably cold air encompasses a large part of the country from the northern Rockies through the Plains and Midwest into the Northeast.
