Eastern  The cold front that triggered heavy rain over the Northeast last night is finally moving off the East Coast. Behind the front cold, Canadian air is still pouring into the northern Plains and Great Lakes region. As this cold air flows across the lake, some light lake-effect snow is being produced downwind. The Southeast has cooled down and dried out, but the cold air will aim at the Northeast tonight. Another storm system, which produced heavy snow in the Rockies last night, is exiting into the central Plains this afternoon. While snow amounts are not heavy, there will still be enough moisture to work with to produce a quick inch or two of snow tonight as the storm heads toward the Midwest. The best weather in the nation can be found across the Southwest with plenty of sunshine and mild temperatures. A moist flow off the Pacific continues to bring cloudy weather to the Northwest. Later tonight, a powerful storm over the central Pacific will aim at the northern California coast, bringing another soaking rain, gusty coastal winds and heavy mountain snows to the region.
