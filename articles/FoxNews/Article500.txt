Eastern  Thunderstorms are firing ahead of a cold front sweeping through the Northeast and Ohio Valley this afternoon. With warm and very humid air ahead of the front, these storms will be capable of producing very heavy downpours in addition to strong gusty winds. Behind the front the air is not much cooler, but is much less humid, thus giving folks a break from a long stretch of hot, humid weather as Hurricane Dennis gradually fell apart over the region last week. Farther south the hot, tropical air mass remains in place over the Southeast and Deep South. With daytime heating at its peak, air mass thunderstorms are widely scattered across the area. The big story is Hurricane Emily. While she is not going to make landfall in the U.S., the storm will come close enough to bring heavy rain and tropical-storm force winds to extreme southern Texas. Currently a few bands of thunderstorms are beginning to move into the Texas coast. The western half of the country is dry with plenty of sunshine. A few dry thunderstorms will pop up over the mountains, and may trigger new wild fires. With sunshine and dry air in place, the Southwest continues to cook. Most of the region is above 100 this afternoon and some of the typically hot desert locations will be in the 110s and 120s.
