Eastern  A cold front stretches southwestward from Michigan to the Oklahoma Panhandle this afternoon. To the south and east of this front, another warm afternoon is occurring thanks to high pressure sitting over the western Atlantic. A clockwise flow around the high is transporting warm air from the Deep South as far north as the eastern Great Lakes and southern New England. Temperatures this afternoon will top out in the 60s and low 70s as far north as Michigan, New York and Connecticut. Highs in the 80s and low 90s will be common across Oklahoma and Texas. North of the cold front, the weather is not as delightful. Clouds currently cover much of the northern Plains, where a couple of showers are occurring. Temperatures will climb no higher than the 40s across most of the Dakotas and Minnesota. Clouds are also plentiful across the northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Another bout of rain and gusty winds has begun to impact western Washington and western Oregon. High pressure over the Southwest is promoting bright sunshine from New Mexico to Southern California.
