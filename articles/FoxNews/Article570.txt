Eastern  Heavy snow continues to fall from interior Massachusetts northward to eastern Maine this afternoon thanks to a storm system sitting off Cape Cod. This storm system is the same one responsible for blanketing much of the Northeast with an average of 5-10 inches of snow Thursday night into this morning. The snow along the New England coast will be ending late this afternoon. Meanwhile, in the wake of the storm, a cold gusty wind will continue to blow across New York state and the mid-Atlantic region. Elsewhere, shower activity has ended across southern California this afternoon as a storm system backs westward, away from the coast. More chilly conditions are found across the Lone Star state where highs are only in the 30s and low 40s as far south as the Mexican border. The normal high in far southern Texas is around 71 degrees this time of year. A gusty wind blowing across Montana is helping to moderate temperatures across the northern Rockies and the Dakotas.
