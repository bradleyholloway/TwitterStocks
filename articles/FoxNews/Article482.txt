Eastern  Rain associated with Tropical Storm Arlene has begun to wet southern and western Florida this afternoon. The winds, although not all that strong as of yet, have begun to gust past 30 mph across South Florida. Summerlike warmth and humidity continues to be felt across the eastern half of the nation this afternoon. This warmth and humidity has sparked numerous showers and thunderstorms, some heavy, from the central and southern Plains northeastward into New England. The strongest thunderstorms are flashing over West Texas, where large hail and damaging winds have been reported. An unseasonably cool air mass continues to cover the northern Plains and the northern and central Rockies this afternoon thanks to a low pressure system overhead. This upper-level low is responsible for rain and thunderstorm activity across Colorado and northern New Mexico. Farther west, sunshine is plentiful across the Desert Southwest and interior portions of California.  WEATHER ALMANAC 1816 Plymouth, CT — Laundry laid out on grass to dry; found frozen stiff.
