Eastern  A soaking rain is occurring this afternoon across the mid-Atlantic region. Already today, numerous locations across Maryland, Delaware, northern Virginia and southern New Jersey have picked up between 2-4 inches of rain due to a persistent easterly fetch of moisture off the Atlantic ocean. This rain is also holding temperatures well below normal in this region. Normally, highs in late May are in the middle 70s; today's highs will only reach the low- to mid-50s. Further south, a cold front crossing the Southeast is causing showers and strong thunderstorms from eastern North Carolina into Georgia and Alabama. High pressure along the coast is allowing for some sunshine across New England with comfortable temperatures, mainly in the 60s. Much of the rest of the nation is experiencing dry weather this afternoon with the exception of a couple of showers over the Pacific Northwest. High pressure anchored over the Desert Southwest is responsible for summerlike warmth from the central and southern Plains westward through the Four Corners region into southern California. Highs will eclipse the 90-degree mark across much of the Plains while a few 110-degree readings are possible in the Desert Southwest.
