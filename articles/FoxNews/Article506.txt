However, a southerly flow around this high is bringing a return to hot conditions across the northern Plains. An upper-level disturbance is located over the southeastern part of the nation. This disturbance is combining with plenty of moisture to trigger showers and drenching thunderstorms across the Southeast. The heaviest rain is falling in southern Alabama as well as the Florida Panhandle. Some thunderstorms will likely cause flash flooding, making traveling difficult Friday afternoon and Friday evening. Plenty of moisture will continue to affect the Rockies as well as the Southwest this afternoon triggering more showers and thunderstorms.
