Eastern  Lake-effect snow will continue to fall downwind of the Great Lakes in the wake of a nor-eastern that continues to churn northeastward well off the northern New England coast. Behind this system a strong cold front has moved off the East Coast, allowing cold air to filter all the way down into the deep south, were temperatures are in the 40s and 50s. However, the real cold air is centered farther north. An arctic high pressure system has unleashed bitterly cold into the northern tier of states extending from the northern Rockies to the western Great Lakes. Most locations in this region are stuck in the single digits with a few places in Montana struggling to even reach zero. This cold air will settling into the nation's heartland tonight with reading well below zero. In the meantime a storm over the southern Rockies is producing snow from Colorado and northern Utah to Wyoming and western Montana. This storm will eventually move into the southern Plains and head east as the week progresses. Out West, the weather remains mild and dry over the Southwest, but clouds are starting to move into the Northwest ahead of a storm system moving in off the northern Pacific.
