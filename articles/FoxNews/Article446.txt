Eastern  A storm moving out onto the central Plains is causing a large swath of rain from Texas to Nebraska eastward into Missouri and Arkansas. A few thunderstorms are imbedded in the area of rain over central Texas. High pressure is bringing a comfortable day to the Southeast, but cold air is drilling into the Northeast. The passage of the cold air over the Great Lakes has resulted in lake-effect snow across northern and western New York. The Midwest and northern Plains are mild and dry, but moisture moving into the Northwest and northern Rockies is resulting in some showers and mountain snow. The southern Rockies is rather cloudy with some rain scattered across Arizona and New Mexico. California and Nevada are generally rain-free and mild.
