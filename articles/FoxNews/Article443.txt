Eastern  A storm system moving through the eastern Great Lakes is spreading rainfall through New York and northern New England. The rain will cause some of the snowpack in the area to melt. Extreme northern Maine had some freezing rain at the onset of the precipitation before quickly turning to plain rain. Another storm system is beginning to exit the Rockies after bringing some heavy snow to the higher elevations. This snow will continue to spread eastward through Kansas and Nebraska and into the Midwest through time. High pressure building southward from Canada is finally allowing some cold air to intrude across the northern Plains. This cold shot has brought an end to a streak where many places for the first week of February were 15-20 degrees above average. A ridge of high pressure has built over the Northwest and will bring several days of dry and pleasant weather to the region. Above average temperatures will remain in place across the Southeast for today with high pressure hanging tough just off of the coast.
