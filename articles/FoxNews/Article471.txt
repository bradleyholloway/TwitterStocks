Eastern  A steady rain continues across Maine this afternoon as a storm system lingers off the New England coast. Rainfall totals across Maine over the past 24 hours have been on the order of 1.00-2.00 inches. The storm system has moved far enough off the coast to allow sunshine to return to western New York state and much of Pennsylvania this afternoon. These areas have experienced damp, unseasonably cool weather since Monday. High pressure over Tennessee is providing the remainder of the East Coast with plenty of sunshine and pleasantly warm temperatures this afternoon. A storm system over Ontario, Canada, is responsible for showers and thundershowers over the Dakotas and Minnesota. Rain and some embedded thunderstorms are affecting central Texas. High pressure is providing most of the West with bright sunshine this afternoon. While comfortable temperatures are found across the Northwest, the Desert Southwest will bake under 100-degree heat again today.
