Eastern  Rain and mountain snow continues to bombard northern California, western Oregon and western Washington this afternoon thanks to a storm system moving toward British Columbia, Canada. Snow levels are currently running about 5,000 feet in the Washington and Oregon Cascades to 8,000 feet in the Sierra of northern California. Below this level, moderate to occasionally heavy rain is soaking places like Redding, California, in the northern Sacramento Valley. Milder air continues to spill eastward from the northern and central Rockies into the Plains and Midwest this afternoon thanks to the series of storm systems that have tracked onland from the Pacific Ocean lately. Elsewhere, the chill is still on across the Northeast. The Southeast remains a little cooler than normal, as well, despite a good deal of sunshine.
