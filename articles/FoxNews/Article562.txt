Eastern  Almost as fast as it swept into the Midwest at mid week, the core of a harsh, wintry cold shot is scooting eastwards allowing marked warming to take hold of the nation's mid sector. Versus the same time yesterday, temperatures have recovered 15, 20 and even 25 degrees today in such states as Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. Warming has been slower farther north, and the Northeast as remained cold, albeit with less wind. Meantime, as part of broad southerly flow promoting warming over the nation middle, rain with thundery downpours has broken out over eastern Texas and is spreading into Louisiana and southern Arkansas. In the West, a vigorous, yet moisture-starved and diffuse, weather system, in effect a strong cold front, is over the interior aimed for the Rockies. Snow and, east of the Rockies locally rain, have been rather spotty with this weather maker, yet snowfall has been locally substantially over the high country. Cold, gusty winds made themselves known. Farther south, dry and gusty winds have returned to the mountains and high deserts of Southern California, thereby heightening once again the threat of wild fire.
