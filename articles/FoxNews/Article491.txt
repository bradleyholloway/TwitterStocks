Eastern  A potent cold front pushing into the East this afternoon is igniting thunderstorm activity across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. Likewise, thunderstorms ahead of this front are widespread from eastern Tennessee and northern Alabama, through the lower Mississippi Valley, into northeast Texas. The thunderstorms across the Deep South have had a history of producing large hail, damaging winds and downpours. Behind the cold front, pleasant weather has invaded the Great Lakes and Midwest where temperatures are rising into the 70s and low 80s with low humidity. A couple of thunderstorms have begun to develop across the western High Plains this afternoon from western North Dakota southward to eastern Colorado. Any thunderstorm in this region will be capable of damaging wind gusts and large hail. Across the West, another sunny, dry and warm day is occurring. High temperatures in southwestern Arizona and southeastern California will exceed 110 degrees.
