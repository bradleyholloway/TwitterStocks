Eastern  An area of high pressure over the Midwest is promoting relatively quiet weather across the eastern two-thirds of the nation this afternoon. Clouds are currently blanketing the Northeast and are plentiful across the eastern Great Lakes and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. Underneath these clouds, temperatures are being held well below normal. Temperatures are currently in the 30s and 40s across the Northeast with 50s common from Ohio to Tennessee. Despite a good amount of sunshine, much of the Southeast has cooler-than-normal conditions as well. Meanwhile, bright sunshine is helping to warm the Plains well into the 60s. A storm system over Idaho is bringing clouds to areas from the northern Rockies to central California. Beneath the clouds, some rain is falling. Additional rain can be found across parts of central and South Texas.  WEATHER ALMANAC 1764 Rutland, MA — "...very high wind...snow fell 22 inches deep."
