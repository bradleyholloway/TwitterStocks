Eastern  High pressure centered over Maryland is responsible for a delightful afternoon from the central Plains and Midwest into the mid-Atlantic states. In these areas, bright sunshine is boosting temperatures into the 70s. A cool air mass covers the Northeast where temperatures are only running in the 50s and 60s this afternoon. Showers and thunderstorms have begun to fire along a stationary frontal boundary over southern Georgia and northern Florida. The extreme heat has eased some across south Texas. Due to the passage of a cold front, high temperatures will only reach the mid- to upper 90s this afternoon instead the mid-100s. Elsewhere, warmer air has surged into the eastern Rockies this afternoon allowing temperatures to return to the 70s and 80s. Some rain associated with a cold front is falling across the Pacific Northwest. The heat that gripped Los Angeles Basin yesterday is not quite as bad today.
