Eastern  A storm system, rich with tropical moisture, advanced from southeastern Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley and later into the Southeast and Tennessee Valley yesterday. Heavy rain inundated parts of Texas and Louisiana, with a few locations pounded by more than 10 inches of rain. Conroe, Texas, just north of Houston, received 11.49 inches of rain on Monday. This heavy rain led to three fatalities in the Houston metro area as a man and separately 2 women had their vehicles succumbed to flash flooding. At least 10 tornadoes swept through eastern Texas and Louisiana on Monday, while thunderstorms also produced damaging wind gusts across these same areas and into western Mississippi. These thunderstorms knocked down tree limbs, damaged cars and houses, knocked an 18-wheeler off the road and caused numerous power outages. As this rain spread eastward it was welcome in drought areas, but too much falling too quickly lead to flooding. By Monday evening, this rain reached the Great Lakes and into the Virginias and western mid-Atlantic states. High pressure brought a dry day across the Northeast and down the Appalachians into the Carolinas and Georgia, but as this high shifted into northern New England, clouds overspread the East in advance of the southern Plains storm system. Another storm system passed from the Rockies in Montana, then into the northern Plains. A few showers and thunderstorms ahead of the leading edge of colder air associated with this storm system passed through the Plains, with one such cluster of thunderstorms bringing hail to parts of southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas. This same storm system brought snow to Montana, with 4-8 inches falling across the western mountains of Montana. The snow later shifted into parts of Wyoming and will later reach Colorado. Cool air continued to push southward along the Pacific coast. The most significant temperature departures were across the interior, with highs as much as 15 degrees below normal. Monday was dry across the Southwest after rain passed through this past weekend.
