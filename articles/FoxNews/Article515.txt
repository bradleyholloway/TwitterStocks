Eastern  Tropical Rainstorm Katrina has moved into southeastern Canada with some lingering rain in parts of New England. In the wake of the storm, much drier air will move into the Northeast, allowing for plenty of sunshine and warm temperatures. Dry weather has also settled into the Midwest, Ohio Valley and into the Southeast.  A cold front is moving through the Plains states and into the Upper Midwest, but has very little moisture to work with, and will result in generally nothing more than a few clouds. The exception will be areas near the Canadian border where there will be enough moisture to squeeze out a few showers. A couple of afternoon showers and thunderstorms will also pop up in southeastern Texas.  The western half of the nation is quiet with generally dry conditions thanks to a ridge of high pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. There will be some clouds along coastal areas with a fair amount of sunshine elsewhere.
