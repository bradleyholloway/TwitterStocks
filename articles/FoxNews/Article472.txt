Eastern  Showers and thunderstorms are erupting this afternoon ahead of a cold front across western New York and northern Pennsylvania. Clouds continue to shroud much of northern New England thanks to a storm system lingering off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. A storm system over south-central Canada is responsible for numerous showers over the eastern Dakotas, Minnesota and the Great Lakes region. Additional showers with some embedded thunderstorms are affecting parts of Kansas and Oklahoma. Across the Southeast, sunshine is mixing with some clouds where a seasonably warm afternoon is occurring. In the West, an area of high pressure over the northern Rockies is responsible for dry weather from Colorado and Utah westward into California. Isolated thunderstorms have begun to bubble up over parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Another hot afternoon is on tap for the Desert Southwest where high temperatures will exceed 100 degrees once again.
