Eastern  Keystone to the nation's weather today has been low pressure gathering over the central Plains after dropping bursts of snow upon the Colorado Rockies. As of early afternoon, clouds and showers have spread eastward from the central High Plains to the upper Mississippi River Valley; however, further strengthening of the low along with access to Midwestern moisture will, through the late afternoon and evening, boost potential for an outbreak of strong, potentially severe, thunderstorms beginning over Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and southern Wisconsin. The other focus for unsettled weather has once again been upon the Pacific Northwest, where heavy clouds laden with rain have been streaming ashore in Washington, Oregon and northernmost California. Eestward from the Cascade Range, precipitation has been thinning out greatly as it often does. Elsewhere, the eastern half of the nation has been dominated by mild, if not warm, weather having very few instances of rain. And from the southern Plains to the Desert Southwest, it has been bright, warm and sunny.
