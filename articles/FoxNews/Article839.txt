Eastern  A upper level low that has been over the south-central plains for over two weeks continues to produce problems. Yesterday, heavy thunderstorms dropped close to 10 inches of rain (9.86 inches) in Corpus Christi, Texas and 3.44 inches at Victoria, Texas. Tuesday, this low is still meandering around north-central Texas and is causing additional showers and locally heavy thunderstorms over portions of that already soggy state. Additional heavy rains from this afternoon through tonight will likely cause more flooding problems. Heavy showers and thunderstorms also affected portions of Florida on Monday dropping 1 to 2 inches of rain. A weak low and stationary front over the northern portion of that state is the reason for the heavy storms yesterday, with more likely late this afternoon into tonight. Severe thunderstorms late yesterday into last night brought some impressive hail to portions of Montana, North and South Dakota, and western Nebraska along with strong and gusty winds. Hail as large as tennis balls fell near Gordon, Nebraska and Hays, Montana with many reports of golf ball size hail and wind gusts past 50 and 60 mph in this area. Today, locally severe thunderstorms are likely farther east from Wisconsin and Minnesota southeast to central and eastern Nebraska. Most of the West is dry and the heat is building over interior sections. Record highs were set from Denver, Colorado to Ramona, California on Monday. More records will be set today and over the next several days in the west as the heat builds north into the interior Northwest and northern Rockies.
