Eastern  Winter's grip has come early as witnessed by today's chill, which spanned the full breadth of the nation across the Northeast, the Midwest, the Plains and the West. As snows in the lee of the Great Lakes have waned, steadier snows, mostly light, have made their way eastward from Minnesota and Wisconsin southwest to northern Kansas and eastern Colorado. Snows over the interior West, between the Cascade Range and the Rockies, have been spotty over valleys, but locally substantial higher up. California and the Desert Southwest have cleared and dried with cool northerly wind flow taking hold. Contrasting starkly with the northern chill, the central south, especially Texas, has warmed markedly owing to strong southerly flow south of a cold front. as of mid day, the contrast in temperature in Oklahoma, for instances, was from near 80 degrees along the Red River to the 30s in the state's Panhandle. The contrast was helping to drive strong, gusty winds eastward from New Mexico to West Texas. These dry winds have held single-digit relative humidity today at Carlsbad, New Mexico.
