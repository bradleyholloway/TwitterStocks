Eastern  A large high pressure system is anchored off the Northeast coast this afternoon. This high pressure system is responsible for plenty of bright sunshine from the central Appalachians northward to Maine. In addition, the bright sunshine is boosting temperatures well above normal in these locations. Temperatures will continue to rise into the upper 70s and lower 80s later this afternoon. Warm and sticky conditions are found from the Gulf Coast northward through the mid-Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes. Not only is the humidity high in these locations, but high temperatures will top out well into the 80s and low 90s. A cold front separates the unusually warm and humid air in the Midwest from much cooler and damp conditions that are found over the Dakotas, northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Much of the northern Rockies will only have high temperatures in the 30s and 40s with snow showers in the highest mountains. Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Otis is bringing some high clouds to portions of Arizona and New Mexico.  WEATHER ALMANAC 1841 New England — Great October Gale -- Nantucket's worst.
