Eastern  Rain and thunderstorms will spread from Florida to Maine today as moisture continues to pump into the East from the Gulf of Mexico. A storm system centered over the Great Lakes region, as well as its associated cold front, are responsible for the wet weather. Rain and thunderstorms will push slowly eastward across the Florida panhandle, Appalachians and Atlantic Coastal regions with a few showers lingering behind over the Great Lakes. Although the rain is needed across much of the region, a steady moderate to heavy rain over portions of the Middle Atlantic and New England may lead to some flooding problems. Elsewhere, a weak disturbance is bringing unneeded rain to Northern California. Showers will fall from the central Valley to the Oregon border, further dampening the already soaked region. A few rain and mountain snow showers will also spread across the northern Rockies in portions of Idaho and Montana. In contrast to the wet weather, an upper-level ridge of high pressure will bring warm and sunny weather to the Plains, allowing for a quite pleasant afternoon.
