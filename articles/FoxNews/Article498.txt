Eastern  A warm, very moist air mass continues to encompass a large portion of the nation this afternoon, stretching from the Ohio Valley southward to the Gulf Coast. This sticky air mass is fueling showers and drenching thunderstorms across a large portion of the Ohio Valley, mid-Atlantic, Southeast and lower Mississippi Valley. The greatest concentration of drenching thunderstorms extends from the Texas coast northeastward into Alabama, Georgia and northern Florida. Meanwhile, New England is experiencing a break in the high humidity today thanks to the passage of a cold front. Another warm afternoon is moving across the Plains. A ridge of high pressure covering the Rocky Mountain states is promoting another very warm to hot afternoon from interior Oregon, Idaho and Montana southward to Arizona and New Mexico. Some mountainous locations across this region will have a little relief from the heat this afternoon and evening in the form of a cooling thunderstorm. High temperatures in the deserts of Arizona and southeastern California will exceed 110 degrees again.
