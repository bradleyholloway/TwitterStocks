Eastern  A potent, fast-moving clipper system will bring a swath of snow across the lower Great Lakes into the northern mid-Atlantic Wednesday night into Thursday morning. A general 1-3 inches of snow is expected across southern New York, northern Pennsylvania, as well as western and central Pennsylvania, southward across the higher terrain of West Virginia and extreme western Virginia. Locally, as much as 6 inches can fall across the Laurel Mountains of western Pennsylvania. Behind this system, cold, northwesterly winds will produce heavy lake-effect snow downwind of the Great Lakes through Thanksgiving Day. Snow will also spread across much of New England Thanksgiving Day. Much of the Southeast and central and southern Plains will have dry weather for Thanksgiving Day. High pressure will promote generally clear and dry weather across much of the west into Thanksgiving Day. However, some high clouds will spread across the Four Corner states.
