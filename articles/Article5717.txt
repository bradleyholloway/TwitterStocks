 New Orleans Has Its Eye On Atlanta's Freaknik   By By Kevin G. Salwen and Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1995  Atlanta may have found its solution: hand off Freaknik to New Orleans. While there has been no formal request from Atlanta, a spokeswoman for New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial says the two mayors have discussed the issue privately at several events. New Orleans officials see Freaknik as a possible long-term addition to the exploding market in that city for huge festivals, capped off by Mardi Gras and the jazz festival.  In a related move, three independent promoters wrote Mayor Morial last week asking him to adopt Freaknik for New Orleans. The promoters -- Jerry Roebuck from Black Expo USA in Atlanta, Corky Reams from ARC Inc. in Chicago and Steve Muhammad from Next Step Productions in Decatur, Ga. -- have offered to help plan events in New Orleans.  That's not to say a switch would happen anytime soon. The New Orleans spokeswoman, Michele Moore, says her city is planning "to look at any proposal with some balance." At issue would be whether Freaknik would be held on a weekend that doesn't already have another major event booked, whether some "real solid [entertainment] activities" could be planned, and whether the city could handle the demand for hotel rooms. (New Orleans has about 30,000 hotel rooms, less than half of the number in Atlanta.)
