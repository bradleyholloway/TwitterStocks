 Climbing to the Top of Black Businesses   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1999  That might not bother him, but some in the black business community say there is too little high-tech presence on the ranking of the Top 100 African-American-owned industrial and service businesses, annually prepared by Black Enterprise magazine. Just 6% of the list's overall sales come from technology-related companies -- compared with 20% for the 100 largest U.S. corporations.  The Black Enterprise Top 100, announced Saturday night at a conference hosted by the magazine in Orlando, Fla., is dominated by basic businesses that have become mainstays for black ownership: Grocers and other food companies, beauty-care products and minority-targeted publishing and music. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of this newspaper, was a sponsor of the conference.)  Front and center now is Mr. Llewellyn, the only African-American among the 100 or so U.S. bottlers of Coke. His firm is Coca-Cola Co.'s fifth-largest American bottler. Taking into account car dealerships, which Black Enterprise ranks separately, only one black-owned business actually eclipses Mr. Llewellyn's in the U.S. It's led by former Detroit Lions football star Mel Farr Sr., whose chain of Midwest auto dealerships posted $596 million in sales last year.
