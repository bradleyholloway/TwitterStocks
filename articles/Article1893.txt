 Hewlett, Microsoft To Develop Program Despite Apple Suit   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1988  PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. said it reached an agreement with Microsoft Corp. to further develop and market a product that is the target of a suit by Apple Computer Co.  Apple filed suit in March challenging two "operating environment" programs -- Microsoft's Windows and Hewlett-Packard's NewWave. Operating environments provide visual displays on the computer screen using various icons to make the machine easier to use.  Apple charges that certain software sold by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard infringe on copyrights that Apple holds for the way its popular Macintosh computer uses graphics.
