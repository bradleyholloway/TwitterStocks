 Futures Markets: Bond Prices Plunge On Traders' Fears About Inflation   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1986  The drop continued even though precious metals, whose steep price gains had triggered the bond sell-off Tuesday, ended the day mixed. Treasury bond futures managed to rebound slightly from their lows when it became apparent that the rally in metals had stalled at least temporarily.  "What a debacle. This has been one of the steepest two-day drops ever" in bond futures, said Joseph Belanoff, general partner of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co., New York. He said that at the low point in yesterday's trading, Treasury bond futures had dropped more than four points in two days.  Treasury bond futures on the Chicago Board of Trade for December delivery settled at 98 1/8, down 1 19/32. The December contract closed down the two-point daily limit on Tuesday, so in accordance with exchange rules the limit was expanded to three points for the rest of this week. Treasury bond futures for September delivery, which trade without a limit during their delivery month, closed down 1 5/16 at 98 29/32.
