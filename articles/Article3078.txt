 U.S. Proposes Modest Increases In Fuel-Economy Standards   By By Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 2002  In a potentially more significant step, an administration official said last night that officials are considering redefining how the government classifies light trucks -- specifically whether some SUVs should be treated more like passenger cars, which must adhere to higher fuel-economy standards, and whether some station wagons should be treated more like light trucks. The standards for cars are set at 27.5 miles a gallon. In addition, the official said the administration is considering subjecting the heaviest vehicles -- those weighing more than 8,500 pounds, such as General Motors Corp.'s hot-selling Hummer H2 -- to fuel-economy standards for the first time.  An NHTSA analysis indicates the proposal would particularly challenge GM to keep up with planned fuel-economy increases by Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. That could force GM to significantly alter its product line, possibly by reducing the number of heavy trucks it sells. The proposal would be less of a hurdle for auto makers whose truck fleets tend to be lighter in weight, such as Honda Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler.
