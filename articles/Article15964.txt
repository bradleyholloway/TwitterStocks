 Monthly Mutual Funds Review: Merger Kick for Fund Firms Can Give Investors Surprise Run for Their Money --- Takeover Trend Can Trigger Chain Reaction Affecting Money Managers, Returns   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2000  The main driver behind the acquisition binge is the presence of European insurers and banks willing to spend healthy premiums to gain the expertise of U.S. investment firms. Such money-management skills are in high demand as countries across the world adopt the U.S. model of defined-contribution retirement plans that usually are built around mutual funds.  Mr. [Ronald Roge], the adviser, has been cautious on manager combinations since a small fund boutique with which he had invested $6 million formed an alliance with Strong Capital Management in 1996. The fund, Strong Schafer Value Fund, has underperformed since the alliance, and Mr. Roge has pulled his money out. The fund manager "had wonderful results when it was just Schafer Value," he said. David Schafer, the manager, replies that the fund beat its peer group in 1996 and 1997, adding that "the alliance had nothing to do with our underperformance." Instead, he blames the cold streak on the sluggish returns of undervalued low-priced stocks during the past three years.  "What I said is: `I will put a significant amount of the proceeeds from the sale into the [[Tom Marsico]] mutual funds,' " Mr. Marsico recalled. In fact, he has pledged to put $100 million of his money from the sale into the funds at the start of next year. Marsico's fund investors are better off for the sale, he says, because the question of selling the firm is resolved and he is focused on managing money for the rest of his career at this firm. "I plan on retiring here," he said. "I won't manage money for someone else."
