ROME, June 20â€” Pope John Paul II canonized his first saint Sunday: he is Crispin of Viterbo, a 17th-century Italian shoemaker who became a monk.  The Pope, who has traveled to Switzerland, Argentina and Britain in the last three weeks, told 20,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica that Crispin was an example of simple and wise happiness.  ''This is the first time during my pontificate that I have had the joyous job of canonizing a saint,'' the Pope said during the two-hour mass.  Crispin, born in Viterbo, Italy, in 1668, was a shoemaker before he became a Capuchin brother. As a monk, he begged for the poor and worked as a cook, nurse, barber and gardener.
