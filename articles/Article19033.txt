 AccuStaff's Profit To Beat Estimates, Says President   By By Melanie Trottman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  AccuStaff Inc.'s first-quarter earnings will "clearly beat" the 27-cent-a-share consensus estimate, according to Derek Dewan, the temporary staffing company's chairman, president and chief executive officer.  Accustaff and its rivals in the temporary staffing industry are currently benefiting from a growing trend towards outsourcing, as well as from the economy's present strength. Mr. Dewan said revenue and margins for the quarter are up, and year-over-year comparisons are strong. Also, operating income is growing "as fast or faster" than revenue, he said.
