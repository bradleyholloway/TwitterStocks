 Schwitzer, a Recent Spinoff, Attracts Buying by Insiders, Including a Director   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1989  According to SEC records, the biggest was a $554,234 indirect purchase by Sheldon B. Lubar, a director. Mr. Lubar is chairman of Lubar & Co., an investment banking firm in Milwaukee. His indirect purchase was 56,000 shares on May 23, at an average cost of $9.89 each. He couldn't be reached for comment. An indirect purchase can reflect ownership by a trust, by family members or by a closely held business.  Other buyers listed in SEC filings were Everett G. Blair, Schwitzer's vice president for engineering, and Michael Morrell, former chief operating officer. They purchased their shares at higher prices -- mostly $13 a share for Mr. Blair and $16.125 for Mr. Morrell -- shortly after Schwitzer went public in April. The two men now have paper losses on these stakes. Schwitzer stock closed yesterday at $10 1/4, up 1/8, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Allwaste, based in Stafford, Texas, is an environmental-services company. Mr. Hellsten is chairman and president of Bear Shipping Ltd., which owns and charters oil tankers, and was an Allwaste director until he resigned in January. He sold Allwaste shares from March 21 through April 25, at prices averaging $17.10 a share. He has only 5,000 shares left, according to SEC records.
