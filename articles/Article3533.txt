 Fewer Blacks Enter Law School, Prompting Plan for Monitoring   By Koppel, Nathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2006  A study due out next month by St. John's blames declining black enrollment on a magazine: U.S. News & World Report. The magazine's annual law school rankings are based in part on schools' median LSAT scores. As schools try to improve their rankings, they are admitting fewer black students because blacks score, on average, significantly lower than whites on the LSAT, according to the St. John's study.  John Nussbaumer, author of the St. John's study, says the emphasis on test scores is about "old-fashioned race discrimination." Some legal academics say they believe that the racial disparity in LSAT scores occurs because blacks and other minorities are less apt to take pricey LSAT preparatory courses or, perhaps, to realize the test's importance for getting admitted to law school.  The American Bar Association's legal-education committee didn't address schools' reliance on the LSAT when it voted to strengthen its long-standing requirement that law schools show a "commitment" to diversity. Previously, ABA rules measured a school's commitment by its efforts to recruit a diverse student body. Now, according to the proposed rule changes, the ABA also will measure schools' diversity commitment by these schools' success in admitting minority students.
