 Pan Am Weighs NWA Bid With Backing Of Group Including Two Bass Brothers   By This article was prepared by Judith Valente in Washington, Richard Gibson in Chicago And Randall Smith in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1989  Financially troubled Pan Am Corp., with the backing of an investment group that includes two of the Bass brothers of Texas, said it is considering joining the bidding for NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines.  Pan Am, parent of Pan American World Airways, is the first airline company to express an interest in NWA since that company put itself up for sale following an unsolicited $90-a-share offer from investor Marvin Davis. Pan Am said the New York investment firm of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is acting as its financial adviser and will attempt to arrange financing in what it said would be an all-cash offer. There was no indication of a possible price.  Pan Am shareholders, meeting yesterday in Washington, already faced a number of thorny issues, not the least of which is Pan Am's own precarious financial position. With about $1 billion in debt, Pan Am has one of the highest debt-to-equity ratios of any airline and has been selling off assets in recent years to remain afloat. Pan Am is less than half the size of Northwest in terms of passengers carried.
