 Personal Business: Going Online for Pet Remedies   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2004  When filling a prescription, most sites request a faxed copy of the prescription. If you haven't taken your pet into a vet and therefore don't have a prescription, many sites offer to call the vet's office for authorization if you supply a name and phone number. For ethical and insurance reasons, however, most veterinarians reject this practice and won't authorize a prescription without first seeing the animal, says Gregory M. Dennis, a veterinary-law attorney in Overland Park, Kan.  Consumers who use online pharmacies, Dr. [Donald Klingborg] says, should go through the same protocol they do when filling prescriptions at a vet's office. First take the animal in for an exam and get the vet's advice on what medication and exact dosage the pet needs. Then, if your pet requires a prescription drug, you can ask the vet to write a prescription rather than getting it filled at the office.  If a particular online pharmacy seems suspicious, don't use it. "We all want to save money," Dr. Klingborg says, "but it doesn't make sense if you're putting your animal at jeopardy."
