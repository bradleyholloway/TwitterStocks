 When Grown-Ups Go For Silly Putty, They Do It in a Big Way --- Dow Corning Sells Basic Stuff, But in 100-Pound Lots; Beware the Bouncing Ball   By By Susan Warren, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2002  To update pool members on delivery, Mr. [Vern Hart] created a Web site where he also posted instructions on how to order putty in bulk from Dow Corning. Shortly thereafter, the company became puzzled by a sudden uptick in orders from individuals, says Kathy Moulton, who handles technical support for Dow Corning products. Inside the company, however, the idea that the putty would appeal to a broad audience was no surprise. "Everybody at Dow Corning has at least two pounds of it sitting around," says Ms. Moulton.  Mr. [Jeff Kivert], 42, remembers the awe he inspired among co-workers when his first 150-pound putty order was delivered to his Pennsylvania office a year and a half ago. He had stumbled across Mr. Hart's bulk ordering instructions when, on a whim, he typed "Silly Putty" into an Internet search engine. Since then, Mr. Kivert has organized five of his own putty pools. To recruit enough people, he uses a mailing list started by Mr. Hart, which regularly has at least 100 members.  A father of three boys and a girl between the ages of 11 and 17, he built a putty fort and had a putty war with his kids one afternoon. The toy soldiers "had putty draining out of their body like blood," he says. He jealously guards his putty stash at home, though he'll occasionally sell some to his kids at cost.
