 Hoping for Strong Holiday Finish, Retailers Are Let Down by Sales   By By Rebecca Quick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2001  These early results provide a glimpse of what other major retailers are likely to report today, when most merchants post their sales for December. The nation's biggest retailers, from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Federated, earlier warned that sales were below expectations for the early weeks of December. But many held out hope that a supersize shopping spree in the weeks just before and after Christmas would enable them to meet expectations for the season.  Federated, which operates such major department store chains as Bloomingdale's and Macy's, said sales for the five weeks ended Dec. 30 slipped 0.6% to $3.29 billion from $3.31 billion. Comparable-store sales, or those at stores open at least a year, rose 1.2% over the year-ago period. Before the holiday season began, the Cincinnati-based concern expected to post a 2.5% to 3% gain in comparable-store sales.
