 A Maverick of Sofas Rearranges the Furniture Business   By By James R. Hagerty, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1998  These three merchants have become some of the nation's fastest-growing furniture retailers by selling sofas the way the Gap sells jeans. They have flooded malls with cookie-cutter couches and leather club chairs that are basic, comfortable and stand up to wear. And if there's a certain sameness about their merchandise, that's because much of it comes from the same source: Mitchell Gold Co., an aggressive maverick that is shaking up the sleepy furniture business.  Ordinary edge-of-town furniture stores are "dead in the water," the 47-year-old Mr. Gold contends, with characteristic brashness. By choosing high-traffic malls instead, he is after shoppers who aren't necessarily in the market for furniture but can be tempted. And he is saturating his chosen turf. At one mall in King of Prussia, Pa., Mitchell Gold chairs and sofas are sold in five different stores.  "I hit the jackpot," says Mr. Gold, who wears jeans to work and employs a "senior vice president of fun" to handle public relations and lead stretching exercises on the factory floor at headquarters. Mr. Gold's English bulldog, Lulu, waddles around the office and has been featured in magazine ads. In a champagne toast at the time of the sale to Rowe, Mr. Gold declared: "We're going to dominate this industry."
