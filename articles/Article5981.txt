 The Challengers: When It Is the Job From Hell, Recruiting Is Rough --- Restaurant Franchisee Requires Managers, but Daily Grind Deters Promising Applicants   By By Bernard Wysocki Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2001  If the jobs are tough, filling them is tougher. And that is the No. 1 preoccupation of Bruce McIntosh at the moment. It was difficult to find a three-person team for his first Golden Corral franchise outlet, which opened here this past February. Now, he wants to expand. He plans to open a second Golden Corral in nearby Lexington this November, and three more big restaurants after that. So the hunt is on for more talent, but there is frustration at every turn.  The recruiters use a variety of tactics, from scanning the resumes on Internet career sites to cold-calling managers in nearby competing restaurants. Last month, to fill a management job at Mr. McIntosh's Golden Corral, Pennsylvania recruiter Joe Mayewski targeted a woman at a competing chain in Lexington. She initially agreed to switch to Golden Corral, then received a counteroffer and is currently undecided about what to do.  Golden Corral Corp. has both company-owned and franchise units. In the company-run restaurants, Vice President Larry Tate says Golden Corral is trying to reduce turnover -- currently 30% annually at the manager level and 44% for associate managers -- to 20%. One initiative: add more managers so they can work a five-day week. Separately, Golden Corral is launching a plan to give managers at company stores a chance to become franchisees. The thinking is that turning some employees into entrepreneurs, with the possibility of making more money, will be an inducement to stick with Golden Corral.
