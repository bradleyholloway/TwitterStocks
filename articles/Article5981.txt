 Strong Second-Quarter Profits Expected For Fertilizer, Crop-Nutrient Concerns   By By Hue Ha, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1997  Fertilizer producers and crop-nutrient distributors should put down healthy second-quarter profits owing to a successful domestic spring planting season.  In addition, robust potash and phosphate exports to China and India, as well as lower producer inventories, helped increase some nutrient prices from recent year lows, analysts said. Potash, a potassium compound, is one of the three main crop nutrients, along with nitrogen and phosphates.  In its latest crop-progress report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said planting for corn, the largest U.S. crop and biggest fertilizer user, is essentially completed. Corn planting is likely to be up 700,000 acres from 1996 to 80.2 million acres, the highest levels since since 1985, Mr. Carson said.
