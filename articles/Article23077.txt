 Letters to the Editor: U.S. Group Welcomes Help for Copts in Egypt   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 2004  In the discussion of Diaspora political activism, one of my quotes is placed out of its original context when Mr. [Jonathan Eric Lewis] highlights the U.S. Copts Association and its advocacy on behalf of Egypt's Christians. He cautions that demanding congressmen serve to infuriate Egyptians "already seething with anti-Americanism," and I am quoted as warning in concurrence that the "the fury expressed towards the United States has been manifested in hostility towards the Christian minority."
