 Not All Applaud Japan's Cutback In Debt It Issues   By By Marcus W. Brauchli, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1989  In Britain, where the government is running a big surplus and repaying huge amounts of government debt, a resulting shortage of British government bonds already is aggravating cutthroat pricing in the London market. But the Japanese situation is considered less extreme, since Tokyo is still running a budget deficit.  By cutting back on new borrowing now, the Japanese government hopes to cushion itself against heavy financing demands early in the next century, when a large portion of Japan's aging population will become eligible for state benefits that the government will have to pay out. "If they can bring borrowing under control now, they'll be better prepared to cope later," says David Pike, an economist at UBS Philips & Drew International Ltd., a brokerage subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland.  At the moment, the ministry hasn't completed its budget plan for the next fiscal year. But officials hint that they expect to slash the amount of 10-year bonds issued next year to about six trillion yen ($48.6 billion) from an estimated 8.84 trillion yen this year. Overall, the government will issue an estimated 22.14 trillion yen ($179 billion) of bonds in the coming fiscal year, off from just under 23.35 trillion yen this year and about 27.27 trillion the previous year.
