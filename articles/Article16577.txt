 Camilla   By Letts, Quentin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  Unofficially, however, the trip is about introducing [Camilla Parker-Bowles] to Hometown USA. Prince Charles, who has loved her secretly since he was a rangy lad, hopes that the world at large will warm to the woman he can at last call his "darling wife." She is quite, quite different from the gazelle-boned Diana, but Charles adores Camilla more than the breath in his blue-blooded body.  Hang on. Here is a mature, warm woman, well lived-in like a country club armchair. She's affectionate, unsnobby and has finally won the prince of her dreams. She dresses sensibly without upstaging others and is never more comfortable than in the muddy shires of England with a wet gundog at her hearth and a gin and tonic in her fist. Yes, she has laughter lines. Sure, she'll never make a living as a Vogue mannequin. But is this lady not a model for our age? Isn't Camilla more truly admirable than the publicity-driven soul whose unhappy marital bed she now occupies with such refreshing gusto?
