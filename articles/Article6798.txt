 Executive Pay (A Special Report); It's Your Choice: Who decides what kind of long-term compensation executives get? At some companies, it's up to the executives themselves   By Tara Siegel Bernard, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2004  The 44-year-old Mr. [Dennis Schoff] has two daughters in middle school, meaning he and his wife, Nina, have less than five years to save before their eldest, 13-year-old Kathryn, goes off to college. So Mr. Schoff chose to receive half of his long-term compensation in Lincoln stock options and half in performance shares. "That will help me pay for things like my children's education," he says. "And if I don't need it at that time, I can delay in exercising my options." Since he is at the midway point in his career, he says, he can afford to take a bit more risk, especially given his confidence in the insurer's growth potential.  Some critics, however, contend that by giving managers self-directed choice, companies are letting them limit their downside, which isn't necessarily in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. Options carry the right to buy stock at a fixed price during a specific period, so there is opportunity to pocket enormous wealth. On the other hand, if the stock doesn't rise above an option's exercise price, the option is worth nothing. But a share of restricted stock is always worth something -- as long as a company's shares keep trading.  Lincoln says it decided as long as senior staffers were being judged with the same yardstick -- performance goals that satisfy shareholders -- differences in the mix of rewards shouldn't pose any problems. "They are still marching to the same drummer because there is one set of measures," says George Davis, the company's human-resources chief. The board's compensation committee has to approve every executive's plan mix, Mr. Davis adds. Executives also are required to hold a percentage of their salary in stock.
