 In Defense of Taking Your Vitamins   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2006  Your article points out, valuably, that vitamins can't always be expected to cure non-deficiency diseases. But the indictment of vitamin C is unwarranted. Vitamin C hasn't been found to act as a pro- oxidant in the body and serves a multitude of vital functions, including a recently discovered reaction in which vitamin C binds to oxidized or rancid fat in the body, generating harmless conjugates that are then excreted. The oxidized fats are thus unable to damage biomolecules like DNA, providing one way by which vitamin C may protect against cancer and heart disease. High-dose vitamin C has also been found to lower blood pressure and to promote relaxation of the arteries. You emphasized speculative studies about vitamin C and cancer and ignored the plethora of other reports in the past 35 years showing benefits of adjunctive high-dose vitamin C, especially when given intravenously.  It is clear that eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods is the best way to obtain vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients the body needs. Healthful diets appear to protect against the development of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. Yet when single isolated nutrients found in such diets are studied in reductionist clinical models, limited or negative effects are often seen, supporting the idea that taken out of their whole food context, dietary constituents don't behave as predicted. Isolated nutrients don't exist in a vacuum in human biology, and thus they can't be meaningfully studied in this way. In whole foods, vitamins and minerals exist in a complex matrix along with many other supporting nutrients and potential health-promoting compounds. Metabolism has adapted to the presence of many interacting factors in the diet, a complexity that isn't always reducible to pharmaceutical clinical methods of study.
