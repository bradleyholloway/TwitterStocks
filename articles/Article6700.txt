 Bush Said The U.S. Had To "Remain Tough" After A Bad Day In Iraq.   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 2003  BUSH SAID the U.S. had to "remain tough" after a bad day in Iraq.  The president acknowledged troops face a "security issue" as two died in ambushes, which Gen. Franks told Congress are occurring at the rate of 10 to 25 a day in a mid-Iraq hot zone. The retired war commander said the current U.S. force level will have to be kept until next year, and Americans may be in Iraq four years from now. Meanwhile, Iraqi political factions appear poised to declare an interim government. Powell, traveling with Bush in Africa, said the president needn't apologize for an erroneous assertion of an Iraqi bid to buy uranium, because it "seemed to be a reasonable statement at that time."  North Korea developed a "mafialike" economy after the Soviet collapse, trying to sell drugs, pornography and counterfeit bills, according to the U.S. ambassador to Australia.
