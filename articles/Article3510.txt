 SmartMoney: Incentives to Go 'Green'   By Grant, Kelli B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2006  Thanks to new tax credits that kicked in this year and increasingly competitive prices on energy-efficient appliances, it's easier than ever to boost your home's energy efficiency without going broke. Under the Energy Policy Act, in 2006 and 2007 consumers can receive federal tax credits for making energy-efficiency upgrades to their homes.  You can view rebates and other programs at the Web sites of Energy Star (www.energystar.gov), a government-backed program dedicated to improving energy efficiency; the ACEEE (www.aceee.org); and Consumer Reports' Greener Choices (www.greenerchoices.org), a consumers' guide that focuses on environmentally friendly products.  Even if you're not in the market for a new appliance, there's plenty you can do to increase energy efficiency without spending much money, says Urvashi Rangan, a senior scientist and policy analyst at Greener Choices. To boost your existing heating system, she advises replacing any analog thermostats with programmable ones.
