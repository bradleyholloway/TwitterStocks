 Love & Money: Picking a Guardian: Is Love Enough?   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2004  It isn't that simple. "It's a good way to spend an entire day crying," says Laura, a friend in Maryland. "The hardest part was dealing with the emotional burden. My stepsister would be the greatest mom in the world -- much better than me, in fact. But she's young and single and shouldn't be forced into that responsibility. My mom would love to be the guardian, but I don't want her to have to worry about a teenager when she's 70."  So this forces you to ask yourself: How much weight should you place on the amount of money potential guardians have -- or don't have? It's a crass question, and nobody wants to leave their children to Cinderella's stepmother just because she has a few bucks. As my New Orleans friend Colleen says of the decision she and her husband, Drew, made: "We are more concerned with values than finances."  money still requires some consideration. Assume we leave enough to cover all of our son's financial needs. That doesn't guarantee he will live the life we'd wish for him -- with all the experiences and opportunities we think he should have. For instance, say we choose a family that can support our son because of our insurance money. This doesn't mean they'll have the financial resources to change their lives. They won't necessarily have the money to take the family on trips, to show him the world that we want him to see. Or they may not want to send our son to private school if their children attend public school. Should your kids attend public schools just because the guardians' kids do, even if your estate can afford the tuition?
