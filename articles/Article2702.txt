 GOP Transportation Chief Undermines Party Plan to Attack Democrats' Gas Tax   By By Jim Vandehei, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2000  Bucking his Republican leaders, House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster is preparing a report detailing how temporarily trimming the gasoline excise tax will imperil highway programs from coast to coast.  Mr. Shuster's report, which could be released as early as today, will show how much highway money each state would lose if the gasoline tax were suspended for the remainder of the year. The report is certain to provide Al Gore, the Democrats' presidential candidate, with ammunition to fight GOP rival Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and congressional Republicans.  Cutting the gasoline tax would "have a dramatic impact on the state of our transit system and our highways," a spokesman for Mr. Shuster said. Most House and Senate GOP leaders want to suspend, at least until year's end, the 4.3 cents-a-gallon tax increase imposed by Democrats in 1993 to fund their deficit-reduction program. The suspension would drain money from the federal account that funds state highway construction projects.
