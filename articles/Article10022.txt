 Bogle Sees Tough Times Ahead For Stock-Market Investors   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2007  Yet, at age 77, he still gives 60 speeches a year, and he's about to come out with his sixth book, "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing." It's an easy read that will, I suspect, quickly join Burton Malkiel's "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" and Charles Ellis's "Winning the Loser's Game" as one of the indexing crowd's favorite books.  These days, Mr. Bogle isn't sounding particularly enthusiastic about the market's prospects. "Figure out what your stock allocation should be," he advises. "Now is a time to stay where you are or reduce. The odds are, we are in for a period of modest returns."  This is the market's speculative return, and Mr. Bogle figures it will work against investors in the decade ahead. He thinks we might go from today's 17 times trailing 12-month reported earnings to a more- typical 16 times earnings. That would drag down the market's return over the next decade, leaving us with a 10-year average that's closer to 7%.
