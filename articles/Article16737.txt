 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Hunting for Returns -- AMT Strikes in Unlikely Spot: Tax-Free Muni-Bond Funds   By Pollock, Michael A, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2007  "People say, 'I already owe more tax than I thought I would. I'm not going to buy any muni fund that will make it worse,'" says R.J. Gallo, a senior fund manager at Federated Investors Inc.  Vanguard is among the fund companies that have cut back on AMT- subject bonds, recently making most of its muni funds AMT-free, except for some that invest in money markets or high-yield bonds. A spokeswoman cites the fact that a growing number of the firm's customers face the AMT.  Some funds intend to stick with their AMT bonds. "If we didn't invest in AMT bonds at all, that would basically take us away from some industrial-development bonds that are extremely credit worthy and deserve our attention," says Franklin Ruben, manager of AIM High Income Municipal Fund, by AIM Capital Management Inc., which has about 2% of its money in private-activity bonds.
