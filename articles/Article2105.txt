 Unpaid Taxes to Reach $100 Billion This Year, IRS Commissioner Estimates   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 20, 1990  According to an IRS report released at the hearing, the so-called tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and taxes actually paid -- was between $82.5 billion and $94.2 billion in 1987, the most recent year complete tax data are available. Mr. Goldberg projected that it could reach $110.1 billion to $127 billion in 1992.  And that's only counting the federal income tax on legal income. Mr. Goldberg said the agency is working on estimates of unpaid taxes from illegal transactions, such as drug dealing. Private calculations put the tax gap over $200 billion if illegal income and unpaid state taxes and other taxes are included.  Sole proprietors underpaid their federal income tax liabilities by about 23% in 1987, accounting for about $16.6 billion, or 20%, of the tax gap for the year, according to the GAO, which analyzed the IRS data. Those underpayments reflected both unreported income and excessive deductions, the IRS said. Mr. Goldberg said the IRS has begun an auditing program to examine taxpayers in this category with over $100,000 in gross receipts.
