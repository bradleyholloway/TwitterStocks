 Ford Promotes William Ford Jr. To New Truck Job   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1989  DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. promoted William Clay Ford Jr., the 31-year-old great-grandson of the company's founder, another notch up its management ladder.  The move is a routine promotion, but it also comes at a time when the Ford family's role at Ford Motor is producing some tension within the company.  Mr. Ford is the son of William Clay Ford Sr., whose retirement as vice chairman last week leaves Ford Motor without a family member in top management for the first time in its history. William Clay Jr. and his first cousin, 40-year-old Edsel Ford II, are the highest ranking family members in active management. Edsel Ford is director of sales for the company's Lincoln-Mercury division. Two other cousins have lesser management jobs.
