 Letters to the Editor: IMF's Economic Massacre in Balkans   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1993  In his grand, multifaceted road map for resolving the Balkans quagmire (editorial page, July 1-2), Albert Wohlstetter recommends the temporary deployment of U.S. special forces to advise and train the Bosnians in the tactics and technology of modern warfare. It's always easy to invoke the Vietnam experience when arguing against foreign military entanglements, but the parallel runs deeper than the limited Green Beret advisory mission that didn't end until 58,000 American lives were lost in the jungles of Southeast Asia.  Tracing the economic massacre of the Balkans does not require such a long-term perspective. In 1986, one Yugoslav new dinar was worth $22. Then the IMF shock troops took over economic policy, imposing devaluation, a wage freeze and price decontrol. As revenues to the government plummeted in the contraction that inevitably followed, the IMF ordered tax increases to balance the budget. By December 1989, the new dinar's value stood at 11 cents. With the savings of the population virtually extinguished, Yugoslavia began breaking up along ethnic lines in the competition for control of an ever-shrinking pool of resources. The state reeled into chaos and hyperinflation. The dinar's value shrank to one-half cent by last summer, and today one dollar buys two million dinars.
