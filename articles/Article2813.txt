 Branson's Virgin Mobile Enters Asia Without a Net   By By H. Asher Bolande, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2001  Some telecom companies see the writing on the wall. Virgin Mobile's foray into Singapore is a $100 million joint venture with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. It expects to roll out services within six months. This deal follows on the heels of the Oct. 31 launch of Virgin Mobile Australia, another 50-50 partnership, with that country's No. 2 mobile operator Cable & Wireless Optus.  All Sir Richard's companies, Virgin Mobile included, market themselves as champions of the downtrodden consumer. At a time when multiyear contracts are a trend in the industry, Virgin Mobile requires none; there is no monthly retainer fee, and users pay only for their time on the phone.  Others plan to try, though. Media giant Bertelsmann AG in recent weeks disclosed that it was in talks with German mobile carriers about becoming a VMNO when third-generation, or 3G, mobile services arrive around 2003. There is also room for niche VMNOs, analysts say. They might target professional groups such as doctors or interest groups such as soccer fans.
