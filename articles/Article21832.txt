 At Orioles Sale, Bidders Send Price Out of Ballpark --- Group Led by Peter Angelos Wins in Court Auction With $174 Million Offer   By By Jonathan M. Moses, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1993  A group of investors led by attorney Peter Angelos bought Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles for a record-setting $174 million at a bankruptcy-court auction here.  Mr. Angelos, who made much of his fortune representing plaintiffs suing former asbestos makers, and his eclectic band of native Marylanders -- including novelist Tom Clancy, movie director Barry Levinson and tennis pro Pam Shriver -- teamed up with a group led by Cincinnati investor William O. DeWitt Jr. They outbid art dealer Jeffrey Loria, whose final offer was $173 million.  Mr. Angelos's group will own the majority of the club, although precise numbers haven't been made public. Mr. Angelos will be the team's general partner; Mr. DeWitt will be in charge of baseball operations, and Mr. Clancy will be chief of public affairs, Mr. Angelos said.
