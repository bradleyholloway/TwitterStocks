 The Stock-Research Pact: Morgan Stanley Stock-Research Tactics Are Criticized in Pact   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  Morgan Stanley "at times implicitly suggested that analysts would provide favorable research coverage . . . by noting analysts' past favorable coverage and/or emphasizing its enthusiastic support for the issuer," according to the report on the investigation by the staff of New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Morgan Stanley "used its analysts as a marketing tool to help secure banking business," the report alleged. Morgan Stanley declined to comment, and a spokesman said Ms. [Shelby Fleck] and other analysts and bankers weren't available for comment.  It's not the first time that Morgan Stanley has landed in hot water with regulators. In November, Morgan Stanley was one of five securities firms that paid $1.65 million apiece to settle civil charges that they failed to save their e-mails and produce them for regulatory probes as required. Addressing the issue at the firm's annual meeting last month, Morgan Stanley's Mr. [Philip Purcell] said the firm "overwrote" many computer tapes containing its 1999 e-mails.  In a self-evaluation for the year 2000, computer-services analyst David M. Togut said that he had spurned requests for research coverage of Sabre Group, since renamed Sabre Holdings Corp., from Sabre and its majority owner, American Airlines parent AMR Corp., explaining "I insisted that we first be mandated on a large investment banking transaction." After Morgan Stanley won a Sabre-related banking assignment, the Spitzer report said, Mr. Togut initiated coverage of Sabre with an "outperform" rating in March 2000.
