 Goldman, GE Unit Seek Effective Control Of Finova but Some of Its Creditors Balk   By By Paul M. Sherer, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  Finova has drawn heavy interest from distressed-debt and value investors, who have bought up Finova bonds and bank debt at a discount in recent months on the belief that Finova's assets are worth more than is reflected in the price of its debt. These include Warren E. Buffett, who spent several hundred million dollars buying up the bonds in the fall and still owns Finova bonds, according to people familiar with the situation. Other big holders of the debt include Oaktree Capital Management LLC and Angelo, Gordon & Co., which are both big investors in distressed debt and other specialized assets.  Under their proposal, Goldman Sachs and GE Capital would purchase $2 billion in debt from Finova; whether that would be newly issued debt or debt purchased from existing creditors isn't clear. The deal would take place amid a Chapter 11 reorganization. The two firms would then take over Finova's assets and manage them to achieve the highest possible return for creditors. The two firms aren't proposing to acquire Finova.  In interviews conducted before word of the Goldman/GE Capital proposal began to circulate, Finova officials said the value of its assets far outweighs its debts, implying a substantial recovery for debtholders. "This is not a typical bankruptcy situation," said Ted Stenger, a principal at Jay Alix & Associates, a corporate turnaround firm that is advising Finova on its restructuring. "We think there's an opportunity for people to get an appropriate and fair recovery here. As long as we can get additional consensus on how to do that, I think we can have a very successful restructuring, whether in court or out of court."
