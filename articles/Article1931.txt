 FORM + FUNCTION   By By John Pierson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1994  Besides its startling looks, the Aeron embodies radical changes in materials and function. Instead of foam-backed fabric, the seat and back consist of a special woven fabric that they call Pellicle, which conforms to the sitter's shape and distributes weight equally. It also lets air pass through, reducing heat.  Aeron's tilt mechanism allows the body to move easily from nearly kneeling to reclining. So it can do equally well as a management, task, conference or lounge chair, the maker says. Instead of trying to make one size fit all, Herman Miller has produced the chair in small, medium and large. The Aeron is priced now between $350 and $600, depending on quantity and options.  Take Casa Pacifica in Camarillo, Calif., a just-opened center for children in crisis. Casa Pacifica sits on 23 acres surrounded by citrus groves, corn fields and the dry Santa Monica Mountains. The buildings -- four cottages housing 80 children, a school and recreation and administration centers -- all have light-admitting clerestories and are built in the style of a ranch. Trellises await the growth of flowering vines, while young trees-eucalyptus, pepper, plane, live oak and magnolia-dot the grounds.
