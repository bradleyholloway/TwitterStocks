ONCE upon a time, before water ran in pipes, people used barrels to collect rain as it slipped off their roofs. Now, when scarcity renews our appreciation of rain, people are regarding their downspouts with new respect. For even when a small amount of rain eases the drought, good quantities of water can be tapped for later use in watering gardens, lawns and, in a severe arid spell, cooking and drinking.  Pure as it may seem, however, Jeremiah Dineen, director of Westchester County's Water Agency, advises homeowners not to drink water from rain barrels unless it has been boiled and perhaps even chlorinated. Potential pollutants include chemicals in the atmosphere and birds and animals that may get into the barrel.  The quintessential rain barrel, to many, is the white oak barrel that has been retired from the business of aging whisky. These barrels are still available, thanks to their adaptability for use as doghouses, planters, furniture and vats for amateur wine makers.  There are no exact specifications for rain barrels, but wood is the preferred material. Pottery may break; plastic garbage cans, when empty, capsize in the wind; steel drums are a bit noisy; plastic drums come in bright, prime colors and do not hold paint well.  But a drum is a drum, said Harry Stickles, a retired carpenter in Modena, N.Y. ''I've used steel rain drums for seven years and they work well,'' he said. Mr. Stickles has one or two drums, painted white, at every corner of his house and a good night's rain, of about one inch, will fill all of his 55-gallon steel drums.  Although rain barrels are not yet appearing under every downspout, sales are increasing. ''From all over, people are coming in for rain barrels,'' said Brice Colwell, whose New Jersey company sells a variety of inexpensive models. Most of his recent customers are collecting rain to water plants and vegetables or wash cars, activities outlawed in many drought areas.  Some garden centers or nurseries may carry barrels, but here are some sources in New Jersey, where the water shortage has been serious: Colwell Corporation, Fairfield Road, Fairfield. Telephone: 201-785-8200.  Colwell has been selling old whisky barrels as rain barrels for 105 years. The white oak barrels - measuring 34 inches high and 24 inches wide and holding 50 gallons - can be bought as is, with charred interior, for $15 to $18.  Water left in the barrels may taste of whisky, but the water is suitable for nondrinking purposes. For an additional $35, the company will strip and wax the interior, insert a wooden faucet near the bottom of the barrel and seal and stain it. If fewer modifications are desired, the price is less.  Colwell also sells 55-gallon black plastic drums for $34 and black steel drums for $23; faucets are not available on these. Shipping to New York is estimated to cost $20 a barrel. White Eagel Enterprises, 133 Dema- rest Avenue, Bloomfield. Telephone: 201-661-2618.  Sells old whisky drums as is for $22 each or two for $40. Tunnel Barrel and Drum Company, 85 Triangle Boulevard, Carlstadt. Tele- phone: 201-933-1444; New York num- ber: 925-8190.  Sells used steel drums for $10 and royal blue plastic drums for $12.
