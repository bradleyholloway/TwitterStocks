 `Open Access' Isn't So Open At Time Warner   By By Julia Angwin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2002  Mr. [Andrew Coren] isn't so enthusiastic anymore. Time Warner is charging him so much -- $39 per customer -- for access to its lines that he says he can't make a profit if he wants to offer prices similar to Time Warner and another national provider that uses its lines, EarthLink Inc. What's worse, the agreement prevents him from selling additional services like home networking, and he isn't allowed to do his own billing, the glue in any customer relationship.  Indeed, the requirement that AOL share its cable lines, dubbed "open access," is turning out to be a closed door for some smaller Internet providers. This is not the result expected when AOL Chief Executive Officer Steve Case and then-Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin promised the Senate Judiciary Committee in February 2000 that they would carry out 11 steps toward opening up their cable lines. That pledge helped the merger pass regulatory muster.  In Time Warner's case, the kind of Internet being delivered is one that violates two of the companies' pledges to Congress. Time Warner isn't allowing Internet providers to bill customers directly or to carry portions of of the Internet traffic that is delivered to cable customers -- despite having agreed that it would allow both of those things.
