 Health Costs: Help for a Healthier You   By Mincer, Jilian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  "A number of years ago, it was considered a nice thing [for companies] to do, rather than something that needed to be done," says Tom Billet, a senior consultant at human-resources adviser Watson Wyatt Worldwide. But now businesses and insurance companies "are really trying to improve the health status of their populations."  Still, while more and more companies are offering programs to boost wellness, many "do a lousy job of promoting these offerings," says Ms. [Linda Cushman] of Hewitt Associates. She suggests checking employer and insurer Web sites as well as asking your firm's human resources department.  Businesses want to help employees lose weight or stop smoking before they develop diabetes or heart disease. Many insurance companies start with printed and Web-based materials, but they try to keep workers motivated with "health coaches" available online and over the phone. About 40% of businesses surveyed by Watson Wyatt offer personal health coaches or health advocates.
