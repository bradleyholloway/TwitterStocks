 Nordic Telecoms Place Bets On Broadband TV Service   By Hansson, Magnus, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2007  Denmark's TDC AS launched its full-fledged Internet Protocol TV, or IPTV, service in February, while Sweden's TeliaSonera AB has begun a major marketing campaign in its home market. Norway's Telenor ASA has some IPTV services in Sweden and is planning a launch next year.  TeliaSonera's offering allows subscribers to order and watch movies on demand, surf the Internet via the TV at home and view photos stored on TeliaSonera's server, said Erik Hallberg, senior vice president at TeliaSonera responsible for broadband services in Sweden. IPTV can also reach a wider market than cable, because it uses the standard phone network. Satellite TV reaches all areas. However, cable can provide more channels.  For example, Swedish cable company Com Hem AB provides around 130 channels, while Telenor's satellite operator Canal Digital has 64. TeliaSonera's IPTV service has 32 channels. "Our key challenge will be to convince customers we have a good TV offering," said Erik Hallberg, senior vice president at TeliaSonera, who is responsible for broadband services in Sweden.
