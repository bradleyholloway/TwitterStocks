 Brazil Is Still Riding Its Big Oil Bronco --- Petrobras Is Shaking Free Of the State, Though, As Opportunity Gushes   By By Jonathan Karp, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2001  The once-obscure Petrobras now sits at the heart of one of the most dynamic exploration areas, and Mr. [Henri Philippe Reichstul] has an opportunity to make reforms from a position of strength. Cost-cutting coupled with last year's spike in oil prices should nearly double earnings for 2000, which Petrobras will announce Friday. Recent discoveries have yielded proven reserves that should last 20 years, longer than rivals.' And, to make Brazil self-sufficient in energy, Petrobras plans to boost production, some 1.3 million barrels a day in 2000, by a torrid 10% a year through 2005.  Last year, he ratcheted up efforts to create a commercial mentality among managers used to working as civil servants. Mr. Reichstul ordered new procurement policies to cut time and costs, set tougher return-on-capital benchmarks and introduced a performance-based bonus program. For nine months, in a process that generated "much heat and blood," he assiduously consulted managers up and down the ranks on restructuring Petrobras to decentralize decision making. The result: From two business units, Petrobras created 40 with operational autonomy and specific financial targets.  Mr. Reichstul is also trying to buff up Petrobras's environmental image after a series of oil spills and fines of $40 million last year. In January, Petrobras agreed to pay a further $119 million to clean up Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay. Separately, Mr. Reichstul plans to invest $1 billion by 2003 to upgrade pipelines and build emergency centers to respond to potential accidents.
