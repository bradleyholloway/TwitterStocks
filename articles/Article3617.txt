 Bangkok Duffers Know At This Golf Course, Planes Play Through; As Slices Hit the Runway, Pilots, Passengers Gawk; Farewell to 700 Jets a Day   By Stanley, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2006  "Where else can you get that close?" said Belinda Skinner of Perth, Australia, as a departing Cathay Pacific Airways jet burst above the tree line just behind her at the 15th hole. "It's hilarious. You try to putt, but you can't because you're laughing too hard."  "You just couldn't do this in America. People would be too worried you'd bring in a missile or something," said Wendy Dendel, a Detroit native who works in Thailand for Ford Motor Co. Mr. [James Ward], the former Virgin Atlantic pilot, said that "if you wanted to chuck a grenade at a 747, it would be no problem. Our bags weren't checked -- we could have had a rocket launcher or something."  "From a pilot's point of view, I always thought it was incredible how you'd see the golfers with their clubs," he said. "This [had] to be one of the noisiest golf courses in the world."
