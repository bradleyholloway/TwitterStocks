 UBS to Move Energy-Trading Unit, Cut Jobs   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  Dave Walker, a UBS spokesman, said the company will review its Houston operation during the next month to determine how many of the 440 jobs there will be cut. The unit will be integrated into UBS's massive financial-trading operation in Stamford, Conn., which has more than 3,000 employees.  UBS invested little capital when it acquired the unit from Enron, paying nothing upfront while agreeing to pay Enron's bankruptcy estate one-third of any future profits.
