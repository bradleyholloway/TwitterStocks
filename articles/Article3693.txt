 Greenwich Builder Bets Hedge Funds Will Pay For Excess; Riding a Boom, Antares Erects Mansions on Spec; A Fight With Renters   By Dugan, Ianthe Jeanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  If Antares's plans pan out, lushly paid hedge-fund executives will buy three mansions it built on "spec" -- without buyers -- including one it claims is the largest in Greenwich. Fund traders and analysts, Mr. [Joseph Beninati] hopes, will buy luxury condominiums his firm is creating from Greenwich's last big middle-class apartment complexes.  For Mr. Beninati, this all adds up to the "ultimate investment play," he says. During a recent interview in his office in Stamford, Conn., he used a white board and marker to sketch out what he referred to as the town's "business ecosystem." He drew a triangle and divided it horizontally into three sections. In the top section, he scribbled "Hedge funds and private equity." For them, he said, rent is lowest in comparison to profits, so they can pay the most. In the middle tier, he said, come investment banks. At the bottom, he said, sit advertising firms, accountants and lawyers. "We'll move them to Stamford," he said, referring to the city east of Greenwich, where office space is less expensive.  Under state law, senior citizens are entitled to stay if they pay "fair rent." Antares has raised rents by an average 27%. Karl Wiemer, 68, who currently pays $1,800 a month for his two-bedroom, has been given a choice: pay $2,658 a month or buy his unit for $636,000. "There's no way we can afford this," he complains.
