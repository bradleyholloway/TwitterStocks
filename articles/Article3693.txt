 U.S.'s Requirement For Visas Angers Foreign Sailors --- New Biometric Identity Card To Combat Terrorism Is Seen as Not Adequate   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 20, 2003  The objective is to weed out potential terrorists who may infiltrate crews, but the country that pushed hardest for the new treaty -- the U.S. -- still won't be satisfied. The U.S. will continue to demand that crews have visas as well as ID cards, and that means a seaman such as Edison Elizalde won't be going ashore.  The 31-year-old Mr. Elizalde arrived in Port Elizabeth, N.J., not long ago aboard the MSC Italy. He had signed on a year ago, when the ship wasn't scheduled to make a U.S. port call. Because of lengthening waits and background checks at U.S. embassies along the Italy's route, he was unable to get a visa.  Effectively, that means the right of shore leave has also been abolished, especially for seamen on tramp ships with no U.S. ports of call to list in advance on visa applications. New York's Center for Seafarers' Rights has found that on 40% of ships in several ports some seamen are refused a chance to step ashore. There are around 900,000 seamen visits to the U.S. annually.
