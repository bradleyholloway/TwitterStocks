 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Catalog Critic: Tray Chic   By Passy, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2005  Our more stylish wooden trays didn't fare much better. With WillyGoat's Slat TV Snack Tray Set ($96.99), our testers found that the principal design feature -- the top is slatted, not solid -- allowed food to fall to the floor. With Target's Drop-Leaf Five-Piece Table and Tray Set ($149.99), made by Winsome, the tray legs were spaced so closely that you had to squeeze your own legs together to fit underneath (uncomfortable, our male testers noted) or straddle the trays (not ladylike, said our female testers).  Bombay Co.'s Westport TV Tray Tables ($149) won some points on looks alone: The handsome wooden trays were finished with a "silk-screened" flower accent. But not everyone wants a TV tray elegant enough for a country estate. "When I think TV trays, I don't think 'beautiful,'" said one tester.
