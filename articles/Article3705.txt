 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2003  A: Apple's Macintosh computers can be attacked by viruses and worms and can be the targets of hackers, just like Windows machines. But Mac users rarely have to worry about this because the vast majority of hackers and virus writers choose to focus their criminal efforts on the predominant platform, which is Windows. There are occasional security patches issued for Apple's OS X operating system, but they are much less numerous and frequent than the patches for Windows.  One caveat: Switching to a Mac won't protect you from spam e-mail or pop-up ads on the Web. You should still use an e-mail program, like Apple's Mail, or Microsoft Entourage, that includes junk-mail filtering, or a third-party antispam program written for the Mac. As for pop-ups, there are special pop-up blockers for the Mac, or you can use Apple's new Safari browser, which has a built-in pop-up blocker.
