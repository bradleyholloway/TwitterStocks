 Concentration Proves Winner At Hedge Fund; Atticus Beats a Path That Others Follow; Risk in Similar Bets?   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2007  While some large funds have seen limp results after adopting more- conservative styles, Atticus is racking up huge gains. Last year, the firm's flagship funds -- the $7 billion Atticus Global fund and the $8 billion Atticus European fund -- each rose about 40% after fees, compared with gains of about 14% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. So far this year, Atticus European, co-managed by David Slager, is up 12%, and Mr. [TIM BARAKETT]'s Atticus Global is up about 8%, again beating the overall market. Both funds have annualized returns of about 27% after fees since they were established in 1996 and 2001 respectively.  Increasingly, Atticus's moves are aped by other hedge-fund managers. And that is raising questions about whether too many funds are investing in the same stocks. The danger here is that if fast-moving hedge funds, or their own investors, start bailing out of the positions they share with Atticus, Mr. Barakett's firm will suffer. In October 2005, for example, the firm dropped 9%, its worst one-month decline, in part because so many hedge funds got nervous and sold stocks that Atticus also owned.  "People enjoy talking to Tim. He's great at finessing information that maybe they wouldn't normally disclose" and using it for his investments says Rick Frisbie, co-founder of venture-capital firm Battery Ventures, who was Mr. Barakett's boss from 1988 to 1991.
