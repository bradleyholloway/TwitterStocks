 Gonzales Walks Fine Line; White House Lawyer Is Point Man as FBI Plumbs for Leak   By Greg Hitt and Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2003  That helps explain the lengths Mr. [Alberto Gonzales] is going to to respond to the Justice Department's voluminous document request, which covers 2,000 employees in the executive office of the president. Mr. Gonzales set an early deadline -- last Tuesday at 5 p.m. -- to comply with the request, days ahead of the Justice Department's deadline. The documents -- e-mails, phone records, hand-written notes and the like -- are piled up in Room 214 on the second floor of the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.  "Obviously, he's got to understand what's happening and where the submarine might be going," says Washington lawyer C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel for the first President [Bush]. "He's got to be alert to something that is caught by the document request. But he can't be doing an investigation himself, because that could look like he's interfering."  Mr. Gonzales also is advising Bush aides about what to say to the press. For the most part, the White House has been close-lipped, with one notable exception. White House spokesman Scott McClellan last week said that he had spoken with three officials -- Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political strategist; Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff; and Elliot Abrams, a top national security aide -- and all had assured him that they weren't the source of the leak. It is unclear what discussions, if any, Mr. McClellan had with Mr. Gonzales before acting.
