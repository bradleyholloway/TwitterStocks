 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Secretary Shultz's Fumble   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1987  The U.S. assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, Roger Mentz, will be in Paris in the next few days for a meeting at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. One subject will undoubtedly be the OECD's proposed multilateral tax convention. Mr. Mentz's mission ought to be an opportunity to call a halt to this ill-thought-out initiative, which would place the taxpayers of signatory nations in harm's way before the tax collectors of those nations with the highest taxes. Unhappily, the U.S. appears to be ready to support this initiative.
