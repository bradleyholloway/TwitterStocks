 Eyes on the Road: Sales Data Show Demand For High Tech, Quality; GM Scores With New Luxury Crossover Online edition  By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2007  While one month doesn't make a trend, a pattern that emerges out of February's uneven results is that the brands that are doing well are mainly those with well executed new models like the GM trucks or that cater to more affluent Americans, particularly those living outside the Midwest. BMW, for example, said February sales rose nearly 12%. Audi sales jumped 37.5%. The Toyota and Lexus brands each set new February records.  Al Gore's triumphant turn at the Oscars highlighted the big shift in attitudes among an important segment of cultural opinion shapers -- the same folks that are snapping up BMWs, Audis and Lexus hybrids.
