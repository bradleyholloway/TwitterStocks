 Intel's Profit Margin Exceeds Forecast --- Chip Maker's Net Falls 77% Cautious Outlook Signals Recovery Hasn't Arrived   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2002  Semiconductor makers tend to focus on comparisons for sequential quarters, rather than year-over-year comparisons, because of the industry's economic cycles. Intel's fourth-quarter sales rose 7% from the third quarter and slightly exceeded the top of a range Intel revised last month. Intel yesterday predicted first-quarter revenue of $6.4 billion to $7 billion; the wide range suggests business could be about flat with the fourth period or decline slightly, as it typically does at this time of year.  Intel's chips act as calculating engines inside most desktop and laptop computers, linking its fortunes inextricably to that market. Though PC sales shrank last year from a peak in 2000, Intel boosted spending on new manufacturing capacity by 12% to a record $7.3 billion. Better manufacturing processes allowed Intel to simultaneously boost performance and drive down the price of its chips, a strategy designed to stimulate demand and take sales from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif.  Intel's flagship Pentium 4 chip operates at 2.2 billion cycles a second, and that is expected to become much quicker over the next several quarters. The company said unit shipments of the Pentium 4 doubled in the fourth quarter from the third period. Intel, in fact, wasn't able to produce enough of some models of the Pentium 4 chip to keep up with demand.
