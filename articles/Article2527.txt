 Clinton to Propose Rise in Tobacco Tax --- Aim Is to Raise $8 Billion For Spending on Defense And Social Programs   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger and Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1999  The White House also is considering seeking new revenues from insurance companies and organizations that insure student loans to fund an ambitious list of initiatives to be included in Mr. (President) Clinton's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, according to people familiar with it. He is scheduled to submit his blueprint to Congress on Feb. 1.  Administration officials refused yesterday to comment on the plans for cigarette fees, closing business-tax loopholes and other revenue raisers. Nearly every day since the new year, Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have proposed popular new spending programs and tax breaks -- yesterday's new program was aid to disabled workers. At the same time, they have vowed to adhere to the letter of strict budget rules requiring new revenues or spending cuts to offset those plans.  But the White House has studiously avoided making public exactly where the funds will come from, hoping to delay as long as possible the inevitable outcry from the targeted industries. A proposal last year to phase in a tobacco-tax increase of $1.10 a pack triggered a multibillion-dollar advertising and lobbying campaign that ultimately killed it. The federal cigarette tax is 24 cents a pack; it will rise to 39 cents in 2002. Mr. Clinton's proposal would be in addition to scheduled increases.
