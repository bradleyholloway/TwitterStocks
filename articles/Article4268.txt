 What France's Economic Policy Means   By By Edouard Balladur, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1987  Under the leadership of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, the French government has launched a program of rejuvenation in the past year. Within this program, economic measures play a central role, measures that, although some call them merely technical, reflect a view of society.  The second principle is that people should not be deprived of the return that their efforts deserve. Freedom is not anarchy; rules, laws, checks and balances are necessary. This is a basic tenet that must be applied to international monetary affairs as well as to domestic affairs. France has been a longstanding advocate of surveillance and discipline in the functioning of the international monetary system. The recent Louvre Agreement on exchange-rate stabilization among the industrialized nations is an example of the contribution that governments can make to an open and growing world economy. Such a cooperative approach amply substantiates the fact that freedom does not mean disorder.  France used to exercise extreme administrative jurisdiction over foreign-currency dealings. Business operations by French corporations outside of France were subject to detailed controls and authorizations. Even travelers abroad and families with dependents outside of France were restricted and controlled. Such controls have never made a weak currency strong; they are short-term expedients and take an exacting toll on economic efficiency.
