 Price Waterhouse Faces RTC Inquiry Over S&L Billing   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1993  The Resolution Trust Corp. asked its inspector general to investigate possible "irregularities" in the billing procedures of Price Waterhouse's 1992 contract to manage some of the activities of the failed HomeFed Bank.  If any irregularities are uncovered, the RTC could take enforcement action against the accounting firm, such as barring further contracts with the savings-and-loan cleanup agency. The billing problems have "only recently come to light," Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary and temporary RTC chief executive officer, said in a statement.  RTC spokesman Stephen Katsanos said that the investigation will go beyond issues that became public earlier this year, when the inspector general reported that Price Waterhouse charged the thrift regulator 67 cents a page for copying more than 10 million documents in reviewing HomeFed assets.
