 SmartMoney: Avoid Car-Loan Pileup   By Bradford, Stacey L, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2004  It's a surprisingly common problem. Edmunds.com, an auto Web site, says about 27% of consumers trading in vehicles find that they are "upside down" on the existing loan, with an average $3,800 in negative equity (the gap between the loan balance and the car's open-market value). In California, 38% of people trading in still owe an average of $4,700. Many drivers simply add that debt to the balance on the new loan or lease.  This may start a cycle that's hard to break. Do it a second or third time and you may find yourself trapped underwater, driving a car long past warranty or shelling out thousands to repay a loan. "A car owner could wake up with a vehicle that's worth $10,000 but owe $30,000," says Bob Kurilko, Edmunds.com vice president of marketing and industry communications.
