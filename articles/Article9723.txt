 Josh Groban, Music's Young Crossover King   By Buss, Dale, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2004  So it's fortunate that Mr. Groban has become one of Warner Bros. Records' leading concert draws of the summer. "What's been cool is that I've been able to be nothing other than who I am; there doesn't have to be a masterworked image in play here," he said. "I've just been able to go out and sing."  Because his crossover appeal doesn't package well for today's highly fragmented radio formats, Mr. Groban's handlers chose another path: television. He came to the attention of many eventual fans through a Public Broadcasting System special. The TV show "Ally McBeal" cast him and his voice for a couple of episodes. "Today," "Oprah," "20/20" and others have exposed him as well. Mr. Groban has belted out globally televised anthems at the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and at this year's Super Bowl.  For his part, Mr. Groban says that for now he's happy to just keep crossing lines, both demographic and musical. "I'd like to be able to pay homage and tap into each of the influences I've had growing up," he says. "But I want to do it in an intelligent way that makes fans want to come along for the ride, and not say, 'Why is he doing this?'"
