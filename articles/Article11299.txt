 Coniston Discloses 9.7% Stake in UAL And Plans to Seek Control of the Board   By By David B. Hilder and Judith Valente, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1989  Coniston Partners' announcement that it owns a 9.7% stake in UAL Corp. and will try to win control of its board significantly increases the pressure on UAL's unions, management and directors to settle their differences and find a way to restructure or sell the company, the parent of United Airlines.  But even the pressure from Coniston might not be enough to force a level of cooperation that so far has eluded the various groups, people familiar with the situation say. In addition, it seems highly unlikely that any sale or recapitalization could approach the $300-a-share price that a management and pilot union group proposed but was unable to finance, investment bankers say.  But leaders of the machinists union are demanding that Mr. Wolf and other managers involved in the failed bid leave UAL and not participate in any future buy-out. In addition, the machinists' leaders have drafted recapitalization plans that call for employees to own a minority stake of 20% to 25%, though the leaders say they might be willing to compromise on a plan that would provide for a bigger employee stake over time. The machinists have also been soliciting outside investors who might want to take a big stake in UAL.
