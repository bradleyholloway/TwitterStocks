 Real Medicare Reform Must End Price-Fixing   By By Ruth S. King, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2001  President Bush will today propose a prescription drug card for seniors as part of a major initiative to overhaul Medicare. Democrats in Congress, even those in favor of prescription drug coverage, are already voicing opposition to anything but modest change in the administration of Medicare. Neither the president nor his opponents seem inclined to address the real problem: Medicare's iron-fisted control over physicians, hospitals, patients, and supplemental insurers.  In all the discussion of health-care reform you rarely read about the restraint of trade and price fixing perpetrated by the combined forces of Medicare and the purveyors of Medicare supplement insurance. Under the auspices of the Healthcare Finance Administration -- which recently changed its name to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS) -- this peculiar partnership of business and government is holding doctors and seniors in a box kept locked by law.  Even worse, his offer to pay the doctor out-of-pocket was refused on legal grounds. Physicians who participate in Medicare must accept the government-dictated fees or face a range of penalties including eviction from the panel of Medicare-approved physicians. Doctors in private practice are free to opt out of Medicare, but internists, cardiologists, pulmonologists and other specialists who treat chronic adult-onset diseases risk bankruptcy if they leave the program.
