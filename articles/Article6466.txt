 Kodak Is Facing 'Informal' Probe Launched by SEC   By Bulkeley, William M, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2005  Kodak, of Rochester, N.Y., said it is cooperating with the inquiry, which began in March. Kodak didn't disclose the investigation until yesterday when it filed financial reports for the second quarter with the SEC. David Lanzillo, a Kodak spokesman, said the company didn't report the inquiry when it filed first-quarter earnings because "we only had very limited information." He said the SEC didn't ask it to report the investigation, and such an inquiry "isn't unexpected" following a restatement.
