 Nasdaq, Russell 2000 Fall From Record Highs, But Vicinity, Delano IPOs Nearly Triple Prices   By By Thomas Granahan and Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2000  By all means, the rally that has pushed the Nasdaq Composite up a stunning 14% in just seven sessions leading up to Tuesday's record high was in a need of a rest, analysts said. Even a bullish second-quarter earnings report from Cisco Systems late Tuesday couldn't provide support for the market.  The day's three IPOs bucked the larger market trend, putting in strong first-day returns. The best performance was a near-tripling in price by Vicinity, a Palo Alto, Calif., Internet-based marketing company backed by CMGI. It ended at $48.75, up from the offer price of $17. A close second was Canadian Internet communications company Delano Technology, which nearly tripled, ending at $50.50, up from its offer price of $18. And LandaCorp, an Atlanta health-care-administration technology concern, rose 59% to $15.9375 from its offer price of $10.  THCG, a Vienna, Va., financial investment and services company, slid 2 1/8, or 8.3%, to 23 1/2. THCG and its venture-funding vehicle, THCG Venture Partners I, acquired a 38.5% stake in Global Credit Services, a New York credit-research company. THCG said it purchased a 25% ownership stake from certain existing shareholders in exchange for about $5 million in THCG stock.
