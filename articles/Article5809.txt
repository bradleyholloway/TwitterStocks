 Shares Rally to End Broadly Higher Following Technology Sector's Rebound   By By Erin Arvedlund, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1996  The December ratio of 1.09 released by the Semiconductor Industry Association was within the range given by analysts for the industry indicator. A Dow Jones survey of analysts produced a mean estimate of 1.11, with a range of 1.08 to 1.12. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.09 indicates that for every $100 worth of products shipped or billed, manufacturers received $109 of new orders or bookings.  While the technology components of the Russell 2000 small-cap index and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher, the small-cap market's nontechnology components also gained. The Nasdaq computer index was up a whopping 4.2%, while the biotechnology, telecommunications, industrial, insurance, bank and nonbank indexes all rose. The transportation index was the sole decliner.  Among chip and related equipment issues that gained today on the book-to-bill results, Lattice Semiconductor rose 2 1/2, or 8%, to 33 3/4; Fusion Systems added 2 3/4, or 12%, to 25; and Microchip Technology Inc. advanced 3 1/8, or 11%, to 30 3/4 after reporting upside third-quarter operating earnings of 38 cents a share. First Call had listed a consensus estimate of 36 cents a share; both figures exclude a 16-cent writeoff charge.
