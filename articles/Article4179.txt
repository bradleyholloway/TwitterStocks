 People Express Is Said to Consider Bids by 2 Airlines   By By James B. Stewart, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1986  People Express Inc. directors met again last night to consider offers for the troubled discount airline, and an announcement is expected today.  According to sources close to the negotiations, as of late yesterday the board had only two offers to consider: a Texas Air Corp. bid of $9 a share, or about $235.8 million, in cash and preferred stock for the entire airline, and a bid by UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, for People Express's Frontier Airlines unit.  Terms of the UAL bid couldn't immediately be determined. People Express paid $300 million for Frontier last year.
