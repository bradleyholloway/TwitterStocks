 U.S. Car Sales Declined 12% In Late June --- Relaxed Import Restraints And End of Incentives On Financing Are Cited   By By Amal Nag, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1985  The decrease brought U.S. car sales for all of June down 3.2% from a year earlier, and slowed the annual sales pace for domestic cars to its lowest level since last November. Foreign auto makers, however, made a staggering sales gain of 18% for June, capturing 28% of the U.S. market, up from 24% a year earlier.  Auto makers blamed the continued drop in sales on the expiration of most of the companies' consumer incentive programs. The auto makers' low-interest financing offers, which began early this year, consistently had helped bolster sales, but those offers ended early last month. Auto executives said many consumers who usually would be buying cars now had been lured by the incentives into making purchases earlier.  In the last 10 days of June, sales of U.S.-made cars fell to 218,874 vehicles from 280,044 a year earlier. The 12% drop is based on daily sales rates, rather than on total sales volume; there were eight selling days in the latest period, compared with nine a year earlier. GM's sales fell 15% to 117,863 vehicles, Ford Motor Co.'s sales declined 8.1% to 56,896, and Chrysler Corp.'s sales dropped 7.7% to 29,966 units.
