 Home Entertainment: The Elephant in the Living Room; Big-screen TV prices are down by 30% or more -- but once you lug one home, the drama's just beginning; From surprise extra costs to new battles for the remote, how home theaters are shaking up the house   By Reed Abergotti and Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2005  For Rob Horwood, it meant staying glued to his couch for hours every Sunday if he wanted to watch the Houston Texans play football in high- definition. That's because every time he got up to get a drink from the fridge or go to the bathroom, his two sons jumped in and started playing Links 2004 on their Xbox. "It's a fight," says the Wichita Falls, Texas, industrial engineer. Last month, he finally changed the rules. On Sundays, all videogame play is restricted to the tube TV. "They're like circling sharks," he says.  Fernando Manalo had a different solution. When he bought a new 50- inch rear-projection TV for his den a couple of years ago, his plan was to spend more time watching super-sharp DVDs on the couch. He even put the old tube TV in his son's bedroom so he could have it all to himself. Then the plan went awry. After months of scrambling for dibs on the high-definition screen, he gave in and bought another, 32-inch LCD for the kids and their videogames. "It's hard to take candy away from kids," says the 46-year-old IT manager in Paramus, N.J. (Flat- panel inch counts reflect the measurement of the screen's diagonal.)  Your old DVR won't cut it: Standard digital video recorders like [TiVo] usually don't record in high definition. That means you might think you're recording your favorite program in the crisp new format, only to find it looking like a standard broadcast when you get home to watch it. You'll likely have to pay a premium to get a DVR that can record in high- definition format. DirecTV's HD-capable DVR, for example, costs subscribers $399.
