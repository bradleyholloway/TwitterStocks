 Stocks Fall In a Raucous Trading Day --- Investors Await Data On Economy Today; Bond Prices Decline   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1997  In another wild trading day on Wall Street, stock prices tumbled as investors braced for a fresh round of economic data to be released early this morning.  By the time the volatile trading session ended, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recouped more than half of its losses, ending 58.30 points lower at 7660.98. That still leaves the blue-chip index about 7.3% below its highs of early August, and close to the lows seen during the current setback. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.44 to 912.59. Small stocks marked time, with the Russell 2000 index of small companies down 0.97 to 435.93 and the Nasdaq Composite Index up just 0.61 point to 1639.86.
