 Airlines' Big Profits Raise Unions' Expectations   By Susan Carey and Scott McCartney, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1997  United pilots, meanwhile, recently voted on a wage-increase proposal that many expect will be turned down. And its flight attendants -- the only labor group that didn't participate in the 1994 buyout of Chicago-based UAL Corp. -- are raising money for a strike fund. "If we don't get raises now, we're not going to get them when [the company] is losing money," says Kevin Lum, president of the United chapter of Association of Flight Attendants.  The defiant mood "clearly signals that labor intends to participate fully in the industry's profit recovery. What a surprise," writes Samuel Buttrick, PaineWebber's airline analyst. "The days of broad-based labor concessions are over."  The American pilots' rejection of the contract caught AMR officials by surprise. "It was the best contract that exists and they turned it down," says one incredulous American official. Even during the industry's downturn, American's pilots received pay increases. But union leaders say the opposition centered on the small size of the latest proposed raise -- a total of about 5% over four years. "People are looking for raises that keep them in line with the cost of living," said Mr. [Rob Held], the pilot.
