 CAE Shares Fall Due to Reports About U.S. Unit   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1990  Shares of CAE Industries Ltd. plunged 18% on reports that the U.S. Defense Department is considering cutting off payments to the company's U.S. unit.  In a letter written to Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), Terrence O'Donnell, the Defense Department's general counsel, said the Pentagon is considering "administrative action such as suspension or debarment or witholding of progress payments" to CAE-Link Corp. The action is contemplated as a result of allegations that the aircraft-simulator manufacturer overbilled the Pentagon on contracts, Pentagon officials said.  The letter was sent last week in reply to one from Mr. Aspin, in which the Wisconsin Democrat requested a tougher stance toward CAE-Link.
