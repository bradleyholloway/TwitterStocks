 Corporate-Bond Hunger Grows In a Market Flush With Money   By Sullivan, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2006  "In general, it has been pretty light," said Cindy Cole, director of corporate-bond investment at Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland, with $7 billion in fixed-income assets. "I expected it to be much, much heavier," she said.  The market "could be looking at somewhat higher benchmark borrowing costs" depending upon today's employment report from the Labor Department, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. The report could set the tone for the direction of interest rates near term. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to have risen 212,000 in February, in line with gains reported in previous months.  Mary Beth Fisher, interest-rate strategist at Bear Stearns Cos., said demand for the reopened 10-year note was subdued. "There's a little bit of nervousness about nonfarm payrolls," she said.
