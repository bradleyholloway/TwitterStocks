 Make Your Cash Earn Its Keep   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2003  I don't believe it's possible to forecast short-term market moves. But I can understand why folks are nervous. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note is yielding less than 41/2%, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is still at a lofty 30 times trailing 12-month reported earnings.  Vanguard Short-Term Corporate's share price will bob up and down, and that can be unnerving if you are used to money-market funds, savings accounts and certificates of deposit, where you shouldn't ever lose money. Even so, the risk involved is modest. Since its launch in 1982, Vanguard Short-Term Corporate has had only one calendar-year loss and that was a tiny 0.08% dip in 1994.  I own short-term bonds in my personal account and I have part of my 401(k) money invested in the plan's stable-value fund. But this year, most of my bond-market money hasn't gone into these two investments. Instead, it's gone into my mortgage.
