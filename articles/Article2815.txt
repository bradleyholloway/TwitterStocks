 Problems Grow for Mexico's Grupo Dina --- Leading Bus Maker Will Miss Payment Due Tomorrow; Workers Threaten Strike   By By Joel Millman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2001  Grupo Dina's current difficulties stem from a 1999 restructuring in which the [Raymundo Gomez Flores] family decided to sell 61% of its American holding to New York buyout firm Joseph Littlejohn & Levy Inc. Although the deal gave Grupo Dina $80 million in new working capital and enough cash to service its debt, it deprived the bus maker of needed earnings from its most profitable division. Grupo Dina further agreed under the sale terms not to liquidate any of its remaining 39% stake in MCII until 2004.  On Friday, Grupo Dina General Director Gemaliel Garcia said the company hopes to renegotiate that part of its agreement with its New York partner. "Availing ourselves of our MCII shareholding is just one of the measures we would like to adopt" to raise cash to service Grupo Dina's debt, Mr. Garcia said. Calls to Joseph Littlejohn & Levy weren't returned.
