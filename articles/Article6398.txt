 Older Treatment For Manic Illness May Be Superior   By By Thomas M. Burton, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2000  The latest developments don't bode well for the hottest new treatment, Eli Lilly & Co.'s Zyprexa. Since receiving federal approval last spring to treat the acute mania phase of manic-depression, Zyprexa has snapped up nearly 10% of the market, according to some estimates. But now comes a study suggesting that the market leader, 17-year-old Depakote from Abbott Laboratories, works just as well for patients in the acute manic phase of the illness -- and with sharply lower side effects compared with Zyprexa.  For Lilly, any Zyprexa slowdown would signal trouble. Sales of the company's flagship product, the antidepressant Prozac, are waning, and next year Prozac is expected to lose its patent exclusivity. The manic-depression market was thought to represent enormous potential for Zyprexa, a three-year-old drug originally approved for treating schizophrenia. This year, manic-depression helped Zyprexa's sales grow 20%, to about $2.25 billion.  The Abbott study of 120 patients over 12 weeks shows that Depakote and Zyprexa treat the illness about equally well, but that weight gain occurred in 10% of the Depakote patients, compared with 25% of the Zyprexa patients. Similarly, Depakote showed advantages in other lower side effects such as somnolence (29% vs. 47%), nasal rhinitis (3% vs. 14%), bloating known as edema (0% vs. 14%) and speech disorder (0% vs. 7%.)
