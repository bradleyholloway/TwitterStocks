 MarketWatch: Get Older, Get Happier -- It Happens   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  Uncertainty matters more than money and "has more influence on happiness than most other circumstances," Mr. [Peter Ubel] says. He notes, for instance, that if you are offered a steady, yet small, stream of income for life, "no matter what your previous income had been, you'll adjust."  "We tend to think that having more money so we can purchase more goods will bring us happiness, but there is such a small relationship between how much money you have and how happy you are," Mr. Ubel says. "It makes more sense to have a little more insurance than having the latest iPhone. It's good for your happiness."  It has to be "something that's substantive and matters, such as taking care of a grandchild, volunteer activity three days a week, continuing to work rather than retiring," Mr. [Robert Butler] says. "Something that makes a difference in the person's life is life-enhancing. They enjoy it more and live longer than those who have nothing in their lives."
