 Recording Industry Continues Legal Duel Against Web Piracy   By Smith, Ethan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2003  The 267 people who received warnings earlier but weren't sued this week have either settled or are in the process of settling, said RIAA president Cary Sherman. The group didn't specify the amounts of the settlements, but previously disclosed sums have ranged from $2,000 to $10,000, with the average around $3,000.  Mr. Sherman said that the high rate of settlements indicated that the strategy of suing individual users was working. "People are settling at a very quick pace," Mr. Sherman said in an interview. "The message is out. This is illegal; they know they've been caught."
