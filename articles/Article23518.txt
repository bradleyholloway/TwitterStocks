 Rate-Cut Speculation Dominates Market   By Scott Patterson and Jaclyne Badal, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 2007  Earlier in the week, jitters about the Fed's plans helped send spasms through the stock market. On Tuesday, the Dow tumbled 280 points, in part due to the release of minutes from the Fed's Aug. 7 meeting that showed central bankers were more concerned that the economy is weakening than previously thought. The following day the Dow roared back 247 points, after the release of a letter in which Mr. [Ben Bernanke] told Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) that policy makers are prepared to "act as needed" to maintain economic stability.  The recent volatility is likely to continue until the Fed's Sept. 18 meeting -- unless the central bank decides to make a rare intermeeting move before then. But economists say that's not likely to happen unless the market's volatility gets much more severe.  "My guess is the Fed will not ease at the meeting," he says. "If I am the Fed, I wouldn't waste a cut on a regular scheduled meeting, I'd save it for when it was needed to boost panicky confidence and otherwise, unless real economic growth fades, I wouldn't use it."
