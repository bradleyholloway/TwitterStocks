 Picks -- Top Toons: Awards Watch; The new Oscar short list for animated films features some you probably haven't seen   By Jurgensen, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  A CLAY FIGURINE could be thanking the Academy in March. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced 10 animated features that meet its requirements for Oscar consideration. The list will be narrowed to three nominees by a selection committee in January. The list points to some of this year's dominant box-office trends and critical favorites but also includes some lesser-known contenders. Six of the films are computer-generated, including Disney's first all- computerized film, "Chicken Little," which has made $119 million in the month since it was released.
