 Reagan May Ease Minimum-Wage Stand If Legislation Is Diluted, Brock Indicates   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1987  The Reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if Congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly, Labor Secretary William Brock indicated.  Mr. Brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses. He also said that Congress would have to drop plans to tie future rises in the minimum wage to the average wage for all non-supervisory private workers after 1990.  Earlier this week, during the Senate Labor Committee's first hearing on a bill to boost the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour in 1990 from the current $3.35, Mr. Brock reiterated his opposition to an increase. He said boosting the level would worsen problems that many poorly educated, unskilled youths face in trying to find work in a more complex job market.
