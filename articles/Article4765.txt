 Double Czech: Dvorak's Opera 'Rusalka' With Benackova   By By Manuela Hoelterhoff, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1987  New York -- Any doubts that a little-known piece about the amorous plight of a water sprite could hold adults spellbound for three hours disappeared last Wednesday as Eve Queler led her Opera Orchestra of New York through a concert performance of Anton Dvorak's "Rusalka" sung in the original Czech at Avery Fisher Hall.  This "Rusalka" was no exception. Holding center stage, all a-twinkle in a sequined frock that evoked the watery depths she hymned so sweetly, was Gabriela Benackova, the soprano from Bratislava. Just getting this Czech wonder woman onstage is a feat. Last March, she got Ms. Queler to postpone "Rusalka" by pleading an ear infection. Some American opera managers say the soprano is quite the slippery sprite when it comes to keeping her engagements. The Metropolitan Opera, for instance, won't soon forget the rescission of her Micaela contract for the revival of "Carmen" this spring. Unexpectedly, it seems, her voice had swelled from a silvery freshet into a Moldauesque flood of sound. Virginal Micaela was too slight a role for her now.
