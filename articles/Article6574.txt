 War as a Necessary Evil? Indian Firebrand Is an Odd Pied Piper   By By Sadanand Dhume, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2002  Mr. [Singh Bitta] rose to national prominence fighting a different war. In the 1980s and early 1990s, India's Punjab state was racked with violence as Sikh separatists sought to carve out a homeland. As a university student in Punjab, Mr. Bitta, himself a Sikh, opposed the separatists and joined the youth wing of the Congress party, then India's ruling political party. He rose rapidly and in 1993 was made president of the wing. His high profile as a nationalist Sikh student leader from Punjab put Mr. Bitta near the top of the separatists' hit list, and in 1992 he escaped a car-bomb attack but sustained serious injuries to both legs.  Mr. Bitta never misses a chance to drive his point home to the Indian public. Two days after the demonstration at Parliament, Mr. Bitta, flanked by two machine-gun-toting commandos, strides into a hospital room where an Indian Embassy staffer is recuperating after allegedly being beaten up by Pakistani intelligence agents in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, on June 1. A gaggle of press photographers follows, ignoring the admonishments of the nurse on duty, and as flashbulbs explode, Mr. Bitta leans forward and hands the man his business card.
