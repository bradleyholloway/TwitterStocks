 Union Defections From AFL-CIO Strain State and Local Councils   By Maher, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2005  Over the past two weeks, four million members of the AFL-CIO, representing one-third of the federation, left the group, seriously straining the 50 state and roughly 400 regional labor councils that depend heavily on members for grass-roots organizing, political campaigning and contributions. The councils are funded by a per-member tax paid by union locals. "They're critical to what we do in every part of our work," said Stewart Acuff, AFL-CIO national organizing director.  John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president, indicated that won't happen in this case. "Anyone that is not affiliated with the federation cannot participate in state [AFL-CIO] federations and labor councils," he told reporters last week. Mr. Sweeney remains a member of the now disaffiliated SEIU, but also reactivated his membership in the Office and Professional Employees International Union six months ago, a move that effectively allowed him to continue running the AFL-CIO.
