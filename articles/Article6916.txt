 The Middle Seat: Overseas Flights Put the Squeeze on Legroom; Airlines Cramp Coach Seats In Sharp Contrast to Routes Flown by U.S. Discounters   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2005  Even worse, Air France has some seats in its long-haul planes with a measly 30 inches of space, and Virgin Atlantic Airways says it has some entire planes in its 747 and A340 fleets laid out at 30 inches of space in coach -- other planes have either 31 inches throughout or 32 inches throughout coach. But the airline doesn't tell customers if the plane has 30-inch seating or 32-inch seating because aircraft rotate around different routes, a Virgin spokeswoman says.  Different types of planes within an airline's fleet can have different coach seat-pitch offerings as well. At Continental Airlines, for example, the Boeing 767-400 is laid out with 32 inches of standard seat-pitch in coach. But Continental's 777 has only 31 inches of row room standard. At Northwest Airlines, A330-200s have 32 inches, but A330-300s have only 31 inches (rows 10-28 do have extra room, Northwest's Web site says). Northwest 747s also have only a minimum of 31 inches in coach, and slightly narrower seats than either A330 model. If you have a choice and you're flying coach, look for the A330-200s.  Even on the individual plane, seat pitch can vary considerably, and it can be difficult for savvy travelers to root out the best seats. At American Airlines, for example, the minimum seat pitch is 31 inches on 777s. But only 61 of 194 coach seats on a 777 have just 31 inches -- less than one-third of the seats. American says 53 seats have 32 inches, 24 seats have 33 inches, 34 seats have 34 inches, and four seats in coach have 35 inches. And that doesn't count exit rows or bulkheads. That's the good news, since odds are you will get more than 31 inches. The bad news is American doesn't mark the roomier seats on its Web site. Other sites like seatguru.com don't have it, either.
