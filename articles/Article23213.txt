 AT&T Investors Face Tax Headache; Deal With SBC Complicates Problem of How To Calculate Cost Basis; Decades of Splits, Spinoffs   By Kim, Jane J, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2005  As a result of the flurry of deals, many of the 2.7 million shareholders who own AT&T have little idea what their shares' initial value really is. In order to calculate their taxes, they must reconstruct their records and piece together the threads of AT&T's long and convoluted history to figure out what they originally paid for each share of AT&T -- a figure known as the "cost basis."  There is some good news for investors, though. SBC's proposed deal to buy AT&T appears to be structured in such a way that will allow AT&T shareholders to postpone that tax headache for another day. Under the pact, SBC would pay roughly $15 billion in stock, which is expected to be exempt from taxes for AT&T shareholders. AT&T will also pay its shareholders a special dividend of $1.30 a share which, because it is being paid out by AT&T and not by SBC, will essentially be treated like any other qualified dividend, [Robert Willens] notes.  To be sure, investors shouldn't let their tax fears drive their investment decisions. For those who don't have much faith that the deal will succeed and want to immediately sell their shares, several resources can help them come up with a proper cost basis. A good place to start is to call the brokerage firm where the shares were purchased, or AT&T's stock-transfer agent, EquiServe (800-348-8288), which can track down stock certificates using the shareholder's Social Security or stock-certificate number. AT&T's Web site (www.att.com) offers a detailed breakdown of corporate changes and worksheets to help shareholders figure out their cost basis.
