 The New School Spirit: Burial Plots for Alums --- Cash-Hungry Universities Sell Space in Campus Vaults; `You'll See Me in Box 12'   By By Anne Marie Chaker, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  The University of Richmond in Virginia just opened a million-dollar "columbarium," a vault with individual niches for cremated remains. The serpentine-shaped structure, which surrounds a garden adjacent to the campus chapel, has room for the ashes of several thousand people, at $3,000 a slot. In nearby Charlottesville, the University of Virginia's "cemetery committee" has sold 130 of its 180 niches, and is talking about doubling the size of its columbarium. Slots there go for $1,800 apiece, but each holds four urns.  The concept of being buried at one's alma mater has gained momentum from devoted alums eager for new ways to show their school spirit. University of Virginia grads pooled together about $140,000 to build the school's columbarium. The facility sits on the edge of its sold-out cemetery. A few plots in the cemetery, which dates back to the late 1800s, are still unoccupied, but the school has been unable to find the families who bought them.  Even with the space efficiency of columbariums, some schools are sticking with traditional graveyards. Mount Saint Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Md., has a century-old cemetery that has been filled since the 1960s. Over the years, requests from alumni who wanted to be buried on campus poured in. So, in 1994 the college built a cemetery on campus that took up three groves and had 350 burial plots. Demand forced the building of a fourth grove, which opened in 1999. Already, it, too, is nearly sold out, and a fifth is being discussed.
