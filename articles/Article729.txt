 American Airlines Offers 10% Discounts To Senior Citizens for One-Time $25 Fee   By By Jonathan Dahl and Francis C. Brown III, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1986  American Airlines, in a marketing tactic that is likely to set an industrywide trend, announced a 10% discount fare program for senior citizens.  The discount, which American said will "indefinitely" be a part of its fare structure, applies to senior citizens who pay a $25 one-time enrollment fee. United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, said it will be "fully competitive" with the new discount, and other airlines are expected to match the program. If they do, the discount could become one of the most significant marketing tactics in the airline industry in years.  A few other carriers have tried to offer discount fares to senior citizens, including a program recently offered by Continental Airlines. But Continental's discount was considered one in a recent spate of fare cuts; it applies only to travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and expires March 5.
