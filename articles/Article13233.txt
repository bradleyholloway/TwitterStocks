 Yes, Virginia, the U.S. Has a War Strategy   By Melloan, George, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2005  The U.S. method has been spelled out repeatedly as well: Attack the jihadists on their own ground and replace their protectors with democratic governments that share U.S. values. This has been defined as the "[George W. Bush] doctrine." In November's 60th-anniversary issue of Commentary, no fewer than 36 leading scholars debated it, a rather strong suggestion that such a doctrine exists. Admittedly, they were mostly friendly "neocons," but who else these days has anything interesting to say about foreign policy?  The document on the White House Web site details a U.S. government doctrine designed and implemented by the commander in chief and approved by the Congress. It is the core of U.S. foreign policy and even though it is not "new," the greater detail makes the document worth reading by anyone with a serious interest in understanding what is going on and what is at stake. Cynics might scoff that it is White House "propaganda," which of course it is in the broadest sense of that word, but it is also an effort to explain to Americans why winning in Iraq is of vital importance to them.  The Department of Homeland Security is proud of the fact that there hasn't been a major terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, and that is indeed something to be thankful for. But it has perhaps given Americans a false sense of security that erodes the shock of the 9/11 atrocity and leads to a belief that the "War on Terror" is not as serious as it was first made out to be. One problem is the abstract description. It is not a war on terror, but a defensive struggle against ruthless fanatics who have dedicated their lives to the destruction of Western civilization. They dream of an Islamic "caliphate" stretching from the Far East to the coast of Spain, ruled over by the equivalent of Iran's ayatollahs with an equal disdain for human freedom and dignity.
