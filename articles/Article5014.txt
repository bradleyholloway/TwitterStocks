 Crash of Southern Co. Plane Still Unsolved, U.S. Investigators Say   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1989  Federal officials investigating the April crash of a Southern Co. plane released transcripts Friday of the aircraft's cockpit recordings but said they still hadn't reached any conclusions about the fatal accident.  A senior vice president of Southern's Gulf Power unit, Jacob F. Horton, died in the crash, and investigators are trying to determine whether it was an accident, sabotage or suicide. On the morning of the crash, Gulf officials had told Mr. Horton that an internal audit committee was recommending his termination.
