 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Compiled by Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 1985  The president's televised address Tuesday will be followed by a series of trips to "take the tax plan to the people." A visit to Williamsburg, Va., an aide says, will "stress that resistance to taxation is an American tradition." Another stop will be Oshkosh in Wisconsin, the home state of GOP Sen. Kasten, a leading tax-change advocate.  The goal is to drum up public support before pressing for congressional backing. "First the people, then Congress," one adviser explains. To avoid a potential backlash, the White House nixes a possible trip to New York state. High state and local taxes there no longer would be deductible under the president's plan.  Jordan's king will seek U.S. support when he visits Reagan next week. The two countries are near agreement on formation of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian negotiating team that wouldn't include PLO members. The delicate task is to draw up a list acceptable to both Israel and Arafat. Hard-liners in Jerusalem and at PLO headquarters in Tunis are already denouncing the plan.
