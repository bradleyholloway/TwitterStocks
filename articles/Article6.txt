A Transit Authority investigation of Friday's subway accident at the station at 53d Street and Third Avenue has not yet determined why an electrical device beneath one of the F train cars fell to the tracks, causing the accident, an authority spokesman said yesterday.  The device, called a current collector, hit a rail and shortcircuited, causing fire and heavy smoke and a delay of 1 hour 20 minutes on the IND line from Queens. The accident caused minor injuries to 21 persons, all of whom were either treated at the scene or treated at hospitals and released.  The spokesman, Robert Huber, said of the device, which links the power, or third, rail to a train's motor: ''We don't know why it fell off and are trying to find out.''  The subway car involved in the incident was one of the 754 R-46 models that have been plagued by troubles related to weakness in the undercarriages. They are regularly inspected twice a week, specifically for cracks in the undercarriages, as required by the Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration.  Mr. Huber said the two undercarriages of the car involved in the accident ''most certainly'' had been inspected for cracks ''within the past week.'' And when the entire car, including the current collector, was last inspected on March 20, he said, ''no trouble'' was found with the electrical device. Similar Incident Recalled  After the accident on Friday, John D. Simpson, president of the Transit Authority, said that the original ''flimsy'' current collectors had been replaced with new ones on more than two-thirds of the R-46 fleet of cars, following a 1979 Federal study of the controversial cars.  Mr. Huber said yesterday that the current collector that fell on Friday was one of the newer ones. It was at least the second such incident with the newer current collectors in 25 days. A similar incident involving an R-46 car occurred on April 21.  Mr. Simpson said on Friday that it was difficult to determine what goes wrong with a current collector when it short-circuits, because ''the electrical leads tend to melt'' from the intense heat.  Meanwhile, according to Mr. Huber, inspections were moving ahead in accordance with Mr. Simpson's assurance after the Friday accident that the entire R-46 fleet would be inspected over the weekend.
