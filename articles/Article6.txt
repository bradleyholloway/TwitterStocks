In a move that stock analysts said demonstrated unusual confidence in its hold on consumers, Eastman Kodak Company said yesterday that it would raise prices an average of 8 percent on a wide variety of photographic products.  ''These new increases confirm that pricing is now accepted by Kodak's management as a weapon for keeping margins up,'' Brian Fernandez, an analyst with the First Manhattan Company, said. Mr. Fernandez stated that in the past Kodak relied primarily on the introduction of new products to increase margins.  The increases, which will be phased in over the next two months, range from about 7.5 percent for roll film to 10 percent for instant and traditional cameras.  Yesterday's announcement attributed the price rises to ''increased costs of doing business.'' Stock analysts, however, said that at least some of the increases were also an attempt to raise profit margins. Demand Remained Strong  ''It demonstrates an important discovery Kodak made a year ago when silver prices shot up and they had to drastically raise film prices,'' Mr. Fernandez said. ''They discovered that demand did not drop in many sectors.''  Mr. Fernandez was referring to Kodak's response to the rise in the price of silver from just over $6 an ounce in early 1979 to more than $50 an ounce last January. The metal is a key raw material in most films and Kodak, the supplier of 90 percent of the picture film sold in the United States, annually purchases some 50 million ounces.  The jump in silver prices forced Kodak to abandon a decades-old practice of rarely raising prices more than a few percentage points in any year. It raised film prices as much as 35 percent for basic products such as 35 millimeter black-and-white film. Some specialty film went up even more steeply.  By February, silver prices began to plummet, but Kodak, which had discovered surprisingly little resistance to its price increases, decided not to pass on the savings in most cases. According to Mr. Fernandez, 1980 ended with Kodak prices averaging 19 percent more than a year ago even though silver is trading at under $16 an ounce.  ''They found in 1980 that they can get away with it,'' said Peter J. Enderlin, who follows Kodak for Smith Barney, Harris Upham Inc. ''I think they are looking for a 14 percent profit margin on sales, after tax, and a 21 to 22 percent return on equity.'' Mr. Enderlin estimates that the profit margin on sales this year will be 12.6 percent and return on equity somewhere between 18 percent and 19 percent. Surprising Aspect  The most surprising aspect of the increases to analysts was the 9 percent increase for instant film and the 10 percent increase for instant cameras. Kodak is thought to have 40 percent of the instant camera market and perhaps a 30 percent share in instant film, but the market is slumping and Kodak's drive on the market leader, Polaroid, appears to have stalled.  Noting that the increase will raise the price of an instant photo to about $1, Mr. Fernandez said, ''This tells me they are pricing for profit, not greater volume and will increase speculation that this is an area where they may be coming up with a new product.''  Kodak's increases for instant cameras and film are not expected to draw a response from Polaroid. But Japanese pocket camera and film producers are likely to follow Kodak's pricing lead.
