 LAB NOTES   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1993  Efforts to treat illness by implanting genes into human cells are among the most provocative endeavors in science today. Doctors are testing various gene-delivery techniques against several inherited disorders, certain cancers and AIDS. Despite logistical hurdles and ethical concerns, there are 68 human gene-therapy trials approved or under way -- up from 26 last year. Gene-therapy research programs are popping up at medical centers around the country.  Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are trying gene therapy to block symptoms of arthritis, such as joint swelling and cartilage damage for which there's currently little effective treatment. In experiments led by Christopher Evans and Paul Robbins, researchers inserted an arthritis-blocking gene into white blood cells removed from fluid surrounding the knees of laboratory rabbits that suffer an arthritis-like disorder. In arthritis, these blood cells attack joint tissue by releasing a substance called interleukin-1, or IL-1.  Several years ago, scientists found that another natural substance can inactivate IL-1. Recently, scientists isolated the gene that gets cells to produce this IL-1 blocker. It's this gene that the Pittsburgh group inserted into rabbit cells. In a new report, the researchers say these transformed cells, after being injected back into rabbit knees, safely produced large amounts of the IL-1 blocker. Swelling and tissue damage were sharply reduced. Plans for human tests are several years off.
