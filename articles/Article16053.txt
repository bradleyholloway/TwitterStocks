 Regicide Reappears -- With a Twist   By By Tunku Varadarajan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2001  It is difficult not to marvel at this tale. Of course, to the Nepalese, who regard their kings as incarnations of the Hindu god Vishnu, regicide is the ultimate transgression. And when the killer of the king is the king's own son -- raised, and deified already, as an avatar-in-waiting -- the violation of the natural order is so immense as to call to mind a Himalayan version of "King Lear" -- save that here, in taking his own life, [Dipendra] revealed a tragic fragility behind his murderous intent. Lear's daughters, by contrast, were greedy subversives. They were usurpers, and their extinguishing of their father, though evil, was comprehensible. If Dipendra's act has an explanation, and there is no certainty that it has, it was as a crime of passion.  The killing of King Birendra, by contrast, appears to have been an irrational act -- inviting one, in fact, to see it as a case of a crown prince "going postal." Dipendra, by all accounts, was a stable fellow who had shown an interest in, and aptitude for, kingship. Why would he take leave of his logic and destroy an institution he stood to inherit over his right to marry a woman of his choice? If he loved her so much, why didn't he choose the path of simple rebellion, like all headstrong sons? After all, he could have married his sweetheart and presented his parents with a fait accompli, or even have threatened to renounce his right to the throne. Why regicide?
