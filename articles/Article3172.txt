 Suspected Arms Dealer Is Arraigned; Briton Is Accused of Offering To Sell 50 Missiles to Agents He Thought Were Terrorists   By Gary Fields and Sara Schaefer, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2003  Mr. [Hemant Lakhani]'s federal public defender, Donald McCauley, said he couldn't comment on the charges. Cathy A. Fleming, a lawyer for Mr. [Ahmed Hameed], said her client is maintaining his innocence and "we are looking forward to a trial in the courtroom and not by the press." Efforts to locate Mr. [Yehuda Abraham]'s lawyer were unsuccessful.  In an April 2002 meeting in New Jersey, court documents said the informant indicated he wanted the missiles for a "jihad" and wanted to "hit the people over here," after which Mr. Lakhani said, "the Americans are bastards," and later, "I am ready to work with you."  Conversations continued over the next several months, according to the court papers, with money arrangements being made for the missile at a cost of $85,000. Mr. Lakhani also set up the disguise by which the missile would be smuggled into the U.S. from St. Petersburg, Russia, and it ultimately was sent as medical equipment, the court papers said.
