 Election '08: For a Historic Election, an Enormous Turnout   By Paulo Prada, Evan Perez, Corey Dade and Douglas A. Blackmon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2008  Citizens surged into school gymnasiums, town halls, church basements, county courthouses and other public places across America to cast ballots in a presidential election pitting the first major- party African-American candidate against a Vietnam War hero. Michael McDonald, a politics professor at Virginia's George Mason University, predicted nearly 65% of the electorate would have voted by the time all polls closed -- matching or eclipsing the turnout in the presidential election of 1960 featuring candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.
