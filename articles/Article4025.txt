 Bevill Bresler Trustee-Receiver Named Amid Indications of Heavy S&L Losses --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1985  A court-appointed trustee and receiver took control of the collapsed government-securities firm Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management Corp., and affiliated companies, as indications mounted that losses by Bevill Bresler's customers -- mostly savings and loan associations -- will be heavy.  In what apparently is a coincidence, two Bevill Bresler alumni -- Ronnie R. Ewton and George Mead, who according to Florida records worked for the firm in 1975 -- became founders and key officers of E.S.M. Later, E.S.M. contributed at least two of its alumni to Bevill Bresler, including Andrew Dale Ledbetter, who is one of several Bevill Bresler officials named along with the firm in this week's SEC suit.  Yesterday, Saul Cohen, an attorney with Rosenman, Colin, Freund, Lewis & Cohen, a New York law firm, was appointed trustee of Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management, which was placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings Monday. Judge Dickinson Debevoise of federal court in Newark, N.J., also named Mr. Cohen receiver for BBS Government Securities Group Inc., the parent company of Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management, and Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Government Securities Inc., an affiliated company.
