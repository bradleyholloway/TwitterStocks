 Solid Quarterly Results Expected for Newspapers   By By Brian Steinberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2000  While the first-quarter results are going to be "very good," says Douglas Arthur, a publishing analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, "it's not going to help the stocks that much." Mr. Arthur suggests investors are already aware that the rest of the year brings with it difficult comparisons for the industry, which has enjoyed robust advertising.  The high-flying Internet economy has buoyed newspaper publishers to new levels of advertising success. But analysts wonder if newspapers can build significantly on results that in many cases are already healthier than usual. A slowdown in advertising revenue growth is starting to become more noticeable, Mr. Arthur says, "in part because comparisons are difficult, in part because retail and classified [advertising] are slowing." National ads, "which have been carrying the crown," he adds, "can't carry it forever."  Gannett Co., often recognized as an industry bellwether, is expected by a First Call/Thomson Financial analysts' consensus to post first-quarter earnings of 73 cents a share. That would mark a rise from 61 cents a share a year earlier for the Arlington, Va., publisher of USA Today.
