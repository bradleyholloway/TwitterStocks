 Getting Personal: Popularity of Managed Accounts Grows   By By Tom Lauricella and Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2001  Fund companies are piling into the managed-account business. Pimco Funds recently rolled out a managed bond account modeled on its best-selling Pimco Total Return Fund and run by Pimco star manager Bill Gross. Last year AIM Management Group launched portfolios following eight different strategies for stocks and bonds. Fidelity Investments recently unveiled separately managed bond portfolios. And this summer, Merrill will offer additional portfolios run by some of their high-profile fund managers.  Expanding into the managed-accounts area means designing different back-office systems and changing the way money managers build portfolios for fund firms. "The behavior modification required to evolve from mutual funds into separate accounts is huge," says Allen Williamson, group president of Nuveen Investments' managed-accounts business.  Consider MFS Investments. In early 1999, MFS hired a veteran managed-account executive, Bill Taylor, from Alliance Capital Management's Regent Investor Services. That summer, an MFS executive said the firm would be "selling billions of dollars" in managed accounts "in a couple years." MFS, which touts itself as the originator of the mutual fund, felt it could easily leverage the abilities of its fund managers.
