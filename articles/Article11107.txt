 Campeau Will Sell $4.4 Billion in Assets To Pay for Costly Federated Acquisition   By By Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1988  Campeau Corp. expects to sell about $4.4 billion in Federated Department Stores Inc. assets to help finance its massive purchase of the big department store company, officials said.  At a news conference here, Mr. Campeau and Robert H. Morosky, who will become chairman and chief executive of combined Federated and Allied Stores Inc. operations, described the Federated purchase as attractive despite the high price.  "We certainly didn't steal it," Mr. Campeau said, adding that he "would have loved to buy (Federated) for $450 million to $500 million less" than what was finally agreed upon. But he declared that combining Allied, which was purchased 17 months ago, with Federated will "give us the best department store chain in the world." He was clearly jubilant after succeeding in "two major hostile takeovers."
