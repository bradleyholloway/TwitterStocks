 Plots & Ploys   By By Peter Grant, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2001  Abbey paid a mere $15 million for the 1.5 million square-foot warehouse and two parking lots in the mid-1990s. Hitting the market with perfect timing, Abbey converted the warehouse to office and retail space, which is now more than 95% leased. Abbey also built a 132-unit rental apartment building on one of the lots. Both projects today are valued at a total of about $280 million, twice Abbey's investment. Indeed, Abbey just refinanced the warehouse building alone with Deutsche Bank for $160 million, in a deal arranged by Bob Herron, of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler.
