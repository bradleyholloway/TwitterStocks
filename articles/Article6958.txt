 Qualcomm to Purchase Flarion   By Clark, Don, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2005  Flarion's patent portfolio is extensive. Some analysts said the deal could help Qualcomm create a stream of patent royalties from non- CDMA networks, along with OFDM patents that Qualcomm has been filing independently.  Michael Thelander, an analyst with the market-research firm Signals Research Group, said Flarion's patents could pose problems for companies working on mobile versions of WiMAX, though stationary versions may not infringe the patents, he said.
