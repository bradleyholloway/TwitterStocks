 Singapore Is Likely to Lift Casino Ban; Major Gambling Operators Are Designing Concepts; Rare Public Protest Heard   By Cris Prystay in Singapore and Peter Sanders in Los Angeles, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  While the gambling companies salivate at the opportunity, the idea of a casino has created a tempest in Singapore. Supporters argue that the casino could earn between $1 billion and $2 billion a year and make a significant contribution to Singapore's gross domestic product.  A casino project has a financial upside for Singapore, which is trying to restructure an economy that has long been dependent on manufacturing plants, many of which have shifted some or all production to lower-cost countries like China and Vietnam. The country has invested heavily to build a biotechnology industry and aims to revamp its role as a tourist hub. Singapore's share of total tourism receipts in Asia fell to 5.2% in 2002 from 8.2% in 1998, according to the Singapore Tourism Board.  While in Macau last month announcing details of the ambitious project to develop a Las Vegas-style strip, William Weidner, Las Vegas Sands' president and chief operating officer, said the company has proposed to spend significantly more on a megaresort in Singapore than the nearly $2 billion already designated for Macau. A person close to the company said Las Vegas Sands could spend about $2.6 billion to develop a single resort-casino at a site near Singapore's central business district.
