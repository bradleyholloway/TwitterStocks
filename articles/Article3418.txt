 Build-to-Sell: A Risky Business for Public Firms --- Quick-Sale Strategy Helps Profits, but Some See Danger Due to Economy   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2001  At the same time, if REITs do scale back their building activity, that would no doubt hurt the gains companies add to their funds from operations, a commonly used measure of REITs' financial performance. The profit gained from the sale of a $100 million development by a merchant-building REIT, roughly $12 million, can amount to four times that of a REIT that builds and then holds that development, Prudential Securities estimates.  While a small number of REITs currently engage in merchant building, more are expected to try it as a result of the REIT Modernization Act, which went into effect this year. The act allows REITs to form wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries that can conduct a range of businesses, from offering tenant services to carrying out merchant building. Previously, REITs could only partly own such subsidiaries.  Some REITs that have expressed interest in setting up subsidiaries to handle merchant building have been waiting on the sidelines, watching which direction the economy is going, says Lee Schalop, analyst at Banc of America Securities. But other companies that have been merchant building for a while -- especially First Industrial, Kimco Realty Corp. and ProLogis, the most active merchant builders in the REIT industry -- insist they have strategies that keep their companies well protected in the face of an economic downturn.
