 Online Brokers to Post Weakened Results   By By Gaston F. Ceron, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2001  Hurt by the weak market, Ameritrade has said it expects to post a loss of 12 cents to 14 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter ended in December, larger than what analysts expected. A year earlier, Ameritrade reported a loss of 12 cents a share for the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Now, investors and analysts will want to hear about Ameritrade's plans for its OnMoney unit, a financial-services Web site in which Ameritrade has invested millions of dollars but which has yet to produce significant revenue.  Meanwhile, Schwab is seen posting earnings of 12 cents a share for the fourth quarter, down from a stock-split-adjusted 13 cents a year earlier. Despite the gloomy predictions about brokers' fourth-quarter performance, Ms. [Eva Radtke] at Prudential says Schwab "should escape this market correction in the best position of the discount brokerage firms in our coverage." She estimates that commission revenue should account for just 36% of Schwab's fourth-quarter revenue, "still the lowest among its peers."
