 South Korea's Roh to Downplay Trade, Focus on Shared Interests in U.S. Visit   By By Karen Elliott House and Damon Darlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 1989  South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, who arrives in Washington next week, will seek to shift the focus of Korean-American relations from trade tensions to shared interests in Asian security and Korean democracy.  Mr. Roh, Korea's first democratically elected president in nearly 40 years, will address a joint session of Congress and meet with President Bush. In an interview, President Roh made clear that he will seek to persuade Americans that the relationship between Korea and the U.S. is far stronger than divisions over Korea's $8.6 billion trade surplus with the U.S.  Asked what those benefits are, Mr. Roh said, "Suppose Korea were communist and Japan threatened. What would be the position of the U.S. as a leader of the free world? Because of U.S. steadfastness, Americans can see favorable economic changes in even communist nations like China and the Soviet Union."
