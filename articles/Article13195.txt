 In Katrina's Wake: Animal Groups Save Scores of Lost Pets; 'Rescue Rig' Arrives   By Avery Johnson and Rachel Emma Silverman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  The American Humane Association dispatched an 82-foot blue "Animal Rescue Rig" from Denver, which costs $6,000 a day to operate and comes with an ambulance that can be driven into the back, three rescue boats, showers, and enough fuel and water for a month. A group called Code 3 Associates from Longmont, Colo., brought a 77-foot tractor- trailer that weighs 74,000 pounds and has a horse trailer and veterinary triage center. Meanwhile, Dr. Kent Glenn, an Aledo, Texas, veterinarian, raised $1,250 from his clinic's clients Saturday morning and the next day headed out to Hattiesburg, Miss. in a Dodge pickup hitched to a 20-foot cattle trailer to help out.  The hurricane's fury left an estimated tens of thousands of animals -- including pets, livestock, zoo and aquarium creatures -- stranded in muddy waters and dilapidated buildings. Many human refugees fleeing the storm didn't have space or money to take their animals with them. Those left in New Orleans often weren't allowed to take their animals into the city's makeshift shelters at the Superdome and Convention Center -- or on some of the evacuation buses, boats and airlifts out of the city.  In Austin, Texas, Lynn and Jud Shelton arrived at the convention center on Saturday with their two dogs, Li'l Bit and Belle; a black cat named Sammy, who was nestled in Mr. Shelton's backpack; and a cockatiel named Trixie, housed in a cumbersome two-by-three-foot metal cage that the couple had been carrying around for almost a week. When the Sheltons fled their house, one of the first things they grabbed -- besides the animals -- was a large plastic bag full of pet food.
