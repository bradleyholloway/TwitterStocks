 Caregiving, in a Team   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2005  Ms. [Sheila Warnock] and another member of the original group, Cappy Capossela, were so inspired by their involvement that they wrote a book titled "Share the Care: How to Organize a Group to Care for Someone Who Is Seriously Ill," published in 1995. Three years ago, Ms. Capossela was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and Ms. Warnock spearheaded yet another team to care for her. And, after Ms. Capossela's death, Ms. Warnock created a Web site, sharethecare.org, and a nonprofit group, Sharethecaregiving Inc. in New York, to honor her friend's memory and increase awareness of their model.  Ms. Warnock also updated their book with ideas pioneered by the care groups that have sprung up around the country in at least 30 states. "It's not uncommon for a group to have 40 or 50 people," she says. "There's an active group in Hawaii that has 100 people taking care of a woman with ALS," or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal neuromuscular disease. "They work in shifts. Part of them are trained to work with the trachea tubes, some do fund-raising."
