 Video Distributor Thrives at Last in Offering `Culture' --- Kultur Overcomes Snags With Unusual Methods of Marketing Its Fare   By By Jeffrey A. Tannenbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1994  WEST LONG BRANCH, N.J. -- With only $6,200 in capital, and his kitchen table as an office, Dennis M. Hedlund started Kultur International Films Ltd. 14 years ago.  But the kitchen table has long been history. And four days ago, the video distributor moved from cramped rented quarters here to a roomier building of its own nearby. Mr. Hedlund says he was able to pay cash for the $400,000 building.  Selling such tapes proved harder than buying rights to them. Mr. Hedlund says he and his wife, Pearl Lee, vice president of Kultur, worked seven days a week for four years, taking holidays only on Christmas Days and Mother's Days. To gain entree to stores, and to earn a living while his own product line was still too small to support the couple, Mr. Hedlund says he became a sales representative for other video companies, offering such popular fare as Jackie Gleason tapes. But store orders for Kultur tapes were still poor, so Mr. Hedlund tried a different strategy.
