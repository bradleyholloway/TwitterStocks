 Deals & Deal Makers: Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns Beat Expectations for 4th-Quarter Earnings   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2001  "Lehman's quarter looked good," said Richard Strauss, a securities-industry analyst for Goldman Sachs Group. Mr. Strauss said he was surprised by the strength of the firm's bond business; turmoil in the junk-bond market hurt profits elsewhere on Wall Street. Revenue from bond trading, for instance, rose nearly 29% at the New York firm.  "We're very enthusiastic about the prospects for Lehman over the longer term and guardedly optimistic in the short-term," said Lehman Chief Financial Officer David Goldfarb. He added that the rate cut is "a great first step in re-energizing the markets."  For the year, Lehman Brothers reported net income of $1.78 billion, compared with $1.13 billion in 1999. Net revenue in 2000 was $7.7 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 1999. (The company defines net revenue as total revenue minus interest expense.) During the fourth quarter, Lehman reported net revenue of $1.7 billion, a 20% increase from the $1.4 billion reported during the fourth quarter of 1999.
