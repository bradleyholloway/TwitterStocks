 Braddock Resigns As the Chairman Of Priceline.com   By Grant, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 9, 2004  Mr. [Richard Braddock]'s departure comes as Priceline is broadening its online sales approach to respond to increasing competition in the travel industry. Best known for using Star Trek's William Shatner as its spokesman, the company originally sold airline tickets by allowing bargain-hunting travelers to bid any price they wanted on a trip. But they had to be flexible on times, routes and airlines, and commit to pay the bid amount if any airline made the flight available.
