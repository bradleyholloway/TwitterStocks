 Europe's Central Bank Appears To Lay Groundwork for Rate Rise   By By G. Thomas Sims, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2000  That optimism is supported by new growth forecasts for the 11-nation euro area by the European Commission, which now predicts the economy will expand 3.4% this year, up from November's best guess of 2.9% and up from 2.3% in 1999. But higher inflation tarnishes the growth outlook. Consumer prices will likely rise 1.8% in 2000, up from a previous forecast of 1.5% and up from 1.1% in 1999. The Commission's forecasts are closely monitored by the ECB, which doesn't make its own predictions public.
