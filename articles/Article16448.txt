 Firm Insures Bank Deposits for Up to $10 Million   By Kim, Jane J, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2004  Some individuals -- especially if they've recently come into an inheritance or sold a property, for example -- may need to worry about exceeding current FDIC limits. Indeed, the percentage of uninsured deposits has been steadily rising to about 38% of total U.S. deposits as of the end of 2003, from 23% in 1994, says Mr. Barr. Part of the reason behind the increase may stem from the fact that Congress hasn't adjusted the limits since 1980, when it raised FDIC coverage to $100,000 from $40,000. Meanwhile, Congress is currently considering legislation that would raise the limits to $130,000.
