 U.S. Investment Banks Tread a Tricky Path in Philippines   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2002  MANILA, Philippines -- U.S. investment banks are looking to help the Philippines deal with its banking problems, just as they have done in South Korea and Thailand. But their business plans could run into snags not seen elsewhere in Asia.  The two are among a number of financial companies that have been sniffing around the Philippines for a while now, but the high cost of doing business here has made progress slow. Now, as the U.S. and the Philippines move closer in the war against terrorism -- sparking a rally in the local stock market as the U.S. pledges aid to the country -- President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's government is pushing new legislation to encourage foreign investors to bankroll asset-management funds here.
