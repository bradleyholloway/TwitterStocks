 Southern Union Gets Bid to Be Acquired; Stock Price Soars   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1989  Southern Union Co. said it received an unsolicited bid to be acquired in a stock swap.  The unsolicited takeover bid isn't the first for Southern Union, which has been restructuring after its financial bruising from the energy industry's downturn. In 1986, Trafalgar Holdings Ltd., a closely held investment firm, proposed to acquire Southern Union for $24 a share, or about $240 million. After confidential examination of Southern Union's books, Trafalgar dropped its plans, saying Southern Union didn't meet its acquisition criteria. At that time, Southern Union's shares were trading at about $17 and its dividend was nearly nine times more than it is now.
