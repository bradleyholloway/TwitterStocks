 Flop by Kloeckner Underscores Risk In Participation Notes, Spawns Outcries   By By Terence Roth, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1988  FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Walter Matrius's telephone began ringing off the hook shortly after Kloeckner & Co. announced Friday that its one million profit-sharing certificates, sold for 135 Deutsche marks ($75.50) apiece two years ago, suddenly were worthless.  The callers were small investors frozen out of Deutsche Bank AG's plan to rescue Kloeckner, a big West German trading group, from a possible bankruptcy filing after it posted a huge oil-trading loss. Their investment, totaling DM136 million on Kloeckner's books, was written off, along with the rest of Kloeckner's equity capital, to cover as much as DM700 million in so-called forward oil-trading losses.  But it was a warning many investors chose to ignore, because the notes often gave investors a higher annual return than many other investments, and surpassed the dividends the company paid to its shareholders. The highly publicized Kloeckner case, however, exposed the riskiness of the investment West Germans call genuessscheine.
