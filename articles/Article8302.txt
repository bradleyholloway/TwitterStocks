 World Wire   By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1992  The state's safety net guarantees that banks will fulfill all commitments to creditors and depositors and comply with international capital-adequacy rules. The lifeline was triggered by prospects of accelerating loan losses, which, barring state aid, probably would have left every Swedish bank in breach of capital-adequacy standards and some banks technically bankrupt by the end of next year.  Another German company has scaled back its plans for investment in eastern Germany. A printing-press maker, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, cited weak economic conditions for its decision to build a smaller plant in Brandenburg state for 650 million marks ($412.4 million), 24% less than planned. Earlier this week, in a move that further deflated flagging confidence in a recovery for eastern Germany, Daimler-Benz's Mercedes-Benz unit shelved plans to build a truck assembly plant in Brandenburg.  Algeria, braking a trade liberalization that began last year, has suspended imports of luxury goods to save its meager foreign-exchange reserves to pay for imports of oil and natural gas, consumer products and medical supplies. The suspension applies to products ranging from perfumes and alcoholic beverages to microwave ovens. The restrictions don't apply to Algerians who have private foreign-currency bank accounts. The government, with foreign debt estimated at $25 billion, said in September it would introduce foreign trade curbs to ward off "an economic, social and political collapse."
