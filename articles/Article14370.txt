 Pennzoil Says Outsiders Have Expressed Interest in Taking a Role in Texaco Case   By By Thomas Petzinger Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1987  "Three of them," said Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke, "are of a size that they could do whatever they want to do." Although Mr. Liedtke didn't elaborate, the remark suggested that the outsiders could be major corporations or investors capable of threatening or mounting a takeover of Texaco.  Mr. Liedtke made the comments in a wide-ranging interview in which he was asked whether any outsider might seek to act as a catalyst toward settlement of the ongoing mammoth legal battle. Pennzoil won the judgment when a jury here in 1985 found that Texaco had interfered with a binding merger agreement between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co.  Mr. Liedtke said the company informed each of the outsiders that Pennzoil was restrained from joining them -- or from encouraging any hostile actions toward Texaco -- because of a negotiated "standstill agreement" that exists between Pennzoil and Texaco. But Pennzoil also told the outsiders that Pennzoil remains interested in seeing the litigation disposed of, he said.
