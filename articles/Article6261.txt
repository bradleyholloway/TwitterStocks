 Russia's Uneximbank Is Close to a Deal on Debt --- Pact With Creditors Would Be Milestone Since '98 Turmoil   By By Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1999  The deal, which took 13 months to negotiate, would mark the first time a major Russian bank has reached a comprehensive pact with creditors. Foreigners and banks lost billions of dollars in Russia's August 1998 blowout, when the country devalued the ruble and defaulted on domestic debt. Uneximbank is part of a financial empire, Interros, controlled by tycoon Vladimir Potanin. After last year's crisis, it became the first big Russian financial institution to default on a Eurobond payment.  In Moscow yesterday, 99% of Unexim's creditors voted in favor of restructuring the bank rather than moving ahead with bankruptcy proceedings, and asked the Russian Central Bank to reissue Unexim's license, withdrawn earlier this year.
