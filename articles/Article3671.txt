 Whaling Meeting Boycott In Japan Shows Divide   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2007  Minoru Morimoto, Japan's representative to the commission, told the conference that the boycott made it "almost impossible" to have a worthwhile discussion on reforming the IWC, which Japan argues should manage commercial whaling rather than banning it outright.  "Sea Shepherd's protest has gone too far," Mr. [Chris Carter] said on New Zealand's National Radio. "Any further action on the part of captain [Paul Watson] risks the loss of human life, and severe damage to the cause of whale conservation."  "We are not a whale-hunting country, but the matter of resources within our sea is very important to us," said Cedric Liburd, the fisheries minister of St. Christopher-Nevis. "No country can buy our vote."
