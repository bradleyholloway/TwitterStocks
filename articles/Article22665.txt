 Politics & Economy: Farmers Are Growing More of the Crops That Are in Oversupply, Survey Finds   By By Scott Kilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2000  According to the June survey, U.S. farmers planted 19.9 million acres of genetically modified corn this spring. The USDA didn't conduct a similar survey last year. But J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. analyst Donald D. Carson estimates that last year corn farmers planted roughly 23 million acres of genetically modified seed.  The USDA said Friday that U.S. corn farmers planted 79.6 million acres, up 2.8%, or 2.1 million acres, from last year. The increase, which surprised economists, prompted some analysts to predict the size of the nation's No. 1 crop will likely reach record proportions this year.  Wheat prices plunged, too, because the government revised upward the number of wheat acres in production this year. The survey released Friday showed that wheat farmers planted 62.9 million acres, up from 62.8 million in 1999. In a March survey by the USDA, wheat farmers had said they would cut acreage this year by 2%.
