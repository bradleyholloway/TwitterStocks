 Deutsche Bank Sues Two Insurers Over Tower Damaged on Sept. 11   By Frangos, Alex, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2003  By suing, Deutsche Bank portrays the insurers as hurdles to the World Trade Center's redevelopment plans. "The building remains a dark reminder of unspeakable tragedy and threatens to impede efforts to redevelop Ground Zero," the suit says. Deutsche Bank already has come to terms with Chubb Corp. and Zurich Financial Services Group AG, the other insurers on the property, for $530 million.  Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Rohini Pragasam said the bank's insurance policies required it to file the suit against the city and that it isn't seriously pursuing the claim. "It's not to shake the city down for money," she said. "Deutsche Bank's insurance policies require it to preserve any claims Deutsche Bank might have against third parties."
