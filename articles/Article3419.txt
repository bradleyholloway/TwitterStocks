 Siebel Ousts Its CEO Over Sales Slide   By Bank, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  The leadership change highlights [Tom Siebel]'s strategic quandary in the consolidating business-software industry, where bigger rivals such as Oracle Corp. and Germany's SAP AG are gaining an increasing share of corporate purchases while online rivals seek to replace Siebel's software with Web-based services. Indeed, Mr. [George Shaheen] and Siebel's board may now have to decide if Siebel should be a buyer or seller in the next round of merger talks.  Mr. Siebel said no major strategic disagreements led to the departure of Mr. [J. Michael Lawrie], who took over from him as CEO last May. "This is all about performance," Mr. Siebel said. He said Mr. Lawrie and Siebel's board "mutually agreed" that he would step down after the board "determined that a change was necessary." The company said Mr. Lawrie wasn't available to comment.  Before his departure, Mr. Lawrie had acknowledged internal resistance to his efforts to transform Siebel's culture and strategy. His agenda, known inside the company as "Chapter Two," implicitly laid much of the blame for Siebel's troubles at Mr. Siebel's feet. Mr. Lawrie said customers had expressed disappointment with the results from earlier deployments of Siebel's software.
