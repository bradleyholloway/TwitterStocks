 Cram Course: Running for President, Candidates Bone Up On Issues in a Hurry --- Both Dukakis and Dole Try To Study Foreign Policy And Key Regional Topics --- Gaffes Cost Votes, Credibility   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1988  Mr. Reilly's advice is gospel for 1988. After two terms of Ronald Reagan, knowledge about the issues is at a premium in presidential politics. But the process by which presidential candidates acquire that knowledge is bruising. In the midst of a crazy-quilt schedule of rallies, interviews and fund-raisers, candidates must familiarize themselves with a bewildering array of topics, sorting vast amounts of information fed to them by competing advisers.  Mr. Dukakis has put himself through a crash seminar in arms control. At the same time, this governor of a high-tech urban state must learn the problems of Texas oil men who joked a decade ago of letting Yankees freeze and those of the Midwestern farmers who still remember the time he cited Massachusetts' endive crop in discussing agricultural problems. These days, he finds safer ground promoting alternative -- but costly -- uses for surplus farm products and softens his image by staying overnight with Iowa families.  Meanwhile, Senate GOP Leader Dole's limited foreign-affairs experience makes him vulnerable alongside Vice President George Bush, a former ambassador and director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Dole also has had to get himself up to speed on issues important in politically critical regions, such as acid rain and nuclear-plant safety in New England, and must show that he can break out from the legislative netherworld of Congress.
