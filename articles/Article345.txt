 Tastings & Travel: Uncorking an Adventure... --- Venturing Beyond Veuve? Try `Other' Champagnes; Letters to Look for: RM   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 2002  On those rare occasions when most of us drink Champagne, we're accustomed to going with a sure thing: Moet, Mumm, Taittinger, Veuve Clicquot and such. In fact, the top three Champagne houses account for 70% of all Champagne imported into the U.S., according to the Office of Champagne USA, a Washington trade group. The top eight account for 83%. But here's something important to know: If the wine is French and it says "Champagne," it has to be real Champagne, from the Champagne district of France. There are hundreds of Champagne houses in Champagne, and almost 100 of them export to the U.S.  Here's another tip: On every Champagne label, there's a very tiny registration number. The number is preceded by a couple of letters. The letters you'll see most often are NM, which means it was made by a Champagne house that blends and ships the wine. But if you happen to see RM -- and you might -- you've hit the jackpot. This is a grower's own wine, a Champagne made from his or her own grapes. This means you'll probably get a wine of real individual spirit, a bubbly with personality that could be as exciting as the occasion you're celebrating -- even if it's just an especially wonderful sunset. This is no guarantee that you will love the Champagne, but you're likely to at least have an interesting and memorable experience. For our train trip, we spent a month buying every Champagne for less than $50 that we'd never seen before. This doesn't mean that they were all small-production Champagnes or all RM Champagnes. They were simply labels that were unfamiliar to us.
