 Politics & Economics: Thompson's First Test: Raising Funds Fast; After a Late Start, Campaign Targets Web, Fence-Sitters   By Cooper, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2007  Delaying his candidacy cost Mr. [Fred Thompson] support of two prominent Tennessee fund-raisers: Chip Saltsman, former state party chairman, who raised more than $100,000 for President [Jeb Bush]'s 2004 race; and Ted Welch, a Nashville developer who raised more than $200,000 for Mr. Bush's last campaign, becoming a Bush "Ranger." Mr. Saltsman has committed to longshot Arkansas ex-Gov. Mike Huckabee. Mr. Welch said he would have been happy to raise funds for Mr. Thompson but has already committed to Mr. [Mitt Romney].  Brad Freeman, a Los Angeles investment banker and Bush Ranger who is raising money for Mitt Romney, said most of his friends have already committed. He points to Mr. Welch as a symbol of the difficulties that may face Mr. Thompson: "Even his natural constituency is spoken for," Mr. Freeman said. "I think he'll find it tough sledding -- a lot of ships have sailed."  "The money people aren't bloggers and activists, so they didn't know Fred has spoken extensively about many of these issues, such as immigration," Mr. [Zach Wamp] said. "So I broke in and told them it's all collected on our Web site, and they should go and take a look."
