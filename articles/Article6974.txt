 Health & Wellness -- Heart Beat: Battle With Heart Disease Moves to the Doctor's Office   By Winslow, Ron, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2009  The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology are aiming to reduce the toll of cardiovascular disease and increase adherence to long-established prevention guidelines by collecting data from doctors that document their encounters with patients during regular office visits.
