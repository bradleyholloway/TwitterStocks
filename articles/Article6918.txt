 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2005  Previously, German governments have insisted minimum wages weren't necessary because most workers' pay tracks nationwide bargains struck between unions and employers groups. With elections next year and the world's third-largest national economy stagnating, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is changing course. Mr. Schroeder has pledged to protect German workers from what he has termed "wage dumping."  Such a move risks exacerbating Germany's unemployment, now over 12%. Economists warn that making wages less flexible would erase more jobs. "In a labor market as rigid as Germany's, making regulation even stronger is the worst thing you can do," said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. "Employers will move even more jobs abroad."  The spat concerns the U.S.'s handling of a case involving Bt10, a type of genetically modified corn that Swiss agrochemicals company Syngenta AG inadvertently sold in the U.S. and that was exported to Europe for four years without approval.
