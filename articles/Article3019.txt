 Tastings: Surfing the Waves From Australia --- Oceans of Its Chardonnay Wash Up on U.S. Shores; A Classy Surprise for $7   By By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2002  Australian wine production has doubled in five years, while Australia's own consumption of it has remained essentially flat. Almost all Australian wine was consumed domestically 20 years ago, but this year, for the first time, Australia is exporting more than it is drinking. Experts are warning the industry there that it will soon be sitting atop a massive amount of unsold wine if it doesn't restrain production and market more effectively.  The good news for American consumers, of course, is that this means there's a massive supply of inexpensive Australian wine on the market, including its popular Chardonnay. (California also has an oversupply of Chardonnay, especially at the low end, and the price of Chardonnay grapes dropped last year. Some were even left on the vine. Surprisingly, Sauvignon Blanc grapes, on average, now are worth more.)  An enormous number of Australian Chardonnays are on the market, too. We've been writing about them for years, because their plump friendliness and great prices are quite attractive. In our first tasting of Australian Chardonnays under $20, our favorite was Chateau Reynella, then just $10.99. In a tasting of more-expensive Chardonnays, our favorite then was Penfolds "Adelaide Hills," which was luscious and worth every penny of $32.99 at the time. We've also recommended Jacob's Creek as a simple house wine and Lindemans Bin 65 as a great "refrigerator white" to greet you, cold and comforting, when you finally arrive home from work on a hot summer day.
