 Deals & Deal Makers: Central Casting Puts Diller in Saga   By Julia Angwin and Robert A. Guth, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 2004  "[Barry Diller] always wants to be a player, that's his history," says Tom Wolzien, analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co. LLC. But many on Wall Street say Mr. Diller isn't likely to bid for Disney on his own -- he has promised investors he will focus his attention on his e-commerce conglomerate InterActiveCorp.  Surprisingly, Disney's most potent defense may be its rising stock price in the wake of the bid. Disney shares have soared 16% since Comcast disclosed its offer, while Comcast shares have fallen 11%. Those shifts have essentially knocked out Comcast's original 7% premium offer, so Disney is trading at a much higher price than the Comcast offer. As a result, Comcast will need to raise its bid considerably to get Disney shareholders to agree to a deal.  Speculation is rampant on Wall Street about who the rival bidders for Disney could be, particularly in light of the intense interest in last year's sale of Vivendi Universal SA's U.S. film and television assets. "This is going to attract a lot of people to the party," says Henry Ellenbogen, analyst at T. Rowe Price, which owns shares in Comcast and Disney. "If Vivendi can attract the interest it did, then this will attract a number of players."
