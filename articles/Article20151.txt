 Remembrances   By McKay, Betsy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2007  Pepsi's most famous slogans: "You've got a lot to live. Pepsi's got a lot to give."; "Have a Pepsi day." and others were created on his watch. A 1985 commercial showing an archeology professor puzzling over an old Coca-Cola bottle dug up a few centuries in the future won advertising's highest honor, the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.  Mr. Pottasch had an innate sense for the "magic moments" that would capture consumers' imaginations, recalls Phil Dusenberry, former chairman of Omnicom Group Inc.'s BBDO North America, who worked closely with Mr. Pottasch developing Pepsi advertising for more than 35 years. During a break in the shooting of one commercial in the 1970s, a little boy featured in the ad spilled Pepsi all over his sweater. When some puppies instantly surrounded him and started licking the sweater, making the little boy giggle, "Alan said, 'Get the camera going,'" Mr. Dusenberry recalls. "He believed in the magic of the accidental moment." The commercial, featuring that spontaneous moment, became one of Pepsi's most popular.  He "rose to the occasion," Mr. [Roger Enrico] says. Working with BBDO, Mr. Pottasch modernized the Pepsi Generation campaign with a new tagline: "Pepsi -- The Choice of a New Generation." That campaign included the ads featuring Mr. [Michael Jackson]. Mr. Pottasch convinced Mr. Jackson to do the commercials by appealing to Mr. Jackson's mother over a meal of her fried smelts. When a spark from fireworks on the set ignited Mr. Jackson's hair, Mr. Pottasch went to the hospital to see how badly he was hurt (the singer sustained a small burn).
