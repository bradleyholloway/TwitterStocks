 Lost at Sea   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2002  So what's a boat full of concerned people to do? Teri Frady, spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries Service, says call the Coast Guard and stick by the whale to document its condition. A crew from the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts -- the only group on the East Coast with the coveted permit -- will arrive with sophisticated tracking equipment. "We do want a disentangled whale," she says. "But you can make it worse."
