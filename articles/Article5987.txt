 Local Hero: Practically Everybody In Dunn, N.C., Reads The Daily Newspaper --- In an Electronic Age, It Wins With Blanket Coverage Of Hometown Goings-On --- Top Story: A Bear's Sad End   By By Patricia Callahan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2001  Here in Dunn, an 81-year-old World War II veteran with a high-school education is proving it isn't. Hoover Adams, who founded the Daily Record in 1950, has seen the penetration in its primary market climb to 112%, the highest of any daily paper verified by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. A number that high means people from neighboring towns are buying the paper in Dunn and some Dunn households are probably picking up a second copy.  Here in Dunn, where boosting circulation is a near-obsession, Mr. Adams believes that readers like to see their names in print. Around 1980, he sent his staff an impassioned memo arguing that a local paper must fill its pages with the names of locals. Why do people make large donations to the symphony? To read their names in the program, the memo said. "By now you know I am a fanatic -- almost an absolute nut -- about printing a lot of names," he wrote. "But you'll find out it pays off in increased readership, more subscriptions and more ads, too." The memo remains required reading for the paper's new reporters.  Then, to attract larger advertisers, he set his sights on 10,000 homes. A hard-charging new circulation director, Tom Gilligan, took on the challenge. Mr. Gilligan's first step was counterintuitive: He raised the subscription price. It might seem a sure way to lose readers, but Mr. Gilligan publicized the rise for two weeks and gave subscribers the option of renewing at the old rate. So many took the offer that circulation actually rose.
