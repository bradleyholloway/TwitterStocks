 Big Brokers Left Funds Flat Picking Hot 1st-Quarter Stocks   By By Georgette Jasen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  Ten of 15 big brokerage firms in this column's survey beat the 5% return on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the quarter, a feat only about one in four actively managed stock mutual funds accomplished. But investors perhaps can take comfort that neither group did well for the 12 months ended March 31, when just four of the 15 brokerage firms exceeded the 18.5% return on the S&P, compared with one in seven mutual funds.  Internet and other technology stocks topped the recommended lists of many of the big brokerage firms, although financial-services stocks, retailers and consumer-products companies also were among the best performers. As the second quarter progresses, some firms are keeping their lists technology-heavy, while others are taking a more diversified approach.  "After a dismal third quarter, we recognized that the momentum had moved into technology, especially the Internet," says Ed Dunleavy, Everen's director of equity research. Qualcomm Inc., a San Diego company that provides digital wirelesstechnology products and services, was Everen's top performing stock in the first quarter, with a 140% return. Everen added America Online Inc. and Exodus Communications Inc. to its recommended late last year and MindSpring Enterprises Inc. and EarthLink Network Inc. in January.
