 details: Getting Bronzed From a Spray Gun   By By Tatiana Boncompagni, The Wall Street Journal,  May 9, 2003  The process, which costs as much as $75, is simple but not particularly "luxurious and pampering," says Robin Gibson, president of St. Tropez, which makes self-tanning cream. Clad in next to nothing, clients stand still for 15 to 30 minutes while an airbrush artist blows a fine brown mist all over their bodies. The brown-colored solution can take as long as 24 hours to set, and can rub off on clothing, bed sheets and furniture. Then there's the smell: Darci Vonfeldt's salon uses a coconut-scented lotion supposedly remiscent of the tropics. "It just gets old," says the Kansas City, Mo., party promoter who gets bronzed every Friday.
