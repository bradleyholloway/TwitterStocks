 As the Japanese Yen Goes, So, Too, Do Stocks -- Usually   By Slater, Joanna, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  That's because the yen has become an unexpectedly important barometer of investors' appetite for risk world-wide. If investors get worried, the yen often strengthens. Conversely, when investors are willing to go out on a limb, the yen tends to weaken.  The currency's unique role is tied directly to Japan's remarkably low rates. Risk-taking investors are enticed to borrow cheaply in yen, then invest the borrowed money in other countries where returns can be higher. (This maneuver weakens the yen because the borrowers are essentially selling yen to buy other currencies.)  The problem for investors is that these links aren't necessarily predictive. "Of course, they're related, but focusing on the correlation between two markets doesn't tell you what to do tomorrow," says Mr. [Jonas Thulin] of Calyon.
