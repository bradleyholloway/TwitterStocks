 Politics & Economics: Trade Talks Test China's 'Ms. Fix-It'; Influence of Vice Premier Wu, a Well-Regarded Negotiator, Is Critical for a U.S. Deal   By Andrew Batson and Shai Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2006  "She has enormous credibility with the Communist Party, the government, the general public and the foreign businesses," says Chris Murck, the Asia head of public-affairs firm APCO Worldwide, who has dealt with Ms. [Wu Yi] for many years. "She's an extremely honest advocate for China."  The pair's meeting with the vice premier ran over time when they came to Beijing in March, on the eve of a threatened vote on a bill they had proposed to levy tariffs on Chinese imports. "The vice premier was a lot of fun. She's really direct," said Mr. [Lindsey Graham], unprompted, afterwards. "She'd do well in an American courtroom. I like her a lot."  Ms. Wu seems well aware of her reputation as an "iron lady." On a trip to the U.S. in April to sign a barrage of major Chinese purchases -- an effort to defuse trade tensions -- she introduced herself to a roomful of skeptical reporters in Washington by noting that she was outnumbered by men on the podium. Through a translator, she deadpanned: "So, obviously, I'm in the weak and disadvantageous position." There was silence. "It's a joke," she said in English. The reporters laughed.
