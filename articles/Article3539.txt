 Citigroup to Use Microsoft Web Service   By By Rebecca Buckman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2002  As part of the deal, Citigroup also deepened its ties to Microsoft's MSN network of consumer Web sites, where plugs for Citigroup's Citibank credit cards will be prominently displayed and the bank will be featured as a "preferred card partner." Microsoft has been aggressively signing other deals for MSN, which competes fiercely with the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. Financial terms of the Citigroup deal weren't disclosed.  Katherine Sullivan, chief operating officer of Citigroup's e-Citi unit, said that when the bank adds new Microsoft Web services later this year, "any financial data that we have is staying with Citigroup behind our firewall." Customers will have the option of signing up for a Passport account, but won't need to do so to continue to access financial information online, she said.
