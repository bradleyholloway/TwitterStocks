 Politics & Economics: World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2006  Exports rose 18.7% to a record 6.08 trillion yen. Imports rose 30.4% to a record 5.02 trillion yen. For all of 2005, Japan's current- account surplus stood at 18.048 trillion yen, down 3.1% from a year earlier for the first decline in four years.  About 22,000 public workers in eight of Germany's 16 federal states stopped work yesterday, the Verdi labor union said. They included garbage collectors, theater clerks and administrative staff and cleaners at government-owned hospitals. The union said it expects 40,000 workers to take part over the course of the week, after 94% of balloted workers voted to stop work.  Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has pressed local and federal authorities to help shore up Germany's stretched public finances. However, her spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, said that it is up to local leaders and the unions to settle the dispute over working hours.
