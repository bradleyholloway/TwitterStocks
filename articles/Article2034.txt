 Science: Galileo Mission Is Debated As Scientist Warns of Safety   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1989  After studying the safety of the Galileo mission to Jupiter for six years as a member of a federal panel on nuclear safety, Richard Cuddihy has some urgent advice: Don't launch.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration currently plans to launch Galileo, which carries 50 pounds of radioactive plutonium for power, Oct. 12 on the space shuttle Atlantis. Mr. Cuddihy, a leading expert on radiation poisoning, says NASA underestimates the risk of a launch disaster or that Galileo may crash back to Earth, and the cost and difficulty of cleaning up an accident.  Nuclear power is critical for space exploration. Manned outposts on the moon or Mars would require nuclear reactors for power. Unmanned probes to Jupiter and beyond also would need smaller plutonium-based power sources. Safety questions dog the missions, however. At least two groups vow actions aimed at stopping the Galileo launch. But the warning by Mr. Cuddihy, made privately in a letter to President Bush, is the most significant opposition yet and could fan public fears about carrying nuclear payloads into space.
