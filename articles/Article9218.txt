 Leslie Fay's Ex-Financial Chief, Polishan, Is Found Guilty of Fraud   By By Lisa Vickery, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2000  Mr. [Paul Polishan] was convicted of bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years. He also was found guilty of multiple counts of wire and securities fraud. Mr. Polishan, who was indicted in 1996, will be sentenced in October.  The verdict in the nonjury trial was delivered Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie in federal district court in Scranton, Pa. The trial was held in Pennsylvania because Leslie Fay maintained financial headquarters there, separate from its New York operational headquarters. Leslie Fay, a publicly traded apparel maker, declined to comment on Mr. Polishan's conviction.  Donald Kenia, a former Leslie Fay controller, in 1994 pleaded guilty to making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation. He was a key witness against Mr. Polishan.
