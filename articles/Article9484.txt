 The Economy: Labor Data Back Fed's Steady Course   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2002  Should a risk become reality, such as a war with Iraq disrupting oil supplies and hurting the economy, then the Fed might have to act. "There are downside risks in the outlook, and they need to be monitored especially closely by policy makers in the period ahead," Richmond Fed President J. Alfred Broaddus said last week. But in the absence of an external shock, many officials seem content to leave rates alone on the view that the recovery is likely to strengthen.  Of growing significance to some officials' thinking is the possibility that weak growth could eventually push inflation down to zero, perhaps to deflation, which would make it far harder for the Fed to stimulate the recovery. This may have been a factor for Dallas Fed President Robert McTeer, one of the dissenters two weeks ago. "I don't know at what point welcome [declines in inflation] might morph into unwelcome deflation," he said last week, though he added, "I don't think we're there yet."
