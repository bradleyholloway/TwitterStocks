 Aftermath of Terror: Signs of an Ethnic Backlash Put Arab Americans on Defensive   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  Since Tuesday's terrorist attacks, Arab residents in Dearborn and in other parts of the country say they have received threats, while others have reported vandalism of mosques and other incidents. Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Mideast history at University of Chicago, says that last night, an angry crowd of some 300 people marched on the Al-Aqsa mosque in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview. The police turned the crowd back. James Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute, in Washington, says that he has received telephone death threats and had police protection in his office Thursday.  The American Arab Chamber of Commerce and the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, along with other community organizations in Dearborn, have assembled a team of 10 Arab-American doctors who are willing to go to New York or Washington to help the victims. The organizations have contacted American Red Cross, and the doctors are ready to leave upon request from Red Cross.
