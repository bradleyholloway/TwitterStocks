Whatever a regime's political color, it takes special pluck to defend human rights in Central America.  In leftist Nicaragua, the police recently seized the files of the local Human Rights Commission, apparently because its chairman said that the Sandinists were using ''methods of torture and repression very similar to those prevailing during the Somoza dictatorship.'' On repression, at least, he was surely right.  Even worse has been the crackdown on the Human Rights Commission in El Salvador, whose reports on violence by right-wing forces have embarrassed the ruling junta. Victor Medrano, one of its officers, was reportedly abducted by armed men in civilian clothes a month ago. He has disappeared. According to Amnesty International, two other commission members were killed last year - a press secretary was found dead in a shallow grave and the group's administrator was fatally shot while driving in the capital.  These incidents attest again to the courage and effectiveness of human rights monitors. Before his disappearance, Mr. Medrano had criticized the regime in a television documentary. He was well aware of the risks. Violence in El Salvador from all sides resulted in 10,000 killings last year. The Government is clearly annoyed by the commission's effort to document its complicity in this mayhem.  In Nicaragua and El Salvador, as in the Soviet Union and wherever repression flourishes, the charge against such monitors is the same: they are ''unpatriotic.'' Yet without the work of these commissions, the world would know far less about political realities.  As the Sandinists well know, documented commission reports on the abuses of the Somoza era played a crucial role in winning foreign support for their revolution. The region's governments have learned not to underestimate the force of the human rights cause. How ironic that the professed realists of the Reagan Administration refuse to recognize its value.
