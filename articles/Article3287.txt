 Producer Prices Rise 0.7%, Setting Stage for Fed Move   By Hilsenrath, Jon E, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2004  PRODUCER PRICES  Here are the Labor Department's producer-price indexes (1982=100) for April 2004, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from April 2003.  Index % Chg.  Finished goods ................... 147.3 3.7 Less food & energy ............... 152.2 1.5 Intermediate goods ............... 139.8 5.1 Crude goods ...................... 154.1 20.4 The PPI report was the latest in a series of recent economic indicators that are setting the stage for the Fed to start raising short-term interest rates. The Fed has used super-low interest rates to stimulate economic activity and job growth. But as growth and signs of modest price pressures mount, many economists believe the time has come to move away from the easy-money policy. The latest monthly survey of private economists by WSJ.com lays out expectations for the course of short-term interest rates through 2005. Forty-three of the 55 economists surveyed said they expected the Fed to nudge up the benchmark federal-funds rate by June from the current 46-year low of 1%. The median forecast -- which represents the midpoint of all projections -- shows that the federal-funds rate is expected to hit 1.25% in June, 1.75% by December, 2.5% a year from now and 3.5% by December 2005.
