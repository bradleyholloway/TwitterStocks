 ValuJet May Be Worth a Flier -- But It's Not for the Risk-Averse   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1997  In the four months since ValuJet has returned to the skies, one matter has become clear: The new company holds little of the market allure of the old. Since Sept. 30, when the Atlanta-based low-fare carrier obtained regulatory clearance to resume limited operations, its share price has plunged to about $6.50 from about $12. The paradox: The grounded airline with no operations was valued nearly twice as high as today, when it operates 112 daily flights to 19 cities.  "Sometimes anticipation is better than reality," says Samuel Buttrick, a PaineWebber airline analyst in New York. "All we can say with confidence at this juncture is ValuJet II will be in no way a repeat phenomenon" of ValuJet I's success.  -- The start-up carrier, launched with two old DC-9s once owned by archrival Delta Air Lines, grew faster than any carrier in history. By contrast, the new ValuJet must grow slowly -- with regulatory approval for each new city or added plane. "Investors look for rapid growth," says Lewis Jordan, president and chief operating officer of ValuJet Inc., the holding company for ValuJet Airlines. "We say we're going to grow moderately, and naysayers say it's not a good stock."
