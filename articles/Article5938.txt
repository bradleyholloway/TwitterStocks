 FBI Warns of Russian Hackers Stealing Credit-Card Data From U.S. Computers   By By Lee Gomes and Ted Bridis, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  Indeed, some independent security experts, while describing the Internet extortion problem as a very real one, said the FBI's interest in the matter was part of a public-relations effort on behalf of its beleaguered Internet-crime division, the National Infrastructure Protection Center, or NIPC, which has been under fire from Washington lawmakers and others. Some experts have complained that the FBI has been reticent in issuing cyber warnings.  The FBI defended its discussion of the crimes, saying that despite repeated warnings, many U.S. businesses have not yet taken advantage of the software tools that are readily and freely available to repair the flaws the hackers are exploiting. Senior NIPC officials, who asked not to be identified, flatly denied they were moving to resuscitate the organization's faltering image. "We're not trying to get notoriety for the FBI," another official said.  The high-profile announcement of the extortion investigations was a rare highlight for the FBI's multimillion dollar NIPC, whose future is unclear amid continuing congressional inquiries and mounting criticism from industry and others. A recent study from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, complained that NIPC has "largely failed," because it doesn't share warnings with private industry about threats soon enough.
