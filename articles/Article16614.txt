 Love & Money: A Home Office Built for Two   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2006  That's the way it goes, right? Kids and home offices just don't mix. It's the spot in the house where grown-up business trumps kids' play. In an age when work and family life all too often intrude upon each other's space, it's the one separation that most work-at-home parents feel they have to enforce.  "The downside," he says, "is that sometimes she ends up spending too much time on the computer when I'd rather she be playing with her dolls or reading. But if I'm going to be on a one-hour conference call, and I can't be interrupted, it's easier to have her nearby, on her computer, where she's unlikely to ask me something and where I can keep an eye on her."  The new arrangement, my friend says, "has worked out so much better than I imagined. I was worried I wouldn't be able to concentrate, but it's easy to tune out the little noises she makes." The shared office has now become "a focal point in our relationship," my friend says. "Before, I'd say, 'Mom's working, you have to go.' Now it's 'Mom's working, come on in.'"
