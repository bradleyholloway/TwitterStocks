To the Editor:  The renewed cry for national handgun control must be viewed in light of the great discontent felt by many law-abiding citizens at the apparent inability of the criminal justice system to deal with the rising crime rate. For too long these citizens have been living in fear in areas they can no longer call communities.  What they fear are violent crimes in which the handgun is the principal weapon. But it is also often the only weapon an honest citizen may use to protect home and family. Unless coupled with other measures designed to strengthen the criminal justice system, the elimination or restriction of handgun ownership will simply not be supported by city dwellers.  Over the past several years the criminal justice system has been crippled by unreasonable and often irrational applications of the socalled ''exclusionary rule,'' limiting the admissibility of evidence, that frequently send violent criminals back onto the street. Even when police comply with the numerous requirements of this rule, they are often frustrated by judges who refuse to impose appropriate sentences that would deter others from committing similar crimes.  Any national gun control act must therefore be tied to legislation limiting the exclusionary rule and requiring mandatory sentences for gun-related offenses. Only then will the climate of fear be dispelled and people feel safe in their homes without guns of their own. GEOFFREY L. BEAUCHAMP, Philadelphia, April 5, 1981
