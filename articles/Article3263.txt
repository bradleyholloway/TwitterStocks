 Restless Readers Chime In   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2004  "One side benefit of early Social Security you haven't mentioned is that it reduces drawing down on an individual retirement account during a downturn and the current upswing," wrote Steve Zimmerman, a retiree in Scottsdale, Ariz. "My $16,600 Social Security benefit represents funds I did not withdraw from my IRA, which grew 35% last year."  "Every month I wait increases my benefit," Mr. [Allan Dyson] wrote. "I printed out a great chart at the Social Security Web site [www.ssa.gov] that tells me exactly how much someone born in 1942 like me increases their benefit percentage per month by waiting. So I'm going to take it one month at a time -- feeling good about waiting, but knowing I've helped myself whenever it becomes time to 'cash it in.'  "A way I try to convince clients to wait [to file for benefits] is to explain that Social Security is a lifetime, inflation-adjusted annuity. If you don't live long, you don't need it! Waiting is smarter financially since if you live long, it will be worth considerably more than if you didn't wait."
