 Boston Scientific Jolts Traders   By Hadi, Mohammed, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2005  Noting that implied volatility in Boston Scientific's options actually rose on Monday, Stacey Briere, options strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, said the options were indicating that investors continue to expect movement in the stock. "It's as if the event they are anticipating hasn't been announced yet," she said.  Typically, implied volatility falls after a news announcement as investors anticipate that the stock's volatility will decrease. "You would think that with the news out, that volatility would come in substantially and it hasn't," she noted.
