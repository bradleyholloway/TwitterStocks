 Jean-Bertrand Duvalier   By Peck, Raoul, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  [Jean-Bertrand Aristide] talked of peace where there was violence, and violence was a constant during the 29-year murderous rule of the Duvaliers. He spoke of reconciliation where there had been but fragmentation, instigated by the dictators who sought to rule by dividing further the already weak Haitian social fabric. In the exhilaration of the moment, many thought that there was no problem in Haiti that could not be resolved. After all, he even advocated an end to corruption, a permanent cancer in the Haitian social fabric. Sadly, the priest who acceded to government power turned into a mob leader. The language of reconciliation gave way to the "necklacing" of political opponents, the firebombing of radio stations, homes and offices of opponents, the murder of journalists like Jean Dominique and Brignol Lindor, and the unwillingness to bring the criminals to justice. Hired thugs raped and kidnapped even the poorest of the poor in the slums that Aristide always pretended he was defending.
