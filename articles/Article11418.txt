 Small Companies Move to Increase Anti-Drug Programs --- Some Fall Under Expanded Federal Rules; Others See Workplace Savings   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1990  When a foreman at Chamberlain Contractors Inc. allegedly caused a truck door to rip off in a collision in the paving company's Laurel, Md., parking lot last July, he faced more than an angry boss. He also had to cope with a mandatory post-accident drug test.  The war on drugs, which has already enlisted a large chunk of big business, now is being taken up by many small companies as well. "The word on the street is that people with drug problems are going to small companies because they know that the IBMs and the Xeroxes and the GTEs are drug screening and have been for years," says Jean Johnson, operations vice president at Corporate Wellness Inc., a Mount Kisco, N.Y., drug-counseling firm. So the small employers see a growing need to protect themselves from drug abusers.  Moreover, as federal and state anti-drug rules expand their coverage, many small firms are discovering that a substance-abuse plan is as much a requirement of doing business as filing a tax return. Defense contractors, large interstate truckers, and companies involved in aviation and nuclear energy are among the concerns already covered by drug-abuse rules. And the list is growing. In December, for example, 35,000 interstate trucking companies with fewer than 50 drivers will have to begin living by Department of Transportation drug-testing rules.
