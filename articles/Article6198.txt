 Cable-TV Gear Makers Benefit From Upgrading   By By Nicole Ridgway, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1999  "What happens going forward is a very large transformation of traditional cable networks into the future delivery systems of all of these sexy services like cable modems, digital set-top boxes and cable telephony," said CIBC Oppenheimer analyst James Jungjohann.  The race to offer telephone, digital, high-speed data and Internet connections over cable lines has spurred a series of mergers in the cable industry and has many cable operators digging deeper into their pockets to buy new equipment in order to upgrade their networks.  Mr. (Lawrence) Harris believes General Instrument will meet Wall Street's first-quarter earnings forecast of 19 cents a share, reflecting increased set-top box shipments and pared down operating expenses. In the year-earlier quarter, the Hatsboro, Pa., company had net income of 13 cents a diluted share, excluding charges. Shipments of set-top boxes, which permit twoway transmission of digital information, are expected to come in at close to 775,000, up from 730,000 in the fourth quarter, Mr. Harris said.
