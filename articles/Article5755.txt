 Prada to Buy U.K. Shoemaker Church In Latest Bid to Shift to Luxury Goods   By By Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1999  Italian fashion house Prada, in its latest move to transform itself into a luxury-goods group, agreed to buy Church & Co., the venerable British maker of classic men's shoes.  The deal is the latest in a string Prada has made this year as part of an aggressive strategy to become a luxury-goods group. Just last month, it agreed to acquire control of German fashion house Jil Sander AG, while it also took holdings in Helmut Lang and Italian eyeglass maker De Rigo SpA earlier this year.  Now Prada is looking to strengthen its booming footwear division by acquiring Church, the 126-year-old United Kingdom group known for its shoes for men. Prada said yesterday that it has made an offer to buy 100% of Church for 950 pence ($15.38) a share. Shareholders representing about 24% of Church's capital have accepted the offer, which would give the Italian fashion house a total 33% stake following the 9% it bought this summer. The deal, which Church's directors are recommending shareholders accept, values the group at about 106 million.
