 IBM in Talks For Networking Firm Kalpana --- Cash-Rich Giant Would Pay Estimated $150 Million As Its Confidence Grows   By By Laurie Hays, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1994  The proposed purchase of Kalpana Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., would be one of the largest acquisitions IBM has made in years, signaling the company's growing confidence in its rebounding finances. The talks come amid speculation that IBM may offer to invest in Apple Computer Inc. or in a joint venture to make their personal-computer lines more compatible.  Some insiders cautioned that IBM isn't about to go on a shopping spree, but analysts nonetheless see the company's new interest in acquisitions as a shift in attitude. The company is seeking "things to fill out the quiver," said one IBM analyst. "They have all these arrows, and some of them don't have heads and some don't have tails. They are getting things to make the arsenal whole."  IBM has about $8.6 billion on hand, and activity around the company is certainly picking up. Investment bankers are coming up with lists of suggested targets. They also have suggested that IBM use the cash to pay down debt, buy back stock or increase the dividend. Jerome York, IBM's chief financial officer, has said he is considering a wide range of possibilities.
