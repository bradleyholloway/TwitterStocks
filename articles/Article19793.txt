 Caught Off Guard: As Ranks Dwindle In a Reserve Unit, Army's Woes Mount; After Tours in Two War Zones, Many in 211th Are Fed Up; Tough Sell for Recruiters; Spc. Coggins Skips the Drill   By Jaffe, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2004  Spc. Jason Coggins, who was a member of the 211th's sister unit in nearby Asheville, was one of about two dozen soldiers who transferred into the unit. Spc. Coggins's father was a member of the 211th, and the son was eager to deploy with him. Spc. Coggins also wanted to do his part for the war. "I really felt like I was involved in something important," he says.  Capt. Payne, the 211th's commander, didn't want to alarm his troops, but he was getting signals that they might be deployed again. Commanders in Raleigh had begun calling him to ask if the unit's equipment was in good shape.  Many soldiers in the 211th were convinced that, because they were Guardsmen and not active-duty soldiers, they had been given second- rate equipment. They say they had to make due with older, less- effective flak vests, while their active-duty colleagues were protected by new Interceptor Body Armor, which includes special ceramic plates that protect vital organs. Their Humvees weren't armored. Even their rifles were hand-me-downs from the 82nd Airborne Division. The sights were out of line and the barrels had too much give in them, the soldiers say. Though they spent hours cleaning and repairing the guns, Capt. Payne says "not a soul in the unit had faith in them."
