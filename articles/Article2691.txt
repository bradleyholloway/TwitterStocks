 World-Wide [13]  The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 1995  The House GOP leaders appeared to be stepping up plans to recapture billions of dollars in domestic spending previously approved by Congress. HUD, with its reservoir of funds for long-term subsidized-housing contracts, is a major target. In addition, Republicans are drafting options to rescind or cut as much as $7 billion from prior appropriations for the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education departments.  Vice President Gore told union leaders Clinton will sign an order to ban firms from federal contracts if they permanently replace strikers. According to AFL-CIO and White House aides, Gore said the order would be issued after decisions are made on the size of contracts and a review by administration lawyers.  Bosnian and Croatian Serbs set up a joint defense council in a step toward greater military cooperation. Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic said the move committed the two groups to come to each other's aid if attacked. In Belgrade, Serbia's Milosevic told a Kremlin envoy he can't accept a peace plan if U.N. sanctions stay in place.
