 College Hoops: Stanford on the Rebound   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2000  Palo Alto, Calif. -- The Stanford University men's basketball team was putting away the one from Oregon State University in cozy Maples Pavilion here on Saturday afternoon, and the joint was jumping. I mean literally. Many of the Stanford students were behaving like deranged pogo stickers, bouncing up and down in no apparent order. The playing floor was rocking, too. It's on substrata springs, and although it's not as flexible as, say, your bedroom mattress, it shimmies with every firm footfall. When the fans create gross atmospheric disturbances, it can clatter teeth a dozen rows up.  If it all sounds a bit excessive, it is, but Stanford has lost time to make up . For many years basketball was a snooze at the academically high-toned institution, so much so that, six years ago, the school's sports marketing department felt the need to drum up support by creating a "Sixth Man Club" that rewarded students who anted up a $10 membership fee with front-and-center seats to all home games, a T-shirt and free pre-game feeds. About 30 enlisted, scarcely enough to finish off a good-sized tray of lasagna. All of them jumping together wouldn't have jiggled a eucalyptus leaf. But that was then and this is now and these days, Stanford's hoops teams are winning big, a condition that cures the blahs on any campus. The current edition?, which thoroughly gnawed the OSU Beavers on Saturday 82-56, stands 21-1 in the won-lost column, second in the Associated Press national poll, and first in the hearts of its constituency.
