 Barron's Insight: General Mills Shares Seem Worth a Nibble   By Bary, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2004  General Mills, around $47, trades at 16 times projected 2004 profit of $3 a share, a discount to rival Kellogg's 19 times estimated 2004 net of $2.10 a share. (General Mills' fiscal year ends in May, but we offer a calendar-year figure to ease comparison with Kellogg.)  General Mills Chief Executive Stephen Sanger says the merger problems largely are over and Wall Street isn't recognizing that General Mills has better growth prospects than its food peers. "We're No. 1 or 2 in every category, and we're gaining market share in the aggregate," he says. General Mills does have a heavy debt of $9 billion, a legacy of the Pillsbury deal. The company is committed to cutting that by $2 billion over the next two years.
