 Bank of Scotland Calls Off Plans For Venture With Pat Robertson   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  Bank of Scotland said it has dropped plans to launch a U.S. telephone-banking service with evangelist Pat Robertson.  Mr. Robertson's reputation as a hardright conservative proved too controversial for the bank, whose core customers are in liberal Scotland. When the bank first announced the deal in March, it received sharp criticism, but the outcry died down. Then last week, it erupted again over reports that Mr. Robertson had publicly complained that Scotland was too sympathetic to homosexuals.  "In Europe, the big word is tolerance," Mr. Robertson said. "Homosexuals are riding high in the media. . . . And in Scotland, you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are. It's just unbelievable."
