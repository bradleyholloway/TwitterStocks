 Air Force Lifts Its Ban on Jobs For Rockwell   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1985  The Air Force lifted its suspension of Rockwell International Corp. from receiving new defense contracts.  The company was temporarily barred Oct. 31 after it pleaded guilty to 20 counts of false billings. But the Air Force said yesterday that it rescinded the sanction because it believes Pittsburgh-based Rockwell has taken a number of actions to prevent a recurrence of the labor mischarges.  Mr. Sims, who said he was expressing Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's views, was responding to predictions by Pentagon critics that the department was going to let General Dynamics Corp. continue to bid for major military work despite its recent indictment for procurement fraud. St. Louis-based General Dynamics, another major contractor, was temporarily suspended earlier this month from receiving new government work following its indictment on charges of illegally billing the Pentagon for cost overruns.
