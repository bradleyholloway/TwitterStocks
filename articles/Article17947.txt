 Varity Corp. Offers For the Third Time To Acquire Fruehauf   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1989  Varity Corp. said it made another offer to acquire Fruehauf Corp., its third bid for the troubled transportation equipment firm in the past eight months.  Varity officials wouldn't disclose details, citing a confidentiality agreement with Fruehauf, but James Vance, Varity's chief financial officer, said "I guess it would be an equity and paper deal."  The only major business unit remaining after Fruehauf agreed last week to sell its trailer and maritime divisions to Wisconsin-based Terex Corp. is its Kelsey-Hayes Co. automotive parts maker, and that is the unit of particular interest to Varity.
