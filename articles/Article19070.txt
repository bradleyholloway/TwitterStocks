 Who's a Hypocrite -- and Who Cares?   By By James Taranto, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1998  What do Clarence Thomas, Bill Clinton, feminist leaders and Linda Tripp have in common? All have lately been accused of hypocrisy. Do the charges against them hold up? And is hypocrisy necessarily a bad thing?  Webster's New World Dictionary defines hypocrisy as "a pretending to be what one is not, or to feel what one does not feel; esp. a pretense of virtue, piety, etc." By this definition, it's plainly unfair to accuse Justice Thomas of hypocrisy in opposing racial preferences. Nobody has questioned the sincerity of his views; the charge of hypocrisy rests on assumptions about his background. In the wake of Justice Thomas's disputed appearance last week before the National Bar Association, the New York Times editorialized: "The fact that he himself benefited from programs that opened up educational opportunities to minorities adds to the resentment."  Even as Justice Thomas's critics pillory him for putative hypocrisy, President Clinton's defenders applaud his hypocrisy in apparently concealing extramarital affairs. "We all lie about sex, or if we don't, (we) should," wrote a San Diego Union-Tribune columnist last month. Here hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue. Disclosing an affair, the argument goes, compounds the betrayal, subjecting the wronged wife to additional pain and embarrassment. Keeping it secret may save a troubled marriage, and it allows the unfaithful husband and his mistress to remain respectable in the eyes of the community.
