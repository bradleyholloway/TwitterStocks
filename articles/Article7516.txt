 Customers vs. Banks: A California Lawsuit Could Have Broad Impact on Service Fees   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1986  When Paul Perdue bounced three checks in 1976, his bank slapped him with a $6-a-check fee, Mr. Perdue slapped his bank with a lawsuit. "I wasn't trying to stiff them," he says. "But I didn't want to be gouged either."  Bank service charges have become a growing source of irritation for consumers, and, increasingly, they're fighting back in court. In essence, consumers maintain, banks are making too much money from services that in many cases cost a pittance to offer. In his suit, for example, Mr. Perdue says it cost Crocker National Corp. as little as 30 cents to handle each of his bum checks, although Crocker disputes the assertion. Consumers also complain that the fees are often hidden or aren't well-publicized.  Mr. Perdue, who began his legal battle in 1977, lost out in two lower courts. Then last July the California Supreme Court -- finding that Crocker had "structured a totally one-sided transaction" and rejecting arguments that national banks like Crocker are subject only to federal laws -- ruled that he deserved a hearing. The U.S. Supreme Court let the California ruling stand in February. Having survived four courts and such Crocker allies as the American Bankers Association and the federal Comptroller of the Currency, the suit is expected to go to trial this fall in state Superior Court in San Francisco.
