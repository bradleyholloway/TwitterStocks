 Home of `Aladdin' and `The Lion King' Is Hit by Katzenberg's $250 Million Suit   By King, Thomas R, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1996  Most importantly, the contracts are said to specify that Disney, after the initial two years following Mr. [Jeffrey Katzenberg]'s departure, would give the executive one final and presumably huge lump-sum payment based on an estimate of all future profit relating to the projects. Mr. Katzenberg and his attorneys didn't include copies of the contracts with their complaint, in an effort, they said, to keep other aspects of Mr. Katzenberg's compensation package confidential. They indicated, however, that the contracts may have to be introduced in any trial.  Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields, who along with New York attorney Herbert Wachtell is leading Mr. Katzenberg's high-octane legal arsenal, said: "That is very much not correct. I've read and reread this contract, and there's absolutely no doubt but that this money is owed to Jeffrey." Mr. Fields said "he knows" that other Disney executives have similar contracts promising them profit participation, adding: "I would bet the farm that [Disney Motion Pictures Group Chairman] Joe Roth has a participation" in his contract. Mr. Roth didn't return a phone call seeking comment.
