 Big Funds Fed on Top S&P Names in '98   By By Mara Der Hovanesian, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1998  With about $27.3 billion in assets on average, managers of the top 25 mutual funds have feasted on the biggest names in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. To corral any sort of decent return in 1998, these huge mutual funds have had no choice but to think big.  "You look back a few years and not as many funds were forced into giant stocks the way they are now," said Russ Kinnel, equity analyst for Chicago fund tracker Morningstar Inc.  And because the market has favored top-tier, blue-chip stocks, it has been a wise investment choice. Mr. Kinnel said returns have been "pretty darn impressive," with 14 of the top 25 funds performing in the top quartile of their peer group. But only six of the 25 largest funds have beaten the 23.36% return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index through Dec. 17, according to Lipper Inc.
