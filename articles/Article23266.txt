 The Economy; BUSINESS: Bush Starts to Deliver for Big Business   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2005  The event was a celebration of a dramatic change in U.S. foreign policy: an end to three decades of sanctions on India because of its nuclear-weapons program. But for the trio of executives -- General Electric's Jeff Immelt, Lockheed Martin's Bob Stevens and Boeing's James McNerney -- it meant big business. The new policy will allow Boeing and Lockheed to compete for billions of dollars in contracts for airplanes loaded with GE engines. It also will allow GE to re- enter a potentially lucrative market for nuclear energy that it was forced to exit from in 1974, when India first tested a nuclear weapon.  Term two is turning out to be very different. The Indian agreement is just one of a long list of pro-business actions that got significantly longer last week. Congress passed a Central American Free Trade Agreement eagerly sought by business, as well as an energy bill and a transportation bill that had been stalled for years. Add to those the new bankruptcy law and the changes in class-action lawsuit rules approved this year, and you have got what the lobbying group Business Roundtable's John Castellani calls an "unprecedented string of accomplishments to help drive the America economy."
