 Bush Budget Underscores His Priorities --- Spending Trade-Offs Are Linked to Theme: `No Guns and Butter'   By By Jacob M. Schlesinger and Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2002  It isn't clear how successful Mr. [Mitchell Daniels Jr.] will be in imposing such fiscal discipline on Congress as the crucial midterm elections approach. Already, the administration appears to be backing away from some major fights waged last year, such as its effort to reduce subsidies for U.S. businesses operating overseas.  In his fiscal 2002 budget, Mr. [Bush] proposed a 24% cut in the Export-Import Bank's budget, part of a broader swipe at "corporate subsidies." Much of that money was restored in Congress, amid lobbying by big business. This year's Bush budget not only doesn't seek cuts but, by easing Ex-Im lending requirements, actually will allow as much as a 10% boost in corporate trade financing for such major exporters as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co.  Overall, Mr. Daniels tried to play down the significance of departments getting squeezed. "Some people will mindlessly complain about" the flat education budget, he said, ignoring the 15% increase approved for schooling last year. Similarly, Commerce Department spending will be flat, partly because outlays for the 2000 census have ended, while Labor Department cuts would be reversed if proposed job benefits in the administration's economic-stimulus package were approved.
