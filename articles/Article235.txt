The title of the American Symphony Orchestra's first program of the season at Avery Fisher Hall, "Surrealism and Music?," was suitably cautious, and Leon Botstein, the orchestra's music director, began a preconcert talk by stressing the question mark.

In fact, an innovation of two composers represented in the program was the use of "real world" sounds not traditionally considered musical. In John Cage's Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra (1951), played here by Alan Feinberg, the instrumentation includes a door buzzer and a radio. Edgard Varese's volcanic "Ameriques," which was bypassed by the American Symphony in favor of his "Arcana," employs a simulated lion's roar and a siren.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
