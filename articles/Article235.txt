 Today's financial euphoria can't last   By Kaufman, Henry, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1996  Henry Kaufman warns that President Clinton may have to face a stock market crash in his second term, asserting that "today's financial euphoria is not immortal." Kaufman explains that the stock market ride will end either because growth will slow a lot more than optimistic earnings estimates foretell or because inflation will move up. Kaufman suggests that the success of Clinton's second term may well depend on the FRB Chairman Alan Greenspan's decisions on monetary policy.
