 Letters to the Editor: Good Schools Need Angels' Blessing   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1989  As he correctly noted, the basic difficulty faced by religious schools these days is financial. The fact that priests and nuns are not available in large numbers is a critical problem, of course. However, schools with a record of high achievement, such as the Abbot Pennings High School and any other that has the distinction of being honored by the Education Department as an "Exemplary School," can and should be continued. They should be encouraged to flourish. This can be done even with a diminished clerical representation. The philosophy and traditions of these schools can be carried on through careful selection of future faculty. These positions must be prized ones that provide all the reimbursements available at other high-ranking schools. If these schools could provide such conditions, an excellent faculty dedicated to the type of education Mr. Gigot praises would be ensured.
