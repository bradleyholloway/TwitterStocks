 Moving the Market: Gabelli, Affiliates Settle Fraud Suit For $130 Million   By Davies, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  Mr. [Mario Gabelli] is best known for running Gamco Investors Inc., a mutual-fund group in Rye, N.Y. Gamco isn't a party to the lawsuit, which focuses on Mr. Gabelli's role as chairman of Lynch Interactive, a telecommunications firm.  As part of the settlement, Mr. Gabelli and his affiliates denied any wrongdoing and said that they properly certified their eligibility to participate in the auctions. "My clients and I believe this is a fair resolution of the case," said Lanny Breuer, an attorney at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., who represented the Gabelli affiliates and negotiated the settlement. Mr. Breuer added that the settlement doesn't prohibit Mr. Gabelli or his affiliates from participating in future auctions of cellphone licenses. Mr. Gabelli couldn't be reached for comment.  "Barring Mr. Gabelli from an upcoming auction would have been the best way to show we're serious about protecting the integrity of the program," said FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein. "We don't want this settlement to simply be a cost of doing business."
