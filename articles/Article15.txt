TOKYO, Nov. 16â€” Japan's steel exports in the six months ended Sept. 30 fell 3.8 percent in tonnage from a year earlier, but the value rose 5.6 percent because of price increases, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said today.  Exports in the latest period totaled 14.8 million metric tons, worth $856 million.  The average price of steel products was $578 a ton, up from $526 the year before. A metric ton is about 2,204 pounds.  Steel exports to the United States, mainly pipes, surged 31.1 percent in volume, while those to Canada climbed 26.8 percent. By contrast, steel shipments to the Common Market nations plunged 69.3 percent amid economic stagnation in Europe.  In the latest six months, Japanese production of crude steel dropped 9.8 percent, to 51 million tons. Federation officials cited sluggish domestic demand as well as the overall decline in export volume.
