 Deals & Deal Makers -- IPO Outlook: War Gets Added to Risk Factors Specified in Offerings' Filings   By By Raymond Hennessey, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2003  In truth, the possible war is just one of many developments that has slowed the IPO market, said Sal Morreale, who tracks new issues for Cantor Fitzgerald LP in Los Angeles. "The war is a problem, but there's a combination of things wrong right now," he said. "There's still the problem of unemployment, a sluggish economy, and no one wants to buy stocks. War is just on top of that right now."  Still, it's enough of a concern that companies feel they need to warn investors. The recent filing for a $600 million IPO by real-estate investment trust American Financial Realty Trust is a prime example. American Financial, a REIT based in Jenkintown, Pa., warns in offering documents that the U.S. "may enter into an armed conflict, which could have a further impact on our tenants."  Both are profitable, something that IPO investors have favored in new issues. American Financial, which is going public through Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America Securities and Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc., reported net income of $33.1 million for last year on revenue of $137.6 million. Axis Capital booked $1.1 billion in gross premiums last year, for $265.1 million in net income. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney are leading Axis's IPO.
