 Legislators Seek To Overhaul Philippine Bank --- House, Senate Bills Differ On Who Must Assume Institution's Big Debts   By By Julia Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1993  The Philippine Congress, after years of dragging its feet on the issue, appears to be taking concrete action to restore the financial health and independence of the country's central bank.  In the past decade, the Central Bank of the Philippines has accumulated about 308 billion pesos (US$11.56 billion) in foreign and domestic debts. As the obligations swelled public-sector deficits in recent years, the bank was forced to surrender part of its central-banking functions to the Department of Finance. In addition, the bank's policy-making Monetary Board is dominated by government officials, further eroding its independence.  The House of Representatives passed the Central Monetary Authority Bill earlier this week, and the Senate is expected to vote on its version soon. Both versions propose that a new central bank be established with a Monetary Board comprising mostly private-sector representatives, but they differ on the degree to which the central bank can eliminate its debts.
