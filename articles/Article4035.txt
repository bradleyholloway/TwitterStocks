 Happy Birthmother's Day   By By Bruce Chapman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1985  But you could not bring yourself to abort your baby. And it also became clear to you that you were in no position to raise a child alone. My wife and I know from the adoption agency that you quit school in about your fifth month, managed to hold on to a part-time job, got in to see a doctor and, finally, with surprising ease, gave birth to a nine-pound baby boy -- our son.  Only some 50,000 women each year make the choice you did. In fact, no one even knows the correct numbers for sure because the federal government stopped collecting adoption statistics in 1975. In contrast, we do know that abortions now number about 1.6 million annually -- more than one in four pregnancies. Out-of-wedlock births also have risen -- to about 715,000. According to the National Committee for Adoption, only 10% of women who bear babies out of wedlock today relinquish them for adoption, compared with approximately 80% a generation ago.  Philanthropy over the years moved away from support of maternity residences, the number of such residences dropping from 201 to 100 from 1966 to 1981. Only recently have some churches and private charities returned to this field. Yet the need for a safe haven is great. As you know, today's pressure on an unwed prospective mother considering placing her child for adoption is not so much the moral opprobrium of old, based on a chastity code, but the peer pressure of other young people, who, in contradictory fashion, argue first the "smart" course of abortion, and then, when birth is coming, censure a woman if she is going to "give away" her baby. A woman who thinks first of the well-being of her infant and perhaps her own long-term emotional well-being as well, and, accordingly, considers placing her child for adoption, often is left to shift for herself unless she connects early with a well-funded adoption agency or a sympathetic and generous doctor.
