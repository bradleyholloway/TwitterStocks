 Coles Myer Spurns Buyout Offer by KKR-Led Group   By Harrison, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2006  "I don't think that's the end of it," said Paul Xiradis, who manages A$6 billion of equities at Ausbil Dexia. "Coles's board needs to demonstrate to shareholders why they think it substantially undervalues the company."  Coles Myer operates Coles supermarkets, Target and Kmart discount stores and Liquorland liquor shops. The company sold its Myer department-store unit in March for A$1.4 billion to Newbridge Capital, the Asia-focused arm of buyout firm Texas Pacific Group.  "The next step will be Coles's board bringing out its independent valuation of the company," said Chris Prunty, a Sydney-based CCZ Statton Equities analyst. The independent report will give a breakup value for Coles.
