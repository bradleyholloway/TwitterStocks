 Shanghai to Surpass Citigroup As Pudong Bank's Largest Holder   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2006  If successful, the deal would make Shanghai International Group the largest single shareholder of Pudong Bank, with a 21.44% stake. Citigroup, which recently agreed to increase its stake in the Shanghai bank to 19.9%, would take second place. Citigroup acquired a 4.6% stake in Pudong Bank in 2003 for about $70 million.  The share-sale plan comes ahead of an expected deal by a Citigroup- led consortium to acquire an 85% stake in Guangdong Development Bank for roughly $3 billion. An announcement confirming the Citigroup consortium's right to negotiate exclusively for a stake in the Guangdong bank is expected soon. That deal would leave Citibank owning 40% to 45% of the Guangdong bank, according to people familiar with the talks, the largest stake yet to be held by a foreign investor in a Chinese bank.
