 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1995  Muslim and Croat forces claimed major gains in a fierce offensive across central and western Bosnia, seizing two key towns from Serb troops and sending thousands of Serb civilians fleeing. The Serbs offered little resistance and appeared to be pulling back. NATO, meanwhile, launched new air strikes against Serb positions around Sarajevo.  Armed Jewish settlers scuffled with Palestinian parents outside an Arab elementary school in the West Bank town of Hebron. The melee set off clashes in which Palestinian youths hurled stones and bottles at Israeli soldiers, who fired rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades. The army clamped a curfew on downtown Hebron.  Greece and Macedonia signed an accord at the U.N. that normalizes relations between the two neighboring countries. The agreement followed 29 months of negotiations aimed at resolving Greek objections to Macedonia's name, flag and constitution, which Greece says imply claims on its own northern province of Macedonia.
