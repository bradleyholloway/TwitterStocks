 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2005  A Sunni party said it will urge supporters to approve the charter following a last-minute deal for a commission to consider amendments and a new referendum in 2006. Bush hopes voter assent, and next week's scheduled start of Hussein's first trial, will turn around flagging support for Iraq policies, but he warned the potential for violence is high. Insurgents continued their bloody campaign to derail the vote, killing more than 50 in attacks that included a huge suicide car bombing at a Tal Afar market by a woman. An IED killed two U.S. soldiers in Ramadi. Britain offered compensation for wrecking a jail in Basra to free two of its soldiers on Sept. 19. Bin Laden deputy Zawahri wrote to Zarqawi saying Iraq insurgents must prepare for any sudden U.S. departure, counseling establishment of an Islamic state and export of terror to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon in preparation for a showdown with Israel.
