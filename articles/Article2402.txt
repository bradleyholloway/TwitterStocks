 Suing the Wrong Party   By By Eugene Volokh, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1998  Suppose my 14-year-old daughter has sex with a 15-year-old boy at a party and gets pregnant. What do I do?  The court is, as usual, very vague about just what are a host's legal duties as sexual policeman. The judges found it significant that the hostess saw the teenagers lying on a bed kissing and did nothing more than "point a finger at them and give them a look to let them know that the behavior was unacceptable." Though kissing isn't yet a crime, the court said that in light of this evidence of the teens' "sexual propensities," the hostess should have done something more. What exactly? The court doesn't say.
