 Textile Deal Could Spur China to Improve Quality   By Kris Hudson and Ellen Byron, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2005  While the pact will cap China's textile exports to the U.S., it still ensures China will have a growing presence in the U.S. market, said Peter Kilduff , a professor of strategic management and marketing of textiles and apparel at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. "So I don't think it will lead to any significant price increases," he said.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer by sales, expects it will make few, if any, changes. While Wal-Mart, Bentonville, Ark., imported $18 billion in goods from China last year, textiles and apparel represented an unspecified fraction of that amount. Central American countries provide most of the apparel and textiles that Wal- Mart imports. "What we were looking for was for the U.S. and China trade negotiators to come up with a stable, comprehensible approach on these categories so we can plan for the future," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Beth Keck said.
