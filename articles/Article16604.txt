 Entertainment -- The Weekend Adviser: A Tale of Two 'Sex and the City' Knockoffs; Networks Play on Hit Show, NFL's Wild-Card Weekend, Comedy CDs' Comeback   By Schechner, Sam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2006  "Four Kings" is among the first in a slew of midseason replacements that the networks are offering to liven their lineups for the spring. The coming week will also find Heather Graham in "Emily's Reasons Why Not" (the other "Sex" aspirant); a new season of ABC's summertime hit "Dancing With the Stars;" and the limited-run drama "The Book of Daniel," in which a Vicodin-addict minister talks to Jesus.  Another young artist has found a slow route to American stardom: Although Sia Furler's "Colour The Small One" came out independently in Britain two years ago, she has never released anything in the U.S. But when HBO's series "Six Feet Under" used her whispery marimba-based song "Breathe Me" to accompany its final minutes in August, the show's soundtrack jumped to the top of the Amazon and iTunes lists. A U.S. version of "Colour The Small One" arrives in stores next week.  Rather than simply directing or producing movies, Mr. [Quentin Tarantino] -- who helped propel the 1990s indie-film boom with violent epics like "Reservoir Dogs" -- lends his imprimatur with the phrase "Quentin Tarantino Presents." His role in these productions varies from consulting closely with the filmmakers to simply deciding to endorse the film. The strategy works: When Mr. Tarantino lent his name to the unknown martial-arts movie "Iron Monkey" in 2001, it grossed $14.7 million. In 2003, he championed "Hero," which went on to earn $53.6 million domestically.
