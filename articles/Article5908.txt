 As GM Shifts Gears, Dread `14th Floor' Quits the 14th Floor --- Chairman Moves Own Boxes From Aerie of 76 Years To New and Shiny Home   By By Rebecca Blumenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1996  GM officially ended an era yesterday when GM Chairman John F. Smith Jr. and Vice Chairman Harry Pearce packed up the last of their belongings and did the once-unthinkable: moved out of the company's landmark art deco headquarters to its new home in the glistening towers of Detroit's Renaissance Center.  Symbolism seems to be no small part of GM's new world headquarters, which GM bought for a stunningly modest $73 million in May. GM, which has renamed the building the "General Motors Headquarters at The Renaissance Center," hopes the name will be fitting for the restructuring auto maker, No. 1 in revenue.  Mr. Smith said he moved his boxes himself from the legendary 14th floor, traditionally seen as a symbol of corporate arrogance. For decades, workers referred to GM's management as "the 14th floor."
