 Cost Cuts Aid Mutual-Fund Firms' Results   By By John Shipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2001  Baltimore money manager T. Rowe Price Group Inc. reported a 16% cut in operating expenses from last year's third quarter, helping it beat analysts' estimates compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call by a penny a share. "Management appears to be showing remarkable vigor in their efforts to minimize margin contraction," Lehman Brothers analyst Mark Constant said.  Franklin, parent of the Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series fund families, instituted a round of cost-cutting, including the elimination of net new hires, salary reductions of 5% to 10%, limits on overtime and reductions in travel and entertainment expenses. The company estimated the moves could save Franklin $50 million in annual compensation and benefits.  Alliance "demonstrated admirable expense discipline in the quarter," Lehman's Mr. Constant said, "by bringing overall expenses down commensurately with revenue declines." However, the company indicated it expects costs to tick up as it brings in new business, and having received $6 billion in net new money from investors during the quarter, Alliance may feel less pressure on spending than some other companies.
