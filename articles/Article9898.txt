 TiVo to Allow Verizon Customers To Program DVRs Via Cellphones   By Wingfield, Nick, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2006  Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc., of New York, and Britain's Vodafone Group PLC, plans to offer a new service called TiVo Mobile that will allow Verizon Wireless customers who also have TiVos in their homes to schedule TV shows for recording when they are on the go. The service works with a small software program Verizon Wireless customers can download to their handsets that will communicate back to their TiVo digital-video recorders.  Verizon Wireless says it intends to heavily promote TiVo Mobile on its online service for mobile phones, as well as in brochures in Verizon stores and advertising campaigns. TiVo agreed to make its service available to only Verizon Wireless customers for 60 days after its launch. TiVo can make deals with other carriers after that.
