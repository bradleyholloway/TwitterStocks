 Loral Will Pay U.S. $2.5 Million In Settlement   By By Betty Wong, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1989  Loral Corp. partially settled the federal government's civil charges of defense contract fraud by a Loral unit and agreed to pay $2.5 million in damages.  In a lawsuit, the U.S. charges that Goodyear Aerospace Corp., a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. unit acquired by Loral in March 1987, overcharged the Army and Navy in 10 contracts from fiscal years 1982 to 1986. The unit is now known as Loral Systems Group.  Loral's settlement relates only to the claims concerning the allegedly excessive prices Goodyear Aerospace charged the government in 1986. Furthermore, if the government proves the unit knowingly overcharged the Army and Navy in those contracts, the government can recover penalties from Loral, a New York defense electronics concern.
