 Breakaway (A Special Report) --- Editor's Note   By By Lawrence Rout, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2001  That same mix of the practical and the personal, the hard-core advice and the entertaining feature, infuses the entire issue -- as it does each issue of Breakaway. Dan Akst answers readers' questions in Ask Breakaway, and Dick Gibson gives us the latest news on franchising. Scott Thurm tells us why e-tailing may never live up to its hype, and Dan Morse reports on a former dot-commer who much prefers the old world. And Hal Lancaster has encouraging words for all the corporate losers out there.
