 Dollar Expected to Hit New Lows; Bond Yields to Drop on Fed Ease --- Long Treasury Nears 8% Level   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1990  The Fed took another small step Friday, trimming a crucial short-term rate by 1/4 percentage point. That move came shortly after the Labor Department reported a surge in the November unemployment rate and sharp declines in jobs. Gloomy economic news sent investors scurrying to buy Treasury bonds, driving up prices of long-term issues by 1 3/4 points, or $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Government bond yields, which move in the opposite direction from prices, fell to about 8.2%. Just two months ago on Oct. 11, 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 9.06%.  But lower short-term rates will be good news for people with adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity loans. Many home-equity loans offer rates pegged to the banking industry's prime, or base, lending rate. The prime rate has been stuck at 10% at major banks since January. None of the 20 largest banks cut their prime rates Friday, but several smaller banking companies, including First Fidelity Bancorp. of Lawrenceville, N.J., and Southwest Bank of St. Louis, are lowering their prime rates by 1/4 percentage point to 9 3/4%, effective today. Some bankers predict the prime rate will drop to 9 1/2% by early January.  Several analysts recommend buying a mix of short-term and longer-term bonds. A. Gary Shilling, president of an economic consulting and investment advisory firm bearing his name, says long-term Treasury bonds "still are very attractive," as are two-year Treasury notes. The notes "are attractive because that's an area that will react to Fed moves" to ease credit, he says. He also recommends "stocks that look like bonds," such as utilities.
