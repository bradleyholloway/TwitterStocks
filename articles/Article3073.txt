 Bond Prices Fall as Large Offerings Approach; Trading Volume Low on Lack of Economic Data   By By Guy Dixon and Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1998  Several particularly large offerings loom, including a $3.25 billion global issue today by Ford Motor's Ford Motor Credit Co. Underwriters said that would be the largest global issue ever sold by a U.S. company.  In trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 21/32 point, or $6.5625 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 102 23/32. Its yield rose to 5.92% from 5.87% Friday, as bond yields move the opposite way as prices.  But given the government's lower borrowing needs, investors are waiting to see if Treasury auction sizes face further reductions. "If the Treasury is consistent with its downsizing of auctions, that's very positive for the bond market," as lower auction sizes may help to hold down Treasury yields, Mr. Gamba said.
