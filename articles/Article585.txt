PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 4â€” Joel Youngblood competed today for two different teams in two cities, and he is believed to be the first player to do so in major league history.  His playing day began in Chicago and ended in Philadelphia.  At Wrigley Field, starting for the Mets against the Cubs, he had one hit in two times at bat, a two-run single in the third inning that helped the Mets to a 7-4 victory. He left the game when he received word that he had been traded to the Montreal Expos.  Several hours later, at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Youngblood entered right field in the sixth inning for defensive purposes and had one single in one time at bat in the Expos' 5-4 loss to the Phillies.  ''I heard in the third inning that I was traded,'' Youngblood said in Philadelphia . ''I made plane reservations immediately. I showered and packed and made it to the plane with 20 minutes to spare. I had dinner on the plane and caught a cab here. It's funny, I left there in the third and got here in the third.''  Steve Carlton, the Phillies' lefthander, completed his 10th consecutive game, and Manny Trillo drove in the game-winning run with a two-run single in the sixth inning.  Tim Wallach, the third baseman, accounted for all the Expos' runs with a three-run homer in the fourth and a bases-empty homer in the eighth. Wallach has 14 home runs for the season.  Carlton (15-8) allowed eight hits, struck out five and walked four as he won the 15th of his last 18 decisions. He is the first major league pitcher to win 15 games this season.
