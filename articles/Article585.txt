 Thinking Things Over: Trimming the Fat   By By Vermont Royster, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1985  Then one day it turns out that the good times don't last forever. In fact, it doesn't take much of a turndown in business to put a squeeze on that budget bulge. Then come the pains of cost containment. And as with personal dieting, the corporate variety takes time to slender down.  For the trouble didn't begin with President Reagan or our most recent Congress. Over the past two decades there was only one year the government spent less than its revenue, fiscal 1969; for the rest, nothing but deficits, which are cumulative in their effect. Deficits have grown mightily in the Reagan years, some as a result of tax cuts but more from the cumulative piling on of government spending by previous presidents and Congresses.  Even older and necessary departments, such as Defense, have become accustomed to steadily increasing funds that give us not only arms but an entrenched bureaucracy. To suggest trimming Defense fat brings the cry that this would leave us defenseless before our enemies. This despite such lonely dissenters as Sen. Barry Goldwater, a retired Air Force brigadier general, or Rep. Jack McCain, a retired Navy captain and former POW, both supporters of strong defense but neither of them confusing strength with unlimited spending.
