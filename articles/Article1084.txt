 3Com China Venture Lures 3 Bidders; Private-Equity Firms Offer As Much as $1.5 Billion For Networking Operation   By Nisha Gopalan and Jane Spencer, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  3Com now owns 51% of the venture, which 3Com and [Huawei] set up in November 2003. Under the terms of an agreement with Huawei, each has the right, starting Nov. 15, to start a bid process to buy the other's equity interest in the venture. "Huawei will likely stay in the venture and hold 20% to 30% finally," this person said.  In August, 3Com said it intended to begin negotiations to increase its stake in the venture, with Chairman Eric Benhamou saying H-3C "can be an important cornerstone of 3Com's future." One of the people familiar with the matter said that as the Chinese company involved, Huawei would be able to buy out 3Com's stake if it wished.  3Com last month reported a net loss for its fiscal first quarter that was narrower than a year earlier, thanks to increased sales from H-3C. For the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 1, the Marlborough, Mass., company had a net loss of $14.1 million, or four cents a share, compared with a net loss of $42 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. 3Com's fiscal first-quarter revenue rose to $300.1 million from $177.6 million a year ago.
