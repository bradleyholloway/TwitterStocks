 Kroger Unveils Tentative Plan To Restructure --- Analysts Say Move to Block Possible Bid by Hafts Could Cost $3.8 Billion   By By Carol Hymowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1988  Kroger Co. moved swiftly to squash a possible hostile takeover by the Haft family, disclosing a tentative costly restructuring involving a hefty dividend pay-out to shareholders.  Still, the plan won't necessarily thwart a raider, Mr. Raiff and other analysts maintained. Kroger wouldn't disclose the value of the stock portion of the restructuring, but analysts estimated it at $5 to $7 a share. "When you add in that stub portion, you can figure that the company is paying shareholders $53 to $55 a share, and someone else may be able to pay higher," Mr. Raiff said.  Kroger Chairman Lyle Everingham said he expects the "substantial necessary financing" for the restructuring to be obtained from a syndicate of private banks and a private placement of subordinated debt securities. He said Kroger already is talking with a number of banks and Goldman, Sachs & Co., its investment banker, "intends to deliver a 'highly confident' letter with respect to the subordinated debt."
