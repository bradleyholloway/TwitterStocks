 Senate Spotlight Turns to Data Security; Series of Breaches Reignite Campaign on Capitol Hill to Protect Consumer Privacy   By Christopher Conkey and Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 2005  Ms. [Deborah Platt Majoras] called the recent crime spree "identity theft on a massive scale" and hesitantly acknowledged that data brokers exist in something of a regulatory vacuum, unbound by many of the rules that force banks and credit report agencies to thoroughly screen potential customers who buy sensitive data about consumers. "Why do they get it? Why do they sell it?" she asked. "Because there's a market for it."  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, long has been supportive of privacy rights and even co- founded the bipartisan Privacy Caucus in 2000. Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, also is a member. Yesterday, Sen. Shelby characterized the recent security breaches as a "treasure trove" for criminals. As Ms. Majoras was finishing her testimony, Sen. Shelby thanked her and said, "There are some things that we should work together to tighten up in this area."  "LexisNexis is a big, big advocate of data-security standards," Mr. [Kurt Sanford] said. "I'm happy to engage in dialogue on what's the right balance, if legislation is to come, what's the right kind of legislation." Any legislation should make sure that tools such as LexisNexis remain available to the people who are its main users -- law-enforcement agencies, Homeland Security agencies and financial institutions, he said. The company's products, he said, help people open bank accounts or credit cards by letting financial institutions run checks.
