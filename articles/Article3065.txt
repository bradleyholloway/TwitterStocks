 Ralph Neas, Majority Maker   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2002  Now Democrats say they'll vote on appeals-court nominees Dennis Shedd and Michael McConnell as a gesture of good will. The reality is that if Mr. [Patrick Leahy] had practiced a little more "good will" over the past 18 months, Democrats might not be turning the Senate over to Republicans. Mr. Leahy's unprecedented stonewalling of judges (49 of Mr. Bush's nominees are still pending) fed the public perception that today's Democrats deal from the bottom of the deck. Special credit goes to liberal lobbyist [Ralph Neas], whose tireless slander of qualified judges helped boost GOP turnout in Texas, Georgia and Missouri.
