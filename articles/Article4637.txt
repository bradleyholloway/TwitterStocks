 Mattel to Pay First Dividend In Seven Years --- Senior Notes to Be Repaid; Licensing Pact Reached On `Simpsons' Products   By By Pauline Yoshihashi, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1990  Mattel Inc. announced its first quarterly dividend in seven years and said it plans to repay $75 million in senior subordinated extendible notes. The move reflects improved earnings during the past several quarters.  The toy maker also announced at its annual meeting a licensing agreement with Twentieth Century Fox Licensing & Merchandising to produce toys and related products based on the hit television cartoon series "The Simpsons." Twentieth Century Fox is a News Corp. unit.  The dividend of three cents for each share of common stock is payable July 2 to stock of record June 15. Mattel's last common stock dividend was paid in June 1983, the year the company's plunge into electronic toys and other strategies resulted in a $394 million loss. That prompted a major restructuring and eventually a change in senior management.
