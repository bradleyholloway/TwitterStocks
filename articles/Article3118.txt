 Futures & Options: Celebrating Cinema   By By Robert J. Hughes, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2003  "FOREVER HOLLYWOOD" is a film celebrating a century of Hollywood filmmaking. It's made up of more than 400 images from archives and feature films, with footage dating to the early 1900s. Clips include films in production during Hollywood's heyday in the 1930s, home movies of the stars (romping around their pools or with children) and newsreels of Hollywood night life. Tickets are $7 for adults, $5 for students and seniors. Showings at 2 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.  IN AN UNUSUAL FILM series, this Queens, N.Y., museum is pairing movies first made as silent films with their remakes in the days of talkies. Coming Sunday is a defining Barbara Stanwyck movie, "Ladies of Leisure," first filmed in 1926 with a largely forgotten cast and again in 1930 with Ms. Stanwyck, under the direction of Frank Capra. Ms. Stanwyck plays a tough hooker with a heart of gold and a strong left hook. Admission is $8.50 for adults and $5.50 for seniors and students. The silent version will screen at 2 p.m., the sound version at 4 p.m.  SMALL-TOWN CINEMAS in the 1930s often displayed their own hand-painted posters instead of expensive Hollywood ones. This exhibition shows how locals interpreted Hollywood. Contrast that homey charm with the eye-catching imagination of Saul Bass, known for dynamic title sequences for movies including "Psycho" and "Goodfellas." An exhibition of his work opens Thursday. This museum celebrates all aspects of movie, TV and radio production. Admission is $8.75 for adults, $5.50 for seniors, $4.50 for students and $4 for children ages 5 to 12. Open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, except Wednesday.
