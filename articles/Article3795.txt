 Comcast Will Use Microsoft System For Digital TV   By Peter Grant and Robert Guth, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  Comcast is particularly interested in those abilities because it has over the past year been making a huge push to promote on-demand movies and other programming that digital cable subscribers can watch at any time. Foundation Edition gives Comcast the ability to promote the latest on-demand features on the program guide.  Comcast executives said the Microsoft software will make it easier to navigate through the myriad digital-TV offerings. "The vision is to allow consumers to access the television they want to watch when they want to watch it," said Steve Burke, president of Comcast's cable division.  Comcast committed itself to helping Microsoft break into the cable- software business when it acquired AT&T Broadband in late 2002. At that time, Microsoft agreed to convert $5 billion in AT&T debt into Comcast equity. In exchange, Comcast agreed to launch Microsoft software in 25% of its systems, if certain conditions were met.
