 Digits   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2002  A public-relations specialist at EMC ran a search on all seven of the data-storage patents that H-P had cited in a Monday news release announcing the suit. It turned out that patents with the numbers 5,327,658 and 5,391,327, which were prominently featured in H-P's announcement, weren't owned by H-P.  EMC, which has since countersued H-P with its own patent-infringement claims, quickly pointed out the mistake to H-P.  Mark Stouse, an H-P spokesman, said the correct patents numbers -- 5,237,658 and 5,390,327 -- were used in the actual patent-infringement complaint against EMC. But when it came to the news release, "a couple of numbers got transposed" by an attorney's assistant, Mr. Stouse said. "We made a small error. But the important thing is that EMC is infringing on H-P's intellectual property."
