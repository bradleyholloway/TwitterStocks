 California Speeds Measure to Aid Blue Cross Insurer   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1988  California lawmakers are racing to pass a bill intended to keep troubled Blue Cross of California, the state's largest health insurer and one of the largest nonprofit insurers in the U.S., from technical insolvency.  The legislation would clear the way for Blue Cross to sell its TakeCare affiliate for about $45 million. TakeCare, an Oakland, Calif.-based health maintenance organization with about 155,000 members, had 1986 revenue of $117 million. Blue Cross needs the special legislation, because there isn't any provision in insurance regulations to convert the nonprofit affiliate into a for-profit concern.  Despite some recent improvement in its financial condition, Blue Cross is telling lawmakers that it must sell TakeCare soon to meet certain regulatory requirements of the state insurance department. State Sen. Barry Keene wrote the bill to protect the consumers who are dependent on Blue Cross for health insurance, an aide said.
