 Getting Stock Picks From Your Boss --- Despite Economy, More Companies Offer Financial Advice as a Perk; the Risks of Listening   By By Michelle Higgins and Ruth Simon, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2003  Just because you're getting financial advice through your employer doesn't mean you should take it, however. The current plight of two top executives at Sprint Corp. is a case in point. Company President Ronald LeMay and Chief Executive Officer William T. Esrey used a tax shelter pitched by Ernst & Young, Sprint's auditors. Now, the tax shelter is being challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, and the executives could be liable for tens of millions in taxes. And they're being shoved out the door for taking Ernst & Young's advice.  An increasing range of big companies are now providing assistance that goes beyond the longstanding perk of advice for CEOs. At General Motors Corp., for example, the top 10% of executives -- about 400 people -- can get free financial counseling from Ayco Co., a tax and financial-counseling firm, or accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. Other employees can pay for advice from Ayco through payroll deduction ranging from $100 to $200 a year, depending on the program they opt for.  Over the past five years, some 2,500 companies have signed up for a MetLife program that offers workers guidance on everything from buying a car to estate planning. Rank-and-file employees pay MetLife anywhere from $300 to $1,000 to set up a financial plan, while executives can pay as much as $20,000. The employer pays nothing.
