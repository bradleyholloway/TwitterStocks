 PURSUITS; Books -- Writer's Block: A German Reckoning   By Lewis, Tess, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2007  In 1990, after her country had disintegrated, Ms. Wolf finally published a direct critique of the East German regime in a collection called "What Remains." The title story described a prominent writer under menacing surveillance by the Stasi, East Germany's secret police. Ms. Wolf had written it in 1979 but had kept it in a drawer. The media's response was ferocious. They roundly condemned her for waiting to publish "What Remains" until it was safe to do so and for opportunistically presenting herself as a victim. In 1993, Ms. Wolf was back in the pillory when a journalist reported that he had found three files in the Stasi archives detailing her activities as an unofficial collaborator with the secret police from 1959 to 1962.  For 40 years, Ms. Wolf set out to describe a single day, Sept. 27, as "accurately as possible." The idea originated with an assignment in 1960, when the Moscow publication Izvestiya asked writers from around the world to write about Sept. 27. Ms. Wolf dutifully recounted her own experience on that date -- and then decided to do so the next year, and the next. She wanted to preserve, she says, the fleeting moments of her life and to use the annual stock-taking as an "exercise against blindness to reality." "One Day a Year" offers too little insight to meet such a lofty purpose.  In the 1962 entry, a month after the Wall was built, Ms. Wolf laments the dividing of Germany but notes her relief, "when the borders were closed," that factories would no longer be "stripped of engineers and technicians," who were being lured away by the promise of freedom and wealth in the West. The engineers' and technicians' preferences, apparently, were beside the point.
