 GM, Toyota Bet Hybrid Green; Even as Sales Cool, Auto Makers Hope They Will Help Branding, Bottom Line   By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2006  "We are going to keep working to displace petroleum" as a motor fuel, "and expanding our commitment to electrically driven vehicles," GM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner told a group of reporters and analysts assembled last week for a preview of GM's future models. "We see energy and environmental leadership as a key part of our turnaround strategy," he said.  GM's Vice Chairman for product development Bob Lutz went even further. "I think the electrification of the automobile is not just a possibility. It's inevitable." At the recent Los Angeles auto show, Mr. Wagoner declared that GM intends to develop a plug-in hybrid -- a gas-electric vehicle that can run for miles on batteries alone and plugs in to the power grid. He didn't say when, and GM executives say the battery technology needed to make a plug-in hybrid work reliably doesn't exist. But Mr. Wagoner's statement was a victory for the small but very vigorous plug-in hybrid lobby.  Meanwhile, GM is gearing up to launch next year its own brand of gas-electric hybrid technology on its large SUVs. The "two mode" hybrid Cadillac Escalade will get a boost from electric motors at both city and highway speeds. Equally important, the big SUV will have prominent badges identifying it as a hybrid. Mr. Lutz calls it the "guilt free Escalade."
