 Market Malaise Sinks Campsix's Corporate Alliance   By By Peter Loftus, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  The demise of San Francisco-based Campsix helps illustrate another development amid the soft market: the pursuit of big-name corporate partners by struggling incubators. Campsix went out of business in May after running out of funds, its former executives say, even after forming an alliance with corporate powerhouse Dow Chemical Co.  This past fall, Campsix and Dow Chemical teamed up to launch iVenturi, a developer of Web-based software designed to help corporate customers launch products. Campsix said it was the first of many businesses it would launch with top corporations. Dow contributed intellectual property to the partnership. Campsix also said Andersen Consulting, now called Accenture, was a partner in the start-up.  Accenture spokeswoman Darienne Dennis says the consulting firm assisted Campsix in launching iVenturi, "by developing certain aspects of the incubation process." But its "work was brief in nature and ended a year before Campsix went out of business."
