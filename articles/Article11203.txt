 Short-Term Interest Rates Move to Higher Ground As Traders Await December Employment Report   By By Matthew Winkler and Sam Alcorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1989  Short-term interest rates rose but long-term bond yields were little changed as traders braced for the government's latest report this morning on the nation's employment.  The employment data for December probably will prompt the Federal Reserve to confirm its recent credit tightening, many analysts and investors say. The report is expected to show a 0.1 percentage point decline in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.3% and a 273,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month, according to the average estimate of 13 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.  While the economy shows few signs of slowing significantly, "it's a pretty good bet the Fed will raise the discount rate {half a percentage point} to 7% before the end of the month," said Edward J. Merkle, manager of bond funds at Marinvest, a subsidiary of Marine Midland Bank. The discount rate is the Fed's lending fee to banks and other financial institutions.
