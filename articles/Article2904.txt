 Sunshine Teams to Battle In a Murky College Bowl   By By Allen Barra and George Ignatin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 1996  Florida and Florida State deserve a rematch; or rather, Florida deserves another shot at FSU. Florida was No. 1 all year, both in the polls and in Max's power ratings. When it lost to No. 2 FSU, 24-21, on FSU's home field, FSU had a four-point home-field advantage. Max still ranks Florida No. 1, and on a neutral field he says they beat FSU.  As for the rest of the Top 20, if anyone got shafted by the current bowl coalition, it wasn't Arizona State or BYU (which played the weakest schedule of anyone in the Top 20). It was 8-3 Notre Dame. Believe it. This Irish team had a brutal schedule. Six of its opponents -- Navy, Washington, Ohio State, Texas, Air Force, and USC -- had a combined won-lost record of 44-18 (not counting their games with the Irish). The Irish got no bowl this season, even though Max says they would probably beat BYU by a TD on a neutral field. And BYU probably would've gone 7-4 against Notre Dame's schedule.
