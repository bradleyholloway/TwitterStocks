 High-Tech Farewell: Cellphones Allow Cherished Last Words --- Terror Victims, Adventurers Try to Reassure Loved Ones; An Instinct to Dial Up Mom   By By Jonathan Eig and Andrea Petersen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  Peter Hanson was aboard United Airlines Flight 175, along with his wife, Susan, and their two-year-old daughter, Christine. He called from his cellular phone to tell his parents that his plane had been hijacked and that he loved them. Suddenly the Hanson family was experiencing an extraordinary social change wrought by new technology: Now we can broadcast the details of our sudden deaths to loved ones.  Verizon Wireless has installed systems near the disaster area in New York's financial district to help find survivors still trapped in the rubble. The company was using devices that grab the radio signals emitted by cellphones that are turned on but not necessarily in use. By measuring the signal received from each site, the devices can pinpoint a cellphone's whereabouts within 100 feet. Verizon wouldn't say whether or not any of its subscribers had called from the rubble, saying it was forbidden to do so by emergency medical personnel.  Verizon also sent a "cell site on wheels," or COW, to the disaster area. A COW sends and receives the radio signals that make up cellphone calls. The closer a phone is to a COW, the less battery power it uses. Verizon's goal was to extend the battery life of the cellphones of any trapped survivors and increase the time they could call for help.
