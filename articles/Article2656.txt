 Making the Most of Your Weaknesses   By By Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1999  Financial experts say we should combine a host of stocks and bonds and then focus on the performance of the entire portfolio. In theory, it's a smart strategy: By buying a slew of investments, some of which will soar while others are sinking, we should get healthy returns with less violent portfolio swings.  "The problem is, it doesn't correspond to people's intuition of how to build portfolios," says Meir Statman, a finance professor at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif. "The notion that you should consider portfolios as a whole and focus only on the risk and return of the overall portfolio is good advice. But it's advice that investors find hard to take."  What's our problem? We tend to divide our money into different mental accounts. We fret about each investment's performance, rather than focusing on our whole portfolio. And we aren't consistent about risk. With some money, we yearn for safety. With other money, we hunger for riches.
