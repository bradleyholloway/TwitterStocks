 PURSUITS; Food & Drink -- Chefs at Home: A French Approach to Grilling; For Bastille Day, a top chef makes lamb skewers with a tangy sauce   By Lauren A.E. Schuker, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2007  THE CHEF: CYRIL RENAUD, the chef-proprietor of Fleur de Sel in Manhattan's Flatiron district, first learned the art of grilling in his mother's kitchen in Brittany. A veteran of some of France's finest restaurants and David Bouley's eponymous restaurant in New York, Mr. Renaud opened Fleur de Sel in 2000. (It's named after salt from his childhood home.) The restaurant has received numerous awards, including a Michelin star.  -- For the lamb skewers: Crumble the meat into a large bowl, add the egg, onion, parsley, mint, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon fleur de sel, pepper and cinnamon, and gently mix together. Form the meat into walnut-sized balls (about 2 tablespoons of meat mixture per ball), then flatten each slightly with the palm of your hand. Slide two pieces of meat onto each skewer, alternating with pieces of zucchini and tomato. Lay the skewers on a plate or tray, cover and chill for at least 15 minutes.  -- Heat a grill or grillpan over high heat. Lightly oil the grill and, working in batches, grill skewers for 3 to 4 minutes per side, using a long offset spatula and tongs to flip (handle the meat gently). Clean the grill between batches. Transfer skewers to a platter, lightly sprinkle zucchini with fleur de sel and serve with the shallot-yogurt sauce and apple-celery root salad.
