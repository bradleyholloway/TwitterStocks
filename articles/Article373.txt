The State Supreme Court justice presiding in the murder trial of Jack Henry Abbott refused to grant a defense request to sequester the jury as selection of the panel began.  Mr. Abbott, 37 years old, won fame last year for his prison memoirs, ''In the Belly of the Beast,'' published with the help of the writer Norman Mailer and other literary figures.  He is accused of fatally stabbing Richard Adan, a 22-year-old waiter, after a dispute outside a Bowery restaurant last July.  As the proceedings began before Justice Irving Lang in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Abbott's lawyer, Ivan S. Fisher, argued that the widespread attention given to the case required that the jury be barred from contact with the public. Justice Lang denied the motion. Jury selection is expected to take a week.
