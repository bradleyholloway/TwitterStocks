 Wobbly on Iraq?   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2003  The right kind of non-U.S. forces could help stabilize the country more quickly. A division of Turks, for example, could slow terrorist incursions along the Iraq-Syria border. A brigade or two of Indians could relieve the U.S. Army around key points in Baghdad as well. Several thousand Dutch, Polish, Italian and other European troops are already doing such work in the Shia-majority areas in the center of Iraq. A similar U.S.-dominated U.N. force fought the Korean War 50 years ago, and there's no reason that model can't work in Iraq.  That assumes, however, that the price of the U.N.'s blessing isn't too high. Our friends the French will want a piece of the oil business they had under [Saddam Hussein], and they'd also like a say anointing any new Iraqi government. After everything the French did to stop the liberation of Iraq, we suspect more than a few Iraqis would consider this a betrayal.  Among some on the right, meanwhile, the preference is to send more American troops to Iraq. This seems intended to prove a long-time point that the U.S. needs a larger standing Army and a bigger Defense budget. But this was also the Westmoreland strategy during Vietnam, the illusion that another 100,000 Yanks on the ground can pacify the country. Perhaps they'll also call for "search and destroy" missions. A million Marines won't be enough if the Iraqi people aren't on our side.
