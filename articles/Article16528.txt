 Pension-Plan Checkup   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2005  If you are covered by a traditional pension, technically called a defined-benefit plan, you are promised a fixed benefit when you retire. But that money doesn't belong to you until it's paid out, so it's still vulnerable. Typical triggers for a pension plan's demise include a company's bankruptcy, a merger, or conversion to a 401(k)- type system.  To check up on your pension plan's health, look at the summary of its assets and liabilities that it's required to send you each year. If you work in a troubled industry, such as auto or steel manufacturing or airlines, it's worth paying attention to how much the plan's liabilities outweigh its assets.  What if you've lost track of a pension from a former employer? Check out the PBGC's "Finding a Lost Pension" publication, available at pbgc.gov/publications/lostpendl.htm. The agency also has a list of people who have not been tracked down but are owed pensions by companies that went out of business or terminated their pension plans. To see if you are on the list, go to pbgc.gov/search/default.htm or write to the PBGC Pension Search Program, 1200 K St. NW, Suite 930, Washington, D.C., 20005-4026.
