 GM Will Scrap Cost-of-Living Payments in '86 --- No. 1 Auto Maker to Base Salaried Workers' Raises Solely on Performance   By By Dale D. Buss and Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1985  The move affects about 110,000 nonunion GM employees in the U.S. and Canada. But the No. 1 auto maker's 440,000, unionized hourly employees in North America also could face renewed pressure from the company to accept cuts in the inflation allowances they currently receive.  The action could be a gamble for GM because it is bound to alienate some white-collar workers who would resent the absence of nearly automatic pay increases. It is the latest in a series of major changes GM's salaried work force has experienced in the last two years, as GM reorganized its North American car operations and took some benefits away from employees transferred to its new Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit.  A GM spokesman said that under the new plan, the company's fund for merit pay increases for 1986 will amount to about 5 1/2% of next year's North American salaried payroll, an increase of about two percentage points from this year. Those two percentage points are about equivalent to what GM calculates it would have disbursed in inflation allowances next year under the current plan. GM also estimates that 2% of its salaried payroll will consist of inflation allowances this year.
