 U.S. Farmers Want WTO Review Of GMO Dispute With Europe   By By Scott Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2002  U.S. farmers want the European Union to take important steps toward ending a four-year moratorium on approving new genetically modified foods and animal feed by the end of the year. But just days ahead of a meeting of EU agriculture ministers on Thursday, the outcome is still unclear. Adding to U.S. farmers' frustration: The EU is considering replacing the freeze on GMO approval with strict rules on labeling and traceability -- a move U.S. farmers say would leave them worse off than they are now.  Although some U.S. products received permission to export before the testing ban went into place in 1998, and continue to be exported now, the moratorium has prevented wider exports. Exports to Europe of U.S. corn, for example, have plunged since the moratorium began. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, U.S. corn growers are suffering $300 million a year in lost business because of the ban.
