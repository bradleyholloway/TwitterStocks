 India's Kashmir Ambitions   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2002  Western worry over Kashmir has focused on Pakistan's willingness to control terrorists slipping over the border with India, and rightly so. But that shouldn't allow U.S. policy to overlook India's equal obligation to prevent a full-scale war from breaking out in Southwest Asia.  This question is on the mind of U.S. leaders who ask Indian officials what they think a war would accomplish, only to get no clear answer. India is by far the dominant power in Southwest Asia, and it likes it that way. Some in India may fear Mr. [Pervez Musharraf] less because he has tolerated terrorists than because he has made a strategic choice to ally his country with the U.S. If he succeeds, Pakistan could become stronger as a regional competitor and a model for India's own Muslim population of 150 million.  As it works to defuse the Kashmir crisis, the U.S. has to press Mr. Musharraf to stop as many terror incursions into India as possible. But it also must work to dissuade India from using Kashmir as an excuse to humiliate Pakistan, a vital U.S. ally. The U.S. has a long-term interest in good relations with India, a sister democracy and Asian counterweight to China. But self-restraint over Kashmir is a test of how much India really wants that kind of U.S. relationship.
