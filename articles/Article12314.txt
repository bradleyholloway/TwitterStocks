 Apria Healthcare Breaks Off Deal With Investor Firm   By By Frederic M. Biddle, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1998  COSTA MESA, Calif. -- Apria Healthcare Group Inc. formally broke ties Friday with Joseph Littlejohn & Levy, which had pledged a cash infusion of $172 million for the home-health-care company.  The break follows weeks of uncertainty about the willingness of JLL, a New York turnaround firm, to proceed with its financial commitment to Apria.  As part of a mutual decision to part ways, Apria said it settled a lawsuit against an investor group headed by JLL. The settlement leaves both sides "free to explore other strategic directions," Apria said. Representatives of JLL couldn't be reached for comment.
