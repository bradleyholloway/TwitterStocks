 Most Retailers Report Mediocre Holiday Sales; Retail Index Rose Only 2.7% In December; A Few Stars Posted Big Seasonal Gains   By Covert, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  Even rising sales weren't necessarily great news for retailers. Target Corp. -- Wal-Mart's smaller, trendier rival -- edged past its own expectations with a strong monthly same-store sales increase of 5.1%. But the Minneapolis-based discounter also warned that its fourth-quarter earnings won't meet Wall Street's current expectations of 94 cents a share. George Strachan, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, blamed Target's weak margins on "increased cherry-picking by customers rather than higher promotional activity by the company."  Elsewhere in the mall, many specialty chains also saw a challenging season. Gap Inc.'s same-store sales fell 1%, missing Wall Street's forecast for a 0.1% drop, according to Thomson First Call. The San Francisco apparel giant said sluggish customer traffic forced it to take markdowns on holiday merchandise. Although inventories are now in good shape, holiday margins were worse than last year's, Gap said.  The surge in post-Christmas buying doesn't bode well for retailers' margins, said Mr. [Dan Hess], the firm's chief executive. But he also noted that as shoppers searched for bargains and places to spend their gift cards, a number of retailers managed to greet them with newly arrived, full-priced spring merchandise on the day after Christmas. That will help shore up profits, Mr. Hess said.
