 Indonesia's Wahid Replaces Top Officials   By By Michael Schuman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2001  Mr. [Abdurrahman Wahid]'s shake-up replaced security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with retired Gen. Agum Gumelar, a [Megawati Sukarnoputri] ally that the president may hope will help broker a deal to keep him in office. Mr. Wahid also replaced Attorney General Marzuki Darusman with Justice Minister Baharudin Lopa. Mr. Darusman last week absolved Mr. Wahid of any criminal activity, but he is considered ineffective in pursuing corruption cases against autocratic former President Suharto, his family and cronies.
