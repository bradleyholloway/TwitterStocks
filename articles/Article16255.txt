 Invacare Expects New Products To Boost Sales   By By Ralph E. Winter, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2003  In 2002, Invacare's profit fell in North America, offset by better results in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, its principal overseas markets.  Invacare also will introduce respiratory products, including equipment that allows the user to fill oxygen cylinders at home instead of relying on a dealer to continually replenish the supply.

For instance, the company is importing more electric motors for power wheelchairs and scooters.
