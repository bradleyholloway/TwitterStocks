 In the Battle Against Avian Flu, Rural Asia Is Seen as Vanguard   By Hookway, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2005  "I followed CP's instructions," Ms. Sumalee said. "But I'm afraid of the risk bird flu poses, and I'm happy to do it. And CP helped me borrow the money to do it."  Boonpeng Santiwattanatam, a veterinarian at Charoen Pokphand, said helping small farmers is in the company's interest. "If we minimize the risk of small farms catching bird flu, we minimize the risk to ourselves and to Thailand's exports," he said.  Even in Thailand millions of chickens are farmed in still less-than- secure conditions. "We know 80% of birds [in Thailand] are processed safely," said WHO Director-General Lee Jong Wook. "It's the other 20% we worry about."
