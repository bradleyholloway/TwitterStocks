 Aftermath of Terror: `True Believer' Prosecutor Brings Knowledge of bin Laden to Hunt   By By Jerry Markon And Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 2001  Mr. [Patrick Fitzgerald] knows Osama bin Laden as well as any law enforcer. As an assistant U.S. attorney in New York until the end of August, he had investigated Mr. bin Laden since at least 1996 and led the prosecution team that convicted four bin Laden associates earlier this year in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.  Mr. Fitzgerald, whose whereabouts are being kept secret like other prosecutors on the case, didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago, Randall Samborn, confirmed that Mr. Fitzgerald is involved in the investigation and has been out of Chicago all week. He would not elaborate.  Stanley L. Cohen, attorney for the witness, Moataz Al-Hallak, said Mr. Al-Hallak had previously been questioned by Mr. Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury in the Africa embassy-bombings case. He was quizzed then on his ties to convicted bin Laden associate Wadih El-Hage. On Wednesday, he was asked "very general questions about intelligence-gathering," Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Al-Hallak "had no information at all."
