 Opera: Words vs. Music By Heidi Waleson   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1998  New York -- Richard Strauss and librettist Clemens Krauss probably had a very good time creating "Capriccio," Strauss's final opera, which had its premiere in 1942. What could be more alluring to a composer and librettist than a work that takes as its subject a debate over which is more important, music or words? "Capriccio" finally got its first Metropolitan Opera production, directed by John Cox, this month, but a game cast and some diverting stage pictures could not conceal the fact that aesthetic argument isn't necessarily operatic. After two hours of repartee so dense that it kept the viewer glued unrewardingly to the titles, the answer -- that music and words are inseparable -- turned out to have been obvious, at least to opera lovers, from the very beginning of the evening.  In "Capriccio," the poet Olivier (Simon Keenlyside) and the composer Flamand (David Kuebler) both declare their love to the Countess (Kiri Te Kanawa), whose choice will decide the words vs. music debate. The Countess seems to be leaning toward music; her brother, the Count, a stage-struck amateur played to hearty blustering perfection by Kim Josephson, prefers words. Actually, he prefers Clairon (the throatily sensual Kathryn Harries), a professional actress who usually plays Andromache, Phaedra, Medea and Roxane but is slumming for the day to do some home theatricals with him.
