 REVIEW & OULTOOK (Editorial): Killing Election Reform   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut agreed with the GOP point man, Kit Bond of Missouri, to include modest anti-fraud protections. Mr. Bond saw fraud first-hand in St. Louis in 2000 and 2001, when a dog and the dead were registered; 28% of all registered voters can't be located by the U.S. Postal Service. So he insisted that voters who register by mail show proof of identity, such as a photo ID or utility bill, but only when they cast their first ballot. Every Senate Democrat voted for the bill that included this.  Now comes the House-Senate conference, and every issue is settled but one: the anti-fraud provisions. The usual liberal interest groups (AFL-CIO, NAACP) are pressuring Senate Democrats to kill the bill, claiming that the first-time-vote ID requirement is "tantamount to requiring [voters] to pay a poll tax." You don't have to be from Alabama to know that "poll tax" is intended to rile black voters into suspecting GOP foul play.
