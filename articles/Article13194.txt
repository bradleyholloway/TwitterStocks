 EDS, CheckFree Record Gains; Nordstrom, Gap Post Declines   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2005  Stocks fell sharply after disappointing sales reports from retailers such as Gap, Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch sparked concerns about the state of consumer spending. But investors still took to solid earnings reports and sent Electronic Data Systems and CheckFree soaring.  "Lower than expected" was the operative phrase in many cases for July same-store sales that retailers released. Nordstrom fell $3, or 8.2%, to $33.45; AnnTaylor Stores lost 94 cents, or 3.6%, to 25.15; Abercrombie & Fitch lost 4.68, or 6.7%, to 65.56; and Limited Brands declined 68 cents, or 2.7%, to 24.35.  CheckFree (Nasdaq) rose 3.85, or 11%, to 40.25. The provider of electronic-billing services posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were at the upper end of its prior estimate and a penny ahead of Wall Street's target. It also said fiscal 2006 earnings will meet analysts' average view.
