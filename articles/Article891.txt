 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Ten-Gallon Outrage   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1987  Texaco's move to Chapter 11 is best understood as a do-it-yourself injunction against the Texas courts and Pennzoil. Now Pennzoil can't attach liens. Texaco tried to get a series of courts to block the $12 billion bond so that it could try to get the absurd trial verdict overturned without first having to post a crippling bond. It lost. So Texaco chose legal bankruptcy over actual bankruptcy. The betting is that this will shield it from unsecured creditors long enough for justice to prevail.  This is a painful process. But it is also probably the only hope Texaco had for finding a serious court to consider the core public-policy issue raised by this case: The U.S. legal system is supposed to create rules of behavior that are rational and certain, not bizarre and entirely unpredictable. Pennzoil v. Texaco is a national embarrassment. Foreigners may justifiably wonder how they can avoid local but utterly destructive legal pitfalls in this country when not even a powerhouse like Texaco can escape.  The courts so far have been hung up on the side issue of the size of the bond Texaco must post to appeal the ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court last Monday told Texaco it had to go back to the Texas courts for relief from the bond. The company had warned that it couldn't wait that long, and within the week Texaco's biggest creditors were already nervous. Banks and oil suppliers feared Pennzoil would get its liens before Texaco found a court willing to reduce the bond. Texaco gave additional security to its most important creditors, but this process couldn't last. In bankruptcy court, the secured creditors are better off than Pennzoil, which is unsecured.
