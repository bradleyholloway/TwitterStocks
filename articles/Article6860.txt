 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Review & Outlook: The Plots Thicken   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2004  When Walter Cronkite talked on CNN last month about Osama bin Laden's scary pre-election video, yet another cat leapt out of the conspiracy-theory bag. "I'm a little inclined to think," Mr. Cronkite told host Larry King, "that Karl Rove, the political manager at the White House, who is a very clever man, he probably set up bin Laden to this thing."  Yasser Arafat probably wasn't poisoned, but it's no surprise if perpetually discombobulated Palestinians want to think he was. The otherwise lucid actor Will Smith has espoused the belief that AIDS is part of a plot to strike down black people. That's a classic example, says Tim Melley, the University of Miami (Ohio) professor who wrote "Empire of Conspiracy: The Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America." Many conspiracists function like sociologists at first, he notes, "identifying patterns of inequity . . . that have effects on society" -- and then they jump to blame everything on a deliberate plan. "It's comforting. It provides an explanation that explains why your group is down and out."
