 VW Offers Sweeter Bid For Rolls   By By Brandon Mitchener, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1998  Raising the pressure in the battle for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., Volkswagen AG yesterday said it had presented Rolls owner Vickers PLC a sweetened bid for the luxury British auto maker.  Confronted with VW's announcement, a Vickers spokeswoman who previously had denied receipt of a sweetened bid from VW would say only that Vickers wasn't in negotiations with VW.  "We are in a period of exclusive negotiations with BMW until the end of April," said the spokeswoman, repeating comments made earlier in the week after Vickers announced an agreement in principle to sell Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to Bayerische Motoren Werke AG for GBP 340 million in cash. Vickers says it won't seriously entertain any other bids at least until May, though it might acknowledge their receipt.
