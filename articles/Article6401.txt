 Motorola Sees Sales and Margins Slipping at PCS Unit in 1st Period   By By Andrea Petersen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2001  Motorola is placing much of its hope on a slew of new phones and devices that it plans to introduce in the middle of this year. It remains to be seen, however, what kind of demand it will see. Motorola has badly misjudged the cellphone market before. In 2000, it put a lot of resources into developing fancy phones that let users access the Web. But consumers largely ignored the new Web phones and many instead bought cheaper phones. "What is most important is introducing a product that the market wants," said Michael Ching, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "We'll be watching new-product announcements very carefully."  Motorola estimates that about 410 million handsets were sold industrywide in 2000, and that this figure will grow to between 525 million and 575 million in 2001. But Motorola warned analysts that it expects 2001 industrywide handset sales to be closer to 525 million.
