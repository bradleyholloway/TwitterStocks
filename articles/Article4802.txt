 Florida Thrift Fires Two Officers For 'Impropriety'   By By Sydney P. Freedberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1987  First Mutual Savings Association of Florida said it fired two of its top officers for what it termed "alleged impropriety" by the two men in relation to certain loan transactions.  Oscar M. Tharp was fired as president and chief executive officer of the Pensacola-based thrift, Florida's oldest. He was succeeded by Barney B. Burks Jr., who had been First Mutual's vice chairman.  First Mutual is a state-chartered institution. Florida banking officials declined to comment on the matter, except to say that they planned to investigate it. But a spokeswoman for the Federal Home Loan Bank, whose Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corp. arm insures Florida Mutual's deposits, when asked if the allegations concerned theft from Florida Mutual, said, "That was the substance of what they were going to announce."
