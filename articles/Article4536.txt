 Justices Let Some Investors Sue Sources Of False Tips for Illegal Insider Trades   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1985  The Supreme Court ruled that an investor who trades illegally on inside information may, in certain cases, file a securities-fraud lawsuit against a tipster or broker who passed on a false or misleading tip.  The high court ruled 8-0 that in a civil securities-fraud lawsuit, a defendant's claim that the plaintiff also violated securities law doesn't automatically mean the lawsuit must be dismissed.  The Supreme Court's ruling "is going to discourage brokers from giving inside tips if they have them. It is certainly going to discourage them from pretending they have inside tips if they don't really have them," said Alan Bromberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist University Law School, who specializes in securities fraud.
