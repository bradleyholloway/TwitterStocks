 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Cory vs. the Communists   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1986  Two of the Philippines' top Communists, Saturnino Ocampo and Antonio Zumel, slipped reporters into their secret Manila "safe house" over the weekend to let them know they were still "testing the waters" for a deal to participate openly and legally in politics. If those waters are polluted, however, it is by the Communists.  Indeed, President Aquino chose the perfect response to the Communist overtures two weeks ago when the Philippine military captured the New People's Army leader and former Communist Party chairman, Rodolfo Salas. She termed his incarceration "a nonnegotiable issue" and insisted that he face trial. The Communists say the arrest violated government promises of safe conduct during the negotiations but the military says the promise didn't cover Salas.
