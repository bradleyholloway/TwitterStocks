 PURSUITS; Books: Backwoods Bildungsroman   By McGrath, Roger D, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2006  FANS OF [Charles Frazier] and his highly acclaimed first novel, "Cold Mountain," have waited nearly a decade for his second to appear. I would like to say the wait has been worth it, but I'm afraid many will find "Thirteen Moons" ponderous, uninspired and dreary. Given that it is set in the same North Carolina terrain of "Cold Mountain," though earlier in the 19th century than that Civil War-era story, I had expected a similarly grand and compelling adventure. But I found mostly a tedious exercise that even the writer himself seems bored with at times.  "Thirteen Moons" is the tale of Will Cooper, a fictional character loosely based on the real-life figure William Holland Thomas, a white trader who became a lawyer, a Cherokee chief, a North Carolina state legislator, a railroad builder and a Confederate colonel. Mr. Frazier's Will Cooper inhabits all those roles as well, although he never finds the wife or has the children that William Thomas did. In the end, Cooper loses at everything, including love. Mr. Frazier informs the reader, again and again, explicitly and implicitly, that we are made to be destroyed, that fighting against time's onrush is folly, that our best efforts are mostly futile, that friends betray us, that what is lost can never be regained, that life is tribulation followed by decay and death. Suicide today or tomorrow?
