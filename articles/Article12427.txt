 Dollar Gains on Yen on Japanese Data, Gets Lift Against Euro From U.S. Stocks   By By Michael Casey, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1999  The day began with Tokyo currency traders reacting negatively to the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey of business confidence by selling the yen. This forced the dollar above resistance at 121.10 yen and set the foundations for the U.S. currency to test the 122-yen level later in New York. The tankan report, released Sunday, disclosed a modest rise in business sentiment, but the increase in the key diffusion index for large manufacturers was below market forecasts.  Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 121.85 yen, up from 120.44 yen at midday Friday. The euro was trading at $1.0710, down from $1.0783 Friday. Sterling changed hands at $1.5995, compared with $1.6036 on Friday.  Although the dollar appeared to struggle with the 122-yen level, perhaps in view of large offers cited at 122.50 yen, technical analysts are looking for yesterday's rally in the dollar to fuel a return in coming days to this year's highs around 124 yen, where the U.S. currency faces an important technical test.
