 Computers Bringing Changes To Basic Business Documents   By By Paul B. Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1987  FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, electronic data interchange has been one of those computer technologies whose payoff always lay just beyond the horizon. Holding out the prospect of paperless business transactions, EDI never quite delivered.  Electronic data interchange is simple in concept: Software translates documents into and then out of a generic form so that companies can perform transactions electronically, even though they use different documents, computers and software. Typically, the technology is used to cover only a dozen or so basic documents, such as purchase orders and invoices. Still, results can be substantial even in such limited applications.  Navistar International Corp., one of the early users, says that EDI made it possible to cut truck inventories by a third, or by $167 million, in the first 18 months of use. Ben Milbrandt, EDI manager, says inventories have been cut to a six-day supply from 33 days during the seven years the truck and engine maker has used EDI; premium payments for rapid shipment of freight have fallen more than 90% to less than $500,000 a year. Mr. Milbrandt says that executing transactions instantaneously has not only speeded up the process but has enabled the company to keep better track of inventory.
