 Poltics & People: Avoiding a Fiscal Train Wreck?   By Hunt, Albert R, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  With the president's State of the Union and then budget proposals coming in the next two-and-a-half weeks, the press, which inexplicably gives this White House an easy ride on these matters, ought to be super-vigilant in assessing the transparency and credibility of the numbers and commitments; both parties generally vow to cut the deficit in half within five years. The Democratic presidential candidates' commitment to return to the fiscal state of the Clinton years doesn't square with their programmatic promises.

"This is our due."  Five-hundred billion to send another man to the moon and then to Mars? "The message is we can afford anything," noted former Republican Congressman John Porter at the Brookings briefing. "That's the wrong message." How about instead spending that money on expanding health care to some of the 43 million uninsured -- over the last year fiscally strapped states have thrown an estimated 1.5 million low- income Americans off the health-care rolls -- and reduce the deficit?
