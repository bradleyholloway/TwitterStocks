 DeBartolo and Bilzerian Didn't Disclose Takeover-Related Activities, SEC Asserts   By By James B. Stewart and Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 1988  Shopping center magnate Edward J. DeBartolo and Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian failed to disclose millions of dollars in loans and secret profit-sharing arrangements related to takeover bids for Hammermill Paper Co. and Cluett-Peabody Co., the Securities and Exchange Commission asserted in court papers.  The statements were contained in an enforcement action filed in a Washington federal court to compel Mr. DeBartolo, his son, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., and entities they control to comply with SEC subpoenas seeking information about their relationships with Mr. Bilzerian.  The SEC's disclosures are the first indication that the government is scrutinizing the DeBartolos, who recently were involved in Campeau Corp.'s takeover of Federated Department Stores. People familiar with the government's inquiries said the government is trying to determine whether the DeBartolos and Mr. Bilzerian entered into any illegal takeover arrangements and whether Mr. Bilzerian was required to publicly disclose his arrangements with the DeBartolos.
