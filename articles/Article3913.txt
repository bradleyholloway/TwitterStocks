 U.S. Inflation Picks Up Speed, Raising Odds of Tighter Credit; Consumer Prices Rose 0.6% In March on Energy Costs; Mixed 'Beige Book' View   By Ip, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2005  Separately, a Federal Reserve survey of business conditions in its 12 districts found "upward price pressures have strengthened, although actual increases to date . . . have generally remained moderate." The Fed's "beige book," released yesterday, added: "Much of the pressure derives from energy costs, although contacts cited the lower dollar and rising costs of building materials as well."  "There are emerging signs of inflation" and "we need to track pricing developments quite closely," Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson said after a speech in North Carolina, while acknowledging "there was possibly a soft patch" in the economy last month.  The Boston district reported "firming prices for telecommunications services;" the Kansas City district said there are shortages of "truck drivers, computer technicians, and both entry-level and experienced workers in the retail, manufacturing, and energy sectors;" and a contact told the Minneapolis district that real estate in Fargo, N.D., is "hot as a pistol."
