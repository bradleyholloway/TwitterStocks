 Industrials Drift Down by 7.46; Woolworth Surge Limits the Loss   By By David Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1988  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.46 to 1980.60. The decline would have been steeper but for a surge in F.W. Woolworth, which rose 8 7/8 to 54 1/8 on 2.3 million shares in the latest instance of the merger mania that has been sweeping through the stock market in recent weeks. An investor group controlled by Herbert H. Haft is interested in acquiring as much as 15% of Woolworth's stock.  Big Board volume expanded to 182.2 million shares from 139.9 million Thursday, before the Good Friday holiday. Yesterday's volume, however, was inflated by heavy dividend-related trading in six telephone and power utilities: BellSouth, Carolina Power & Light, Delmarva Power & Light, Illinois Power, Pacific Telesis Group and Washington Gas Light.  The stock market managed to recover from its early setback, and the Dow Jones industrials briefly showed a gain. But stocks retreated again, sinking to their session lows at midday, and couldn't rebound. Traders said there was little demand from institutional investors except among the utility stocks sought for their high dividend yields.
