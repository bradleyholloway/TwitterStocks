 Divided Capital: Many in Washington Now Find Drug War Isn't a Distant Affair --- The Uninvolved and Affluent In Insulated Parts of City Are Changing Their Views --- Peace Amid Cherry Blossoms   By By David Shribman and Joe Davidson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1989  These are slices of the two worlds of Washington. One is the Washington of the tourist and the cherry blossoms, the sparkling white monuments, the magisterial buildings of government and the world of politics and power in a city that enjoys low unemployment and wide affluence among both whites and blacks.  The other is the Washington that is riddled with drugs and violence and last year had the nation's highest murder rate. It is a world where so many drug users store the mind-altering drug PCP in baby bottles that hospitals now have to treat infants who have been fed the drug by mistake.  But there is a hollowness in all the outcry. True, the rise in drug murders has spurred the sudden civic-mindedness in Washington and has heightened criticism of Mayor Barry. Yet the broader problems that sparked this violence in the first place -- poverty, drug use, the intractable ills of America's inner cities -- aren't new at all. Only the dimension of the problem is different, along with the feeling among this city's affluent class that matters are truly out of hand.
