 India's Cement Makers Shine; Building Spree, Rise in Demand and Share Price Likely Will Go On   By Sabharwal, Binny, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2006  With India's unprecedented construction spree likely to continue and cement supplies tight, analysts say cement shares -- already up sharply this year -- might still have room to rise, as Mumbai's stock market touches new highs in volatile trading. Yesterday, the Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index rose 176.22 points, or 1.5%, to a record 12218.78, as a ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia lifted two of the country's largest generic-drug makers.  Longer term, India's cement market, now the world's second-largest after China's, is bound to get bigger, industry watchers say. In the first three months of 2006, Indian demand increased 11% from the year- earlier period to 141.5 million metric tons. Infrastructure projects consume about 25% of India's cement output, while property developers use about 60%.  ACC shares have risen 85% since the end of 2005. They closed at 989.40 rupees yesterday. Gujarat Ambuja ended yesterday at 122 rupees -- 53% higher than at the start of 2006. Gujarat Ambuja doesn't have much scope for expansion because it is operating at full capacity. ACC, the country's second-biggest producer, might see growth slow by 2008 because its stronghold is in northern India, while most new demand is coming from the country's southern regions.
