 Tokyo's String of Advances Ends With Reports Of a Downturn in Emperor Hirohito's Condition ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1989  News about ailing Emperor Hirohito's condition sent Tokyo share prices lower Thursday, ending a rally that began late last year. Stocks rose, however, in London and Frankfurt.  Share prices first surged in early trading, sustained by a rally on Wall Street and relatively stable exchange rates. But the broad rally quickly ran out of steam following a palace announcement that the 87-year-old monarch's blood pressure fell dangerously low Thursday morning.  The Nikkei index finished at 30183.79, down 59.87 points on the day. The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues fell 7.21 to close at 2368.09. First section volume was estimated at 850 million shares.
