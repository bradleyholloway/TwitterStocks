 Factory Orders Rose Modestly In February   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1992  The Commerce Department said orders rose 0.5% in February to $236.37 billion after a similar 0.5% climb in January. But the two months' figures didn't completely erase December's 3.7% nosedive.  Most of the February increase stemmed from an 8% leap in orders for primary metals. Transportation orders also rebounded somewhat from recent declines.  A 1.4% jump in orders for non-durable goods, the first increase in that category since November, easily offset a 0.3% decline in orders for durable goods, which initially were reported to have climbed 0.1%. Excluding defense goods, new factory orders were up 1%.
