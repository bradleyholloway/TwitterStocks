 Real Time: Is Radiohead's Move Revolutionary?; British Band Releases 'In Rainbows' Online, But Eliminating Labels Is Still Just a Dream Online edition  By Fry, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  In wondering about the answers to those questions, don't expect many other bands to follow Radiohead's lead. When you're a band as big as Thom Yorke and Co., the rules change -- yet even Radiohead isn't completely leaving the old ways behind. "Eliminating the middleman" has become information-age gospel, but however distasteful artists may find middlemen in theory, in practice they're not so easy to do without.  Granted, none of those bands was a musical colossus like Radiohead. But Radiohead won't be the last to try disintermediation: Trent Reznor has said he's ditching his label, Interscope, to sell Nine Inch Nails music directly to fans. Oasis will soon release a single on its Web site, and Jamiroquai is reportedly exploring Web releases. Add it up, and it sounds ominous for the record labels; as one European A&R executive told Time magazine, "if the best band in the world doesn't want a part of us, I'm not sure what's left for this business."  As for Radiohead, they reportedly plan to release "In Rainbows" as a conventional CD next year -- perhaps even with a major label. As the band's management told British radio, Radiohead wants to get "In Rainbows" to a mass marketplace: "That's why we need a record company who have that infrastructure to deliver the CD."
