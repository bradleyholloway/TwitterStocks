 Personal Business: Dot-Com Investors Could Recoup Losses   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2005  The court filing sets guiding principles for determining who should get a payout. Under the "proximity principle," investors who bought shares within 11 trading days after the allegedly conflicted research was issued will receive the fullest payout. An "information principle" reduces the payouts to investors who made larger investments because they have access to more sources of information.  Investors who suffered an unrealized loss also are eligible. Their losses will be calculated based on the average daily price for the stock during the 90 days after the "relevant period of purchase" as specified by the settlement, or the implied loss on the settlement date, whichever is smaller.
