 Deals & Deal Makers: Market Woes Hit Venture Investments   By By Suzanne McGee and Lisa Bransten, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2001  The current year could be the worst year for returns in the 30 years Venture Economics has been keeping track of data, says Jesse Reyes, vice president of Venture Economics. During that period, only 1973 showed industrywide losses for the year as a whole.  On top of that, dozens of venture-backed companies have shut down or dramatically scaled back their businesses. For example, both Ironbridge Networks Inc., a Lexington, Mass. company that was building equipment for sending data around the Internet at very high speeds, and group buying service Mercata Inc. shut down earlier this year. Ironbridge had raised $85 million in venture financing. Mercata had raised about $80 million from investors including Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures, Highland Capital Partners and Global Retail Partners.  Venture firms that specialize in investing in later-stage companies saw their returns hurt the most. Venture Economics says those funds saw average losses of 8.1% in the fourth quarter, compared with average losses of 4.8% for funds specializing in "seed" financing of brand-new start-ups. That is because although later-stage investors face less business risk -- the company's model is more tried and tested -- in the last year or two they often have paid hefty prices to participate in final private-financing rounds. The expectation was that an IPO would follow quickly at yet another markup in price. Increasingly, that hasn't been possible.
