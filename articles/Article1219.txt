 Patent Firm Lays Global Plans; Intellectual Ventures Is Seeking $2 Billion As Strategy Shifts   By Buckman, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2007  "We want to work with companies that are really going to develop the technology, and I'm not sure if they will or not," said Katharine Ku, who heads Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing. "They keep saying they're not a litigation play necessarily, but we'll just see."  "There are a lot of folks in the world who have the fundamental skills and educational background, and talent, to be an inventor," said Mr. [Nathan Myhrvold], a mathematician and physicist. But these people "don't have a set of folks providing additional expertise and capital to help them get that traction. That's our job, to help inventors get traction."  The patent-holding firm could "send letters to big companies saying, 'We have 800 patents that cover your business,'" said Ron Laurie, managing director of Inflexion Point Strategy LLC, a Palo Alto, Calif., investment bank specializing in intellectual property. That is a "game changer," he said, because companies usually get warned over just a few patents. Faced with such massive numbers, he said, "nobody can risk going to court, and they're just going to write you a check."
