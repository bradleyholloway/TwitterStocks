 Ban Could Make Philip Morris Quit Smoking   By By Gordon Fairclough, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2002  For Philip Morris, New York City's proposed law goes beyond business. It's personal. Walking into Philip Morris's headquarters today is a bit like traveling back in time to the 1950s, when smoking was widespread. From Mr. [Louis C. Camilleri] on down, many of the people who work in Philip Morris's headquarters smoke -- in their offices, in meetings, in the cafeteria. Even the restrooms have ashtrays, and cigarettes are available on trays in the executive dining rooms. (Smoking is prohibited, though, in the gym, clinic and copy rooms.)  Furthermore, unlike in years past when tobacco companies denied the health risks of smoking, Philip Morris acknowledges that cigarettes are harmful and spends millions of dollars delivering that message. The company is preparing to change its name in January to Altria Group Inc. in an attempt to give itself an identity separate from its tobacco holdings and draw attention to its ownership of Kraft Foods, the country's largest food company. Creating a stink over the mayor's plans will only link Philip Morris more closely with cigarettes and give its critics another reason to claim that the name change and the company's repentant attitude are simply spin.
