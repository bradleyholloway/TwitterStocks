 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2007  Yahoo Inc. acquired the assets of MyBlogLog, a five-person Orlando, Fla., company that connects bloggers and readers in like-minded communities. The move is another in a line of acquisitions of so- called Web 2.0 companies that are part of Yahoo's push into "social media." It is a strategy that leverages Yahoo's large user base and that the company believes can give it an edge over its machine-focused archrival Google Inc.
