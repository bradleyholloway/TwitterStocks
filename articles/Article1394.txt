 Expanded Air France Faces Weak Market --- With Purchases Complete, The Hard Part Begins   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1990  "This reorganization has been awaited for 30 years," says Bernard Attali, chairman since 1988 of the state-owned Air France Groupe, which now includes Union de Transports Aeriens and Air Inter.  And circumstances could hardly be less auspicious. Sluggish traffic growth, sky-high fuel prices and the weakening economic outlook are clobbering the airline industry. Air France itself lost 170 million francs ($34 million) in the first half of 1990, compared with net profit of 83 million francs in the year-earlier half. The company has delayed non-aircraft investments, adopted a hiring freeze and is cutting costs. Mr. Attali won't rule out a loss for the full year. "We're in this restructuring at the same time the airline business is crossing a difficult period," he says.  Labor problems aside, things looked more secure two years ago when the battle to control the French aviation market began in earnest. It was sparked when UTA filed a complaint with the EC Commission challenging Paris's refusal to let it fly to other European destinations. UTA, then owned by the industrial group Chargeurs SA, was limited by French policy to flying only to Africa and southeast Asia. While the EC dithered, UTA bought shares in domestic airline Air Inter -- itself largely limited to domestic routes -- and was matched share for share by Air France.
