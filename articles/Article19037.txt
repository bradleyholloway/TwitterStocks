 Benign Inflation Reports Reassure Bond Investors   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1998  Fed fear dominated the bond market early in the week after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve had adopted a tilt toward raising rates. That sent bond prices into a tailspin, driving the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction of prices, as high as 6.09%.  But reassuring data released on Thursday and Friday demonstrated that the economy's strength has yet to lead to inflation, either in wages or prices. The surprisingly benign data enabled the market to rally, sending the yield back down to 5.93% on Friday, essentially unchanged from the week earlier's 5.94% yield.  While consumer spending has been notoriously volatile the past year -- growing as fast as 5.3% during the first quarter of last year, before falling to 0.9% in the second quarter -- if it continues to surge, inflation could be right around the corner, many economists fear, unless the Fed raises rates. "The consumer is two-thirds of GDP, and as the consumer goes, so goes the economy," says Robert Brusca, the chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York. "There have to be concerns, even if you're a `New Economy' adherent."
