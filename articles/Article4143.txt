 A Clot-Dissolving Drug Proves Effective In Federal Tests of Heart-Attack Patients   By By David Stipp, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  In an unusual step, the researchers have canceled plans for a large nationwide study of TPA, or tissue-type plasminogen activator, made with recombinant-DNA techniques by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif. TPA, especially in an improved version used since last August, worked so well in preliminary trials that the researchers believe they now couldn't ethically withhold it from patients. So they won't go through with a large study in which patients receiving TPA would be compared with a control group not getting the drug.  While strengthening the case for TPA, National Institutes of Health scientists express mixed feelings about forgoing further TPA study. "I would be happier if the evidence on TPA were buttoned up a little firmer," says Eugene Braunwald, a Harvard Medical School professor and the chairman of NIH's so-called TIMI study group (an acronym for Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction). In supporting the canceling of further TPA study, he says, "I wavered for three or four months and didn't come lightly to the decision."  Dr. Braunwald replies that "right now" TPA seems to be the best clot dissolver and that alternatives will get their fair share of NIH attention later. He says the new version of TPA worked "very substantially" better than the old one in tests with 200 patients. In fact, says a researcher familiar with the NIH tests, the new TPA cleared blocked arteries in about 80% of heart-attack patients. In a TIMI report last year, NIH scientists recorded a 65% success rate with the old TPA and a 35% rate with streptokinase.
