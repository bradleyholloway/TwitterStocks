 Have They Got A Sales Tax For You   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1998  Don't laugh. This crowd means business, politically speaking. They've massed pollsters, flacks and big-name economists -- former Fed governor Wayne Angell and Harvard's Dale Jorgenson -- in support. They plan to dump $8 million of their own money, and maybe more, in TV and radio ads in 32 markets in the coming weeks to tap public fury at the tax code and promote a 23% national sales tax to replace the whole mess.  Watching behind Mr. Linbeck is his boyhood Houston pal, Bill Archer, who happens to be the chief House tax writer. He also may be the most underestimated member of Congress. He was thought to be outgunned on tax reform by House Majority Leader Dick Armey's flat tax.  But Mr. Archer is counting on the Linbeck sales-tax campaign to replace the flat tax as the main tax-reform vehicle. Republicans can then unite behind it as a "mini-Contract With America" in 1998, he says. If enough new members are elected on the issue, the poll-reading President Clinton will be forced to deal in 1999. Mr. Archer could thus put his stamp on radical tax reform before he retires after 2000.
