 - Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1992  The advisory committee, officially to aid in the transition but known derisively in Hong Kong as the "Gang of 40," is composed mainly of business tycoons, conservative politicians and China sympathizers. Liberal legislators termed the appointments another attempt by Beijing to strip the territory of autonomy.  Beijing recently has been increasingly vocal about its displeasure with political developments in Hong Kong. Doubt lingers in the colony that China will honor its pledge in a 1984 Sino-British agreement to guarantee Hong Kong and its capitalistic system a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after 1997.  Japan plans to accelerate its phase-out of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, following a U.S. decision to ban the chemicals by 1995. But Tokyo expressed doubt about satisfying Western industrial nations' pleas to speed up discontinuance of all CFCs, as they include a cleaning agent for metals widely used by smaller industries in Japan. Tokyo will present its phase-out plans at a November meeting of signatories of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, under which CFC production and use will be banned by the year 2005. CFCs are used mainly as coolants, aerosol propellants and semiconductor cleaning agents.
