 Monthly Mutual Funds Review; Fundamentals: NAV Gazing: Useful, but Confusing; Net Asset Value Can Offer Investors a View of Fund's Day-to-Day Performance   By Oster, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2003  Alas, things often aren't equal in the world of NAVs, making net asset values an imperfect measure of fund performance. That's because a fund's NAV is reduced any time it makes a distribution to shareholders of income received from the fund's holdings or when it earns capital gains garnered from the sale of winning investments. So if a fund with a $10 NAV distributes $1 to shareholders, the fund's NAV falls to $9.  Sometimes funds have to use what amounts to a guess when valuing their holdings. That's been true for some funds that focus on fast- growing start-up companies whose shares aren't traded publicly. Van Wagoner Capital Management, a firm whose funds posted some of the best returns -- and subsequently some of the biggest losses -- in the technology bull market and its wake, was one of the better known investors in private technology companies. A December 2001 Wall Street Journal article noted that Van Wagoner allegedly didn't lower prices of many of the private technology firms in the firm's funds in 2000, when many technology stock prices plummeted.  Once a portfolio's value has been determined, further calculations may be needed as funds can adjust the figure by deducting various fees they are entitled to collect. For example, investors don't pay for fund-management fees and a fund's marketing expenses by making out a check. Instead, these expenses are continuously subtracted from the fund's portfolio's value before the NAV calculation is made.
