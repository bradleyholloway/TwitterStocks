 GE's Net Rises 20% on Strong Economy --- Forecasts Edged as NBC, Power Systems Shine; Total Revenue Up 24%   By By Matt Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2000  The company reported net income of $2.59 billion, up from $2.16 billion a year earlier, on a 24% rise in revenue. Net income per diluted share rose to 78 cents -- a penny over analysts' consensus estimate, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial -- from 65 cents.  Excepting its finance arm, GE Capital, which accounts for about half of GE's revenue, the company posted top-line growth of 21%. Among the strongest performers: GE Power Systems, which, with an 88% revenue gain, surpassed GE Aircraft Engines to become the company's single-largest nonfinancial business as measured by revenue; GE Medical Systems; and NBC, continuing to benefit from strong ads.  GE shares have been trading near 52-week highs in recent weeks, since the company forecast its quarterly earnings, but have fluctuated with the tumultuous markets of recent days. In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were at $150.3125, off $6.1875 on a generally down day in the markets. GE shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposed 3-for-1 stock split later this month at the company's annual meeting.
