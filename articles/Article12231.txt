 New Boss Tries To Fix Image Of Box Energy   By By Patrick Barta, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1997  Just ask James A. Watt, who agreed five months ago to leave Seagull E&P Inc. to serve as president and chief operating officer of the outfit best known for the litigious bent of its four main shareholders, the bickering Box brothers. With some significant assets and about $250 million in proved and probable reserves, Box Energy, he contends, has the potential to become "just another boring, money-making oil company" in a state chock full of them.  Mr. Watt has his sights set on a classic Texas Oil Pach coup: turning a bust into a boom. Last week, he announced that the company had made its first acquisition since the early 1970s with it purchase of an interest in six producing onshore fields along the Texas Gulf Coast from Smith Production Co. The price of the deal is still being negotiated, but it's likely to be at least $11.5 million. The purchase confirmed for some investors that Mr. Watt is serious about shifting the company's attention away from the filing of legal briefs to the business of making money.  Indeed, industry analysts and executives say that by hiring the 47-year-old Mr. Watt -- who has credibility in the energy business and a Rolodex full of contacts -- Box Energy took a big step toward rehabilitating its image. Mr. Watt is the first nonfamily member to hold the post of president at Box Energy, and the first high-ranking official with technical training. "They needed someone in there who knew the oil and gas business," says Bud Wilson, president of Houston-based Amicus Oil Inc. and a longtime friend of Mr. Watt's. "They have that kind of person now."
