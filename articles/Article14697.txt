 Montedison Unveils Plan to Transform Enimont Venture   By By Guy Collins, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1990  Montedison S.p.A. Chairman Raul Gardini unveiled an ambitious plan to transform the troubled Italian chemical joint venture Enimont S.p.A. into a world leader in plastics, fluor chemicals and special elastomers and rescue it from the damaging management disputes that have threatened its future.  Mr. Gardini proposed to shareholders that Montedison should transfer its U.S. polypropylene subsidiary Himont Inc., its fluor unit Ausimont N.V. and other small businesses together valued at an estimated five trillion lire, to Enimont. This would leave the remainder of the capital increase to be raised through cash subscription to an issue of shares and convertible bonds.
