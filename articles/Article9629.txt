 Did You Miss the Next Big Thing?   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2003  Can the surge continue? Some point to VocalTec, an Israeli company that is a pioneer of the business, as a sign of caution. The rush into VOIP stocks catapulted shares of VocalTec from under 50 cents a share at the beginning of the year to $7.60 in July. But as the stock rose, so did expectations for the company, making it harder to impress the market. As a result, VocalTec's stock has drooped back to about $4.40, raising concerns that others who have soared could face similar resistance if they don't trump growing expectations.  At the same time, Cisco is a leading supplier of VOIP phone systems to businesses, selling about $250 million of VOIP equipment and phones in the third quarter of this year, according to Eastern Management Group, a telecom-research firm. Cisco is expected to rack up $1 billion a year in revenue from the business next year, however, bolstering its bottom line. Avaya is a leading seller of VOIP phone systems to businesses and its shares have room to grow, according to Krishna Rangarajan, an analyst at CRT Capital Group.  In just the past month Roxio stock has fallen to about $5 as investors focus on the fact that Apple Computer (AAPL) and some other big names -- including Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Microsoft and Sony (SNE) -- all will be major players in online music sales. That will make it difficult for Roxio, and some urge caution on the stock. At the same time, profits on online music sales are thin so far. Says a hedge-fund manager: "I would be scared of Roxio. There's just too much competition."
