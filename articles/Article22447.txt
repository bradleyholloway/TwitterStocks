 Big Board Loosens Further Rule Covering Delisting   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1998  The new version of the exchange's longstanding Rule 500, approved yesterday by the exchange's board, follows criticism from the Nasdaq Stock Market that the original revision, approved last year, was still too strict and a barrier to competition among marketplaces.  In its current, unrevised form, Rule 500, adopted in the 1930s, requires two-thirds of a company's shareholders to approve a decision to delist with no more than 10% objecting. Critics considered that an almost impossible threshold to meet, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had urged the Big Board to change the rule.
