 Numbers Game: How MiniScribe Got Its Auditor's Blessing on Questionable Sales   By Berton, Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1992  The complexities surrounding an audit of computer firm MiniScribe Corp by Coopers & Lybrand is described. As it later turned out, MiniScribe had deep financial problems that it attempted to conceal in questionable financial reports. Whether or not Coopers was itself deceived, or was a party to the deceit, is still being debated. However, in 1991, Coopers settled with MiniScribe's bondholders for between $45 million and $50 million, and is a defendant in another suit involving bondholders.
