 British Gas Seeks Solution To Contracts --- Bank Bailout Is Possibility In Solving Woes Over `Take or Pay' Accords   By By Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1996  British Gas PLC said it is considering a number of options, including a possible bank bailout, in its efforts to resolve a dispute involving more than #40 billion ($62 billion) in gas contracts.  Though British Gas said it is pursuing the options, analysts raised doubts about how effective they would be in dealing with the contracts, which were signed by the one-time monopoly before it was privatized in the mid-1980s. Gas producers have vowed to hold British Gas to the contracts, echoing a standoff that plagued the U.S. gas market a decade ago.  In addition to pursuing a bank loan, British Gas said it may ask the government to impose a new tariff on the price of gas, which would be paid by gas distributors and industrial users. The company said it is studying other solutions from Canada and Western Australia as precedents, as well as the U.S., which it describes as a system of "torn-up contracts."
