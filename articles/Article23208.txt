 Russia Denies China Role in Yukos Deal   By White, Gregory L, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2005  Russian authorities auctioned Yugansk off in December to help cover $28 billion in back-tax claims against Yukos. An unknown Russian company placed the only bid at the auction and was taken over within days by Rosneft. For weeks, officials were silent on how Rosneft, a midsize oil company with a heavy debt load that had turned to partners to finance its shares in other projects, had come up with the $9.3 billion price for Yugansk.  Yesterday, Rosneft denied the Chinese payment was related to the Yugansk sale, saying it needed the $6 billion for unspecified "capital-intensive projects." Rosneft said the oil for the China shipments would come from its other subsidiaries, not Yugansk. A spokesman declined to be more specific or comment on where the company got the money for Yugansk. The Russian state bank that was the agent on the Chinese transaction, Vneshekonombank, also denied the funds were related to Yugansk.
