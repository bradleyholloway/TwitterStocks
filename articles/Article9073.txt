 In 3 Galleries: Sigmar Polke   By By Francine Prose, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  New York -- Sigmar Polke's early drawings suggest the notebook doodles of the brightest eighth-grader in the class -- perhaps the brightest eighth-grader who will ever be in the class. Like his paintings, the German artist's works on paper convey the guileless clarity of a child's imagination and vision, the barbed accuracy of a pre-adolescent's social criticism, and a convincingly puerile (or adolescent) chemistry of energy, innocence, mischief, silliness -- together with the more calculated and willful impulse to test, disturb and provoke.  This spring, three separate shows offer a chance to trace the development of that vision over the past 30 years. The Museum of Modern Art's "Sigmar Polke: Works on Paper, 1963-1974" (on view until June 16, when it travels to Hamburg) contains approximately 180 drawings, gouaches and sketchbook pages, many of which come from the artist's studio and have never been seen in this country before. A smaller exhibition, at the Michael Werner Gallery (until May 15) contains about two dozen watercolors and drawings, mostly from the 1980s, while the Knoedler Gallery's show of 25 pieces, all in mixed media on paper and all done within the past two years, will be on display until April 24.
