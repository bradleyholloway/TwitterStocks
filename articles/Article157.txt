Rodney Peete has the measles and may not play in Southern Cal's showdown with U.C.L.A. on Saturday for the Pacific-10 Conference title and Rose Bowl berth. ''I'm not sure on Rodney's availability for the U.C.L.A. game,'' the Trojans' coach, Larry Smith, said yesterday regarding the condition of the U.S.C. quarterback. ''We'll go ahead with the basic game plan that we've prepared. This is something that we have to be good enough as a team to overcome. We're a team first, although Rodney is a very valuable component of our team. If it means we have to play Rodney's backup, Pat O'Hara, we have a lot of confidence in him.'' Peete, a senior who ranks among the nation's passing leaders this season, first felt ill last week. He still had one of his finest games in last Saturday's 50-0 rout of Arizona State, but has been unable to practice this week. He had been suffering from flu-like symptoms, but his illness was diagnosed as measles yesterday. Peete has guided the Trojans to a 9-0 record.(AP)  Photo of Rodney Peete (NYT)  To see the full article, subscribe here.
