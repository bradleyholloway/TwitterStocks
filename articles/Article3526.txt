 Your Money Matters (A Special Report); Home Rundown: A look at the pros and cons of different types of mortgages -- and which one may be best for you now   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  Thanks to a flatter yield curve, the benefits of taking out a hybrid ARM are smaller than normal. Rates on a "10-1 hybrid," which carries a fixed rate for the first 10 years and then adjusts annually, currently average 6.26%. That's the same as the rate on 30-year fixed- rate mortgages.  Borrowers can lower their rate by choosing an ARM with a shorter fixed period. Rates on a hybrid ARM that's fixed for the first seven years currently average 6.07%. That's 0.19 percentage point less than the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and less than half the savings borrowers normally get for picking this product. With a hybrid ARM, "you're taking on some risk, but getting very little reward," says Mr. [Keith Gumbinger].  with the gap in rates narrow to nonexistent right now, borrowers may want to consider taking a conservative stance -- picking a hybrid that has a fixed rate for seven years even if they expect to move in five, or choosing a fixed-rate loan over a 10-year ARM. "It's one of the ways to protect yourself from the uncertainty of what might happen in the housing market," says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com, a provider of financial rate information in North Palm Beach, Fla.
