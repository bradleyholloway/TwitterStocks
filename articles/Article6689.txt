 New York Times Details Deceit By Its Reporter   By By Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  The Times didn't appear to heed multiple clear warnings about Mr. [Jayson Blair]'s past inaccuracies from his supervisors, something the newspaper attributed to a failure of communication among editors. Jonathan Landman, the paper's metropolitan editor and at one time Mr. Blair's boss, was among a number of managers who knew about problems with Mr. Blair's work. Mr. Landman didn't support Mr. Blair's promotion to full reporter in January 2001, and in April 2002 he e-mailed newsroom administrators saying, "We have to stop Jayson from writing for the Times. Right now." The next day, Mr. Blair received a formal reprimand and he took a brief leave, according to the Times article.  When Mr. Blair returned from his leave, the paper said, his performance improved. Eventually, Mr. Blair was recruited to help with sniper coverage, in part because he was familiar with Washington's suburbs. The Times's two top editors knew of problems with Mr. Blair's prior work but didn't tell National Editor Jim Roberts because Mr. Blair had improved.  Editors at the paper didn't ask Mr. Blair to reveal his sources on two significant sniper-related stories, which appeared at the time to be big scoops but also drew denials from law-enforcement officials. Mr. Roberts and Nick Fox, another of Mr. Blair's editors on the sniper story, "said in interviews last week that the [law enforcement officials'] statements would have raised far more serious concerns in their minds had they been aware of Mr. Blair's history of inaccuracy," the Times said. Mr. Roberts said in the Times account that Mr. Landman told him of Mr. Blair's problems with accuracy a while after those stories ran, but that he didn't tell his own deputies.
