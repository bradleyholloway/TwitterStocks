 Barron's Insight: Global Infrastructure Needs Will Power Growth for GE   By Racanelli, Vito J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  GE's total infrastructure business in India will increase by 30% this year to more than $2 billion, says Mr. [Jeffrey Immelt]. It could "grow at that level for a number of years," he adds.  Mr. Immelt sees GE's infrastructure revenue -- 30% of its total -- rising by 10% a year in the next five to 10 years, with the overseas portion of sales increasing by 10% to 15% "for a long time."  "GE has been underappreciated," says Larry Puglia, manager of T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX). Mr. Puglia's fund holds GE stock, and bought more recently at around $35.
