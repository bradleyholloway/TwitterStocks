 Bond Prices Close Slightly Higher as Investors Snap Up Treasurys at Their Highest Yield of '99   By By Brian Blackstone and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1999  Bond prices rebounded from recent weakness to finish slightly higher as investors stepped in to buy Treasurys sporting their highest yields of the year. But traders remain on edge ahead of a speech today by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that could hint at a coming increase in interest rates.  "If (Mr. Greenspan) characterizes global growth as weak and defends current monetary policy" then the bond market should rally from current levels, said Hugh Whelan, vice president of fixed-income instruments at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford, Conn.  "People are really nervous about the speech and whether the Fed will be adopting a tightening bias, and if there are indications (of higher rates) we will break through 5.75% (yield on the long bond)," said David Ging, Treasury market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc.
