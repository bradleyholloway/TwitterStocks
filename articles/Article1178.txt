 Alliance Boots CEO Resigns   By Cauchi, Marietta, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2007  The announcement follows the GBP 11 billion ($22.3 billion) buyout of the pharmacy chain, backed by U.S. private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Mr. [Pessina], an Italian billionaire and Alliance Boots's deputy chairman.  Analysts said they weren't surprised at Mr. [Richard Baker]'s departure because of his failure to improve performance at Boots, both before and after its merger with Alliance UniChem.  Mr. Pessina, 65 years old, was CEO of Alliance UniChem and was behind the pan-European drug distributor's merger with U.K. health and beauty retailer Boots Group PLC in July 2006.
