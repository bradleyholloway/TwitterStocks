To the Editor:  In his essay ''Up From the Garret: Success Then and Now'' (Jan. 27) Ronald Sukenick is correct to note the ascent of leftist, ''Beat'' and 60's writers out of the ''underground'' and into the literary and commercial middle class. He is right too in saying that the underground or ''true avant-garde'' is ''indispensable.'' Nevertheless, he is wrong to suggest its present ''evaporation'' because ''The genius is no longer in the garret. And if s/he is, s/ he is no genius because for him or her there can be no alternative to quick fame.'' The genius-inhabited garret - avant-garde or front line - and underground remain; only their tenants and tenets have changed.  They are not in sight precisely because they are truly underground, and not by their choice, but forced there by the literary power of now popular writers like those Mr. Sukenick recognizes: Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow, E. L. Doctorow, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Diane Wakoski, their editors and university professors. Mr. Sukenick is also right to question the ''genius'' (though not the sanity) of younger writers who consider living in the garret or underground ''a bogus spiritual commitment'' essentially because they are ''frightened of failure'' or unable ''to deal with success.'' But for deservedly popular, talented older writers, as well as market-savvy, talented younger writers to dominate the literary scene is nothing new. Such was the case when the work of leftist or Beat writers could only live underground. Now they have emerged into the light of recognition - awards, grants, great jobs, plenty of publishing opportunities, powerful friends, etc. It is curious that they might still want to claim to be avant-garde or revolutionary, as Mr. Sukenick notes, but more curious is a claim like Mr. Ginsberg's: that there was no ''ideological-conceptual thing'' in the first place, that the underground or avant-garde or embattled garret didn't exist. Most curious is that the genius in the garret  now  might not exist because Mr. Sukenick doesn't see him or her. They do exist. Their names and characteristics? They're not yet ready for book reviews. CHARLES CANTALUPO  New Ringgold, Pa.
