 Business Brief: Europe's Antitrust Chief May Expand Probe of Accounting Firms' Merger Plans   By By Elizabeth MacDonald and Brian Coleman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1998  Europe's antitrust chief said he expects to expand his investigation of the proposed mergers of four Big Six accounting and consulting firms, a sign the mergers could face delays and even changes from regulators.  In a recent interview, Karel Van Miert, antitrust commissioner for the European Union Commission, said "it's very likely" he'll extend his investigation of Ernst & Young's planned merger with KPMG Peat Marwick and Coopers & Lybrand's proposed combination with Price Waterhouse. The initial inquiry, lasting about one month, is nearly over and any extension would push it into a full-blown, four-month investigation. Mr. Van Miert said he will announce his decision soon, but declined further comment.  Ernst & Young and KPMG officially notified European regulators on Dec. 23 of their plans to create the world's biggest accounting and consulting firm, with $18.3 billion in combined annual revenue. Ernst & Young Chairman Philip Laskawy said he expected prolonged European scrutiny. Timothy Roberts, a KPMG spokesman in London, said: "We have not been officially notified yet that it would go to the full four-month period, but we would not be surprised that that would be the case."
