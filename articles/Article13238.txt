 Moving the Market: Deloitte Pays More Than $200 Million to Insurers   By Mark Maremont and Miho Inada, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2006  Deloitte quietly settled with all parties in September under terms that remain confidential. Facing legal claims related to its audit work for other scandal-plagued clients, including Adelphia Communications Corp. and Italy's Parmalat SpA, Deloitte has tried to keep the Fortress settlement under wraps. But details have leaked out in the financial filings of the Japanese insurers.  In the latest such disclosure, Sompo Japan Insurance Inc. said in a financial filing that it booked a special pretax gain related to the Fortress case of 11.4 billion yen, currently valued at $98.4 million, in the period from April to September. The Deloitte settlement was the only such payment made during that period. The Sompo filing was made in late November but wasn't publicized at the time.  Deborah Harrington, a Deloitte spokeswoman, said she couldn't comment on the settlement terms, other than to say the "suit had been settled amicably." Deloitte has previously defended its audit work for Fortress as proper.
