 Subplot: Networks Let White House Vet Shows to Push Antidrug Line   By By Glenn Burkins and Joe Flint, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2000  Yesterday, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy confirmed that for more than a year it has been rewarding TV networks for using antidrug messages in some of their most popular shows. Under a complex accounting plan, commercial slots allocated for the government's cut-rate antidrug ads can be sold at full price to other sponsors if network shows include antidrug messages that pass government muster.  So far, the government says, the antidrug themes have found their way into such highly rated shows as "ER," "Chicago Hope" and "Home Improvement." In some cases, networks submitted scripts to the drug czar's office for review before the shows aired. But many of the specifics of how the federal government collaborated with the networks are unclear. The arrangement was first reported on Salon.com, a Web magazine.  But the TV networks and Bob Weiner, a spokesman for federal drug czar Barry McCaffrey, said there is nothing unseemly about the program. The collaboration with the networks began after federal lawmakers approved a five-year, multimillion-dollar media buy for the White House drug-control office, which Mr. McCaffrey directs, in 1997. The office approached the networks about buying advertising time.
