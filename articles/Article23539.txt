 Cross Country: California Burning   By Navarrette, Ruben, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2007  Early on in the crisis, local journalists received an anonymous and remarkably uniformed email definitively blaming the devastation on "illegal campfires set in the forest routes that illegal aliens use to invade our country" and "the 'soft on illegal aliens' policies of our President and the Senate." Other comments came from the San Diego Minutemen, who were upset with Bill O'Reilly for dismissing the notion that the fires were set by illegal immigrants on his radio show.  Speaking of employment, as the flames approached and plumes of smoke filled the air, human-rights activists tried to lure immigrant farm workers out of the fields for their own safety. But, in a story chronicled by ABC News's "20/20," at least one tomato farmer refused to order his workers to leave and wouldn't guarantee their jobs if they did. Instead, the farmer told the workers, it was their choice about whether to stay or go. And so the laborers covered their faces with bandanas and kept right on picking tomatoes.  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger spent a lot of time in San Diego during the crisis. At one point, he made his way over to Qualcomm Stadium. He shook hands with evacuees and asked if they had everything they needed. Gov. Schwarzenegger got rave reviews from the media, and rightly so. It was a shining moment for our action-hero governor. But on the immigration angle, he was more like a silent-picture star. Although he has staked out a position in the middle of the road on the immigration issue, and has offered calming and sensible views in a state where you don't often hear that sort of thing, the governor steered clear of any mention of immigrants or how they were being affected by the disaster.
