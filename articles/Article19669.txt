 Thinking Things Over: The Stop-Dean Candidate: Hillary   By Bartley, Robert L, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2003  "Unlike others in that body now seeking the presidency," Mr. [Howard Dean] taunts, he'd have voted against the Iraq war resolution if he'd been in the Senate. Sen. John Kerry, eyeing the New Hampshire primary, has buckled to the left. Rep. Dick Gephardt, eyeing the Iowa caucuses, now castigates President [Jeb Bush] for "chest-thumping unilateralism" and "momentary machismo." The same little drama is now repeating itself on the economy, with Mr. Dean advocating repealing the Bush tax cuts wholesale, and complaining that Mr. Kerry wants to keep the "middle- class" parts.  Sen. Joe Lieberman has criticized Mr. Dean, along with Mr. Kerry and Mr. Gephardt, for "disquieting zeal" in opposing the war against Saddam. But while still leading the national polls, he's been falling. And also dragging in the contributions race; it seems some potential Jewish donors feel the current Middle East crisis is not "the right time" for a Jewish president. More fundamentally, though, ardent caucus-goers and primary voters really do want "disquieting zeal."  Not of course that they like Saddam Hussein, it's just that they were seared by Vietnam. To take the name of one of their Web sites, they haven't been able to "move on." For them, Mr. Dean is an apt champion. Growing up as a stockbroker's son on New York's Park Avenue, he shared a room with his brother Charlie, 16 months his junior. Thirty years ago Charlie was captured and executed by the Communists in Laos. The elder brother admits to "survivor's guilt" and says he had grief counseling during the 1980s. Charlie traveled as a civilian and had been active in the 1972 McGovern campaign, but after his capture the U.S. military listed him as a POW/MIA. Mr. Dean told Newsweek, "I don't happen to believe it, but for all I know he was in the CIA."
