 Cattle Futures Rise to Two-Week Highs On Strong Demand From Retail Buyers   By By Daniel Rosenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1998  Cattle futures climbed to their highest closes this month, helped by what some analysts called "phenomenal" beef demand.

The February contract has gained 3.5% since it hit a life-of-contract low on Monday.
