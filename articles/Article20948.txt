 NASD Disciplines Three Member Firms, Seven People It Charged With Violations   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1986  The NASD, the self-regulatory arm of the over-the-counter securities market, said it expelled Norquay Taggart & Associates, Las Vegas, Nev., from membership and fined the firm $40,000. The NASD also barred from membership two of the firm's employees, Veryl Norquay and Frances Jane Radley, and fined them $40,000 and $35,000, respectively.  The sanctions were based on the NASD's findings that Norquay Taggart failed to maintain adequate minimum capital and accurate records and filed false financial statements with the NASD. The firm also didn't disclose to customers when it was acting as a principal in trades, and didn't register two individuals as principals, the NASD said.  Similar charges were levied against Mr. Norquay and Ms. Radley. Company officials couldn't be reached for comment, nor could Mr. Norquay or Ms. Radley.
