 As Fed Acts, Tyco, Exxon Mobil Fall; GM and Ford Shares Gain As Decline in April Sales Leaves Investors Unfazed   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  Stocks lost steam soon after the Fed's rate-increase announcement. But there was "a last-minute bit of short covering" that pushed up stocks near the close, when the Fed amended its public statement, said Michael Panzner, head of sales trading at Rabo Securities. "But investors are likely to remain confused because the Fed's policy statement still sends a mixed message on inflation and the state of the economy."  Vishay Intertechnology rose 1.24, or 12%, to 11.87. First-quarter earnings fell, but the electronic-component maker's guidance for second-quarter sales is above Wall Street's projection.  Kos Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq) rose 4.27, or 8.5%, to 54.29. First- quarter earnings exceeded analysts' estimates. The pharmaceutical company also announced a deal with Biovail to acquire two Biovail antihypertension drugs and the sales and marketing rights to a third antihypertension drug. Biovail gained 33 cents, or 2.4%, to 14.28.
