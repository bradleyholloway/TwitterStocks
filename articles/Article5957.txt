 China Imprisons Daughter Of a Martyr for Falun Gong --- Her Fate Fits a Pattern Of Beijing's Efforts To Crush Movement   By By Charles Hutzler, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2001  Police in the eastern city of Weifang ordered Zhang Xueling's punishment on April 24, sending her to the Wang Village labor camp in the nearby city of Zibo, a Falun Gong spokeswoman in New York and the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said yesterday. Her alleged crime, the Hong Kong group said, was "using a cult to undermine the implementation of law" -- a charge police frequently use to detain Falun Gong followers.  The death marked a turning point for Ms. Zhang. Initially supportive of the ban, she had grown quietly doubtful about the crackdown, finding the government's portrayal of Falun Gong as a ruthless cult at odds with what she had seen of her mother's circle of practitioners. Her mother gone, Ms. Zhang repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- petitioned the police and government to issue a death certificate.
