 JDS Board Buys Stock; Some See Mixed Signals --- Purchases Suggest Optimism But Are Noteworthy in Part Because They Are Unusual   By By Tony Cooke, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2002  "It looks like it's the largest group-buying we've seen to date at this company," said Kevin Schwenger, insider research analyst for Thomson Financial. A spokesman for JDS Uniphase declined to comment on the recent insider transactions.  Mr. [Michael Painchaud] said the buying is particularly noteworthy because it has been so rare at JDS Uniphase. By his firm's method of counting open-market transactions, fewer than 5% of the insider transactions at JDS Uniphase during the past 10 years have been purchases -- and nearly half of those purchases took place in the recent string of open-market buys.
