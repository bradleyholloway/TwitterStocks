 World Wire [2]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1993  Georgia abandoned the Russian ruble and declared a temporary coupon the Caucasus republic's only legal tender. But merchants continued to accept the ruble, and some goods were available only for rubles or hard currency. Georgia decided last week on discontinuing use of the ruble after Russia invalidated pre-1993 ruble notes. Moscow later relaxed the terms of its decree, making it easier to exchange old rubles for new ones. In April, ruble-short Georgia began injecting the coupons into the money supply to keep up with the government payroll. Backed only by the Georgian economy, one of the weakest among the former Soviet republics, the coupon was unpopular. It is worthless outside Georgia. Its value has plummeted to seven coupons to the Russian ruble.  Thousands of miners in Romania began a strike over pay. Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu rejected an appeal by the 250,000-member union for a meeting, saying the government couldn't raise its offer of $200 a month, made last week when the union first sought $630, then cut that to $250. Miners are paid about $150 a month, far exceeding the Romanian average of $80. The government warned of danger to the economy if miners' demands were met and other workers also sought high pay. The powerful National Council of Free Unions, with more than 3.5 million members, said the miners had gone too far.
