 Regional Report: Cross Country   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2001  At issue are fees levied on cable companies that the companies then pass on to their subscribers. Under federal law, communities can levy franchise fees of up to 5% of the companies' gross revenues, which comprise subscription payments plus ancillary revenues such as advertising and home-shopping commissions. Cable companies can recover the fees from subscribers, but typically passed on to customers only the portion of the fees related to subscriptions.  In an October decision, the FCC upheld the cable companies' right to recover franchise fees entirely from subscribers and itemize those fees on cable bills. The FCC ruling left local governments the option of excluding ancillary revenues from the franchise fees to spare cable subscribers higher bills.  Medicaid may explain part of the disparity, says report author Matt Kane. Northeast states typically have more generous Medicaid programs than the Midwest, boosting their federal matching funds. With budget problems forcing states to cut Medicaid programs, the report may help bolster Midwest states' request that the federal government boost its share of Medicaid.
