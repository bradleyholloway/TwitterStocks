 Brazil Is Pushing States to Privatize As Many of Their 26 Banks as Possible   By By Geraldo Samor, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1997  In that transaction, Banco Itau SA, Brazil's second-largest private bank, acquired Rio de Janeiro state bank Banco Banerj SA in a drawn-out privatization marked by government mistakes.  For foreign banks, the privatization "is a starting point," says Lazaro de Mello Brandao, president of the powerful Banco Bradesco SA, Brazil's largest private retail bank. "It's a way for them to put their foot in the door of the [Brazilian] market and expand from there."  Santander's purchases so far this year include Banco de Venezuela and stakes in Banco Mexicano, Banco Comercial Antioqueno, Banco Geral do Comercio in Brazil and Argentine bank Banco Rio de la Plata SA.
