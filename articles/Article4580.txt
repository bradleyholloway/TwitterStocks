 Recycling Siren Lures Newsprint Makers --- Profit Outlook Is Weak, But Demand Is Soaring   By By G. Pierre Goad, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1989  Two years ago, Canadian newsprint maker Donohue Inc. dropped plans to build a de-inking plant to recycle newspapers, because the project wouldn't earn a profit. Now, the company is taking a second look at the idea. "Even if it's unprofitable, we have to get into recycling," says Charles-Albert Poissant, chairman and chief executive officer.  Like Donohue, every big North American newsprint maker is trying to get on the recycling bandwagon, because a spate of new state laws has newspaper publishers howling for the product. But the rush to recycle newspapers may force the industry into unprofitable investments, and some remote newsprint mills may have to close.  "It's a huge problem," Mr. Poissant says. He says he regrets spending $70 million on a recent upgrade of the mill that feeds pulp made from trees to Donohue's new $120 million newsprint machine at Clermont, Quebec. If the newsprint machine uses de-inked pulp from newspapers, he says the wood-pulp mill will have to operate at lower capacity and "that raises my costs. Then I've got the problem of the extra costs of getting the de-inked pulp."
