 EPA Chief Says Congress Is More Likely To Weaken Than Beef Up Clean-Air Bill   By By Rose Gutfeld and Barbara Rosewicz, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 11, 1989  At a breakfast meeting yesterday with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Reilly specifically said he anticipates industry efforts to reduce the scope of the auto alternative-fuels program and to remove a provision that would cap utilities' emissions of sulfur dioxide, a rule that could limit their growth. He said that the emissions cap faces particular opposition in the House and that he is aware that even some sponsors of the administration's bill believe it is too tough on utilities.  Mr. Reilly, contending that industry opposition to the emissions measure hasn't softened, disputed charges by lawmakers and environmental groups that significant concessions were made to business groups during the drafting of the bill. "We've seen very strong concern and opposition from the energy industry. We've seen a somewhat ambivalent but generally negative view from the auto industry on alternatve fuels," he said.  At the same time, he said, environmentalists have a good chance of winning tougher standards for auto tailpipe emissions and of succeeding in doubling the required warranty on pollution equipment to 100,000 miles per car. Proponents of tougher auto standards gained some ground yesterday when eight Northeastern states agreed to adopt tougher auto emissions rules than the Bush administration is proposing.
