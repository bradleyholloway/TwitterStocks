 Disclosure Rules Gain New Support --- Fidelity, ICI Back Proposal For More Frequent Reports On Mutual-Fund Holdings   By By Ian McDonald The Wall Street Journal Online, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2003  Fidelity, the world's largest fund manager measured by assets, said it is preparing formal comments to the SEC, but it also had changed its stance on more frequent disclosure. "We support the [SEC] proposal," Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley said. "But we have some concerns that we'll raise in a comment letter that I expect will be done this week."  The ICI and some fund companies led by Fidelity had battled efforts to beef up portfolio-holdings disclosures for years. They said more frequent disclosure would help traders who could profit by knowing what fund managers were buying and selling. But many fund companies report more portfolio data than required under current SEC rules and some large fund companies such as Vanguard Group previously have come out in favor of the SEC proposal.  If the SEC approves the rules as proposed -- a vote date on the measure hasn't been set yet -- funds would be allowed to list only their 50 largest holdings and any others that comprise at least 1% of assets. A full listing of fund holdings would be available to fund shareholders upon request but wouldn't need to be sent to all holders. Money-market funds would be exempt from disclosing their holdings in shareholder reports.
