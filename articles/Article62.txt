CINCINNATI, Feb. 16â€” A settlement described as an alternative to the type of school desegregation plan hailed last month by the Reagan Administration was reached today in a 10- year-old case here.  The plan announced here in Federal District Court is viewed as ''a model for urban school district settlements throughout the country,'' said William L. Taylor, an attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the plaintiffs.  Under the plan, the school system would agree that a certain number of schools will reflect the racial composition of the city by June 30, 1991,  As in Bakersfield, Calif., the case cited by the Administration, the Cincinnati plan would initially rely on voluntary participation. However, the Cincinnati plan would allow the courts to step in within a few years if the goals appeared elusive.  In a statement today, Judge Walter H. Rice said, ''The agreement reflects both a strong commitment to voluntary programs and to the achievement of results.''  The plan must now be formally approved by the plaintiffs, the Cincinnati School Board and the State School Board, but negotiators for all three parties said they expected the settlement to be accepted.  Unlike settlements in other cities, the one here sets out a specific standard by which the school system can measure the degree to which it has reduced ''racial isolation''; that is, the number of schools that have at least 70 percent of one race or the other enrolled.  The state has agreed to contribute $35 million, in addition to regular allocations, to the Cincinnati schools to achieve these goals. Use of Magnet Schools  The backbone of the settlement will be the use of magnet programs in schools that now have predominantly black enrollments. Judge Rice in his statement said that the choices that will be provided to parents ''will make it unnecessary for any child to ride a bus except by choice.''  At present, about 40,000 students, including those who attend parochial schools, are bused in Cincinnati. Under a program adopted in 1971, some students are being bused to some magnet schools. The new program would expand the number of magnet schools.  Like the Bakersfield settlement, the plan initially relies upon parents to voluntarily enroll their children in the program. Here, as in Bakersfield and other cities, the inducement will be magnet schools that allow students to specialize in particular subjects.  The major distinction from Bakersfield, however, is in enforcement. After three years, the Bakersfield officials must demonstrate only that a good-faith attempt has been made to bring about meaningful integration. Courts Can Order Changes  In Cincinnati, school officials have agreed to attain a specific level of integration within seven years. If after three and a half years it appears that the goal would not be reached, the court can order compulsory desegregation methods. Thomas I. Atkins, general counsel for the N.A.A.C.P., said today: ''The bottom line is we give the defendants a great deal of flexibility to achieve an agreed upon result. If they don't achieve that result through voluntary means, we have reserved the right to come back to court and achieve it otherwise.''  In this river city of 385,500 people, blacks constitute 35 percent of the population. Generally, blacks live in the older, central part of the city. Whites live to the east and west.  In the public schools, 58 percent of the approximately 51,000 students are black.  In 50 of the 78 schools, more than half of the students are black. In 13 schools, at least 90 percent of the students are black. In another 13, whites make up at least 75 percent of enrollment.  School officials deny that official policies led to this pattern in schools or in housing.  The N.A.A.C.P. has charged otherwise. In a complaint filed in the case, the plaintiffs said:  ''From the time Ohio became a state until the present time, it has, pursuant to explicit policy and ingrained practice, custom and usage, discriminated against, segregated and confined black people in Cincinnati to a separate set of black schools and black housing. The operation of a racially dual school system in Cincinnati has been a central part of this state-imposed and fostered system of de jure racial ghettoization.''  The lawsuit, titled Mona Bronson v. Cincinnati Board of Education, was filed in May 1974.
