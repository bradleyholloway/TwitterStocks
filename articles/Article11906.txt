 Settling In: Christmas Books: A Holiday Sampler   By By Raymond Sokolov, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1994  "Gimme Shelter" is a plea heard in every tongue and clime and epoch. Even the unjustly sneered-at Neanderthals went inside at night (the first fossil was found in a cave in the Neander Valley near Dusseldorf in 1856). To build a free-standing house required better tools and classier skills leading eventually to full-blown architecture. This business of getting a roof over one's head is a major subject for gift books this season, but maybe that's not surprising.  Malcolm Kirk makes this connection right off in "Silent Spaces: The Last of the Great Aisled Barns" (Bulfinch, 162 pages, $50). He goes on to show, in eloquent words and black-and-white pictures, how in Europe and America big structures in stone and wood, based on the same basic scheme, and looking like upside-down ships, could end up either as shelters for animals and fodder (and sometimes simultaneously, human residents) or as houses of worship. Such barns, usually with a high-ceilinged central nave and two narrower, lower-ceilinged side aisles, survive from Scandinavia to the central Hudson Valley. Their rough-hewn beams and rafters bespeak the skill of ancient joiners. O, to be a cow in such a place.
