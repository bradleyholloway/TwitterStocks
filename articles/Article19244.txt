 Toshiba Explains Accord as Other PC Firms Study Suits --- Questions on Chip Flaw Affect H-P, Packard Bell, Compaq and eMachines   By By David P. Hamilton and Robert A. Guth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2000  At the heart of the Toshiba matter is a technical flaw in a PC chip known as a floppy-disk controller, one that under certain circumstances could damage or destroy data stored on floppy disks. Although that defect was discovered 13 years ago and was corrected a few years later by the original manufacturers of the defective chips, it somehow lived on in Toshiba PCs -- and, the plaintiffs' lawyers say, in those of other PC makers as well.  What may have made Toshiba particularly vulnerable to the suit, however, is the fact that in addition to making notebook computers that exhibited the data-corruption problem, it also produced the defective floppy-disk controllers as well -- chips it has supplied to other PC makers for years. What is more, some Toshiba engineers had been aware of the problem in its chips for more than a decade, an individual close to the company says, but declined to fix it because they considered the likelihood of data-damaging errors remote. A Toshiba spokesman declined to comment.  But the problem wasn't restricted to NEC and Intel chips. A few years earlier, Toshiba semiconductor engineers had reverse-engineered the NEC chip. When NEC found out, the two companies huddled in negotiations that eventually led to a "nonassertion agreement" in 1986. Under its terms, Toshiba agreed to make royalty payments to NEC but acknowledged no wrongdoing. Toshiba continued to produce its controller chip.
