 Attorney-Client Confidentiality Waived in Rule   By By Ann Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 9, 2001  Timothy McVeigh, who was executed for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing, had confidential conversations with his lawyer, according to Mr. Schwartz of the criminal defense lawyers group. So did Wadih el Hage, who was convicted earlier this year on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden to kill Americans, leading to the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, according to his lawyer, Joshua Dratel. While the FBI reviewed every letter Mr. Hage sent and the prison monitored conversations with his wife and children, Mr. Dratel says, "there was not a single instance" where prison officials claimed that Mr. Hage's discussions with his lawyer were furthering terrorist activity.  The rule says that lawyers and clients generally will be notified if the government intends to monitor their conversations or correspondence. Nevertheless, Irwin Schwartz, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, calls the rule an outrageous repudiation of one the oldest privileges recognized in U.S. "This is Big Brother going too far," says Mr. Schwartz, whose organization plans to assist lawyers in challenging the rule in court. He argues that the rule may even jeopardize the constitutional right of criminal defendants to counsel. Because lawyers are bound by professional rules to maintain clients' confidences, he says, "this rule would mean lawyers have to stop speaking with their clients who are in custody. That means you can't possibly represent someone effectively if you can't talk with him."
