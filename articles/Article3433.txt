 That Magic Moment   By Erving, Julius, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  There's a short list of NBA names that, when spoken, immediately evoke feelings of greatness of near-divine proportions. For every 20 or so guys who have played in a handful of All-Star Games in their careers, there's one player whose star shines brighter than the rest, a guy who fills the arenas on a nightly basis. From the moment he stepped on the court in his first NBA game in 1979, Earvin "Magic" [Magic Johnson] was one of those players. But it was one performance against my Philadelphia 76ers in the 1980 Finals that forever placed Magic's name among the true NBA legends.  L.A. won Game Five to take a 3-2 series lead, but word dropped that [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] wouldn't make the trip to Philly for Game Six, as his ankle sprain left him unable to run. We were totally shocked to hear this news, and I remember our coach, Billy Cunningham, saying he'd believe Kareem wasn't playing only when the game ended and he hadn't seen him. But while we knew our backs were still against the wall and that the Lakers would be tough even without the big center, I'd be lying if I said our confidence didn't jump a notch or two upon hearing Kareem was out.
