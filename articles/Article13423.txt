 Japan Retailer Tops Barneys Bid   By Amy Chozick in Tokyo and Rachel Dodes in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2007  Fast Retailing's bid represents a 9% premium to Jones's definitive agreement last month to sell Barneys for $825 million to Istithmar, the Dubai government's investment arm. Jones, an apparel wholesaler based in Bristol, Pa., said the agreement is still in effect, but it will enter negotiations with the Japanese retailer.  Acquiring Barneys would allow the retailer to further diversify away from its mass-market basics. In 2004 Fast Retailing acquired an equity stake in Link Theory Holdings Co., the marketer of the Theory and Helmut Lang apparel brands. In 2005, it acquired stakes in the French brands Comptoir des Cotonniers brand and Princesse Tam Tam.  Fast Retailing is the second Japanese company to attempt a relationship with Barneys. In 1988, Barneys brought in Japanese department-store operator Isetan Ltd. to fund its aggressive expansion. Isetan later sold its remaining stake in Barneys to Jones, but it retained control of Barneys' stores in Japan; last year, it sold that control to two Japanese companies.
