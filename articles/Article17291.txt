 Cuomo Sets $50 Million Union Bailout   By Gershman, Jacob, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2011  Last month, under orders from the governor's office, the New York State Department of Health raised the Medicaid reimbursement rate for New York City home-care agencies by $60 million and converted the money into extra insurance subsidies for low-wage workers, according to a Cuomo official. Since the vast majority of providers are unionized and represented by 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, the increase amounts to roughly an extra $50 million in Medicaid funding over 27 months for the union's cash-strapped benefit fund for personal-care aides, who are paid hourly rates to help elderly and infirm Medicaid patients with chores, groceries and bathing.
