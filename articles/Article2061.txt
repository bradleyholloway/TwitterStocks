 Wave of Cellular Operators Will Push European Liberalization, EU Predicts   By Lavin, Douglas, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1995  By the end of next year Spain, Italy Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands will for the first time have competitive cellular networks, Mr. [Herbert Ungerer] predicted. With independent cellular networks, "you have very important national economic interests which support liberalization," Mr. Ungerer said. "This is not a battle between the commission and member states. It is a battle between economic interests within member states."  Even Mr. [Michael Potter], a frequent critic of the pace of Europe's telephone liberalization, agreed that a wave of new cellular operators will help the forces of competition. "The more forces you put in the market, the quicker the monopolies will break down," Mr. Potter said. And as for regulators, Mr. Ungerer said the new operators will create a demand for objectivity. "How can you have an independent regulator when there is just one company to regulate?" Mr. Ungerer asked.
