 SCM, Merrill Unit May Launch Offer To Speed Buyout, Rebuff Hanson Bid   By By Daniel Hertzberg and Barry Meier, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1985  SCM Corp. and a Merrill Lynch & Co. unit may launch a tender offer to speed their planned $70-a-share, or $868 million, leveraged buyout of SCM.  The preliminary buyout agreement that the companies announced Friday counters a $60-a-share, or $755 million, tender offer launched earlier last week by Hanson Trust PLC, a British conglomerate, for SCM, a New York-based chemicals, coatings and paper products company.  While the accord doesn't mention a tender offer, Wall Street sources said that SCM and Merrill Lynch, an investment firm, may resort to an unusual strategy: In effect, the Merrill Lynch Capital Markets-led group would make a friendly tender offer for SCM and later refinance the transaction, selling the company to SCM's management in a leveraged buyout.
