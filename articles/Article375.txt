Harvey Lembeck, a character actor who was featured on Broadway as Harry Shapiro in ''Stalag 17'' and on television as Cpl. Rocco Barbella on ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' the Phil Silvers comedy series, died Tuesday in Los Angeles.  He was 58 years old.  Mr. Lembeck began his career as half of ''The Dancing Carrolls,'' which he once described as ''the worst dance act in show business.'' After serving in World War II, he often portrayed humorous men in uniform. In 1947, he graduated from New York University.  When he appeared in 1951 in ''Stalag 17,'' a comedy-melodrama by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski set in a German prisoner-of-war camp, Brooks Atkinson, drama critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''Robert Strauss is hilarious as the chief clown of the barracks, and Harvey Lembeck is scarcely less funny as his buddy.'' Mr. Lembeck repeated his role in the Paramount Pictures version of the play in 1953.  Other roles he portrayed were a truculent sailor, Insigna, in ''Mister Roberts,'' which starred Henry Fonda on Broadway in 1948, and as the seafaring bookie, Morelli, in the 1951 film ''U.S.S. Teakettle,'' which starred Gary Cooper. In addition to his featured billing on the Silvers show about Sgt. Ernie Bilko, Mr. Lembeck appeared on more tha n 50 television programs. He was recently an actor-teacher in a theatrical workshop in Los Angeles.  Mr. Lembeck, who lived in Beverly Hills, is survived by his wife, Caroline; a son, Michael; a daughter, Helaine; his father, Harry; a brother, Richard, and a grandson.
