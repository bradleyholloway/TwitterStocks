 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Anita Hill Chronology   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1991  Early September: Kennedy Labor Committee aide Ricki Seidman contacted Ms. Hill, who didn't lodge her accusation in that conversation. Then on Sept. 9, Ms. Hill said she was willing to talk about her complaint, and Mr. Seidman referred her to Metzenbaum Labor Committee aide James Brudney, whom Ms. Hill knew from Yale Law School. The next day, Mr. Brudney gave the allegations to Harriet Grant, the Judiciary Committee's chief nomination counsel.  Ms. Hill called the Judiciary Committee for the first time on Sept. 12. Senator Biden said that Ms. Hill wanted her allegation kept "completely confidential." Senator Biden now says this is what kept the staff from giving her name to the FBI or Judge Thomas then.  Senator Biden says that on Sept. 23, Ms. Hill said that her name could be used in an FBI interview with Mr. Thomas. The FBI report was completed on Sept. 25 and that evening Senators Biden and Thurmond agreed to let the rest of the panel know about the allegations. Senator Biden briefed each Democrat orally and brought along copies of the FBI report and of Ms. Hill's statement, if any wished to read it. On Friday, Sept. 27, Mr. Biden gave all relevant documents to all of the committee Democrats.
