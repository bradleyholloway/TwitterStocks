 Authorities Still Unsure if Boston Terror Tip Is Real as Hunt Goes On   By Gary Fields, Joseph Pereira and David Armstrong, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2005  Mr. [Michael Sullivan] said federal agents were aggressively pursuing the information related to a possible terrorist threat, but acknowledged it may be bogus. The tip is coming "from somebody that nobody's been able to identify," said Mr. Sullivan. "If I were to speculate: could this be a hoax, certainly that's a possibility and that's the reason we need to reassure the public not to be concerned."  In Beijing, Kong Quan, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: "I remind you that up to now, all media reports said the information is 'uncorroborated.' . . . We've been firmly supporting the concerted efforts made by the international community to fight all kinds of terrorist activities."  In a report sent to law-enforcement officers yesterday, the Nuclear Assessment Program, a unit of the Department of Energy, said that with "a high degree of confidence" it doesn't believe there is any nuclear or radioactive material being prepared for a terror attack. The program concludes the caller "is attempting a disruptive hoax or less likely is reporting on unfounded street rumors he believes to be true."
