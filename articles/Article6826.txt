 American Editor Of Forbes Russia Is Shot and Killed   By Gregory L. White and Guy Chazan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2004  In May the magazine published a list of Russia's 100 richest people. Such lists are a staple of its coverage in the West but a relatively new phenomenon in a country where vast fortunes have been made virtually overnight, often under murky circumstances. Though Forbes officials said they didn't get any complaints as a result, it raised uncomfortable questions at a time when the popular mood in Russia had turned against the wealthy.  In the wake of the October arrest of billionaire oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky on charges of fraud and tax evasion, Russia's rich had been trying to keep a lower profile. "Klebnikov wanted to show how Russian capitalism was built," said Boris Berezovsky, the Russian tycoon who withdrew a lawsuit against Forbes after the magazine withdrew some allegations made by Mr. Klebnikov. "But money loves silence, especially in Russia." He condemned Mr. Klebnikov's murder.  In a note to employees, Steve Forbes, the magazine's president and editor in chief, said Mr. Klebnikov "exemplified the finest traditions of our profession and served his readers well." He said Forbes was "devastated by what has happened."
