To the Editor:  Criticizing a book in progress without having read a line of it is not a practice that one associates with The Times. Yet your Sept. 19 editorial on the forthcoming Reader's Digest Bible did just that - your writer commenting that condensing the Bible ''can do terrible things to its song.''  If the work were done poorly, by unskilled people, yes. But at Reader's Digest, which pioneered and perfected condensation, we have for many years been offering readers both the ''song'' and the substance of authors ranging from Jane Austen and Charles Dickens to James Herriot and Herman Wouk. We've introduced millions of people worldwide to books they otherwise would not have read.  If a painstaking and sensitive condensation of the Bible - and that's what we'll publish next year -brings a multitude of new readers to the Book of Books, that can only be a positive result. EDWARD T. THOMPSON, Editor in Chief, Reader's Digest, Pleasantville, N.Y., Sept. 25, 1981
