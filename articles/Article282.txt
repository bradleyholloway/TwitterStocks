THE retrospective that caused the fracas in London has arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When the American-born painter R. B. Kitaj's exhibition opened at the Tate last year, the reviews were so hostile that he announced he wouldn't show his work in England ever again. That was saying a lot for someone who had lived there more than half his life (he's 62), and who even coined the phrase "School of London" to describe the group of prominent painters that included himself, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. But Mr. Kitaj has always been a person to say what is on his mind, sometimes to his detriment.  Now that the retrospective is here you may well wonder what the fuss was about. If you go to the Met expecting another Freud exhibition, meaning one as galvanic and intense as the show of his work the museum had a year back, you'll be disappointed. This show has its inspired moments, though Mr. Kitaj is a painter whose ambitions outstrip his art. He deserves credit for those ambitions, and certainly not the caning he got in the British press. But his paintings can sometimes be abstruse and pretentious, and there are too many weak recent pictures on view to come out of the Metropolitan with more than mixed feelings. A Kitaj exhibition now at Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan includes some better new work that doesn't alter the bottom line.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
