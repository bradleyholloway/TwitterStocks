 Plots & Ploys   By Jennifer S. Forsyth, Jonathan Karp and Alex Frangos, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  Yesterday, JMB Capital Partners LP notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had taken a 5.2% stake in Maguire. In a letter to [Maguire], the hedge fund noted that the REIT trades at a 29% discount to analysts' average estimate of its net asset value. JMB called this difference "a 'management discount' attributable to weak corporate governance, excessive general and administrative expenses and corporate actions tainted by conflict of interest." Included in the firm's demand is that Maguire form a committee to explore strategic alternatives and that two JMB representatives be added to the board and sit on the committee.  If it is ignored, JMB says, it might propose an alternative slate of directors. Cyrus Hadidi, a JMB partner, declined to be interviewed, saying, "The letter speaks for itself." Peggy Moretti, a Maguire spokeswoman, said the company had no comment. JMB's move follows that of Scoggin Capital Management LP, which took a 7.8% position in the company last week.
