 U.S. Intelligence-Overhaul Bill Moves Closer to Passage by House   By Cloud, David S, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  The House moved closer to passing a U.S. intelligence overhaul after negotiators agreed on language clarifying the powers of a proposed national intelligence director and President Bush urged lawmakers to act on the measure "for the good of our national security."  The provision worked out to win Mr. [Duncan Hunter]'s vote calls for Mr. [Bush] to issue guidelines ensuring "effective implementation" of the powers that the bill gives the national intelligence director, but which "shall respect and not abrogate the statutory responsibilities of the heads of the departments." At issue is the military chain of command, which by law goes from President Bush to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to the military's combatant commanders. The wording is meant to keep the intelligence director from requiring commanders to get his approval before they can call on the National Security Agency and other so-called combat-support intelligence agencies.  A Senate aide called the Hunter provision "face-saving language" and noted that, under the bill, control of satellites would be handled by a committee headed by the intelligence director that includes Pentagon representatives. In his letter, Mr. Bush promised to issue regulations that would provide for a "strong director of national intelligence" while also ensuring "all of the war-fighter's needs are met."
