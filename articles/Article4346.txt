 Joseph Coors Moves To Enhance Sons' Responsibilities   By By Paul Duke Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1987  Joseph Coors said he will step down from "day-to-day operation" of Adolph Coors Co., a move that further marks the transition of power in the company into the hands of his sons, Jeffrey H. and Peter H. Coors.  "I have much confidence in and respect for the way Jeff and Pete Coors are running" the company, Mr. Coors said in a statement. "In view of this, . . . I felt I could step down from involvement in the day-to-day operation."  Jeffrey Coors, 42, and president, and Peter, 41, and president of the brewing division, are credited with putting an emphasis on savvy marketing and mending relations with organized labor and other interest groups like the AFL-CIO, which led boycotts of the company's beer in recent years. Another son, Joseph Jr., 45, is president of the Coors Ceramics division, which makes industrial lab products.
