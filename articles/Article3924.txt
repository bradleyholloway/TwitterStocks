 Off the Beaten Track / Montana   By DeWeese, Chelsea, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2005  Away from the crowd: Hike down to the Yellowstone River's "Champagne" eddy north of Yankee Jim Canyon. Look for the Yankee Jim Campground just outside Gardiner; park there, cross the highway and walk down the bank. You'll know you've found it when you see the eddy lines and whirlpools that give it its name.
