 Staples's Shift Boosts Profit --- Retailer's Net Jumps With Focus on Small Business, `Power Users'   By By Joseph Pereira, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2003  Mr. [RONALD SARGENT] argued that the company needed to shift focus, de-emphasizing occasional shoppers looking for discounts in favor of bigger-spending small businesses and "power users." Although a group of Staples' sales and merchandising executives balked, arguing that the company couldn't afford to alienate any potential customers in the midst of the post-Sept. 11 downturn, Mr. Sargent prevailed.  As part of Staples's small-business focus, the chain has eliminated such low-end items as $29 cordless telephones and $99 paper shredders and fax machines. Instead, [Staples] now stocks laser-based fax machines that cost $299 to $399, along with sophisticated telephones with multiple lines that retail for $299 to $499. Low-end digital cameras and copiers have also been replaced by systems that cost as much as $800. In place of vanity pens, Staples now features 10- and 20-pen packs.  Staples's retail stores remain an important part of Staples's story, as the 1,261-store North American chain accounts for nearly two-thirds of sales. Wall Street has been wondering how Staples plans to increase its retail division given the poor economy and what it believes to be near-market saturation conditions. (There are about 3,000 office-supplies superstores in the U.S.)
