 An Artist Builds an Empire of Cute   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1998  UNIVERSITY CITY, Mo. -- Mary Engelbreit doesn't cook. "Never," she says. "I get vertigo in grocery stores." She also rarely entertains, doesn't do crafts and has no idea how to cross-stitch.  Yet Ms. Engelbreit is amassing an empire of domesticity that may one day challenge Martha Stewart's. Her burgeoning publishing, design and household-item business includes Mary Engelbreit's Home Companion, a home-decorating magazine stuffed with crafts projects and recipes; a syndicated newspaper column (last week's was about teddy bears) and 30 books on everything from gardening to tea, including two volumes on cross-stitching. A cookbook is in the works.  Where Ms. Stewart successfully has molded herself as a doyenne of discriminating taste, Ms. Engelbreit has succeeded in marketing cute -- as in children, animals, touching sayings, calico and lots of flowers. On the back of her business card, a girl in a sailor suit slouches in a chair, cigar in mouth, beer and pen in hand. "Engelbreit's the name," it says. "Cute's the game."
