 Almost Half of 737s Inspected to Date Have Shown Some Wear of Their Wiring   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1998  Emergency inspections of 179 older Boeing 737s continued, with about half of the 96 planes inspected as of last evening showing wear on electric wiring running through fuel tanks in the wings, the Federal Aviation Administration said.  FAA Administrator Jane Garvey tried to reassure fliers. "Certainly if it's a 737 flying today, then it's not part of the fleet we're concerned about," Ms. Garvey said on NBC-TV's "Today" show. "The ones we are concerned about will not fly until they've been inspected, until we're sure, until the air carriers are sure that it is safe."  Airlines said yesterday that the inspections are moving along quickly with minimal disruption to travelers. US Airways Group said that inspections of its four 737s covered by the mandatory grounding were completed Sunday with "no instances of exposed wiring" found.
