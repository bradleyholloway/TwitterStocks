 Nucor to Build Iron-Carbide Plant To Aid Minimills   By By Dana Milbank, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1993  Nucor Corp. said it will build an ironcarbide plant in Trinidad, a move that will aid steel minimills' assault on larger rivals by giving them a stable and high-quality supply of metal.  Direct-reduced iron, of which iron carbide is one form, will help minimills expand by giving them a form of iron that can be used in their electric furnaces in place of scrap steel, which is impure and subject to wide swings in price. The directreduced iron processes let minimills do the same thing integrated steel mills' blast furnaces do, but on a smaller scale and without the use of coke.
