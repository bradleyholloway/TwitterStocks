John McNamara, who was dismissed as manager by the Cincinnati Reds earlier in the week, said yesterday he had no intention of forgetting baseball.  ''I knew it was inevitable that the Reds would let me go,'' he said, ''but I still want to be with a ball club. I've been there 30 years of my life. I'll be at our stadium tonight. I'll be sitting in the red seats or the green seats. I love baseball. Baseball is my life.''
