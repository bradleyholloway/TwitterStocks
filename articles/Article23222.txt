 Mossberg's Mailbox   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2005  A: If you need a new laptop now, I wouldn't wait, even though the new "n" flavor of Wi-Fi promises to be faster and to have much better range than the current "a," "b," and "g" versions. I have no idea when the "n" standard will make it into the marketplace, since it's still in the hands of a standards committee, and such bodies tend to move slowly.  If "bang for the buck" means how little you can pay for each gigabyte of storage, then the costliest iPod, the $449 white model with 60 gigabytes of storage, offers the most bang. But it's also the largest model. Many people, with fewer songs and a greater sense of style, might prefer the slimmer, multihued iPod mini models, which cost $199 for four gigabytes or $249 for six gigabytes, and also offer the longest battery life of any iPod. And people with limited budgets will prefer the low-end Shuffle models, which are tiny but cheap.
