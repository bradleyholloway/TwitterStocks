 Pakistan Islamists Could Challenge Alliance With U.S.   By By Zahid Hussain, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2002  ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- An Islamic coalition that emerged vastly strengthened from Pakistan's general election said Thursday's vote repudiates the government's support for the U.S. war on terror. But Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, vowed to stick with the policy.  Religious leaders conveyed a mixed message over the weekend as to how they will approach the U.S. and other Western countries after Nov. 1, when Mr. Musharraf says he expects the assembly to start work. Some say the U.S. has nothing to be concerned about. Mr. Ahmed, for example, dismissed concerns that the parties will try to enact Taliban-like policies such as restrictions on women. However, Mr. Ahmed said, Mr. Musharraf's support of the U.S. is a "policy made by an individual and not by the elected representatives of the people."  If the religious parties do emerge as a significant obstacle to his rule, Gen. Musharraf may have only himself to blame. Government officials and independent analysts say Gen. Musharraf's main election goal was to marginalize the country's liberal political forces, particularly the Pakistan People's Party, led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Gen. Musharraf disqualified Ms. Bhutto as a candidate, and she didn't return to Pakistan from exile abroad. Gen. Musharraf threw his support to a pro-military faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and the religious alliance. The PML faction won 78 seats, and the PPP 62.
