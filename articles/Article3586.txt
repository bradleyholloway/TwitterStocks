 WSJ(7/14) UPDATE: Ghosn Steps Up Push For GM Alliance   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  Among the key questions now will be whether Mr. [Rick Wagoner] will be allowed to control the discussions with Mr. [Carlos Ghosn] and Renault and Nissan. Mr. [Kirk Kerkorian] publicly served notice last week that he wanted GM's outside directors -- not Mr. Wagoner -- to spearhead the process of evaluating the pros and cons of a link-up with the two foreign auto makers. So far, GM's board is allowing Mr. Wagoner to manage the talks, but Messrs. Kerkorian and [Jerome B. York] will likely push for a board-led review if Mr. Wagoner appears to be balking.  In interviews earlier this week, Mr. Wagoner said he was open to discussing a possible alliance with Mr. Ghosn. But he and other GM officials said GM isn't looking for a "white knight." And Mr. Wagoner has defended both the pace and scope of his turnaround effort. "I don't know of any company that has, over 14 to 18 months, whacked out $8 billion in costs. . . Anybody who says we aren't moving fast enough isn't looking at the facts," Mr. Wagoner told CNBC on Tuesday.  Mr. Wagoner has told GM's directors that he will brief them after his meeting with Mr. Ghosn, according to a person familiar with the situation. The board is eager to hear the CEO's preliminary thoughts, and also assess his "body language" about an alliance with Mr. Ghosn, says another person familiar with the situation. That is because several directors are willing to allow Mr. Wagoner to run the company's review of the possible alliance, at least initially, so long as he convinces them he is giving the idea serious consideration.
