 Hanson Agress to Buy Kidde for $1.8 Billion, Continuing British Buying Spree in U.S.   By By Joann S. Lublin and Bryan Burrough Staff Reporters of the Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1987  The U.S. arm of British conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC agreed to acquire Kidde Inc., a diversified U.S. manufacturer, in a roughly $1.8 billion transaction that heats up the already feverish U.K. buying spree of American corporations.  Under Hanson's friendly proposal, each of Kidde's 26.7 million common shares would be exchanged for $60.10 cash, stock in a Kidde unit to be spun off, and a seven-year warrant. Each warrant holder would gain the right to buy for $18 one Hanson Trust American Depositary Receipt, which represents five Hanson Trust common shares. Analysts valued the transaction at $66 to $68 a share.  No other bidder is expected to top the Hanson proposal, largely because Kidde intends to grant Hanson an option to buy as much as 25% of Kidde shares at $63.875 each.
