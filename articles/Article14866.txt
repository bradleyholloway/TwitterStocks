 Tourism Languishes in the Philippines --- Problems, Natural and Man-Made, Deter Visitors   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1991  MANILA, the Philippines -- Even if ash-belching Mount Pinatubo returned to slumber tomorrow, the Philippine tourism industry probably would remain in its near-dormant state.  With 7,100 islands, pristine beaches and verdant highlands, the country should be one of Asia's major holiday playgrounds. "I don't think anyone doubts the potential of the Philippines," says Randolph Guthrie, managing director of Hong Kong's Shangri-La International Hotels & Resorts. "Its potential is far greater than any country" in Asia other than China.  The Philippines offers low prices, an English-speaking population, wildlife, Spanish colonial relics and coastal waters that divers consider to be among the best. The country's location makes it a perfect short-haul destination for the increasing numbers of tourists coming out of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. With better air links and savvy marketing, the Philippines could attract lots of tourists from Europe and North America as well.
