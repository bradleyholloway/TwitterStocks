 OPEC Refiners Threaten Firms' Profits, Study Says   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1988  "It seems clear that new investors entering the currently barely-profitable refining business will be bad for the current participants," says the study, to be released today in London by the Phillips & Drew Group of Union Bank of Switzerland.  Although the big London brokerage firm's study doesn't make that point explicitly, the results suggest that increased competition in the refining and marketing sector, or "downstream," could hold fuel prices down even if crude oil costs rise. "Refining margins are expected to remain low over the next five years," Geoffrey S. Pyne, a Phillips & Drew oil-market analyst and one of the authors of the study, said in an interview.
