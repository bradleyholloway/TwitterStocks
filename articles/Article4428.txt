 Letters to the Editor: An Arbitrator Beats a Lawyer   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1988  Laurence Storch's letter (July 15) concerning NASD arbitration of brokerage disputes both distorts the facts and impugns the integrity of arbitrators. I have been an arbitrator for the National Association of Securities Dealers for a number of years. Arbitrators are not NASD employees, and all arbitrations involving public customers are required to have a majority of the panel members from outside the securities industry. Furthermore, arbitrators are subject to pre-emptory challenges and unlimited challenges for cause.
