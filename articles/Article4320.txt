 Stronger Dollar Helps Lift Bond Prices; Attention Focuses on July Trade Data   By By Tom Herman and Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1987  Early in the day, prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury issues slumped amid rumors that a U.S. government report to be released tomorrow will show a huge trade deficit for July. But the deeply depressed bond market later rallied as the dollar strengthened against most major currencies.  Some long-term Treasury bonds, which initially were down nearly a point, ended with a gain of nearly 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bond declined slightly to 9.63% from 9.65% Tuesday. But prices of corporate bonds fell again yesterday, while municipal issues were mixed. Short-term interest rates also were mixed.  Tomorrow morning's trade report is likely to show a deficit of $15 billion to $16 billion, according to many analysts. In June, the deficit was $15.7 billion. However, rumors swept through the markets early yesterday that the gap will be as much as $19 billion. Many analysts contend that the deficit will remain large, depressing the dollar further and heightening investor fear of inflation.
