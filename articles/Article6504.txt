 Mixed Greenback Fails to Find Lift In Consumer Data   By Norman, Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2005  The report on consumer sentiment for December rose to 88.7 from 81.6 in November. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a reading of 85.5. The dollar remained in fairly tight ranges for the rest of the U.S. session, although rising yields on Treasury notes helped it gradually edge higher against the yen.  Late in New York, the euro was at $1.1817, from $1.1819 late Thursday. The dollar was at 120.64 yen from 120.28 yen and at 1.3025 Swiss francs from 1.2999 francs. The pound lifted to $1.7547 from $1.7532, while the euro was at 142.57 yen from 142.19 yen.  The U.S. currency rose to a session high of 120.72 yen according to EBS, as U.S. hedge funds and investment banks bought dollars, after the data, traders said.
