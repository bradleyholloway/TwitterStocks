 Silicon Graphics Rises on Flat Day For Small Caps   By Schreiber, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2004  "There's no doubt that people are starting to get the feeling that we may have priced in perfect earnings and perfect forecasts," said David Memmott, managing director of cash trading at Morgan Stanley.  The Russell 2000 Index of small stocks edged up 0.24, or 0.04%, to 586.36, and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index eased 0.34, or 0.12%, to 279.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index of large-cap and small- cap stocks shed 2.05, or 0.1%, to 2109.08.  Apart from its effects on gold prices, the stronger U.S. currency also weighed on dollar-denominated copper prices, which pressured copper producers such as Olin (NYSE), which fell 38 cents, or 1.9%, to 19.72.
