 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Leisure & Arts -- Masterpiece: Mantegna's Singular Jesus His 'Dead Christ' is a brutal, gripping anomaly   By Spiegelman, Willard, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  "Cristo Morto" is currently displayed in a long hallway here. On one side of it there's another [Andrea Mantegna], a "Madonna and Child" with a chorus of brightly colored, luminous cherubs; on the other, there's a Giovanni Bellini "Madonna and Child." It faces, on the opposite wall, three brilliant, expansive canvases by Vittore Carpaccio, famous, like everyone else from the Venetian school, for his sumptuous colors. Along the same corridor the museum has hung other pictures by Bellini, and a large Mantegna altarpiece with St. Luke (writing his Gospel) and other saints, below Christ with the Madonna and St. John the Evangelist.  Sixteen works fill this narrow space. A single one seems definitively not to belong. It is the "Dead Christ." Other paintings by its maker, his relatives, and his contemporaries are represented all around it, but this picture is the odd man out, indeed sui generis. Why and when Mantegna painted it we can only guess. His son mentions it to the painter's patron -- the Duke of Mantua (from the city's ruling Gonzaga family) -- in a letter right after the artist's death. Mantegna had done his best work for more than two decades for the Gonzagas. His fame spread. After a decade or so in Rome, he returned to Mantua in 1490 and remained there. This picture may have been lying around in the studio for as long as three decades, intended for its maker's funeral (it appeared on his catafalque there) and perhaps for a burial memorial. Instead, Cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga acquired it. It eventually made its way to Milan.
