 Premiere Technologies Ponders Whether to Sell Its WebMD Stake   By By Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  The object of Microsoft's affections is WebMD, which is trying to create a medical hub on the Web offering services ranging from medical news for consumers to patient data for physicians. The question facing the holder, Atlanta-based Premiere Technologies, which has a 9% stake in WebMD: Sell to Microsoft now or wait for a potentially bigger windfall from WebMD's pending initial public offering?  "Some would love to see us sell our holdings in WebMD," Mr. [Bob] Zwerneman says. But others anticipate a bonanza that could come from a successful WebMD IPO, which is scheduled to price later this month and is expected to raise about $55 million.  Among WebMD's other holders, which typically acquired their stakes when they sold services to WebMD in a flurry of deals over the past year, at least one company has agreed to part with some of its WebMD stock. Matria Healthcare, a Marietta, Ga., provider of obstetrical home health-care services for high-risk pregnancies, has sold Microsoft 26% of its stake in WebMD for $4 million, says Chief Executive Donald Millard. Microsoft didn't seek Matria's remaining stake, he adds. Matria's initial investment in WebMD was $2 million.
