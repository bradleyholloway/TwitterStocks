 Letters to the Editor: Golden Memories Of My Kodak Brownie   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2000  On its 50th, or golden, anniversary in 1930, Eastman Kodak offered to give a Brownie to every American child who would be 12 that year.

I remember I badgered my poor father to get me down early to the store where they were being distributed.
