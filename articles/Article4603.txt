 Real estate: S&Ls' mortgage grip slips even further   By Celis, William, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1990  Falling interest rates and shrinkage by thrifts have combined to lower savings and loans' share of the mortgage market to 28% as of August 1989 (compared to 43.5% in August 1988). Commercial banks and mortgage banks hold the rest of the market. Thrift representatives say the decline is only temporary, but analysts disagree.
