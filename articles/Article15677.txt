 Letters to the Editor: Rescuers of Turtles Commit Eco-Mayhem   The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1998  We've received many complaints about "turtle dumping," where turtles are rescued from the markets by well-meaning people and released into public lakes. Once a year, Buddhists release them as part of a religious observance. The Pacific Ocean and state and federal lakes and ponds are well-known locations for "turtle dumping."
