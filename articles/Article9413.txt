 PepsiCo Net Falls 4.4% on Quaker Oats Acquisition   By By Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2002  Investors and analysts are closely watching the performance of Gatorade for evidence that PepsiCo's $13.8 billion acquisition of Quaker is going to pay off. The drink makes up only a small portion of PepsiCo's overall business, but its growth has softened in the face of increased competition from Coca-Cola Co.'s Powerade.  Analysts had expected Gatorade to post volume growth of more than 5% for the quarter. The final figure was 4%, and Gatorade also lost 2.5% of its share of the sports-drink market, while Coke's Powerade gained 2.5%, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. PepsiCo executives played down concerns, saying strong innovation and marketing programs are in place for the drink, and sales have picked up. They also said a transition in leadership of Quaker beverages would be smooth. Sue Wellington, a well-regarded steward of Gatorade, will step down as Quaker beverage chief in March for a leave of absence. She will be succeeded by Charles Maniscalco, also a Gatorade veteran.
