 Entertainment & Culture -- Videogames: Waging War Over Reality; Creators of WWII games are going to elaborate lengths to bolster claims of authenticity   By Jurgensen, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2005  The authenticity offensive is part of the videogame industry's attempt to capitalize on the public's continued hunger for WWII stories. A full seven years after Steven Spielberg's box-office hit "Saving Private Ryan," chronicles of the conflict continue to hit TV screens and book stores. At least a dozen books related to the war, including veteran Richard Hough's "The Battle of Britain," are hitting shelves in time for the holiday season.  In trying to win over armchair historians with vivid scenes ripped from the front lines of WWII, developers run the risk of alienating their core audience -- a group that, above all, craves fast pacing and fun. When the Army adviser who worked on Call of Duty 2 said it should take a full minute for a smoke grenade to spew sufficient cover, designers drew the line at about 15 seconds. "On the scale of a gamer's attention span, that feels like forever," says designer Steve Fukuda. Indeed, in addition to using the WWII releases to try to convert new people to gaming, developers are also aiming these titles at hard-core players, who are critical to the financial success of any title.  Conducting the interview was retired Army Lt. Col. Hank Keirsey, who helped designers replicate radio chatter -- like "target reference point," "point fuse" and "fire for effect" -- that they couldn't find in history books.
