If you feel you must use Reddit to conduct a poll do it using a comment. Create a self referencing post and then add a comment for readers to mod up or down based on their answer to your poll question. Also, be sure to indicate in the title of your post that the polls is being conducted using comments. Including something like "(use comments to vote)" in the title would probably be sufficient."
