 NRG Agrees to Buy Texas Genco Assets For $5.8 Billion   By Rebecca Smith and Dennis K. Berman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2005  Under the agreement, NRG will pay $4 billion in cash and will give the sellers $1.8 billion in stock in NRG, which just two years ago was under bankruptcy court protection. NRG also will assume an additional $2.5 billion in debt.  NRG Chief Executive David Crane said that the deal would immediately add to the earnings of the Princeton, N.J., company. The deal came together in just six to eight weeks, Mr. Crane said, when he learned Texas Genco's owners were considering a sale or swap of its 10 power plants in and around the Houston area. The owners were also considering an initial public offering for Texas Genco, which sells wholesale power to retail suppliers.  Yesterday NRG underscored the value of the nuclear and coal-fired plants, saying 82% of their expected output over the next four years has already been sold or hedged. Mr. Crane said that "the main driver" for Texas Genco's value was that the unsold 18% will presumably command an extremely high price.
