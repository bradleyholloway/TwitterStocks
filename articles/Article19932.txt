 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2005  "Almost one in three survey respondents noted an increase in business activity compared with the previous month -- up from just under 17% in August," the index's compilers said in a statement. They said new orders from China didn't grow as fast.  Brazil is seeking voluntary Chinese export quotas. Brazilian Trade and Development Minister Luiz Fernando Furlan, who returned from Beijing on Friday after talks broke down, told reporters the government's foreign trade council, Camex, "has already approved sanctions and President Lula has frequently said he favors them."  The wave of cheap Chinese imports has cut Brazil's surplus with China by more than half in the past year, according to Brazil's Ministry of Trade and Development. Brazil's exports to China consist primarily of the raw materials devoured by China's industrial machine.
