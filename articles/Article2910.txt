 Grateful for the Love   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 1996  These remarks call to mind the title of a recent book that has become a best-seller across the Latin continent -- "The Manual of the Perfect Latin American Idiot." This provocative and attention-getting term has been popularized by three Latin American writers -- Alvaro Vargas Llosa, Carlos Alberto Montaner and Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza -- to describe Latin American intellectuals who for years have blamed Latin America's woes on the United States. Convenient explanations for problems in Latin America have included, according to the authors, the Monroe Doctrine, the CIA, United Fruit Co. and lately what has been called neo-liberal economics. Mrs. Clinton has now bid for membership into the club by blaming the Republican Party for Latin America's high maternal mortality.
