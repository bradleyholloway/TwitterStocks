 House of the Week: Writer's Escape   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  Due Diligence: In the late 1930s, when author W. Somerset Maugham was forced to flee his villa on the French Riviera, publisher Nelson Doubleday built this plantation for him. Known as Parker's Ferry, the residence came complete with a writer's cottage -- with no windows overlooking the too-distracting water. Maugham wrote "The Razor's Edge" while living here. Ten years ago, Richard and June Taylor bought the property for a little more than $1 million. After Mr. Taylor retired as an executive at Lockheed in 1994, he and his wife spent several years restoring the plantation and its grounds.
