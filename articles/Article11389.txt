 Letters to the Editor: Humans vs. Their Animal Instinct   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1990  Regarding Henry Grunwald's June 26 editorial-page article, "A Backward Glance From the Animal-Rights Future": Mr. Grunwald's is a fictional tale from a future in which the "animal-rights" people have had their way. In this future world the self-proclaimed former "masters of the earth" (humans) have lost their almighty power to look upon the planet as a banquet set out for them exclusively to use, abuse, consume, pollute and kill, as they see fit.  According to Mr. Grunwald, the ability of the human race to destroy animals and the environment is the basis of human intelligence. Funny, I always thought human intelligence was something quite different. To me, the truly intelligent realize the interconnectedness of all life, respect all life, consider the possible consequences of their actions, and make use of a gift given to most of us -- a conscience -- before acting.
