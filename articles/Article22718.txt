 Country Life Grows Chic in China --- Second Homes Gain Appeal As Rich Urban Dwellers Seek Retreats from Cities   By By Leslie Chang, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2001  For Zhai Wei, a Beijing newspaper reporter and photographer, a visit to the south of France inspired the dream of a second home in the country. He bought a plot of land northeast of the capital from a farmer who moved to the city so his children could attend better schools. His project was, in real-estate parlance, a real fixer-upper. Mr. Zhai hauled 40 tons of sand up the mountain for the foundation, then located rough green flagstone for the floors from a Chinese manufacturer that made goods only for export. "Chinese people prefer linoleum, which looks more modern," explains Mr. Zhai, 44 years old.  The perils of country life have scared off others altogether. Two years ago, Beijing native Yan Lan, who had just returned to China after more than a decade practicing law in Geneva and Paris, shelled out a $2,400 down payment for a piece of land about two hours' drive from Beijing. Ms. Yan, who lives in a city apartment, envisioned a "country salon" where friends could gather on weekends. Construction had just begun when the neighbors arrived: farmers who insisted that the walnut trees on the land belonged to them and demanded thousands of dollars for each tree that was cut down.  Such horror stories inspired Ms. [Zhang Xin] and her husband, who have constructed residential and office buildings in downtown Beijing, to build homes catering to those who want the charms but not the troubles of rural life. Unusual for a Chinese development, the Commune at the Great Wall puts nature first. Guidelines forbid private gardens, to emphasize the sense that the entire valley is a garden. Builders must use materials available in the area to control costs and to preserve the local flavor. No trees will be felled, the developers say.
