 The Inauguration (A Special Report) --- Candidates for the Budget Ax? The Naval Dairy and the Screw Engineer Are a Couple That Come to Mind   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 20, 1989  Every morning, 4,500 midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy drink Navy milk produced at a nearby Navy dairy farm. Commercial dairies just won't do. Why not? Because, back in 1911, contaminated milk from a local dairy spread typhoid through Annapolis. To protect midshipmen, the Navy bought a dairy farm, started milking cows and never stopped.  Call it the law of bureaucratic inertia. Government programs set in motion tend to stay in motion -- and should they ever slow down, some bureaucrat, politician or lobbyist will give them a shove to keep them rolling. "We just hate to toss people out of a job," says former Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who retired this year after decades of attacking goofy government spending.  Consider, for example, the Rural Electrification Administration. This agency was launched during the Depression to bring electricity and, later, telephone service to rural America, and it succeeded -- brilliantly. Nowadays, nearly every farm has a phone and electric lights. Yet the REA keeps right on going, making about $1 billion a year in low-interest loans to "rural" power and telephone co-operatives.
