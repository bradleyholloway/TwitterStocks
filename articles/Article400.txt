HARTFORD (AP) - State officials say that, starting Tuesday, it will become harder to match unemployed people with jobs, because Federal budget cuts are making it necessary to disconnect a computerized job-placement system.  The computer operation is being halted at a time when the state is trying to serve a growing number of unemployed workers.  Now, the Employment Security Division must rely solely on its staff, which has been reduced by more than half since October, to find work for the jobless.  The division still will rely to a limited degree on computers to collect information on available jobs, but the main computer system will not be used because programming and maintenance would be too expensive, according to Theodore W. Hatcher, executive director of the division.  The division, which is federally financed, handles unemployment compensation, job placement and related services. Its budget is being cut $3.3 million.
