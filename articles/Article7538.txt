 Alcoa Strike Ends as Two Unions Agree To Cuts in Benefits and to Wage Freezes   By By Mark Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1986  The United Steelworkers and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers unions also agreed to similar contract terms with Reynolds Metals Co., Richmond, Va., which coordinated bargaining strategy with Pittsburgh-based Alcoa. After breaking off talks May 31 with both producers, the unions kept working at Reynolds, the No. 2 domestic producer, on a day-to-day extension of the prior pact.  The agreement falls short of the goals sought by both sides. The unions had sought recovery of any givebacks through profit-sharing, but instead settled for a labor-management committee to study the issue. The producers, meanwhile, beset with an oversupply of primary aluminum, sluggish prices, and high energy and labor costs, initially proposed that the unions accept a $2.90-an-hour cut in wages and benefits. The unions countered with a demand for a 3%, or 40-cent-an-hour, increase in the average hourly wage of $13.
