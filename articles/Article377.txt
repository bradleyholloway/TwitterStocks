TORONTO, Jan. 8â€” Massey-Ferguson Ltd., the financially troubled farm equipment company, today reported a loss of $194.8 million (in United States currency) for the year ended Oct. 31, exceeding expectations. The figure compares with a $225.2 million loss for the fiscal year 1980.  Worldwide sales for 1981 were $2.65 billion, down 15 percent from $3.13 billion in 1980. The 1981 loss for the Toronto-based company includes a gain on foreign currency transaction of $28.5 million and extraordinary charges and reorganization costs amounting to $5.1 million. The 1980 figures include a provision for a reorganization expense of $28.5 million and a foreign exchange loss of $76.8 million.  In a statement, Victor A. Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of Massey-Ferguson, attributed the loss to ''the combination of high interest rates and weak commodity prices, which impacted severely on the farm and industrial machinery industries worldwide.'' Situation Worsened  The company lost $108.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1981, after provision for a foreign exchange loss of $38.2 million and extraordinary charges and reorganization costs of $22.6 million. It lost $162.3 million in the similar 1980 quart er, after provision for a foreign exchange loss of $27.8 million and extraordinary charges of$28.5 million. Mr. Rice said that ''in the fo urth quarter, when some improvement in world markets was expected, th e situation instead worsened.'' He added: ''Sales, at $705 millio n, were down 17 percent from 1980.  ''The U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies, commodity prices dropped and in the two largest markets - North America and Europe - farm machinery sales declined even further.''  Commenting on Massey-Ferguson's financial results, David Schulman, a stock market analyst, said that for the first three quarters of fiscal 1981, the company had shown improved results, with a small profit of $3 million recorded for the third quarter. But, in the final quarter, Massey ''was bagged by high interest costs and lousy commodity markets,'' he said. Cutbacks Already Made  Mr. Schulman, of the Montreal securities firm, Geoffrion Leclerc Inc., said the company had already taken steps, including major staff cutbacks and the selling of many subsidiaries, to overcome its difficulties.
