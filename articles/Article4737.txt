 Ginnie Mae Sued By Lender Group Over Fee Increase   By By Michel McQueen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1987  The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, charges that so-called Ginnie Mae violated several federal laws in seeking to impose the increase through administrative procedures. The laws concerned include those requiring an adequate comment period and minimizing fees in the program. Previous Reagan administration attempts to raise Ginnie Mae fees through the budget process have been blocked by Congress.
