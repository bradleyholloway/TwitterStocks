 U.S. Media Firms Restrict Staff, Threatening Coverage in Iraq   By Angwin, Julia, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2004  In the wake of two attempted kidnappings of its reporters, the New York Times also has asked its reporters to stay within city limits, for now. Still, the newspaper plans to rotate a few more reporters to its Baghdad bureau in the next two weeks. "I think you have to ask yourself periodically, 'Is it safe to be there at all?' But so far, the answer has been quick and unanimous, 'Yes,' " said Executive Editor Bill Keller.  Other reporters are staying inside, in part because this weekend's anniversary of the toppling of the Saddam Hussein statue was expected to prompt a new wave of violence in Baghdad. "We've told them to stay in their resident hotels and not to venture out for even midlevel stories," said John Stack, vice president of news gathering at News Corp.'s Fox News Channel.
