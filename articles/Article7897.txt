 Chief of Drexel Testifies on Behalf Of Prosecution   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1989  Frederick Joseph, chief executive officer of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., testified on behalf of the government in the federal racketeering and fraud trial of five officials of Princeton/Newport Limited Partnership and a former Drexel trader.  Appearing relaxed with his hands folded before him, Mr. Joseph explained Drexel's restrictions on trading by Drexel employees in the stock of a client. Mr. Joseph said that, for years, Drexel has had in place training programs and policy manuals that prohibit employees from trading securities on Drexel's "restricted list." Securities are put on that list, he said, when Drexel has knowledge of inside information that may change the securities' prices, or when Drexel is selling securities in a public offering for the company.
