 The All-Digital War --- TV Crews Plan to Employ A Range of High-Tech Gear Unavailable in 1991 Conflict   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2003  The new gear means more reporters can send dispatches faster and from farther afield. Some TV correspondents are expected to travel solo, armed with satellite videophones that let them send live signals from their "embedded" positions with U.S. troops. Others will use lightweight digital cameras and new, smaller satellite equipment to beam their reports to the states. The prices of the gear, most of it available off the shelf, have fallen so far that even freelance journalists can file video reports.  Satellite providers such as Intelsat Ltd., a Bermuda-based operator, are gearing up to receive the expected flood of signals. Twenty-two thousand miles above the Earth, Intelsat satellite No. 902 recently joined two beams to spotlight Iraq, Turkey, and Kuwait so that clients Fox and Sky News, among others, can better send their reports home. At Inmarsat Ventures PLC, a London-based satellite operator, traffic on its network rose fivefold overnight after Sept. 11 and hasn't let up since, says Michael Butler, Inmarsat's managing director.  The new technology also extends to capturing and editing the video images. Some correspondents are using lipstick cameras, cylindrical digital devices smaller than a pack of cigarettes that are typically mounted on a helmet or car. CNN correspondent Frank Buckley used a lipstick camera Monday to take pictures from the cockpit of a U.S. jet flying over Iraq's southern no-fly zone. Network crews will be equipped to edit their digital video reports on their laptop computers; in 1991, such work required two 70-pound tape mixers.
