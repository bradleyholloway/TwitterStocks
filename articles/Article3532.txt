 Labor Department to Publish New Consumer Price Index --- Strong Consumer Spending Pushes Up Projections For 1st-Quarter Growth   By By Jon E. Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2002  While the economy is still far from booming, and most economists say this doesn't change their longer-term outlook for a more-tepid-than-normal recovery, this changing short-term outlook has broad implications if it proves accurate. It could mean that corporate profits, which bore the brunt of the economic downturn last year, are close to bottoming, too. It seems to signal that the worst of the layoffs is past. And economists increasingly believe it means that the Federal Reserve Board is finished lowering interest rates and will gradually turn its attention to small increases in rates later in the year.  For a sense of how the economic outlook is starting to change, consider Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with Wells Fargo & Co., the San Francisco bank. He started out the year expecting economic growth to be flat in the first three months of 2002. While businesses might start to rebuild inventories after slashing them at a record rate in the final months of 2001, he figured consumers would pull back after bingeing on cut-rate automobiles late last year. Instead, retail sales proved stronger than expected, and Wells Fargo banking clients peppered Mr. Sohn with anecdotes of a turnaround.
