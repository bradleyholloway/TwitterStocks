 Green Thumb / Growing Your Money: Insuring a Teen Driver for Less; 'Accident Forgiveness' and Other Tricks for Racking Up Savings   By Binkley, Christina, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  There's ample reason for insurance policies for teens to be pricey. Teens are dangerous. Their crash rate per mile driven is four times that of drivers older than 19. More than half have an accident within their first year of driving. And here's the scary part: according to one study cited by Allstate Corp., 61% of teens said they take risks because they're convinced that they're good drivers.  There's plenty a parent can do to bring down the cost. The best part is that many of these things are supposed to make teens better drivers. Several insurers, including State Farm and the Automobile Club of Southern California, offer discounts if a teen takes a special driver's safety course. The Automobile Club -- AAA's largest affiliate -- offers a 4.5% discount for a teen who goes through its in-house course.  Other tips include raising the family's deductible as high as possible and being careful to assign the teen to a car that's less expensive to insure overall. "Instead of putting them on the Maserati, put them on the Honda," says Carol Thorp, the auto club's spokeswoman.
