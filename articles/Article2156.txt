 Clean Harbors to Take Charge for Rejection of Its Incinerator Plan   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1990  The waste cleanup and hauling company said the one-time charge will be related to a write-down of its investment in the incinerator. The state Department of Environmental Protection, in a decision that followed the recommendation of the state Public Health Department, said the company's site in Braintree isn't suitable for the project. It said the site is in a heavily populated area and lacks an adequate buffer zone between it and the area's residents.
