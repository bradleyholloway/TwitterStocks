 American Media to Sell Five of Its Magazine Titles   By Dennis K. Berman and Sarah Ellison, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  Private-equity firms Evercore Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought American Media in 1999 with an eye to transforming the tabloid publisher into a legitimate consumer media concern. Three years ago American Media and its chief executive, David Pecker, embarked on a strategy to diversify away from the National Enquirer and Star, its two big celebrity-focused magazines. The company spent $350 million to buy Weider Publications, owner of seven magazines, including Shape and Men's Fitness. At the time, Mr. Pecker called the move one that would "transform" American Media "into a major media company."  Ad revenue for the National Enquirer fell 15% in May versus a year ago. At Shape, ad revenue dropped 3.4%. Ad revenue was up 14% at Men's Fitness and up 4.4% at Country Weekly, according to data from Publisher's Information Bureau.
