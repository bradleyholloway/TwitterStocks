 Far-Out Guru Behind U.S. Best-Seller Arouses Fear and Violence in Calcutta   By By Anthony Spaeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1988  Mr. Batra, an economics professor at Southern Methodist University in the U.S., cites Mr. Sarkar 34 times in the book, which has made its author an overnight millionaire. He describes the guru only sketchily as a "leading scholar from India who has profoundly enriched the literature of many disciplines."  In Calcutta, Mr. Sarkar's cult is feared and despised. In 1982, 16 of its members were burned alive by angry Calcutta mobs. Mr. Sarkar served six years in prison for conspiring to kill six of his acolytes (the conviction was reversed on appeal).  Today, Mr. Sarkar claims 4,500 full-time acolytes. Mr. Batra has been a follower of Mr. Sarkar since 1964 and says it was his perusal of one of Mr. Sarkar's books that convinced him history moves in cycles. Much of "The Great Depression of 1990" is a statistical argument that a cataclysmic downturn in the world's economic cycle is due in 1990.
