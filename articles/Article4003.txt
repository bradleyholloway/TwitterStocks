 Easco Corp. Board Rejects Group Bid To Take Over Firm   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1985  Easco Corp. said its board rejected an $18.50-a-share takeover offer by Equity Group Holdings, a Washington, D.C.-based investment partnership.  Easco also said it sued Equity Group in federal court here, alleging that the partnership failed to meet certain disclosure requirements while it accumulated a stake of about 15% in Easco.  Easco, a maker of hand tools and aluminum products, termed the Equity Group offer "inadequate and not in the best interests of Easco or its shareholders."
