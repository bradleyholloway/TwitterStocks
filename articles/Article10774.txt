 Financial Planners Propose Forming Regulatory Body --- Association Says Watchdog To Be Similar To NASD, Have SEC Oversight   By By Walt Bogdanich, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1985  The nation's largest association of financial planners and marketers of financial products formally proposed setting up a self-regulatory organization to police the fast-growing industry.  The 22,000-member International Association for Financial Planning said the watchdog group would be similar to the National Association of Securities Dealers, and would be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  "We feel financial planning, and people who do financial planning, should be required to meet some ethical, educational, and (professional) practice knowledge standards," said Hubert L. Harris Jr., executive director of the Atlanta-based association.
