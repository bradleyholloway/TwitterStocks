 Family Finances: Protecting Your Children's Inheritance   By Ransom, Diana, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2007  If you have kids and you're getting ready to say "I do" for the second time, it's also time to rethink how your assets will be apportioned in the event of your death.  Rather than assume the child will be "financially mature" at 18 or 21, Mr. [Jeffrey Skatoff] notes that trusts can be designed to distribute assets at older ages or in installments. For instance, the beneficiary might receive one-third of the trust balance at age 25, half of what's left when he or she turns 30 and the rest at 35.  Few people look to completely eliminate a spouse as an heir. And as a matter of law, that isn't possible in most states. Disinherited spouses can challenge the decedent's will and possibly receive an "elective share" of his or her assets, usually one half or a third of a person's estate, says New Jersey attorney Mr. [Steven Tarta].
