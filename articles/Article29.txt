QUESTION: A ball rolls onto the receiver's court in a tennis match just as he is about to return a serve. Who calls a let? Must it be called before or after the serve is returned?  Either player can call a let. According to ''The Code,'' issued by the United States Tennis Association for matches without officials, the call must be made before the serve is returned. This eliminates the two-chance option, in which a player can call a let after he fails to return a serve or any other shot properly.  QUESTION: How many teams in the National Football League have the Jets and the Giants failed to defeat during the regular season?  The Jets are 0-3 against Dallas, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington; they are 0-6 against Pittsburgh and Seattle. The Giants are 0-2 against Cincinnati and Oakland and 0-1 against Miami. QUESTION: No Mets' pitcher has ever hurled a no-hit game since the franchise came into existence in 1962. Does any other team, in either league and in its present city, have a current streak that long without a no-hit game?  Detroit's last no-hitter was thrown by Jim Bunning against Boston in 1958, and the Yankees' last one was Don Larsen's perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1956 World Series.  Milwaukee, Seattle and Toronto in the American League, and San Diego in the National League, have never experienced no-hit victories, but those clubs have been in existence fewer years than the Mets. QUESTION: A player on Team A in a National Basketball Association game accidentally taps the ball into his own basket. What happens? Also, if a free throw is made at the wrong basket?  The field goal is credited to Team B's score and is mentioned in a footnote. The Team B player nearest to the shooter is credited with the 2 points. Team A would get possession of the ball, just as it would after an ordinary field goal. On a free throw, if the mistake is discovered before time is in, the player is required to make another attempt at the correct basket. If the error is not caught by the end of the quarter, the point is credited to the team that made the free throw. QUESTION: What is the length of the intermission between games of a major league baseball doubleheader? What is the time between halves in the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the North American Soccer League? What is the time between periods in the National Hockey League?  In baseball, the second game begins 20 minutes after the end of the first, unless a longer wait, not to exceed 30 minutes, is declared by the umpire-in-chief and announced to the opposing managers.  The N.F.L. and the N.B.A. each have 15-minute intermissions between halves; the N.A.S.L. has a 12-minute intermission. The N.H.L. has 15-minute intervals between periods. QUESTION: A player in a National Hockey League game receives a pass in front of the opponent's goal. The puck lodges between the blade and the boot of his skate as he slides across the goal line before the whistle blows. Is it a goal? If not, where is the faceoff?  It is not a goal; the faceoff is in the end zone circle. QUESTION: When did Babe Ruth begin playing right field for the New York Yankees, and which two players were in the outfield with him for the most seasons?  Ruth joined the Yankees in 1920 and played right field. In 1921 and 1922, he was in left field while Bob Meusel was in right. In 1923, Ruth went back to right field and Meusel shifted to left. Earle Combs joined them in center field in 1925, and the three stayed together through the 1929 season. Meusel was gone in 1930, but Combs remained in the outfield with Ruth through 1933. Ruth left the Yankees after the 1934 season. QUESTION: What are the citizenship requirements for competing in World Cup soccer?  A player must be either a native or a naturalized citizen of the country for which he competes. However, a naturalized citizen must never have competed for another country in the World Cup. Giorgio Chinaglia, for example, is a United States citizen, but he is prohibited from playing for this country because he once competed for Italy. QUESTION: Who was the last goaltender in the National Hockey League to finish his career without wearing a face mask? Also, didn't Ed Johnston of the Boston Bruins appear in every game one season?  Joe Daley, who ended his career with Detroit in 1971-72, did not wear a mask. Johnston, in 1963-64, appeared in all 70 Boston games. QUESTION: How many times did Joe DiMaggio miss the opening-day game?  DiMaggio missed six games and appeared in seven in his 13 years in the major leagues (1936-51, with three years, 1943-45, in military service). QUESTION: What were the career statistics of Scott Laidlaw and Golden Richards in the National Football League? What are they doing now?  Laidlaw, with Dallas from 1975 through 1979, appeared in 67 games, rushing 250 times for 997 yards and a 4.0 yard average, and he scored nine touchdowns. He also had 72 receptions for 652 yards and a 9.1 average, and he scored three touchdowns. He played two games for the Giants in 1980, rushing five times for 10 yards and catching four passes for 32 yards. He owns a Western wear store in Dallas.  Richards, a wide receiver, played with Dallas and Chicago from 1973 through 1979. He caught 122 passes for 2,136 yards and a 17.5 yard average. He scored 17 touchdowns on passes and one on a punt return. He now works for an oil company in Salt Lake City. QUESTION: When the Atlanta Braves won 13 consecutive games at the start of the 1982 season, the streak was referred to as a modern record. Does that mean some team won more games before the modern era?  St. Louis of the Union Association, which lasted one season, set a record of 20 games in 1884. The modern era is considered to have begun when the American League was established in 1901. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Question Box is a regular feature of SportsMonday.
