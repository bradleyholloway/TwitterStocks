MIAMI, Jan. 25â€” The South Bay Club condominium project in Miami Beach had a pool, a health spa and its own marina - everything but buyers. After months of heavy advertising, only six purchasers had closed on 347 apartments.  Last week, the Canadian-based Daon Corporation, one of the most active condominium converters in South Florida, pulled the South Bay Club and two other condominiums, a total of 1,000 units, off the market and began advertising ''the triumphant return of luxury rentals.''  Earlier, another Canadian developer, the Cadillac-Fairview Corporation, the largest publicly held development concern in North America, suspended construction on three new luxury condominium projects with 1,000 units. High Interest Rates Blamed  The slump in the sale of condominiums is also showing up in California and Chicago, and to to a lesser extent in the New York metropolitan area. But the problem is worst in Florida, which, with 500,000 units, is home to half the nation's stock of condominiums.  The reason for the slump, say Daon officials and other developers, real estate analysts and lenders, is a lack of demand from buyers unwilling or unable to take out mortgages at high interest rates. The only exceptions to the slump seem to be the expensive condominiums, like many in Manhattan, that attract wealthy buyers who can pay cash or qualify for mortgages, no matter what the rate is.  ''The best interest rates are 13 3/4 percent and the top is 15 1/4 percent,'' said Wayne Johnson, vice president of the Arvida Mortgage Company and president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of Greater Miami. ''If the price of a condominium is $150,000, a 2 percent difference in the interest rate can make a difference of $300 to $400 a month in the payments. That's a big factor. A buyer who might be able to qualify at 13 percent might not at 14 3/4 percent.''  Mortgage rates, like all interest rates, are linked to the prime, which in the last year has gone from lows of about 10 to highs beyond 20. Buying Linked to Necessity  ''People are buying new construction,'' Mr. Johnson continued, ''signing contracts and hoping rates will come down before they have to close six months to a year from now. Sales on existing construction are slow. About the only people who are buying are those who have to buy.''  Edwin J. Glickman, senior vice president of the New York-based Sybedon Corporation, and one of the developers of the Galleria condominiums, now selling for about $500 a square foot in Manhattan, agreed that while the luxury market did not seem to be suffering, high interest rates had caused ''a significant dropping off'' in the middle-class market around the country.  The New York City market has not declined so much, partly because inflation has already brought new apartment construction to a standstill. Existing buildings are being converted to cooperatives, New York's version of the condominium movement, at a rapid rate in all the boroughs but Staten Island, according to the State Attorney General's office, which must approve conversion plans. The condominium buyer actually purchases a unit; the co-op buyer purchases shares in a building.  Unlike conversions in other cities, New York projects generally offer rental tenants preferential prices for their shares in a co-op building, and this has helped sustain the demand for apartments ranging in price from $5,000 a room to $50,000 and up.  But in Monmouth, N.J., Mr. Glickman said, a developer offering new condominiums in the $125,000 price range was unable to sell. ''The buyers were there, but they couldn't buy with the interest rates,'' Mr. Glickman said. Developer Underwrites Loans  Mr. Glickman said that his concern had arranged for the developer to ''warehouse,'' or underwrite himself, $10 million in loans to individual purchasers who were willing to put 25 percent down. The developer then obtained financing for most of the balance himself and intends to sell the loan to institutional lenders when interest rates improve.  The warehousing of loans to purchasers is one of a number of techniques that developers are using to get expensive, empty condominiums off their hands. Some are renting all or some of their new condominium units. Others are delaying conversion or have postponed or suspended construction.  On Miami Beach, the 1,162-unit Roney Plaza, which announced its conversion to condominiums last year, is instead giving its elderly tenants leases until 1982, a reprieve that even city officials had been unable to deliver. A year ago, the Miami Beach City Commission adopted a 90-day emergency moratorium on such conversions, but it was thrown out by a state court.  ''It's prolonging the agony,'' said Dr. Morris Zucker, 87 years old, a retired dentist from the Bronx. He lives in a $500-a-month one-bedroom apartment. ''They say, 'Look, we gave you a two-year lease. You should fall on your knees.' But the years fly - then what?''  The purchase price of his apartment, he said, is $111,000. ''If I should buy this place,'' he said, ''my monthly expense would be close to $1,600. I simply can't do it.'' 1 2 NEXT PAGE >
