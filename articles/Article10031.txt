 PURSUITS; Food & Drink: Wine Notes   By Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2007  Relax. Brunello ages well for a very long time, and these were excellent years. With proper care, they will be wonderful. More broadly, we are asked so often about laying down wines for newborns that we devoted an entire chapter to this in our most recent book, "Wine for Every Day and Every Occasion." While there are many great possibilities -- top-notch Bordeaux and Port are classic examples -- we're particularly fond of laying down fine Sauternes. Not only does it get better and better with age, but it even gets prettier and prettier in the clear bottle, which means your child can enjoy the wine long before he or she can actually drink it. Unfortunately, the best Sauternes estates don't make wine in every vintage, so this might not always be possible. However, the best wines from all over the world often aren't released for three years or so after harvest anyway, so you have plenty of time to investigate this. Remember that if you are going to lay down a case for the kids, proper storage is important.
