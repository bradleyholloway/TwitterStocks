 Piedmont Mining Expects to Report Profit for 4th Period   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 2, 1990  CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Piedmont Mining Co. expects to report fourth-quarter net income of about $210,000, or one cent a share, compared with a net loss of $17,113 a year earlier, Robert M. Shields Jr., chairman and chief executive, said.  Piedmont Mining, which mines and explores for gold in North and South Carolina, said sales eased to about $1.8 million from $1.9 million. The improved bottom line stemmed from increased gold production and a rally in gold prices that began in September, Mr. Shields said.
