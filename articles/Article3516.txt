 Tech Watch: Coming to a TV Screen Near You: The Web   By Grant, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2006  Some of the products displayed in Las Vegas already are available to consumers. For instance, companies such as Dell and Sony have started to sell computers with Intel's new Viiv technology that allows viewers to watch select Internet content on their TVs. As part of Viiv's launch, Intel has announced deals with about 10 major content suppliers, including the ESPN and MTV channels, America Online and the NBC network. Other Web-based content can be watched on TV using Viiv, but it's not as easy to access as the content provided by Intel's partners.  Computers sold with Viiv range from about $999 for a Hewlett-Packard m7360y desktop to $1,858 for a Dell XPS 400. Intel executives predict that within a year more than 200 computer models will have Viiv installed.
