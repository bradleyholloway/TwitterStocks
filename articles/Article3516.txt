 Fund Manager Endorses H-P, Compaq Deal   By By Scott Thurm, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2002  Alliance's support is a much-needed boost for H-P Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, after months of bad publicity and squabbles with dissident director Walter Hewlett. But it is unclear if Alliance's endorsement presages a wave of support from other big H-P shareholders. A fund manager of a second large institutional investor backed the deal in a separate interview last week, calling it a "well-conceived merger." The manager didn't want to be named because the institution rarely discusses its holdings in individual stocks.  H-P also may gain from ongoing trading in its shares, as shareholders who don't like the deal sell to investors who are more likely to support the merger. For example, Safeco Asset Management Co. sold roughly one-third of its H-P stock -- more than 467,000 shares -- in the three months ended Dec. 31, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fund manager Tom Rath said the sales were partly motivated by his unhappiness with the proposed Compaq merger, which he calls "the wrong way strategically."  His analysis of the deal may not cheer H-P and Compaq executives. Mr. [Lewis Sanders] said he isn't counting on the deal to create an innovative high-tech leader. Instead, he thinks the combined H-P and Compaq would be better able to cut costs to compete with industry leader Dell Computer Corp. in building cheap personal computers and computer servers.
