 E-Business and Technology: Healtheon/WebMD Corp.'s Loss Widens   By By Ann Carrns, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2000  Investors pummeled the company's stock, partly because Healtheon/WebMD said it doesn't expect to fully integrate its professional Web site with doctors' existing practice-management software -- a step it is counting on to attract more physicians and significantly boost transaction revenue-until the third quarter of this year.  In Nasdaq Stock Market trading as of 4 p.m. Friday, Healtheon/WebMD fell $6.5625, or 11%, to $51.9375. There also was some confusion in the market over whether the quarterly results -- which the company reported in several ways to reflect the impact of acquisitions -- had met analysts' expectations. Research firm First Call/Thompson Financial was unable to provide a consensus per-share earnings estimate for the quarter, saying it lacked sufficient information to interpret the numbers.  Healtheon/WebMD reported a net loss of $234.7 million, or $1.98 a diluted share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, 1999. That compares with a net loss of $18.2 million, or 34 cents a share, for the previous-year quarter, before the company was publicly traded. Healtheon went public in February 1999. Revenue grew to $33.2 million from $15.6 million in the year-ago quarter.
