 Tools for the Young Spy; Working Surveillance Gadgets Emerge as Surprise Hit Toys With Elusive 'Tween' Market   By Kim, Queena Sook, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2003  The shift has challenged the toy industry to come up with role- playing props, a nascent category known in the trade as "action-figure role-playing toys." Over the past couple of years, movies that once would have spawned action figures have given rise instead to action props. After last year's "Spider-Man," the Web Blaster, a palm- activated toy from Marvel Enterprises Inc.'s Toy Biz unit, sold well in many stores. "Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones" launched Hasbro Inc.'s hand-held Jedi light saber. The smash hit this year is Hulk Hands, a pair of giant green rubber appendages from Toy Biz. Sales of the toy are dwarfing those of the action figure based on the 2003 movie "Hulk."  Wild Planet's technology-based toys are an evolution of the role- playing aides. They "have really gotten kids imagination," says Manny Francione, Toys "R" Us vice president of merchandising of core toys. Since launching Spy Gear in 1998, Wild Planet's sales have jumped more than fourfold to $48 million.  Danny Grossman, Wild Planet's 46-year-old founder, came to the toy business by way of a stint in the U.S. foreign service serving in the Soviet Union (but definitely not as a spy, he says). Toy companies can win back tweens, he says. "I don't accept that kids older than eight- years-old won't use products that the toy industry makes," Mr. Grossman says. "That may mean that we make products traditionally called 'toys' -- but it may not."
