 Tobacco Companies, Texas Are Said Near Settlement of Lawsuit   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1998  With jury selection set to begin Monday in Texas's closely watched lawsuit against the tobacco industry, state Attorney General Dan Morales and industry representatives met here to discuss a possible settlement.  Mr. Morales, who has said repeatedly that any settlement would have to go through him, couldn't be reached for comment. But one industry representative said that he met with "principals of the tobacco industry" and U.S. District Judge David Folsom, who is presiding over the case. The two sides are close to an agreement, according to the industry representative.
