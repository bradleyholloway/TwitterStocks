 Massey Coal Strike Is Testing UMW Strategy --- Issue of Uniform Contract Leads to Violent Confrontation   By By Seth H. Lubove, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1985  Today, the conflict in this Appalachia coal region where the Hatfields and McCoy clans used to feud, doesn't involve a fight against an industry as in the past, but instead has focused on one operator -- A.T. Massey Coal Co. The once-invincible United Mine Workers union has pitted itself against Massey Coal, a venture owned by St. Joe Minerals Corp., a Fluor Corp. unit, and Scallop Coal Corp., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, because the company didn't sign last September's labor contract between the union and the industry's Bituminous Coal Operators Association.  Massey Coal says that about 1,500 union miners have been on strike at 25 mines and seven of its preparation plants since Oct. 1. The UMW contends that the Massey mines and subsidiaries -- a maze of 119 or so companies (some nonunion) operating in four states -- should be considered one large employer and bargain as such.  The outcome of this confrontation is critical to the union and the industry. A UMW victory almost certainly would show that the selective-strike strategy is effective in pressuring operators into accepting uniform contracts. And it also would block a movement by operators, notably A.T. Massey, to allow mine subsidiaries to bargain with the union on their own.
