 M&A Activity in Southeast Asia Is Likely to Heat Up, HSBC Says   By Man, Sai, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2004  Crucial Southeast Asian markets such as Singapore and Malaysia, where companies are on the hunt for overseas expansion, are likely to make up a big part of the M&A activity, said Chang Tou Chen, managing director and head of Southeast Asian corporate finance and advisory at HSBC's investment-banking arm.  "Singapore and Malaysia are already active markets and are likely to remain so. The momentum of transactions should continue into next year," he said in a recent interview. "In Malaysia and Singapore, the trend is looking overseas for acquisitions," a pattern that should continue into next year, said Mr. Chang. He didn't say which sectors in these two countries are likely to see activity.  Mr. Chang said HSBC is doubling the size of its Southeast Asian investment-banking team in Singapore in anticipation of more M&A business, but he declined to provide any details about the size of the team or about deals HSBC may be working on, or hopes to get.
