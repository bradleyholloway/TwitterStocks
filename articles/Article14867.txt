 World Wire [4]  By Compiled by Monua Janah, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1991  Thousands in Pakistan are condemned to perpetual slavery by a system of bonded labor that is particularly harsh on children, the nation's human rights commission said. The non-governmental commission's report for 1990, issued last week, said bonded workers become trapped by taking loans from their bosses. As most of the workers are illiterate, they cannot dispute the bosses' records of the debt, which is passed on to children. The report said a 1988 Supreme Court ruling awarding bonded laborers more rights was largely ignored and labor laws banning children from working in factories and mines were disregarded. It painted a grim picture of human rights in Pakistan in general, saying the nation "lagged far behind countries even at comparable levels of development."  Germany said it sent extra guards to its borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia to counter a surge in illegal immigrants. Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Germany, whose post-war constitution lays down an open-door policy toward asylum-seekers, is considering flying illegal immigrants immediately back to their countries. He said an estimated 42,000 people entered Germany illegally through Poland and Czechoslovakia since the start of 1991. He said an additional 200 guards were sent to the Polish and Czechoslovak borders and more helicopter reconnaissance units would arrive within days. Ultimately, Germany would have to amend its constitution to limit asylum rights, he said.
