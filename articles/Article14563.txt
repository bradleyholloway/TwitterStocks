 Industrials Surge 33.04, to 2177.68, But Many Analysts Are Cautious   By By William Power and David Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1989  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had plunged 23.93 points on the first 1989 trading day Tuesday, rebounded on a wave of futures-related program buying to finish 33.04 higher yesterday, at 2177.68. The Dow tested its highest level since the October 1987 crash -- 2183.50 -- but it couldn't quite vault it.  Program trading has been alive and well so far in 1989. Just as futures-related trading programs sped up the Tuesday decline, they accelerated yesterday's advance, traders said. Though strength in the dollar and the bond market gave stocks their support, shares exploded because of heavy buying of stock-index futures contracts in Chicago late yesterday.  A technical factor touched off the futures rally that led to the stock move. Traders had been waiting for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock futures contract to hit the 280 level, considered a major resistance point. When traders pushed the contract to that level, a large amount of "short covering" -- or buying to offset earlier sales -- sent the S&P soaring.
