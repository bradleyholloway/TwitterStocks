 Inside a Washington Insider   By Colson, Charles W, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1995  This assertion of impotence would surprise Mr. [Clark Clifford]'s former clients as well, including one who deserted my practice for Mr. Clifford's in the early 1960s (when I was a Republican in exile in a city owned by Democrats). For the then rather princely sum of $50,000, my client explained, he would be allowed to attend one breakfast at which Mr. Clifford would hold forth about the Kennedy White House. Not bad for no "influence."  Messrs. [Douglas Frantz] and [David McKean] spend a great deal of time contemplating Mr. Clifford's guilt or innocence in the BCCI debacle, on which they are unable to render judgment. In 1978, Mr. Clifford was hired by Agha Hasan Abedi, the head of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International, to represent various Arab investors who sought control of a large Washington bank. Whether he knew the investors were front men for BCCI depends on the veracity of contradictory accounts. Certainly Mr. Abedi understood that Mr. Clifford "guaranteed a measure of respectability and prestige." With Mr. Clifford's assurances -- "There is no function of any kind on the part of BCCI" -- the Federal Reserve Board approved the takeover in 1981. Mr. Clifford became the bank's chairman and faced indictment a few years later when BCCI became the object of criminal investigations. Only ill health spared him a humiliating trial.
