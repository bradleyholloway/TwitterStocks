 Senate Panel Supports FSX Fighter Project --- Plan Faces Fight in Congress As Members Criticize Japan's Trade Policies   By By Eduardo Lachica, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1989  The Bush administration narrowly won the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's support for the joint U.S.-Japan FSX fighter project, but it still faces a bruising battle over the issue on the Senate floor and possibly in the House as well.  In the first test of congressional sentiment on the FSX, the committee voted 9-8 against a resolution to kill the project by disapproving the transfer to Japan of U.S. F-16 technology on which the new Japanese fighter would be based. The panel subsequently agreed to bring the resolution of disapproval, which was sponsored by Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.), to the Senate floor with a recommendation that lawmakers reject it and thus let the project proceed.
