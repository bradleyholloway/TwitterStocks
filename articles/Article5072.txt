 NCNB's Legal Staff in Texas Mushrooms   By By Christi Harlan and Milo Geyelin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1989  Last year, NCNB Corp. bought the 60 failed banks belonging to First RepublicBank Corp. of Texas. This year, NCNB is hiring dozens of in-house attorneys to cope with the mound of lawsuits it inherited.  With assistance from the Houston law firm of Baker & Botts, Mr. Grim directed the computerization of the bank's legal records, enabling NCNB Texas to track the 3,000 pending lawsuits it inherited. The computer is also being used to check billings from outside law firms, some of which are likely to get the ax. "We're using over 300 law firms in the state of Texas, and that's just not manageable," Mr. Grim says.  Part of the impetus for NCNB Texas and other banks to beef up their in-house law departments comes from the FDIC, which now has a stake in almost every big Texas bank. The FDIC is paying the salaries of the 17 lawyers in Mr. Grim's department who are working for a special asset bank created to handle the defaulted loans and repossessed real estate spun off from the old First RepublicBank system. The FDIC is negotiating a similar arrangement with Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio, in its acquisition of the failed banks of MCorp of Dallas.
