 Auto Makers Plan More Factories in North America --- Despite Global Overcapacity, Executives See Long-Term Strategic Benefits   By By Robert L. Simison, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1999  Honda Motor Co. is expected to announce today plans to build a fourth North American auto factory, probably in Alabama. Earlier this week, General Motors Corp.'s board gave preliminary approval to plans for a new Cadillac assembly plant near Lansing, Mich. Toyota Motor Corp., with a new truck factory in Indiana going into production, is planning a 50% expansion of the plant's capacity by next year. And in South Carolina, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is expanding its factory.  Meanwhile, other auto makers are gradually enlarging their capabilities for building cars and light trucks, by speeding up production rates, installing more-productive equipment, redesigning vehicles to be more easily assembled and adding work shifts. By 2005, auto-making capacity in the U.S., Canada and Mexico will total 21.8 million vehicles, up 11% from this year's 19.6 million, according to the AutoFacts consulting unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  In addition, there are fundamental reasons for auto makers to bet more money on North America. Demographic projections favor this market over Europe or Japan, auto makers say. The Mexican market is expanding. With auto factories in the 1990s running at 90% of capacity or more -- when 80% is considered full production -- there is almost no real overcapacity in North America. Instead, most experts argue that there is a shortage of capacity for making pickups and sport-utility vehicles, the segments for which most of the new factories will produce vehicles.
