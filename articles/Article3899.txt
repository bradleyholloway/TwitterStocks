 Oil Fuels Unrest in Nigeria; Seeking a Voice Ahead of 2007 Election, Protesters Target Pumps   By Oster, Shai, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2005  "Kula was a test case," says Igbe Sara Igbe, a former security and finance adviser to the local governor and a leader of the Kula community. Speaking two months after the protest from a luxurious walled compound in Port Harcourt, Nigeria's oil capital, he says he is mobilizing support for a regionwide oil shutdown to force the government to accept a presidential candidate from the Delta.  The Delta region -- home to two-thirds of Nigeria's oil production -- is shaping up to be an early battlefield. Nigeria produces about 3% of the world's oil supply, mostly from the mangrove swamps of the Delta, making it the world's seventh-biggest exporter and an important provider to the U.S.  Oil company executives also say much of the recent protesting is grandstanding and has nothing to do with real grievances against the companies themselves. "We're simply being used as a lightning rod to bring the attention of government to some perceived injustice," says Chris Finlayson, head of Shell's Africa operations.
