 European IPOs Steam Ahead; Renewable Energy, Legrand Anticipate Second-Quarter Deals   By Langendorf, Marc, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2006  Among the deals expected that could top 1 billion euros apiece are IPOs from Le-grand SA in France, Renewable Energy in Norway, postal group Oesterreichische Post AG in Austria and United Kingdom retailer Debenham. Wacker Chemie, a German specialty chemical firm, is in the midst of selling up to 15 million shares for as much as 80 euros ($97) each. Order-taking for the offering, which could raise round about 1.2 billion euros, ends in the middle of April.  Some of the new quarter's expected stock sales are tied to recent mergers and acquisitions. Industrial gases group Linde AG has already said it wants to raise between 1.4 billion euros and 1.8 billion euros through the sale of new shares and between 1.2 billion euros and 1.6 billion euros via the placement of a convertible bond to finance its purchase of BOC Group PLC.  The first quarter included a rights issue for BNP Paribas SA to help finance its acquisition of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA, as well as Erste Bank AG's sale of around 3 billion euros in shares. The biggest IPO of the quarter came from Qinetiq Group PLC, a U.K. defense-research group owned by the government and Carlyle Group LP, a private-equity firm.
