 Taco Bell Removes Scallions Following Outbreak of E.coli   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2006  "In an abundance of caution, we've decided to pull all green onions from our restaurants until we know conclusively whether they are the cause of the E. coli outbreak," said Greg Creed, president of Irvine, Calif.-based Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Yum Brands Inc.  The Taco Bell chain reopened restaurants linked to the outbreak on New York's Long Island after the outlets were sanitized. And two of three New Jersey Taco Bells implicated have also reopened, with authorities awaiting test results on customers from the third place. The fast-food chain closed nine outlets in suburban Philadelphia after health officials reported four people falling ill from E. coli.
