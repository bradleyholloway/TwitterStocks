 Cellphones in Cars -- Not So Bad?; Many Driving Activities Are Higher on the List Of Dangers, AAA Finds   By Karr, Albert R, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2003  "People may not recognize how distracted they are," says Peter Kissinger, the foundation's president. "For example, talking to a passenger seems quite safe, but even something that simple takes attention away from the road."  Only 28 of the 70 drivers were videotaped using cellphones while driving. "Cellphones didn't show up as the major distracter, either in crash analysis or in this study," says Jane Stutts, a researcher at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center.  She adds that technological advances are also distracting drivers, including in-vehicle navigation aids, computers with Internet access and even fax machines. In a sign of the times, Homer Simpson on Fox TV's "Simpsons" cartoon show on Sunday was using a fax machine, kitchen appliances and other paraphernalia while driving, and as he was about to head over a cliff, sent a fax calling for help.
