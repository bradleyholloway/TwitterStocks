 Business World Europeans Better Learn to Love a Good Scrap   By By Holman W. Jenkins Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1998  In what was otherwise a fairly Germanic presentation by Ulrich Hartmann, chairman of the energy conglomerate Veba, four words we grasped without the aid of a translator. The words were "stock price" and "shareholder value."  Veba's treasurer, Rolf Pohlig, assured us that the German language has its own tongue-twisters for these concepts, but he also explained that since Veba prides itself on being an "international" company, its folks habitually recur to the English.  Veba has been conspicuous among the wave of German firms to embrace shareholder capitalism, listing itself on the New York Stock Exchange, shedding unpromising businesses. Mr. Hartmann is even ready to reckon with the ire of the German left to introduce a stock-option plan that would enrich executives if they perform well.
