 Scott Paper Co. To Pay $475,000 In Settling Case   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1987  Scott Paper Co. agreed to pay $475,000 in fines to settle Labor Department charges of job-safety and record-keeping violations at the company's Winslow, Maine, manufacturing plant.  The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it served citations on Scott early last week, alleging 121 safety violations, including two willful violations, at the plant. The charges concerned alleged electrical hazards, faulty scaffolding, inadequate machine guards, and an unguarded floor opening.  In September, OSHA proposed penalties of $813,000 against the company on charges of willfully underreporting injuries at the plant, which produces sanitary paper for facial and toilet tissue. At that time, OSHA said the plant underreported such injuries as fractures, back injuries, hernias, strains and sprains, and charged 203 willful record-keeping violations. The agency also said it was conducting a full safety and health inspection at the Winslow plant.
