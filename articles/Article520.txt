 To the Editor:  Re ''The Courage of Others' Convictions'' (editorial, Feb. 13):  I am not, nor have I ever been, a fan of country music. But on March 10, 2003, I did become a fan of the Dixie Chicks, when the band's lead singer, Natalie Maines, made an anti-Bush remark to London concertgoers.  Perhaps, if at that time, Congress and the media had the singular courage of Natalie Maines, there would be no reason to become a fan, and more than 3,000 young Americans would be alive today, enjoying the music of their choice.
