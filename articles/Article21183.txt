 Merrill's Top Two Eurobond Executives In London Quit to Pursue Other Interests   By By Stephen D. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1988  In a terse memorandum to its London staff yesterday, the big U.S. investment bank announced that managing directors Steven Licht and Caleb Watts will leave later this year "by mutual agreement." The Merrill Lynch statement said the separation is amicable and that Messrs. Licht and Watts will work during the transition "to provide for management succession."  Over the past year, Messrs. Licht and Watts battled unsuccessfully to maintain their autonomy from colleagues at Merrill's headquarters in New York, according to officials familiar with the power struggle.

Tully, president and chief operating officer of parent Merrill Lynch & Co. confirmed these and other "organizational changes" in a public announcement last month.
