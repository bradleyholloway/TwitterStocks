 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Cathy Trost, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 1986  The reduced jobless rate and increased complexity of tax preparations make it harder for many companies to find good temporary workers this year. Knight, Lamb & Gaylord, a Dearborn Heights, Mich., firm, runs ads, contacts employment agencies and recruits at college classes, but still can't locate well-qualified people. HFC Income Tax Service, a Household Finance Corp. unit, also sees more unqualified applicants.  In New England, HFC asks customers to suggest good temporaries. Beneficial Tax Centers, a Beneficial Corp. unit, offers regular employees $75 bonuses for referring temporaries; this doesn't help much. Some tax firms plan to start or expand tax-preparer schools. H&R Block Inc. adds advanced courses to encourage more returnees.  The National Council of Churches mediated a long-simmering dispute between farm workers in Ohio and Michigan and tomato and cucumber growers who supply Campbell. The New York church group created a panel to mediate on wages, benefits and working conditions; it may have been the first time a church group served as a labor mediator. The panel continues as a private labor relations board, says the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, Toledo.
