Citing a ''divergence of views as far as the immediate future'' of the team was concerned, the Cosmos yesterday dismissed Hennes Weisweiler, who had led the club to two North American Soccer League championship games in his two years as coach.  In a three-paragraph statement issued yesterday, the Cosmos said that Nesuhi Ertegun, the chairman of the board, had returned from several meetings with Weisweiler in Europe and that those meetings had indicated there were irreparable differences between the club and the West German coach. The statement also said that Weisweiler had ''indicated his desire to follow the games of the German National Team,'' which is playing in Spain during World Cup '82, and that the Cosmos were actively looking for a new coach with international credentials.  The Cosmos open training camp Feb.27 in the Bahamas, and would like to have the job filled by then. No mention was made whether Erol Yasin, Weisweiler's assistant and the coach of the Cosmos' indoor team, might take over on an interim basis.  Weisweiler, 61 years old, joined the Cosmos in the spring of 1980, and led them to the Soccer Bowl championship that season. Last year the Cosmos lost the Soccer Bowl to the Chicago Sting. Soon afterward Giorgio Chinaglia, the team's captain who had been feuding with Weisweiler throughout the season, called for the coach's dismissal. Chinaglia said Weisweiler had been remote without being strict; knowledgeable without being organized; had run short and pointless practices, and did not attend fan clinics or meetings. He threatened not to play for the Cosmos again if Weisweiler remained as coach.  At the time the Cosmos' board of directors issued a statement backing Weisweiler. But Weisweiler, who brought to the Cosmos a reputation as a disciplinarian, also had run-ins with other players.  Carlos Alberto, the Brazilian sweeper quit the team because of difficulties with the coach, and Johann Neeskens, a midfielder from the Netherlands who was popular for his aggressive tackling, was suspended last year for missing an airplane flight and because of other differences with Weisweiler. Neeskens was brought back, however, because of his popularity with the fans.  Thomas D. Werblin, the general manager, said Weisweiler's dismissal was not prompted by player opinion. ''It came strictly from the top,'' Werblin said. ''I can answer with 100 percent certainty that this had nothing to do with what any of the players said.''  Weisweiler and Chinaglia were in Europe and unavailable for comment. Phone calls to Ertegun's office were not returned. Weisweiler, who achieved fame as the coach of top teams in West Germany, was entering the last year of a three-year contract at $350,000 a year. Mark Brickley, the public relations director of the Cosmos, said ''I assume they've reached an agreement'' on what the financial settlement would be on the final year of the contract.
