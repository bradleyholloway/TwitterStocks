 BOOM TOWN: It's the Morning After in Techland --- Internet Leaders, Exhausted From a Frenzied Start, Get Down to Real Work   By By Kara Swisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2000  Ask someone who knows, like Rosanne Siino, employee No. 19 at Netscape Communications Corp., the legendary browser firm whose fast rise was followed by a swift decline in the face of bruising competition from Microsoft Corp. until it was bought by America Online Inc. last year. After the sale, Ms. Siino, like many Netscape employees, quickly departed the company, exhausted from the effort and rich enough from stock options to allow for a pause.  Likewise, Lise Buyer, the Credit Suisse First Boston Internet analyst. She says she has been thrilled to be living at ground zero of the Web whirlwind that has swept up everyone in its path. She has been in some of the better positions to partake in the merrymaking of money, mojo and momentum. She started out covering the fledgling industry as a buy-side Internet analyst in the Baltimore office of T. Rowe Price (helping its fund managers make stock-purchase decisions) and then switched to the sell-side at the bank (giving investors advice on stocks).  You can see it at the parties where once-swaggering teen-age phenoms are suddenly talking about having to accept "down rounds" (getting funding that values your company at lesser amounts than before). VCs, who nonchalantly used to brag about "10-bagger" returns, are wearily insisting that merely doubling your money is still pretty good. Job-hopping tech employees are suddenly looking a lot more carefully before they leap. And without easy access to capital, a multitude of sins -- overspending, not-so-thought-out business plans, lack of consumer interest -- have been laid pretty bare.
