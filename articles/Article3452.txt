 Bear Stearns's Net Climbs 43%, Lifted By Bond Business   By By Susanne Craig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2001  Sam Molinaro, chief financial officer of Bear Stearns, said the firm's results were uneven, but he is "cautiously optimistic" stock capital-markets activity will pick up during the third quarter.  As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bear Stearns shares rose $1.77 a share, to $55.13. Lehman shares also finished ahead, closing at $75.90, up $3.40. Shares of Goldman closed at $88.40, up 22 cents. Lehman also exceeded analyst expectations, while Goldman's profit was in line with estimates.  While Bear Stearns's net revenue for bond operations was up, net revenue from investment banking fell 29% to $156 million. Net revenue from its institutional-stock business fell 17% to $348.4 million, reflecting overall weak market conditions as well as declines in stock-derivatives businesses. The sluggish stock market also ate into Bear Stearns's net revenue from wealth management, which slipped 14% to $133.9 million.
