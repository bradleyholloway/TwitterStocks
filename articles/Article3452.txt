 Retirees Spend Less? Hah   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2005  Other readers are dubious. La Rue Brewer, a reader in West Covina, Calif., contends that she and her husband, both retired, have seen their basic expenses increase "more during the last 10 years than at any time in our 55 years of marriage." They use more electricity now than before retirement "to run all the computers and TV sets and air conditioning we use on a daily basis that we didn't have or need 10 years ago."  Marty Griek of Denver says he "can't dispute 'federal spending data'" but disagrees strongly with the conclusions drawn from it: "In my opinion, the reason people's spending decreases" with age "is that they don't have the income they had while they were working."  Mr. [Ty Bernicke]'s advice: Start with a 6% annual withdrawal rate -- but leave the amount the same every year, rather than boosting it to reflect inflation. In retirement, human nature will be "to decrease spending at about the same rate inflation is increasing," he says. So Mr. [Larry Goldenberg] would "have a high likelihood of not depleting his nest egg, according to my studies."
