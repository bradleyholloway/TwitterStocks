 Telecommunications; Wireless Web: A status report on where high-speed Internet access stands   By Searcey, Dionne, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  Verizon, which gears its marketing of wireless broadband toward mobile professionals, won't say how many users have signed up for the service. "We're deploying wireless broadband further and faster than anyone else, and customers are buying it," Doreen Toben, Verizon Communications' chief financial officer, told analysts in July. Verizon had been charging $80 a month for unlimited usage, but is now offering the service at $59.99 a month for a limited time.  Ms. [Tammy Deuster] was skittish initially because she thought the monthly fee of $80 when she signed up was steep, and Verizon required a two- year contract. But it has been worth it, she says. "It converted the train ride into an office," Ms. Deuster says. "It's been a really, really huge convenience for my portable work life."  The music content on V Cast consists of music videos that can be downloaded for $3.99 each. Much of the V Cast video content is one- minute to five-minute clips of news, sports or entertainment from providers such as MTV or CNN. It also offers "mobisodes" -- short episodes made for the carrier. They include "24: Conspiracy," a mini- offshoot of the television series "24," and outtakes from the Paris Hilton reality TV show "The Simple Life." Another mobisode series called "Sunset Hotel," unrelated to any TV show, tells the story of an old hotel and its colorful residents.
