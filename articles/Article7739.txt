 Perilous Waters: Soviet Proposal For 'Zone of Peace'   By By C.A.H. Trost, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1988  In a speech delivered last fall in the Arctic city of Murmansk, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev reiterated Soviet calls for the creation of a northern "zone of peace." He proposed East-West talks aimed at curtailing military activity in the Baltic, North, Norwegian and Greenland seas, areas vital to the defense of Western Europe and the U.S.  Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to eliminate naval and air presence in these northern waters was echoed in the fall by Soviet representatives at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Conference on Naval Arms Control. Since then, the Soviets have repeated their calls for such constraints on use of the seas.  The program outlined by Mr. Gorbachev has widespread appeal in Western Europe, particularly to some segments of Nordic populations. While most European leaders have reacted to the general secretary's diplomatic initiative with caution, expressing concern that any such maritime accord would work to the advantage of the Soviet Union, some have responded with enthusiasm. At least one member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has privately welcomed the proposal, and stated its intention to raise the matter within NATO councils.
