 Soybeans Soar on Demand for Tight Supplies   By By Daniel Rosenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1997  Old-crop soybean futures skyrocketed at the Chicago Board of Trade, posting their highest price in almost a month, as exporters and processors stepped up demand for dwindling U.S. supplies.  Old-crop futures -- those contracts representing soybeans grown in 1996 -- jumped from the opening bell on rumors that six vessels were approaching Chicago to pick up soybeans for export. Extremely tight old-crop supplies added to the bullish tone, with processors having a tough time rustling up beans from farmers in the Midwest.  The fleet of ships headed for Chicago, whether real or imagined, gave the soy complex another boost. "The rumor is that six vessels are arriving in Chicago looking for beans to export," said Anne Frick, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "In theory, those beans would be going to Europe. Of course, `vessels out of the Lakes' talk has been a consistent feature for several weeks and is taking on the same tone as the `imports from Brazil' rumor took," she said, referring to a rumor earlier this summer that had the opposite effect on the old-crop market.
