 Stock Prices End Mostly Lower, With Takeover Arena Hopping   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1985  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.11 points lower at 1268.55. The industrial index showed minor losses in the morning and was down nearly five points at its lowest level. A flurry of activity in early afternoon, brought on by several buy programs on the New York Stock Exchange, wiped out the losses and pushed the index up a few points. But as the buying interest subsided, the gains melted away.  Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.31 to 178.79 while the NYSE composite index lost 0.23 to close at 103.59. On the Big Board, 929 issues lost ground and 596 stocks advanced. Volume shrank to 84.1 million shares from 96.4 million Friday.  IBM's stock price rose 1 7/8 to 131 1/2 on volume of nearly 1.1 million shares; the stock tumbled more than three points late last week. General Motors gave up 1/2 to close at 78 3/8, Merrill Lynch added 1/8 to 32 3/4 and AT&T finished unchanged at 21 1/2.
