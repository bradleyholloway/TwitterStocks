 Belgians Still Reap A Deadly Harvest From World War I --- Still-Intact Poison Gas Shells, Conventional Explosives Litter Ypres Battlefield   By By Martin Du Bois, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1989  HOUTHULST, Belgium -- The "cabbage field and the battlefield of Europe," as historians sometimes call Belgium, is trying to get rid of a deadly harvest: World War I poison-gas shells.  Row after row of rusting shells -- some 12,000 and counting -- are stored in the open air on an army base here near Ypres, one of the Great War's bloodiest killing fields. More than 70 years after the Armistice, farmers still turn up the deadly relics. Last year alone, the find totaled 160 tons: 18 tons of poison-gas shells and the rest conventional explosives.  Three years ago, while unloading a truck, four soldiers were killed when a few of the ancient bombs containing conventional explosives blew up. But on most days, all's quiet on the Houthulst base. Out in the fields, the scars of the Great War still show. Nothing grows in spots where leaky poison-gas shells have polluted the soil.
