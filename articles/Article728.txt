 GenCorp Inc. Unit Agrees to Clean Up Toxic Pollution   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1986  GenCorp Inc.'s Aerojet General Corp. subsidiary agreed to clean up extensive toxic contamination at a plant site in Rancho Cordova, Calif. GenCorp will reserve $45 million for the job.  The agreement, filed in federal court in Sacramento, would settle a 1979 state suit and a federal suit. A proposed consent decree will become final if approved by the federal court after a 120-day public comment period.  Environmental Protection Agency officials said the Rancho Cordova settlement could become one of the most costly ever agreed to by a company. They also said it is the first agreement by any company to pay for past and future EPA oversight expenses as well as the cleanup cost.
