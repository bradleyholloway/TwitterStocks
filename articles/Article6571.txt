 Letters to the Editor: Are Chemical Plants, Pipelines Sitting Ducks?   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2002  Your May 30 page-one article "Debate Heats Up Over Chemical Risks" about government release of information on chemical plants also mentioned the government's efforts to block data on hazardous pipelines. Anyone can buy state maps of pipelines from PennWell MAPSearch at pennwell.com or mapsearch.com for $100 per state. They are color-coded, telling you what substances are where. So by keeping such data from the public, all the government is doing is protecting us from terrorists who can't afford $100.
