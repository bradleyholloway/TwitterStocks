Aides to Mayor Koch and City Council leaders reached tentative agreement yesterday on a bill to require many property owners to pay real estate taxes twice a year instead of quarterly. The measure would save the city $32 million to $44 million a year, depending on the terms of the final agreement, officials said.  It would not apply to property that is assessed below a certain level, probably $25,000 or $30,000. That provision, which was being negotiated, was designed to exempt one-, two- and three-family homes and at least some cooperative and condominium apartments.  Officials said perhaps as many as 600,000 residences might be exempted from the law, which requires owners to speed their tax payments so that the city can reduce its seasonal borrowing and gain interest from the tax funds.  After a phase-in period, payments would be made in January and July only, eliminating payments in April and October. There are about 840,000 properties in the city. Mostly Outside Manhattan  While the vast majority of those properties likely to be exempted are in the boroughs outside Manhattan, the inclusion of co-ops and condominiums raised the possibility that some of the most exclusive Manhattan residences also would be exempt.  ''Will co-ops on Park Avenue have to pay twice a year?'' Stanley Schlein, a Council aide, asked rhetorically. ''They probably will.'' ''What about co-ops on the Upper West Side?'' Mr. Schlein continued. ''Some probably will and some probably will not.'' Typically, private homes are assessed at about one-fifth of their market values. Thus, homes with values of up to $150,000 could be exempted.  The question of which co-ops would be exempted is more difficult, the officials said, because those apartments are not assessed individually.  The chairman of the Council Finance Committee, Edward L. Sadowsky, Democrat of Queens, said the total assessment of a cooperative building would be divided by the number of apartments in the building to determine each unit's assessment.  For example, in a building with an assessment of $3 million that has 100 apartments, each apartment would have an assessment of $30,000 and would probably have to pay under the new schedule. The law does not take into account different sizes or values of apartments in the same building.  Both Mr. Sadowsky and Alair A. Townsend, the city's Budget Director, predicted that the Finance Committee would pass the measure, possibly today. They also said they expected it would be approved by the full Council. Depends on Exemptions  How much money it will save the city depends on where the exemption level is set. Without exemptions, the measure would have saved $55 million, officials said. In his spending plan released two weeks ago, Mr. Koch included a saving of $35 million from speeded tax payments.  The Koch administration, which initially did not include any class for exemptions from the measure, was prodded by Council members in that direction. Miss Townsend said that the city then offered to exempt property assessed under $20,000 but that some Council members insisted on $30,000.  She said she thought that the city had been ''quite generous already,'' but added that she felt a compromise would be reached. The action came as the last of six budget hearings was held at City Hall, where about 150 speakers took turns labeling the budget as unfair. They said it was unfair to children, disabled persons, minorities, schools, parks, libraries and the Police Department.  ''When libraries are closed, the doors to intelligence, to information, are closed,'' said Vartan Gregorian, president of the New York Public Library, in a typically dire warning.  The requests for more money come even though the budget lacks $519 million in uncertain state actions. Some city officials say the requests cannot really be considered until the city sees how much of that $519 million it can count on.
