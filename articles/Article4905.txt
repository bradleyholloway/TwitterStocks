 SEC Charges Firm's Officer In Insider Case --- Continental Can's Chairman Said to Have Given Data On Other Concerns' Plan   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1988  The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Donald Sturm, chairman and chief executive officer of Continental Can Co., with helping a friend trade on inside information about an impending takeover that Mr. Sturm learned of from a daughter then employed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  According to a complaint filed by the SEC with the federal court in New York, Mr. Sturm in November 1985 learned from his daughter at Drexel that Aviation Group Inc. was about to be acquired by Primark Corp. Drexel had been hired earlier in the year to help Aviation Group find a buyer.  Neither Mr. Sturm's friend nor Drexel was identified in the complaint. The SEC's court filing refers only to "Aviation's Investment Banker," but a Drexel spokesman confirmed that Drexel is that firm. Mr. Sturm's daughter was identified only as "a relative."
