 Stocks Shrug Off Treasury-Yield Rebound, Get Boost From Jobs Data   By Hudson, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2007  "There's some volatility back in the bond market, some searching for direction," said OppenheimerFunds economist Jerry Webman.

The bond market's volatility was driven by a mix of factors, including worries early in the week about weakness in the market for "subprime" mortgages, or loans to risky borrowers, and the possibility of July 4th terror attack and, later in the week, an influx of strong economic data.  Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for research firm High Frequency Economics, said investors were reading too much into the employment data, overreacting to "a change-nothing report."
