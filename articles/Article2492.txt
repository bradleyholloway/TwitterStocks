 Host Marriott Drops Plans to Spin Off Budget-Hotel REIT   By By Christina Binkley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1998  Host Marriott Corp. is scrapping its plans to spin off a new real-estate investment trust made up of its limited-service hotels, Terry Golden, the company's president and chief executive, said. The company has changed its mind because "market conditions" likely wouldn't support the initial placement offering, he added.  Although it has canceled immediate plans to spin off its limited-service hotels into a REIT, the company is moving ahead with plans to turn itself into a REIT on Jan. 1, Mr. Golden said. When plans were announced months ago, Host Marriott had intended to create two REITS, one for high-end full-service properties and another for less exclusive hotels, such as Residence Inns and others that don't offer room service and other amenities.
