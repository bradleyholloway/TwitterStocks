 Martha and the Consequences of Truth or Dare   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2004  Your March 8 editorial "Martha Stewart Misgivings" and the accompanying commentary by Alan Dershowitz's "With Lawyers Like These . . ." analyzing the trial strategy and raising intriguing questions about the role of Ms. Stewart's lawyers at the time she agreed to be interviewed by investigators, omitted one crucial point that should serve as a caveat for anyone being investigated by the feds: Under the federal "false statements" statute, it is a serious felony to lie to any federal agent or official, even when not under oath.  Notwithstanding a carefully worded "disclaimer" to the contrary, Alan Dershowitz patently suggests that Martha Stewart's attorney was protecting the interests of his firm rather than the interests of Ms. Stewart. This suggestion seems motivated by Mr. Dershowitz's apparent disdain for the prosecution bar, and in the instant matter, former prosecutors. It takes little talent to second-guess and criticize the strategy in a case once the outcome has been decided.  3. When the feds call, don't tell your "friend" of 20 years, "Isn't it great to have brokers who tell you these things?" in reference to the "tip" on ImClone.
