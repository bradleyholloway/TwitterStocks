SEATTLE, May 28â€” Lenny Randle of the Seattle Mariners says he did not blow a baseball into foul territory against the Kansas City Royals last night. But that's the way the umpires wound up seeing it, and the ruling went against Randle - and the Mariners.  The play occurred when Amos Otis topped a ball toward third base. Three Mariners, including Randle, the third baseman, converged on the ball, but all realized it was too slow a roller to allow them to throw out Otis.  All they could hope for was for it to roll foul. Randle got down on all fours and helped it go in that direction. Randle said he did not do anything physical, just mental.  ''I didn't blow it,'' Randle said. ''I used the power of suggestion. I yelled at it, 'Go foul, go foul.' How could they call it a hit? It was a foul ball.''  Initially, Larry McCoy, the plate umpire, said the ball was foul. But after a protest by Jim Frey, the Kansas City manager, McCoy awarded Otis first base.
