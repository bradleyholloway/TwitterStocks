 Spain's Repsol Wins Stake In YPF With $2 Billion Bid --- Argentina's Government Receives a 22% Premium For Its Energy Holding   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Craig Torres in Buenos Aires and Carlta Vitzthum in Madrid, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  Repsol emerged as the only buyer after several other companies dropped out of the auction. Repsol matched the government's minimum bid price of $38 a share, which represented more than a 22% premium over the closing price of YPF's American depositary shares, which closed at $31, up 56.25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.  The stake comes with two seats on YPF's 12-member board, and a promise by the government to use its veto power and votes on its remaining 5.3% stake in favor of a tender offer for the entire company under certain conditions. What's more, the government has stipulated that it will consider offers from rival bidders at a price of at least 25% higher than the $38 a share paid by Repsol. Analysts say that even at a higher price, YPF is an attractive company. So in essence the government is disposed to seeing its top tax-paying company and one of its largest exporters thrown into a takeover battle.
