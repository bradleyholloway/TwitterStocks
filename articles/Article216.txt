 Germany's Wella Reverses Its Strategy Following the Ouster of Its Chairman   By Rohwedder, Cacilie, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 1995  Behind the turmoil, company insiders and analysts say, lies a major change of heart by the founding [Ulrich Stroeher] family, which owns 78% of Wella's voting shares. Continuing Mr. [Peter Zuehlsdorff]'s expensive expansion strategy would have placed substantial financing demands on them, perhaps forcing them to dilute the family's controlling stake or even sell out to an international partner. Unwilling to do either, the family's four-member advisory board -- none of whom has much experience in the consumer-goods sector -- first fought Mr. Zuehlsdorff and then, in September, dismissed him, citing "irreconcilable differences." Earlier this week, the company had more bad news for the investment community with an announcement that its pretax earnings dropped by 22% in the first nine months of this year.  The Wella saga raises questions that are being asked these days by many mid-size German companies, the backbone of the nation's economy. Many are family-owned, secretive and sticklers for tradition. But as they face growing international competition at home, they are having to decide whether to risk losing control by taking a quantum leap -- in Wella's case, becoming a multinational corporation able to compete with such industry heavyweights as France's L'Oreal SA or Procter & Gamble Co. of the U.S. -- or to stay as they are and risk being hammered.  Wella's new chairman, Mr. von Craushaar, insists that the family is prepared to continue funding the company adequately. "The family wants to see dynamic growth for Wella, and there are no conditions or limits on investment spending to achieve it," he says. "But they're saying, `We don't think that Wella will be stronger with another partner.'"
