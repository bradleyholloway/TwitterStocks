A plainclothes Housing Authority police officer was shot in the leg and his assailant was chased and critically wounded by another housing officer yesterday afternoon in stairwell of an apartment building on the Lower East Side, according to a spokesman for the authority.  The shootings occurred about 3:15 P.M. after two housing officers halted a car at Columbia and East Houston Streets and tried to search its three male occupants, the spokesman, Tim Sullivan, said.  One of the occupants, Peter Gardner of Hartford, Conn., broke away and, in an exchange of gunfire with police, shot Officer Dewey Fong in the right thigh, Mr. Sullivan said.  Officer Nicholas Witkowich then chased the suspect into 77 Columbia Street, a 21-story cooperative building, where the second shooting occurred. Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. Gardner whirled in a stairwell on the 13th floor, pointed a gun ''directly at Witkowich'' and was shot in the head by the officer.  Mr. Gardner died later at Bellvue Hospital, the police said.
