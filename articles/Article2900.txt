 From Overseas, Hopeful Signs for Stocks --- Dollar Stabilizes; U.S. Bond Trade Also Resumes   By By E.S. Browning and Scott Kilman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  U.S. stock markets remained closed, but jittery American investors saw some glimmers of hope in the performance of U.S. bonds and of foreign stocks.  There were plenty of signs that investor jitters remain, of course. Initial bond trading was volatile and heavy. The gap between the prices of corporate bonds and Treasury bonds widened, a clear indication that investors were switching out of riskier corporate securities in favor of Treasury bonds. And investors showed a clear preference for the safest Treasury bonds, with two-year notes rising strongly, to their most extreme levels in the 29 years that the Treasury has regularly been issuing that maturity, traders said. That led some investors to conclude that there could be a similar flight to safer, more defensive stocks once U.S. stocks start trading, as early as Monday.  Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.66%, or 0.80 point, to 121.81.
