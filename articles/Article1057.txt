 Estate Tax Is Yet Another Marxian Scheme   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  The theme of Prof. Tiger's writing is, however, less sanguine -- namely, if you don't give it away, your accumulated wealth should be wrested away by the government (as it is currently, for wealthy decedents). Why, he says, should inheritable wealth be taxed any differently than what the recipients may "earn working at Sears or Mittal Steel?" (never mind that much of that wealth had already been taxed as earned). Indeed, Messrs. [Warren Buffett] and [Bill Gates] are said to "repudiate the notion that what is mine remains mine." Throw in the growing disparity between the lives of the rich and the poor, brought on in part, it is alleged, by shady self-dealing by executives and the depressing effect on wages of cheap labor imports, and you should see clearly, as Prof. Tiger does, that the needs of families (excluding those living hand-to-mouth) must be subordinated to "those of the commonweal."
