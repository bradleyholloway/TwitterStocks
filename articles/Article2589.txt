 Nissan Plans To Go It Alone With Prototype Of Fuel-Cell Car   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1999  Some analysts questioned Nissan's go-it-alone strategy. The company's fuel-cell research project is "far too small to call a full-fledged R&D effort," especially in the nascent green-car market, said Chikao Masuzawa, an analyst with ING Barings in Tokyo. Commercializing and establishing the technology could prove expensive, she said. "Nissan doesn't have the money to go it alone."  Eiichi Abe, head of Nissan's powertrain research team, wouldn't rule out eventually joining a broader group of companies to help establish the technology. But he said for now Nissan will develop the fuel cell working only with Nissan's largest shareholder, France's Renault SA. Renault recently purchased 37% of Nissan to become the company's largest holder.
