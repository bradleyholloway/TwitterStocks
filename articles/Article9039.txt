 Story of Vanguard Funds Has More Than Indexes   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1999  Vanguard is indeed the index-fund king. Around 60% of the record-breaking $46 billion in new cash that Vanguard's stock and bond funds garnered in 1998 went into the giant Vanguard 500 Index Fund and other indexed products that merely try to mirror the market, according to the Malvern, Pa., firm's figures.  Vanguard and index funds have long been synonymous. Pioneered by John Bogle, now the firm's senior chairman, Vanguard made its name by selling index funds as a better-performing alternative to actively managed funds.  The index formula, initially greeted with skepticism, has certainly propelled Vanguard. In 1998, its flagship Vanguard 500 fund took honors as the single fund to take in the most cash industry-wide through November, $8.8 billion, according to Financial Research Corp., Boston. And the fund, which tracks the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, has consistently beaten the performance of actively managed funds. Last year, the index fund generated a hefty 28.62% total return, compared with 22.28% for the average large-capitalization stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., a fund-data firm.
