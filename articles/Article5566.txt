 Gulf Canada's Bryan Resigns as CEO, Sending Company's Stock Down 6.6%   By By Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1998  J.P. Bryan resigned as president and chief executive officer of Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., a move that caught investors off guard and triggered a 6.6% decline in the company's stock.  The Texan oil veteran joined Gulf in early 1995 to rescue the Calgary, Alberta, oil and natural-gas company, which was foundering under a heavy debt load and a lack of growth plans. He quickly slashed jobs and launched a series of aggressive takeovers of large and small oil producers and properties. Since Mr. Bryan, 58 years old, is widely credited with improving the company's fortunes and sparking its share price until recently, analysts were confused by his sudden departure.  "This is a big surprise," said Martin Molyneaux, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. At a presentation to analysts in Vail, Colo., just last week, Mr. Bryan was "very excited" about Gulf's future and was eager to show that Gulf's stock is undervalued, Mr. Molyneaux said. "I certainly didn't get the impression there that his job was done."
