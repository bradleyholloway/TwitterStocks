 Philadelphia Exchange Studies Its Options About Going Public   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 2002  Should it demutualize, the Philadelphia exchange could join the expanding list of U.S. financial markets with public ambitions, reflecting an overseas trend. Outside the U.S., the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Boerse AG in Frankfurt and Singapore Exchange Ltd. are publicly traded.  As investors flocked to the gold-and-silver sector, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's gold and silver index jumped 4.81 to 75.39. Its December 75 calls, for example, gained $1.50 to $2.25 each as 656 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 1,931 contracts.  Options on gold-related stocks also were sought after. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Newmont Mining shares rose $1.11 to $28.11 each. Its January 30 calls, for instance, traded 2,639 contracts, compared with open interest of 9,349 contracts, and rose 40 cents to 95 cents each at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In 4 p.m. Big Board composite trading, Barrick Gold shares rose 63 cents to $15.75 each.
