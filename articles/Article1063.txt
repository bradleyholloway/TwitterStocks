 Copper Continues to Be Buoyed by Tight Supply   By Sykora, Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2006  "Supportive fundamentals remain in play," said Dave Rinehimer, director of futures research at Citigroup Global Markets. "Inventories are tight. Strikes continue in Mexico and there is the potential for a strike at Escondida. And [speculative] fund buyers returned to the market."  A contract between Escondida and unionized workers in Chile expires Aug. 2. Escondida is considered the world's largest privately owned copper mine, producing 1,271,472 metric tons of copper last year.  Meanwhile, strikes are continuing against Grupo Mexico copper operations. All of this comes against a backdrop in which exchange inventories around the globe are at historically low levels, at 92,575 metric tons in London Metal Exchange warehouses and 7,796 short tons in Comex warehouses.
