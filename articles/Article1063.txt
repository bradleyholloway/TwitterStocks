 Judging a Book by Its Cover Gets Tougher As Blurbs Become a Publishing Obsession   By By Cynthia Crossen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1988  "Swim With the Sharks," the current best seller by businessman Harvey Mackay, must be some incredible book. No fewer than 44 luminaries, from Billy Graham to Robert Redford, provided words of extravagant praise for the blurbs on the book's jacket and inside pages.  Though Mr. Mackay's experience with blurbs may not be typical, it's probably the envy of many authors. A favorable mention from a household name can be used to prove the book's value to the publisher's sales staff and later to retailers, book clubs, paperback publishers and consumers. But the only thing most blurbs actually prove is that the author has famous friends who owe him a favor.  The blurbs are considered so important that they're even appearing on unfinished manuscripts, and sometimes the promise of blurbs is included in book proposals. In her proposal for a book on Jesse Jackson's campaign, Elizabeth O. Colton, a former Newsweek magazine reporter who worked for the candidate, included a list of 32 people under the heading "Notable friends of Elizabeth Colton's who will be solicited for promotional quotes." Ms. Colton says her agent suggested she include the list, since publishers would ask for it anyway.
