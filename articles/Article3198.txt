 Home Office: Decadent Designs for the Opulent Office --- At These Prices, You'll Have to Work Harder Just to Pay for Them   By By Donna Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1999  The move to opulence was seen recently at "L.A.DesignWeek," the annual furniture-industry show. There, pieces for the home office featured exotic woods, decorative surfaces and detailing reminiscent of furniture made decades ago.  "It's important to create a wonderful environment for work," says New York City designer Bruce Bierman, who recently selected a desk and rolling file cabinet covered in black leather for the New York home office of sports-announcer Marv Albert. Mr. Bierman says splurging can actually pay off in the long run. "Incorporating items into your work space that convey a certain sense of luxury can make a difference in your productivity." Not to mention your bank account.  This desk, from Los Angeles furniture retailer J. Robert Scott is covered in goatskin parchment, a material often used in furniture made in the 1930s. "Many office desks are simply unappealing," company President Sally Sirkin Lewis says. "I cannot aesthetically tolerate a typical-looking desk for a home office, so I made a functional piece that is lovely to look at."
