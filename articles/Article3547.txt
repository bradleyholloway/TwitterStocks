 MBA Track -- NYU's Red Carpet: New Program Pairs Movies, Marketing   By Alsop, Ronald, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  "It's been an uphill battle to convince entertainment companies about the value of an M.B.A. degree, but this kind of practical student experience gets their attention," says first-year M.B.A. student Jonas Greenberg, executive producer for ProMotion Pictures and a former marketer at Twentieth Century Fox Television. "It's good for the film students, too, because they're exposed to the business side of projects that may seem like a necessary evil but that they'll have to deal with at the studios."  The winning scripts include "Behind the Eight Ball," a film noir about a detective's Axe-induced appeal to a femme fatale suspected of murder; "Axe Artisan," a special-effects-driven script in which a bumbling waiter at an art gallery comes under the influence of Axe and is spirited into paintings of beautiful women; and "Axe Team," an adventure tale told in music-video style about "a squad of paramilitary seduction professionals" who help the hero get the girl.  The film students don't feel that they are selling out by making a body spray the star of their movies. Quite the contrary -- they see it as an opportunity to break into the lucrative advertising world. "We're eventually going to make commercials, so we should start the process now," says Robert Pietri, the student directing the "Axe Artisan" film. "Most major filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee, have directed commercials." In fact, Mr. Lee, an alumnus and faculty member at NYU's film institute, is expected to critique the Axe scripts during the production process.
