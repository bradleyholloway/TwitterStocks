 For Polish firms, mass privatization moves glacially   By Michaels, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1997  Although Poland's ambitious plan to privatize 512 state enterprises kicked off in Jul 1995, all of its companies and the 15 funds set up to manage them are still owned by the government. The funds and their companies will become private only when they enter the Warsaw Stock Exchange, a milestone expected in spring 1997, according to the Polish Securities Commission, which is reviewing the funds' prospectuses.
