 Irving Bank's chairman agrees to recommend acceptance of Bank of New York's hostile bid   By Anonymous, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1988  The largest hostile takeover in banking history became virtually certain with Irving Bank (New York) Chairman Joseph A. Rice's acceptance of the bid by Bank of New York. The move, valued at $77.15 a share, will create the 12th largest bank in the country, with assets of more than $43 billion. The takeover has shaken the banking world, which had been considering immune to the maneuvering which has become common in the corporate environment. The newly merged institution will likely be a strong competitor in payment clearance, securities processing, and trusts. In August 1988, the Federal Reserve Board placed restrictions on Irving's friendly suitor, Milan's Banca Commerciale Italiana, which resulted in the Italian bank's withdrawal. Two months later, the New York state Supreme Court ruled against an Irving "poison pill" provision, making the takeover inevitable.
