 Manager's Journal: Employee Disabilities Needn't Impair Profits   By By Patricia M. Owens, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1999  A decade after its passage, the Americans With Disabilities Act has become a major feature of the Supreme Court's work, with four cases on the docket this term. At the same time, workplace disability programs have expanded from providing simple wage replacement for disabled employees toward an array of actions that support the hiring and retention of healthy, productive workers, disabled or not. A recent survey by the Washington Business Group on Health and Watson Wyatt Worldwide found that 42% of large companies have integrated disability-management programs, saving them 15% to 20% in disability costs.  The ADA and innovative workplace programs reflect contrasting approaches to dealing with disabilities. True, they share the premise that people with disabilities are willing and able to work. But the ADA defines a legally protected class: people with disabilities who are qualified and able to do a job if the employer makes reasonable accommodation. It imposes a mandate on employers without making clear how they are to meet it. The cases before court illustrate that legal interpretation alone can't clear up the confusion:  -- In Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Vaughn Murphy, a mechanic, was fired because his job required him to drive trucks, but his blood pressure was higher than the level required for a Department of Transportation health card. Mr. Murphy says that reasonable accommodation required by the ADA allows him, a qualified person with a disability, to use medication to lower his blood pressure. The 10th Circuit ruled that Mr. Murphy can't claim ADA protection because he could function normally with medication.
