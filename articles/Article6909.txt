 Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc.: Workers File Lawsuit Claiming Losses Due to Padded Sales   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 2005  The suit says workers who bought Krispy Kreme stock for their 401(k) accounts, or were paid stock in bonus plans, had no way of knowing what top executives knew: that the stock was a risky investment. The suit asks that the defendants -- former Chief Executive Scott Livengood, former board member Jack McAleer, former finance chief Randy Casstevens and current Chief Financial Officer Michael Phalen -- personally repay the millions of dollars in lost stock value to the employees.
