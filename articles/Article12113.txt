 China scrambles to avert banking crisis   By Smith, Craig S, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1996  According to experts, at least a third of all bank loans in China are nonperforming, with interest and principal payments long overdue, and that has resulted in a hidden, potential banking debacle that could top the US S&L scandals or the crisis at Japan's banks, with bad debts totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. However, China is moving early to head off the potential crisis and has drafted new laws that change the way banks are regulated, as well as centralizing lending for big government projects in a new policy bank. The nation has also given private and cooperative financial institutions a chance to compete, hoping to prod state-owned banks into becoming commercially viable.
