 Winter Olympics -- On the Games: A Crash Course in Danger   By Fatsis, Stefan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2006  Among the athletes who perform these death-defying feats, it's standard practice to play down the fear factor. Otherwise, there's no way to compete. "You don't think about it," Megan Sweeney, a U.S. junior team luger and a friend of Ms. Retrosi's, said after the crash. Ms. Kidlow's doctor said she hadn't ruled out racing in the Olympics again as soon as tomorrow.  Kids don't luge for fun. There's only one real goal, which adds a layer of pressure nonexistent in more normal childhood activities. "You have this whole one-day-I-can-make-the-Olympic-team thing hanging over your head," Ms. Retrosi said in Lake Placid in December a few days after qualifying for the Games. "You're expected to succeed."  The Retrosi and [Eilleen Hamlin] contingents wore pins bearing the women's faces and the words "Slide Sammy Slide" and "Go Erin USA Luge." Ms. Hamlin was in 17th place heading into today's final two runs. Fellow American Courtney Zablocki was fourth.
