 Letters to the Editor: The Freedom to Speak Foolishly   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2001  In the political correctness sweepstakes, I suspect Amherst College runs a close second to Wesleyan. My heart goes out to Prof. [Jennie Traschen], whose illusions about free speech have been shattered. This might be a good time to ask her to reflect. Does she recall any instances of her colleagues questioning the party line? Perhaps not. But I have no particular grudge against Amherst. Let's suppose that there were a few brave souls who dared speak out. Does Prof. Traschen know what happened to them? What was her reaction to their exercise of the right of free speech? Did she defend that right? When the ugly grafitti went up in the restrooms, did she protest?  The story on the consequences of Ms. Traschen's flag comments is a story of the responsibility that accompanies the right of free speech. Ms. Traschen is certainly free to advocate her extreme liberal position and to damn the nation that provides that freedom.  Please leave Ms. Jennie Traschen in peace. Those who direct their hideous venom toward her, as described on your story, should remember that Ms. Traschen's right to freedom of speech is every bit as precious as their right to love, and be proud of, the American flag.
