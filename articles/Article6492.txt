 Asian Quake's Grim Toll Mounts; India and Pakistan Make Offers of Mutual Support; U.S. to Expedite Assistance   By Peter Wonacott in New Delhi, John Larkin in Mumbai, India, Zahid Hussain in Bagh, Pakistan, and Yochi J. Dreazen in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2005  The quake, which seismologists put at a magnitude of 7.6, tore through India, Pakistan and Afghanistan on Saturday morning, and is believed to have killed more than 20,000 people. Kashmir, a Himalayan territory claimed by both Pakistan and India, bore the brunt of the destruction. Pakistani officials said yesterday that at least 19,136 people had perished in northwestern Pakistan, with 17,388 of those deaths in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. They said the death toll could rise as high as 30,000 once relief workers reach the more-remote mountain villages.  A clash-filled history between the two nuclear-armed foes has undercut previous peace efforts in Kashmir. The struggle for control of the Muslim-majority territory has triggered two of the three wars between Pakistan and India since Pakistan was split off from British India in 1947. The two nation's armies have continued to square off among the earth's tallest peaks, with thousands dying in fighting atop Kashmir's Siachen glacier. Rising tensions in recent years have been the inspiration for tit-for-tat nuclear tests.  Islamist militant groups who attack India across the so-called line of control have made their base in Muzaffarabad. Their military forays into India -- at times supported by the Pakistani army -- have aggravated ties between Pakistan and India. Predominantly Hindu India views those militants as terrorists; Pakistan historically has seen them as freedom fighters.
