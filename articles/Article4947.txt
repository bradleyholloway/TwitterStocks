 Stocks Are Steady in Quiet Trading As Lethargy of Investors Returns   By By David Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 11, 1988  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.55 to 2114.69 as just 128,920,000 shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, well below Wednesday's 153,140,000.  The low volume was coupled with increasing pessimism on the part of investors, suggesting that the malaise that has dominated the market for much of the year is starting to resurface. "This market seems to be in something of a rut," said Trude Latimer, a market strategist at Josephthal & Co.  Broader market averages fared somewhat better than the 30-stock index. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 0.36 to 273.69, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.15 to 257.28 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.17 to 154.09.
