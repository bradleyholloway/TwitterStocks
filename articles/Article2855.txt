 Dow Jones Profit Drops on Plunge In Ad Spending   By By Matthew Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  The first-quarter charge was slightly offset by a one-time gain of $2.2 million, a partial reversal of a reserve Dow Jones set aside to cover certain contractual obligations to Bridge Information Systems and its Telerate unit. Dow Jones established a $255 million reserve in the 2000 fourth quarter to cover contractual payments made to data providers when Telerate was owned by Dow Jones.  In addition to the Journal and its international and online editions, Dow Jones publishes Barron's magazine and other periodicals, Dow Jones Newswires, Dow Jones Indexes, and the Ottaway group of community newspapers. Dow Jones is co-owner with Hearst Corp. of SmartMoney magazine, with Reuters Group of Factiva, and with NBC of the CNBC television operations in Asia and Europe.
