 Facing Slump, South Korea Eases Pressure for Reform --- In Policy It Calls Temporary, Seoul Will Help Firms Refinance Maturing Debt   By By Hae Won Choi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2001  KDB said its measures were necessary for a stable economy. "KDB had to come to the rescue of companies faced with huge debt maturing as local financial institutions are not well-positioned to channel funds from savers to the corporate sector," said Jung Yun Jung, head of the bank's corporate-planning division.  In recent months, the government and creditors appeared to be turning up the heat on South Korea's weak companies. In October, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., the Hyundai Group's large construction arm, was late in making a payment on its debt after creditors refused to supply new loans. In November, Daewoo Motor Co. filed for court protection from creditors after banks cut off funds when its labor union refused to accept a restructuring plan. That same month, Korean banks released a list of 29 companies they planned to pressure to liquidate or seek court protection from creditors.  KDB said companies are eligible for its program if they can repay as much as 20% of maturing debt on their own but have short-term difficulties in refinancing the total. KDB will buy 80% of the maturing debt outstanding from each company, of which 50% of the debt will be guaranteed by state-run Korea Deposit Insurance Corp., repackaged and sold as investment-grade bonds.
