 Business Brief -- Potlatch Corp.: Earnings for Fourth Quarter To Miss Analysts' Estimates   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2000  Potlatch Corp., citing a general economic slowdown, sharp declines in lumber and wood-panel prices and higher energy costs, said its fourth-quarter earnings will miss analysts' expectations. The Spokane, Wash., forest-products company said earnings will be "substantially below" analysts' estimates, but didn't provide specific figures. A consensus of four analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 10 cents a share. Potlatch also said its fourth-quarter financial results will be disproportionately affected by costs connected with renovating a factory in Minnesota. The company said it will extend the holiday closing of two paper mills to offset the lower demand for its products. Potlatch made the announcement after markets closed.
