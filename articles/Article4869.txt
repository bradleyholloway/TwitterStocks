 Mammograms for Women Aged 40-49 Would Cut Cancer Risks -- At High Cost   By By Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1988  The analysis sought to determine the benefits, risks and costs of recommending annual mammography for women in their 40s. Most medical groups currently agree that women age 50 and over should have annual mammography examinations. Breast cancer is most common among older women, and a variety of studies show that such annual exams can reduce the number of breast-cancer deaths among women over 50 by 50% over a five-year period.  Medical groups disagree, however, on the value of mammography for women in their 40s, when mammography is less effective in detecting early cancers. The American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association urge women to have at least one mammogram taken between age 35 and 40 and have additional mammograms every year or two through age 49. But the federal government's National Cancer Institute, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and others have declined to recommend mammography in this age group except for women with a family history of breast cancer.
