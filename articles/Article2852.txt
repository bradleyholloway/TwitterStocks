 Unocal Hopes Deep Water Will Deliver It From Doldrums --- High Oil, Gas Prices Fail to Draw Investors, so New CEO Turns to New Wells   By By Chip Cummins, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 13, 2001  The company has had better success in other arenas. It holds controversial, but potentially lucrative, gasoline patents that have survived a number of court challenges, and earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge by oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Amoco PLC. Though Unocal shed its refining and marketing businesses a few years ago, the court decisions open the door for Unocal to collect steady revenue from the patents for years to come. Unocal said it is negotiating with companies on licensing agreements, seeking royalties of 1.2 cents to 3.4 cents for every gallon sold that relies on its patents. It expects to use proceeds to pay down debt.  Unocal also is one of the country's biggest producers of natural gas, a commodity that soared in price last year and sells for about twice the price of a year ago. Unocal expects to boost its North American gas production by about 14% this year over last -- no small feat considering many of its competitors are struggling with flat or declining fields in places such as West Texas and the Gulf's shallow-water shelf.  Unocal itself still has significant exploration and production acreage in the gas-rich shallow waters of the Gulf. It expects to spend about $530 million this year developing its gas fields on the Gulf shelf and in West Texas, through its investment in Pure Resources. "We've found certain of our old assets have a lot more life than we expected," says John W. Creighton Jr., who early this year succeeded Mr. Beach as Unocal's nonexecutive chairman.
