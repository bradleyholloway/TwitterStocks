 Call Waiting: Phone Battle Heats Up --- Lawmakers' Goal Is To Inject Competition Into Local Markets   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1994  The state's local phone companies, led by Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., want regulations eased on prices and services. This, they say, will give them the incentive to upgrade their Texas networks, as well as the ability to battle new competitors. But for those competitors -- which include cable-television companies, cellular-telephone providers and others -- the key is to relax the stranglehold that phone companies have over the local phone business. If that isn't done, they say, phone companies will be free to raise prices and enter new markets, while keeping entry into their markets so difficult as to prevent competition.  The Legislature tried to tackle telecommunications policy last session. But the Texas Telephone Association, the industry's lobbying arm, didn't release its proposal until the start of the session, leaving little time for a full debate of the issue. And opponents, lacking a proposal of their own, could do little but snipe at the phone companies' plan. Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock killed a proposed bill the last day of the session, saying lawmakers needed more time to study the complicated issues.  Competitors also object to a phone-industry proposal that would declare sufficient competition already exists in some businesses -- such as paging services and pay phones -- in which only the local phone companies are now regulated. The proposal would deregulate those businesses as soon as the law takes effect, while delaying changes designed to ease competitors' entry into local phone markets until after lengthy Public Utility Commission hearings. Those changes -- such as facilitating competitors' ability to use existing phone networks -- are crucial if newcomers are to get around the phone companies' monopoly of the networks.
