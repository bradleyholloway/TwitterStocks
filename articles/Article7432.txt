 Waste Plant of Rollins Environmental Is Closed by Louisiana After Inspection   By By Thomas Petzinger Jr. and Alix M. Freedman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1985  The order against the operator, Rollins Environmental Services Inc., of Wilmington, Del., followed an inspection Monday night during which three state regulators found strong odors drifting from the Baton Rouge plant and a thick plume of black smoke pouring from the incinerator, which breaks down hazardous, chemically complex materials.  Thomas R. Blank, a spokesman for Rollins, termed the state's action "certainly a surprise." He said new air emissions equipment was added to the site's incinerator last year, making the incinerator one of "the best in the world."  The order, imposed yesterday, required that Rollins immediately close the incinerator pending further state inspection and that it file, within 30 days, a plan for the permament closing of the site within six months. The order added that the state was considering whether to impose fines against Rollins.
