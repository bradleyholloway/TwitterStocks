 Funds: A Quarterly Analysis; Fund Fight: State Street Aims To Reclaim Its Past ETF Glory   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  The Boston firm itself has been dwarfed in the hot investment area by Barclays, which passed State Street as the largest ETF manager in 2003, a decade after the Spider's launch. The San Francisco-based unit of Britain's Barclays PLC surged ahead by flooding the market with new products and pouring money into a sales effort that helped make its iShares brand practically synonymous with ETFs. Barclays now manages $280 billion in U.S.-traded ETFs, while State Street manages $104 billion.  In late 2004, State Street's ETF developers had a big success with a fund tracking gold prices that today has $10 billion in assets. Still, the firm's ETF business was falling behind that of Barclays. At the end of 2004, Barclays managed $114 billion in ETFs and State Street $76 billion, most of it in the SPDR and streetTRACKS Gold Shares.  In early 2005, the group got the green light. The first step: to plug holes in the line-up of funds. "We needed to give our salespeople a full batch of products," says Mr. [James Ross]. "You didn't want them out there saying, 'If you want international [exposure], you need to buy somebody else's ETFs.'"
