 Templeton Goes Hunting for Bargains in Korea   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 1998  The Bahamas-based investor says he has pumped money into a number of Korean-stock vehicles over the past month. Among them: Matthews Korea Fund, a San Francisco-based mutual fund whose 64% decline through Tuesday ranks it as one of 1997's worst-performing U.S.-based funds.  Sir John, the global-investing pioneer who founded the Templeton fund group and later sold it to Franklin Resources, declined to say how much he has invested in Korea. He said the sum is "very small" in relation to his total portfolio. But his recent investment in the Matthews Korea Fund, which appears to be at least several million dollars, is certainly a big deal to that small fund, which describes itself as the only open-end U.S. mutual fund that specializes in Korea.  A coming regulatory filing by Matthews International Funds will disclose that Sir John holds more than 25% of the Korea fund's assets, which recently totaled around $25 million, according to Matthews managing director Mark Headley. Sir John has become "far and away the largest shareholder" of the fund, Mr. Headley says.
