 Software Makers Are Expected to Post Mixed Results on Slower Sales Growth   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1999  SAP AG set a cautious tone last week by projecting that 1998 pretax profit grew about 15%, roughly half what was expected earlier, citing economic problems in Japan and Russia. But analysts say SAP and other sellers of enterprise-resource-planning software, or ERP, are being hurt as big companies divert spending from new software installations to fixing systems they already have.  PeopleSoft Inc., a SAP competitor that had regularly topped 80% revenue growth a quarter, is also slowing down because of year 2000 issues and SAP's recent pricecutting. Mr. (James A.) Moore estimates that the company will report fourth-quarter net income of $47 million, or 18 cents a share, up 19% from year-earlier results of $39.4 million, or 16 cents a share. Revenue rose 39% to $361 million from $260.6 million, he estimates.  Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co., estimates that net income in the fiscal second period rose 46% to $1.65 billion, or 60 cents a share, from the year-earlier mark of $1.13 billion, or 42 cents a share, on a split-adjusted basis. Revenue rose about 20% to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion, he says.
