 House, Senate Seek to Bridge Differences on Spending Bill   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2001  One of the biggest unanswered questions in the coming talks is how Congress will address the health-insurance and employment needs of workers thrown out of work in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The presumption is that this aid will be part of a separate economic-stimulus package. But negotiations over that bill hit a snag Friday, and if those talks collapse, House and Senate negotiators will face more pressure from labor unions to add at least stopgap jobless aid for their New York-area members as part of the final defense and antiterrorism measure.  While much attention focused on whether Congress would defy President [Bush] and exceed the $40 billion emergency-funds target, the Senate defense bill itself wasn't without controversy. It includes a provision to let the government lease as many as 100 Boeing 767 passenger jetliners and modify them as cargo freighters and air-fuel tankers to replace an aging fleet. The arrangement, which would cost at least $20 billion over a decade, would be a financial boon for Boeing, which has lost commercial business after Sept. 11 and begun massive layoffs.
