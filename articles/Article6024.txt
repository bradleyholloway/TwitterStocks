 War of the Zackses: Divorce Splits Up Mom and Pop Store --- In a Double Exposure, Exes Run Rival Camera Shops; Patrons Are Feeling Uneasy   By By Hilary Stout, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1997  PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- It was an unpleasant divorce, as many are. Patty and Michael Zacks fought "about things as mundane as a vacuum cleaner," Michael remembers.  After 20 years of marriage, the couple divided their shared life: Patty got custody of the two kids, the house, the Saab and the mom and pop camera store they had built together 13 years before. Michael got visitation rights, thousands of dollars of camera equipment and repair tools, $8,000 in cash and the shop's phone number.  Today Patty and Michael cross the street to avoid walking by the other's store. Patty, 44 years old, says she occasionally sees Michael, 45, in the gift store across the street, glancing over at Camera Werks. She tries not to look back.
