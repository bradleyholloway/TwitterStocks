 Dollar Steadies on Analysis of Fed View; As Increase in Interest Rates Appears Even Less Imminent, Euro Levels Off From Climb   By Agnes T. Crane and Jamie McGeever, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2003  In the minutes of its Oct. 28 meeting released late in the trading day, the policymakers said that inflation will probably remain at "very low levels over the next year or two," and expressed concern that the U.S. labor market might not recover fully until late 2005 "or even later" no matter if the economy grows at an above-average rate.  The comments sparked an immediate rally in the bond market. After the FOMC meeting early this week, the market was pricing in a 25 basis point, or one-quarter of a percentage point, rise in rates by mid- 2004. The dollar soon sank against it major rivals because prolonged low interest rates in the U.S. generally discourage foreign investment in the U.S.  Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar ended sharply lower in wide, see-saw dealings, experiencing its largest one-day selloff in five months before staging a recovery later in the session as the U.S. dollar again weakened globally. In late trading, the U.S. dollar stood at C$1.3182 down from C$1.3075 late Wednesday.
