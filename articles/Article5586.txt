 UPS to Guarantee On-Time Ground Delivery   By By Douglas A. Blackmon, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1998  The new UPS guarantees, expected to take effect in early May, are intended to undercut FDX Corp.'s Federal Express unit's brand identity as the only shipper "absolutely, positively" guaranteeing every shipment within a specified period of time, as well as to blunt a charge by the U.S. Postal Service into the expedited-parcel business. UPS also hopes the move will convey the message that its operations have recovered completely from last summer's Teamsters strike at the company.  In the past, guaranteed on-time delivery has been the dividing line between services that command a high premium from customers, such as FedEx overnight letters, and more traditional, low-cost shipping options, such as the UPS ground service and the U.S. Postal Service's Priority Mail.  UPS will be offering guaranteed delivery at the same price it now charges for truck deliveries without such a commitment. For example, a one-pound package shipped on a UPS truck from New York to Washington, D.C., costing $3, starting in May would come with guaranteed overnight delivery at no extra charge. The same package shipped via FedEx's air network currently costs at least $11.50, while UPS's air system charges at least $13. For greater distances, the deliveries will take longer and the price will be higher. But if, say, four-day delivery is bought, four-day will be guaranteed.
