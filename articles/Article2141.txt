 Pathway clears for GM spinoff of EDS unit   By Templin, Neal; Blumenstein, Rebecca, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1996  Executives of General Motors Corp and its Electronic Data Systems Corp unit have agreed on a key bargaining point that could pave the way for a spinoff of EDS in a matter of weeks. The two sides have agreed on the dividend that the computer-services concern will pay GM as part of the spinoff, said Harry J. Pearce, GM's vice chairman. As a result, he hopes the spinoff will win approval at the Apr 1, 1996 meeting of GM's 13-member board.
