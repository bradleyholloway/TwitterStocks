 Games: With Wizards and Dragons, Hasbro Expands Its Reach   By By Joseph Pereira and Daniel Golden, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1999  "Gotta catch `em all" say the ads for Pokemon toys. Apparently, Hasbro Inc. agrees.  The country's No. 2 toy maker, which already makes action figures, stuffed animals and plastic balls based on the Pokemon menagerie of miniatures, agreed to acquire Wizards of the Coast Inc., which makes the Pokemon trading-card game -- currently the hottest game in the country -- for $325 million.  Hasbro's pre-existing fold of Pokemon toys is expected to ring up an estimated $100 million in sales this year. But Wizards' Pokemon trading cards are expected to generate twice that volume. A variety of U.S. companies have licensed Pokemon, or "pocket-monster" rights from Nintendo Ltd., of Japan, where the craze started. Nintendo's own Pokemon video games are a big part of the rest of the genre's sales in the U.S.
