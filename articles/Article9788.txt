 Is It a Sports Pic? Or Chick Flick? Fox Film Aims to Be Both   By Kelly, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2005  The movie's dual-audience appeal was no accident. News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox, which made the movie under its Fox 2000 label, made a calculated effort to shoot and market a film leavened with romance, comedy and other "chick flick" fodder -- as well as sports nuggets that could potentially rally men. It's an unusual strategy for the movie industry, where studios typically settle on a particular brand of comedy, from romance to sports or office politics, and then market to the appropriate demographic. The "Bridget Jones" franchise, for instance, is a classic example of a "chick flick" format with a strong female marketing platform. As for male fans? They were welcome to see the show, of course, but their presence was a fringe benefit.  Throughout the film's development, Fox kept a careful eye on its dual demographic. Largely absent from "Fever Pitch" is the sort of bawdy physical comedy that characterized, say, the hair-gel scene with Cameron Diaz in "Something About [Mary]." But also missing are the sort of cuddly romantic moments found in Meg Ryan classic comedies like "When Harry Met Sally."  Tempting sports nuts into a romantic comedy about relationships is complicated, though. "Sports fans are going to be hypercritical, so you have to get the details right," says Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the racy 1988 baseball comedy "Bull Durham." But for a movie to succeed at the box office, he adds, "it better appeal to more than just sports fans."
