Possible choices: former South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, ex-Rep. Vin Weber and former White House staff chief Kenneth Duberstein. Campbell's star rises as a potential running mate as flaws are seen in other contenders like Michigan's Engler and Ohio's Voinovich.  MITSUBISHI MOMS: The National Organization for Women's top Illinois lobbyist won't join NOW's National Mother's Day Action picketing Mitsubishi car dealers over sexual-harassment charges at the Japanese car maker's Normal, Ill., plant. Luellen Laurenti says she backs rallies supporting alleged victims instead.  MINOR MEMOS: Dead Politicos Society: The four blurbs on the back of former House Speaker James Wright's new book quote deceased Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and the late Speaker Tip O'Neill. . . . Frequent lander: Gore flies to California on a plane that has to stop for refueling because Air Force jets for him, the first lady and the secretary of state are down to two. . . . Latest Washington joke: There is talk of three new government bonds -- the [Clinton] bond has no principle, the Dole bond has no interest, and the Gingrich bond has no maturity.
