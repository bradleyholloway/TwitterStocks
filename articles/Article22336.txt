 Gingrich Says GOP Right Will Torpedo Fast Track Without Deals on Other Bills   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1997  H ouse Speaker Newt Gingrich is back in the hot seat, working as President Clinton's partner on "fast-track" trade authority while also trying to broker face-saving deals on spending bills and send his restless Republicans home.  Mr. Gingrich warned yesterday that "the entire conservative wing of our party will just say no" to fast track unless the White House and the GOP can resolve contentious disputes that are delaying appropriations action for the new fiscal year.  The issues run from national school testing to statistical sampling in the next census. Conservatives "have to have some sense of achieving something" on these fronts, the Georgia Republican said, before they will help Mr. Clinton on the trade measure in the House vote Friday. The speaker hopes to produce 150 Republicans for fast track, but internal GOP counts last week had the party evenly split, 93-93, or more than 50 votes short. "Getting to 150 is a big mountain," he said.
