 Confidence Fell For Consumers In November --- But Christmas Buying Plans Are Stronger This Year, Conference Board Says   By By James T. Areddy, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1988  Consumer confidence edged lower in November while Christmas spending plans are stronger this year than last year, the Conference Board said.  The consumer-confidence index, according to the nonprofit industry-supported group, fell to 113.1 in November from a revised 116.9 in October but was up from 110.7 in September. The index uses a base of 100 in 1985.  Employment levels, too, are better now than they are expected to be in six months, respondents said. In November, 30.2% said jobs were plentiful, compared with 29.8% in October, while 15.7% said more jobs would become available in the next six months compared with 18.6% in October. In November, 14.3% said jobs would get less plentiful, compared with 13.2%, while 70% in November expected the rate to stay the same, compared with 68.2% in October.
