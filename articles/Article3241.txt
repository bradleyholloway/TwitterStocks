 Fertility Panel Drops Monitoring Plan; Group Retreats on Tracking Of Embryos, Babies' Health After Outcry Over Privacy   By Regalado, Antonio, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2004  "It's important for patients' privacy that those [initial] proposals not go forward," said Lee Rubin Collins, a board member of Resolve, a national association of fertility patients. Ms. Collins said most of the group's concerns had been addressed.  Carter Snead, general counsel for the ethics council, said the dispute turned largely on misunderstandings caused by vague language in the draft documents. "A lot of this was people saying they didn't want the government involved in this intimate area," Mr. Snead said. That hadn't been the council's intent, he said, and changes to the documents reflected concerns raised by patient advocates.
