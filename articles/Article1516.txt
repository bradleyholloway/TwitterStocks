 Italy's High-Speed Train Project Stays On Track With Public, Private Support ---- Sara Gay Forden Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1991  MILAN, Italy -- An unusual approach combining public and private sector efforts has Italy's high-speed train project rolling.  Chastened by the failure of another Italian public and private sector partnership, the defunct chemical venture Enimont S.p.A., Enimont's former chairman, Lorenzo Necci, has managed to convince both sectors that this time their collaboration has all the ingredients for success.  Mr. Necci, now the special commissioner to the state railroad, has won approval for the project from politicians at home and from bankers world-wide, who are scrambling to get in on the project.
