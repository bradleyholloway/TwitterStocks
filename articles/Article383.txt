 Firing of 'Love Sponge' Signals Cleanup of Shock Radio   By Squeo, Anne Marie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2004  Viacom Inc., which owns radio company Infinity Broadcasting Corp. and the CBS television network, and News Corp.'s Fox TV network have both issued edicts to the staff to err on the side of caution on matters of indecency. And they already appear to be having an effect. Yesterday, Infinity's shock jock Howard Stern told listeners on his widely syndicated radio show that the new FCC crackdown was making his job untenable and he planned to quit. Mr. Stern has made such threats before. He said he set up an appointment with Viacom President Mel Karmazin to discuss his resignation. A spokesman for Mr. Stern didn't return calls, and a Viacom spokesman declined to comment.  "It's a crowded spectrum, so you want a larger audience than everyone else and you want things that can't be duplicated" the way music can, says Gary Stevens, a radio-station broker in the New York area.  "When it was the 'Seven Dirty Words,' we knew what they were and we didn't say them," says Rick Cummings, president of Emmis's radio division, referring to the forbidden words made famous by comedian George Carlin uttering them, which led to the Supreme Court's landmark 1978 indecency decision. "But now it's hard to know where the line is," he says.
