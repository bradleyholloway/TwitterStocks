 Taste: Rescued From Oblivion --- Books used to go out of print; They may not have to anymore   By By Jonathan Eig, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2002  The press's new production facility -- known as Chicago Digital Distribution Center -- will make it cost-effective to print books in batches as small as 25. In the past, publishers required a press run of about 1,200 copies to keep such books in print, which often meant that unsold copies would pile up in warehouses, adding to inventory costs. But digital printing changes all that.  The University of Chicago Press has one home on the school's Hyde Park campus and another in an industrial section of the Pullman neighborhood, on the city's southern edge. For an author, the Pullman warehouse must be as depressing as it is vast. There are about 19,000 titles here -- 10 million books in all, with names ranging from the mundane ("Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About") to the obscure ("Foundations of Tropical Forest Biology"). The sight of so much print is enough to make a writer contemplate tossing out his notes and selling his laptop.  Given these conditions, the key to financial stability for a scholarly press is its backlist -- old books that are still in print. The authors have already been paid and the books edited and designed. That means profit margins are high on the few titles that are truly in steady demand -- usually accounting for about two-thirds of all revenues for a university press. But those revenues are falling. And if they continue to fall, Ms. [Paula Barker Duffy] estimates, 80% of the scholarly backlist could go out of print, including many worthy titles with minuscule readerships.
