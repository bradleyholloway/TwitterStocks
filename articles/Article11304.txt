 Investors Junk Stock of Firms With Heavy Debt...   By By Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1989  Debt-financed buy-outs pumped up stock prices during the 1980s both by retiring billions of dollars of shares and by inducing rampant takeover speculation. Meanwhile, the tax advantages of debt captivated corporate financial officers, who chose to borrow rather than sell more stock to raise capital for building new plants and financing acquisitions.  The blade is drawing blood. Salomon Brothers' 20-stock index of highly leveraged restructured companies is down 18.5% since the start of September, compared with 4% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investors are fleeing these stocks for quality issues of companies that have moderate or low debt. For example, shares of Merck, whose long-term capital is only 3% debt, are up 5.5% since Aug. 31.  But Mr. Seward has bailed "100% out" of these shares. His $125 million portfolio currently consists of 25% cash, 25% blue chips, and the rest in cyclical stocks, which rise in a strengthening economy. That's a contrary position, which Mr. Seward is taking because he thinks prices of these cyclical stocks have been beaten down to cheap levels by investors fearful of a recession. He is hedging his bet, however, by limiting his holdings to shares of companies whose debt totals 50% or less of their equity capital.
