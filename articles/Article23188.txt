 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Music: The Gift of Sound; Broadway Buff on the List? Ideas From 2004's Best; Alison, Bono and Callas   By Hughes, Robert J, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2004  THIS FIVE-CD companion to the acclaimed PBS series charts the breadth of the American musical form. It includes "My Man," from "Ziegfeld Follies of 1921," as sung by Fanny Brice and, later, Barbra Streisand singing "People" in the Fanny Brice musical, "Funny Girl," in 1964. Fred Astaire is here, too: Before the song-and-dance legend made a name for himself in movies, he and his sister, Adele, were a popular stage team. They introduce the Gershwins' "Fascinating Rhythm," from 1924's "Lady Be Good."  EXPLORE THE TWO SIDES of the legendary diva. [Maria Callas] was known for her dramatic intensity and for reviving a 19th-century coloratura repertory. Disc No.1, "The Tragic Heroine," profiles Callas's takes on arias from "Norma," "Il Trovatore," "La Gioconda" and others. On the second CD, "The Romantic Heroine," selections include arias from, among others, Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor." The set also comes with a companion DVD about her life and career.  GEORGIA-BORN [Madeleine Peyroux] made an impact eight years ago with the release of her first album, "Dreamland," with a sound that evoked Billie Holiday's careworn romance as well as the twang of country and pop (check out her take on Patsy Cline's "Walkin' After Midnight"). Voice problems kept Ms. Peyroux from performing in public for several years. Now comes "Careless Love." On this stunning record, the 30- year-old covers Leonard Cohen's "Dance Me to the End of Love," and Bob Dylan's "You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go," in a way that makes them wholly personal statements about grown-up romance.
