 Letters to the Editor: A Military at War With Itself   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1999  After reading your Sept. 22 page-one article "Military Exploits" about life on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, by Greg Jaffe and Thomas E. Ricks, I felt compelled to write to you. I proudly served in the U.S. Navy for four years as an enlisted man aboard the USS John F. Kennedy, an aircraft carrier similar in construction to the Roosevelt. Subsequently, I have gone on to graduate from college, received my MBA and went on to work as an investment banker.  I have never before read a story that so accurately summarizes the modern military's problems. While I feel the Clinton administration has been reckless in its fiscal disregard for our armed forces, I feel the military must share some of the blame for its lack of money. While in the Navy, I observed many of the same inefficiencies you observed. The continual, unnecessary maintenance and painting, lack of modern electronic and electric tools (i.e. the buffing machine and electronic card system you mentioned), and poor use of personnel are hard to explain and inexcusable in an environment of continual budget cuts.  I especially congratulate you for the insights into the issues surrounding the retention of enlisted personnel. While a certain amount of "grunt work" is to be expected at the junior enlisted levels, misleading statements by recruiters and excessive amounts of unnecessary or demeaning daily work will clearly continue to drive talented enlisted personnel away from the military, particularly when the civilian job market is exploding and pay differentials are extreme.
