 European Airline Shares Revive, Led by Some Low-Cost Carriers   By By Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2001  Other analysts favor Europe's discount carriers that, like Southwest Airlines in the U.S., can better weather a slowdown in traffic because of lower costs and better margins. Ryanair, for example, has operating margins of more than 25%, compared with around 3% for British Airways. Both Ryanair and the United Kingdom's easyJet have been able to maintain their pre-Sept. 11 booking volumes by cutting fares, but not so much that it should have an impact on their profits. "Since their earnings are apparently undamaged by the turmoil in the airline market [because of the strength of their business model], we believe it is reasonable for their price relatives to have regained their positions prior to the attacks," J.P. Morgan wrote of the two carriers in a recent report.  Still, some wonder if shares of the discount airliners haven't risen too far, too fast. Ryanair and easyJet have surged more than 80% from their late September lows, and their market capitalizations have ballooned beyond their much larger rivals'. Ryanair is valued at GBP 3 billion on sales of GBP 487 million, compared with British Airways' market cap of GBP 2.1 billion on sales of GBP 9.3 billion.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index dropped 0.9%, or 45.10 points, to 5074.90. Media stocks tumbled. EMI Group fell 20.75 pence, or 5.8%, to 340.25 pence, while Reuters lost 30 pence, or 4.2%, to 692 pence. Granada lost 10 pence, or 6.9%, to 136 pence. Daily Mail & General Trust eased two pence, or 0.3%, to 635.5 pence. Plumbing and heating products distributor Wolseley climbed 3.4% to 529 pence after it said it expects to see continued acquisition opportunities over the current fiscal year.
