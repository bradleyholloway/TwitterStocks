 Eyes on the Road: Plugging In to the Future; Getting 100 Miles Per Gallon While Driving to Work In a Modified Toyota Prius Online edition  By White, Joseph B, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  As I dodged fellow citizens in their last-century gas-only SUVs, I snuck glances at the Prius's information screen, which displayed my fuel consumption and the flow of power from the batteries and the gasoline engine. For most of my roughly 20-mile trip to the office, I appeared to be on electric-only power. Accelerating to merge with traffic, and avoid becoming a high-tech oil spot under a semi, I engaged the gasoline motor. But cruising was all-electric -- and according to the Prius's on board fuel consumption computer, I was cruising at 100 miles to the gallon. The only awareness I had of the power generation hand-offs between the gas engine and the lithium-ion batteries, or the lithium-ion batteries and the Prius's factory- installed nickel-metal hydride battery system was the videogame display in the dashboard screen.  Lithium-ion battery technology can handle the cycles of charging and discharging required for a plug-in better than nickel-metal hydride batteries. It's used now in small power tools and laptops. But lithium-ion battery also has what's referred to as "heat management" issues. That means fire, Scarecrow. The recent spate of publicity about lithium-ion laptop batteries bursting into flame has only made resolving this issue more urgent.  Tony Posawatz, the vehicle line director for GM's plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt and other vehicles using GM's E-Flex electric-vehicle technology, says he expects to get battery packs by the end of this year from suppliers who believe they have what it takes to meet GM's criteria for a safe, reliable and cost-effective plug-in hybrid. A123 is part of one group along with Continental AG. Another involves big Korean battery maker LG Chem.
