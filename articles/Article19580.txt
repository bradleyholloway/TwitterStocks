 Figuring Out That Don't-Worry-Be-Happy Stock Rally --- Market's Strong October Advance Despite Steady Flow of Bad News Reflects Investors' Hopes for '03   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2002  Sentiment was very bullish in August, the most recent time the market peaked and headed down, and it was very bearish in October, when the market turned back up. At the moment, short-term sentiment, reflected in options buying, is fairly neutral. Long-term sentiment, measured by consumer-confidence surveys, remains negative, leading some analysts to hope that the current rally can continue.  Juniper Networks (Nasdaq) climbed 1.10, or 19%, to 6.92, a rise that analysts attributed to speculation that the company may have won a lucrative contract from Verizon Communications. Verizon gained 83 cents, or 2.2%, to 38.59.  Cigna gained 2.26, or 6.3%, to 38.40, shaking off concern over an informal Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, whose details Cigna declined to disclose. Investors instead focused on Chief Executive H. Edward Hanway's statement that Cigna remains "fundamentally sound," and his pledge that profit will grow in 2004 after a year of rebuilding.
