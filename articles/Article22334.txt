 Better Wait on The Inaugural for President Whitman   By By Paul A. Gigot, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1997  PRINCETON, N.J. -- It isn't easy being the savior of the national Republican Party. Just ask Gov. Christie Whitman. Every liberal's ideal GOP presidential nominee is having one helluva time just saving her day job in beautiful downtown Trenton.  Her own answer is that it's a Democratic state, Bob Dole won only 36% last year and the entire Northeast is moving left. There's some truth in this. Yet Republican Mayor Bret Schundler was just re-elected in even more Democratic Jersey City, Rudy Giuliani is rolling through the no-longer Naked City and even Gov. George Pataki, nobody's idea of Mr. Charisma, is deterring challengers in New York state.  The Christian Coalition plans to remind everyone of that veto by distributing a million voter guides on the Sunday before Election Day. Both the national GOP and the Whitman campaign have lobbied privately to deter the Christian Coalition. But its new leader, Don Hodel, tells me the guides will report both the governor's veto and the pro-life stands of conservative third-party candidates. That could hurt in a close race.
