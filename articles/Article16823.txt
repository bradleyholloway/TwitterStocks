 Kraft Is Near Sale of Post Cereals; Ralcorp Is Poised to Buy Business for $2.8 Billion; Stock Deal Being Discussed   By Matthew Karnitschnig and Julie Jargon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2007  For Ralcorp, a St. Louis private-label maker of cereals and other foods, the deal would raise revenue by about 50% to $3.3 billion. The extra heft would enable Ralcorp to better compete with Kellogg and other rivals for space on supermarket shelves and give Ralcorp more purchasing muscle amid rising prices for wheat and other raw materials. Ralcorp makes products such as cereal and frozen waffles for retailers, which sell them under their own brand names.
