 Industrials Climb 21.38 to Record In Slow, Almost Methodical Move   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1987  The industrial average rose 21.38 yesterday to a record 2179.42, eclipsing the previous record of 2163.39, set Wednesday. The advance was slow and almost methodical, in sharp contrast to some recent sessions dominated by wild swings in computer-assisted program trading.  Secondary stocks performed strongly. The American Stock Exchange's Market Value Index rose 3.68 to 304.15, while in the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index gained a hefty 5.12, or more than 1.25%, to 397.18.  Semiconductor stocks were especially strong, beginning with Intel, which received a strong recommendation from Kidder Peabody analyst Adam Cuhney. He speculated that the new generation of International Business Machines personal computers, to be introduced in April, will need the type of chips made by Intel. Intel rose 3 1/2 to 34 3/4 in OTC trading.
