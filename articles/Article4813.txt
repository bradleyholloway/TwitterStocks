 P&G Creates New Posts in Latest Step To Alter How Firm Manages Its Brands   By By Richard Koenig, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1987  Procter & Gamble Co. is taking another step in modifying the way it manages its ubiquitous brands of consumer products.  In a meeting with employees last week, top executives said they are creating new managerial posts to oversee entire product categories. Although the company provided few details, the change appears to give the new managers authority to coordinate marketing strategy among the product brand managers who will rank below them. Traditionally, brand managers, who are responsible for the marketing of their products, have been encouraged to compete against one another, just as they do against other companies.  Mr. McHenry and others maintain that large companies need to alter management roles so that individual executives can better be held accountable for performance across product categories, not just brands. While trying to appeal to different consumer tastes, large companies have seen their brands proliferate. P&G now has more than 80 brands, including such household names as Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste.
