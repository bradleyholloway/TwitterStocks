 Spanish TV's Hottest Soap Is Off-Screen --- Televisa-Univision Feud Over Content Sizzles; The Stakes? Caramba!   By By David Luhnow and Eduardo Porter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2001  Though Televisa is stuck providing Univision's flagship network with programming through 2017 under a 1992 deal, the company is using Univision's need for additional content for its second network as leverage to renegotiate the original deal on more-favorable terms. Currently, ads aired during Televisa's shows account for about 40% of Univision revenues; Televisa gets back 9% of total Univision sales.  The people familiar with the talks say Televisa wants to raise its take of Univision revenue to 15% for both networks, as well as increase its equity stake in the broadcaster to 14% from 6%. In return, in addition to payment for the boosted stake, Televisa would give Univision broader rights to its programs for both open-air channels and pay TV, including Puerto Rico, where Televisa content currently goes to Univision rival Telemundo Communications Group.  Univision currently pulls nearly 80% of the U.S. Spanish-language television audience with a lineup heavy on Televisa soap operas, which are cheaper to produce than Univision's in-house shows, made north of the border. But Univision officials say it may not need as much Televisa content for its second network, which will target the majority of Hispanic homes that also watch programs in English, especially young males.
