 Spies After All   By By Ronald Radosh, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1999  Somehow, the controversies of the (Joe) McCarthy era never seem to go away. And maybe that isn't such a bad thing -- if, as one would hope, old verdicts can be tested against new evidence. One of the outstanding questions to consider, in light of recently opened archives, is the nature and extent of Soviet espionage in the U.S. Did the KGB (and its predecessor, the NKVD) really have top level agents at the heart of the federal government in Washington in the 1930s and '40s?  This question and others are addressed in "The Haunted Wood" (Random House, 402 pages, $30), an investigation by the historian Allen Weinstein and the former Soviet KGB agent Alexander Vassiliev. Together they tell the previously unknown saga of those pro-Soviet Americans "who sacrificed country for cause in `the haunted wood'" of espionage and who devoted themselves with "inglorious constancy to a cruel and discredited faith."  We now have the full story. Dodd, in fact, volunteered her services to the NKVD while her father was still ambassador in the 1930s. Messrs. Weinstein and Vassiliev found the self-profile Dodd wrote, evidently a necessity for KGB recruits. "It goes without saying," Dodd told Moscow, "that my services of any kind and at any time are proposed to the party for use at its discretion." Her husband, recruited by Dodd in 1942, set up a business that functioned as a cover for Soviet spies. So much for the "frame-up."
