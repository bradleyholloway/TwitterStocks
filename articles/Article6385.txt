 Winn-Dixie Ousts CEO Lazaran, Will Name Outsider as Successor   By Gray, Steven, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2004  Neither Mr. [Frank Lazaran], 48, nor Mr. [Peter L. Lynch] could be reached for comment. The management change comes amid poor performance by Winn-Dixie, which has been struggling to stay competitive with rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Publix. Winn-Dixie shares have fallen by more than half in the past year. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the shares were down seven cents to $4.01.  Mr. Lazaran became chief executive and president of Winn-Dixie in June 2003 after having joined the company as executive vice president and chief operating officer in April 2002. Previously he had been president of Safeway Inc.'s Texas division since 1999. He began his career as a bagger at the Ralphs grocery chain in 1974.
