 Gillette Head Revises P&G Role, Sparking Talk of His Next Move   By Ellen Byron and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2006  Mr. [James Kilts], 58 years old, is stepping down as head of Gillette to devote his attention to integrating Gillette into Cincinnati-based P&G, the consumer-products giant said. Mr. Kilts had said he would quit a year after the $57 billion acquisition of Gillette closed, which is Oct. 1. But two longtime Kilts acquaintances said yesterday that he may step down as soon as this summer.  Amid several announced management changes, P&G said 52-year-old Mark Leckie, head of Gillette's Duracell and Braun businesses, will succeed Mr. Kilts as head of Gillette and report to P&G CEO A.G. Lafley. In addition to focusing on the integration, Mr. Kilts is also expected to help ease Mr. Leckie into his new role, Gillette spokesman Eric Kraus said.
