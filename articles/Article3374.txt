 Retail Sales Had Banner Holiday, Signal Solid '05   By Dunham, Kemba J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2005  Some economists say the numbers were impressive, considering the economy faced some challenges during 2004. "We had a year in which there was no additional fiscal stimulus, rising short-term interest rates, higher energy prices and less mortgage-refinancing activity, and yet consumers continued to spend at a healthy clip," says Steve Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics in Danville, Calif. Mr. Wood said the sales results indicate that consumers remain confident about the economic outlook.  David Resler, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York, says healthy retail-sales growth reflects "the recovery of jobs we saw this year, [which] allows more people to spend." Mr. Resler said the growth in sales in December and for the year indicates that the U.S. economy, as measured by changes in gross domestic product, is growing at an annual pace of 3.5% to 4%.
