 Health Costs: Time to Rethink Medigap   By Lueck, Sarah, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2005  Medigap insurance, also known as Medicare supplemental coverage, is meant to fill in some of the gaps in the federal health program for the elderly and disabled. Sold by private insurers, Medigap policies come in 12 standardized forms labeled with the letters A through L. They pay some or all of Medicare's co-insurance and deductibles, as well as some items the program doesn't cover, for about 10 million people who choose to purchase them.  Whatever the decision, Medigap H, I and J drug coverage has drawbacks compared to the Medicare drug plans. For one thing, Medigap isn't subsidized by the government, so the beneficiary pays the full premium. And Medigap tends to provide less-generous drug coverage. Medigap H and I, for example, cap what they'll pay out for drugs at $1,250 each year; plan K caps its annual drug benefit at $3,000. Medicare drug plans have no limit, which provides protection in case of unexpected costs. "The basic arithmetic never changes," says Walton Francis, who writes a popular consumer guide on health insurance for federal employees. "Everyone in Medigap (H, I and J) should get out, without exception."
