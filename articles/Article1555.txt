 Business and Finance [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1992  TAX CUTS including an increase in the personal exemption, liberalized depreciation allowances for businesses and a credit of at least $2,000 for first-time home buyers are expected to be proposed by Bush, barring any last-minute changes. The package would also include a reduction in the capital gains tax. The proposed personal exemption boost may be limited to families with children.  Stock prices surged despite some grim economic reports, while bond prices declined. The Dow Jones industrials climbed 60.60 points to a record 3246.20 in heavy trading. Other stock indexes also set records. The dollar rose sharply against the mark, but lost ground against the yen.  Sales of U.S. cars slumped in early January, falling below the levels set in December and a depressed year-earlier period and reinforcing a belief that auto sales can't get any weaker. Ford's total vehicle sales rose 2.7% from a year earlier. GM's fell 11.5%.
