 Barclays Says That It's Signing Up 10,000 a Week for Internet Banking   By By Erik Portanger, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1999  The comments followed similarly enthusiastic language this week from rival British bank Abbey National PLC, which boasted it will "revolutionize" financial services over the next three years by spending GBP 100 million ($162.2 million) to develop online services. National Westminster Bank PLC also weighed in, vowing to spend GBP 100 million on electronic banking this year, and HSBC Holdings PLC said it will launch a digital-television banking service in coming months.  While most British banks have some online services, such as bill payments and cash transfers, many are trying to use the technology to cross-sell new products to customers. Barclays, for example, said it will launch a range of savings products and possibly even mortgages later this year. "We're still shaping the products," Mr. (Peter) Middleton said. "The main thing is improving the service we give to online customers."
