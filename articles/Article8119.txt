 USA Today's Publisher Quits To Head ANPA   By By Patrick M. Reilly, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1991  The new post for Ms. Black, 47 years old and one of the highest-ranking women in newspaper publishing, was announced here at the opening session of the annual ANPA convention. She will be succeeded as USA Today publisher by Tom Curley, the newspaper's president and the brother of Gannett Chairman John J. Curley.  In Ms. Black, Gannett is losing one of its most visible and highly regarded newspaper executives. She had struggled for eight years to bring USA Today, the country's largest general-interest newspaper, to profitability. In 1990, USA Today had a loss of about $5 million.  Mr. Curley said Gannett didn't make a counter offer to keep Ms. Black. Sources within the ANPA said Ms. Black isn't expected to be taking a pay cut; the group is expected to match her Gannett compensation. At USA Today last year she received salary of $400,000, plus a $200,000 bonus, plus stock. Gannett executives said Ms. Black may have moved to a new job in the company even if the ANPA offer hadn't been made. Gannett had considered, but decided against, bidding for News Corp.'s big magazine group, and Ms. Black would have been a top candidate to run such a new property, insiders said.
