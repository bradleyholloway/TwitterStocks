 Ouch! Adventures in the 'Pain Trade'; Recent Treasury Rallies Have Caused Lots of Losses For a Whole Lot of Investors   By Crane, Agnes T, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  The market's reaction to the Institute for Supply Management's January manufacturing survey on Monday was a case in point. The headline business-activity index reported solid growth in a sector battered by the economic slowdown two years ago. The component sensitive to price increases, meanwhile, posted a multiyear high, which under more-normal circumstance would punish Treasurys.  In yesterday's market activity, U.S. Treasurys posted reasonable gains, buoyed by security scares in Washington and the Bank of Japan's apparent hefty currency intervention.
