 Toyota, Honda Raise Auto Production in Japan   By Takahashi, Yoshio, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 2006  Nissan, Japan's second-biggest car maker by sales volume, said its production in Japan fell 30% from a year earlier to 87,518 vehicles on lower output of its Note and March compact models and the X-Trail sport-utility vehicle. Exports fell 18% to 50,417 vehicles, as it reduced shipments to the U.S. and Europe.  Mazda Motor Corp., the Japanese affiliate of Ford Motor Co. of the U.S., said April production in Japan rose 5.1% from a year earlier to 76,534 vehicles, partly because of a rise in shipments of the CX-7 crossover sport-utility vehicle to North America. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said production rose 29% from a year earlier to 56,357 vehicles in the month, marking the 11th consecutive month of rises.
