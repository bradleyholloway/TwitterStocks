The Henry Street Settlement's New Federal Theater usually reflects admirably the diversity of the people of the Lower East Side in its plays, written by those who are part of all this and relished by audiences that have shared the experience. ''La Chefa,'' showing there this weekend, is about New York's Puerto Ricans, and if it is fascinating to its local audience, it is surely interesting to others.  ''La Chefa,'' by Tato Laviera, is set in the neighborhood during the 1950's. It is too long, but the audience, a mixture of Lower East Side ethnic strains that added to the enjoyment of the evening, did not seem to mind; it was living its own life recognizably with the cast on stage.  This is professional theater as well, with a first-rate cast directed by Raul Davila, and it must be judged by both community and stage standards. As a play, it needs work, tighter editing for a work that simply has too much to say. This hunger to tell all gets in the way of the drama itself. Yet Mr. Laviera writes with knowledge, humor and a deep sensitivity to his subject. ''La Chefa'' is in English, but there are lines in Spanish that drew appreciative laughter from those who understood.  The characters are well drawn and have personalities that transcend the stereotypes they portray. The story centers on a family that, in the 1950's, had been in New York for a long time. The patriarch is a proud Puerto Rican and a proud American. He is a dignified gentleman, and he has even managed to buy the building in which the family lives from the proceeds of his lottery business.  But the real head of the family is La Chefa, his widowed daughterin-law, who holds everyone together. Among the others in the household are her teen-age son, rebellious yet loving; her brother who is a musician and a narcotics addict, and another who has two girlfriends and is intent on making money. There are a Jewish businessman who is family friend, a young Irish priest, a prostitute and a very lively female factory worker.  The family lives on the uncertain edge that is home to the newcomer in a strange land, encountering all of the evils and some of the good, and it is these incidents that form the story. But Mr. Laviera has faith and hope in his people, and he spins a yarn that is realistic but optimistic.  Alfonso Manosalvas is grand as the patriarch, and Denia Brache gives a beautiful performance in the title role. She can most convincingly portray grief, maternal domination and high humor and then display a girlish joy in shaking her hips to the music. Michael Yanez, as the son, is the quintessence of the new generation caught between two cultures. The rest of the cast is no less deft in enveloping us in this world so strange, yet so familiar.  ''La Chefa'' may not be transcendental theater, but at the same time it is the very essence of what theater is all about; it tells the audience something about itself.
