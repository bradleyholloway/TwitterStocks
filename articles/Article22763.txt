 Pentagon Memo Instills More Confusion About the White House's China Policy   By By Neil King, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2001  The Pentagon sowed deeper confusion over the Bush administration's China policy when it rescinded a memo saying that the U.S. was suspending all military ties with Beijing. Instead, officials said, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld would weigh future contacts on a "case-by-case basis."  The mix-up, coming amid U.S. efforts to recover its damaged Air Force surveillance plane from China's Hainan Island, was blamed on a memo written by an aide to Mr. Rumsfeld. Pentagon spokesman Craig Quigley said the aide "misinterpreted the secretary's intentions" by declaring a suspension of military-to-military relations.
