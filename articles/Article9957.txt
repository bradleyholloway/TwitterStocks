 Reinventing the Wheel / The latest car technology   By Flandez, Raymund, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2006  How to Get It: In both the Toyota Sienna and Rav 4, the glove boxes are stacked one on top of the other in the front-passenger side area (the upper one is a bit smaller than the lower one). The Japanese auto maker's FJ Cruiser sport-utility vehicle has an upper storage compartment on the dashboard -- this one on the driver's side. Toyota is working on putting a removable global-positioning-system pop-up device in that space. The Toyota Yaris Liftback also has two glove boxes, which many Yaris buyers will appreciate since most of them are downsizing from bigger cars. Meanwhile, Nissan has the dual glove compartments in its Xterra, Frontier and Pathfinder vehicles in which the top glove box opens up, while the lower one's cover flips down.
