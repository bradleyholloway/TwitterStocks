LAS VEGAS, Nev.â€” THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION introduced its long-awaited Access data base management program here yesterday, filling one of the last major gaps in the software giant's product line.  In a bold attempt to pre-empt its probable main rival (the Windows version of Borland International Inc.'s popular Paradox program, now not expected until early next year) Microsoft will sell Access for $99 until Jan. 31, 1993, when the full suggested list price of $495 will take effect. As a relative newcomer to the data base arena, Microsoft is essentially giving away Access in order to gain a share of the market now in the possession of Borland's Paradox and other more expensive data base programs, like Oracle.
