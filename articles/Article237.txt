Incurable romantics who long to rendezvous under the Biltmore clock will find it again in a matter of months - but they will have to go to Eighth Avenue.  The clock will find a temporary home in the lobby of the Milford Plaza Hotel, on Eighth Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets.  The Milford Plaza, like the Biltmore, is owned by the Milstein family.  The most celebrated of the Biltmore Hotel's treasures, the clock graced the entry to the Palm Court until last Friday, when crews began to dismantle the interior of the 68-year-old hotel, on 43d Street between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues.  Made of solid bronze, the clock hung from an arch in the Biltmore. It has two Roman-numeral faces, with two female figures entwined between them, and is about 4 feet wide and 2 1/2 feet high.  The tradition of meeting under the clock was begun by Ivy League college students but was embraced over the years by many others. In ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' J. D. Salinger chronicled those lobby encounters.  The clock will remain at the Milford Plaza for about two years. It is to return to the Biltmore after that structure is stripped to its skeleton, reclad in granite and reopened as the Eastern headquarters of the Bank of America.  A spokesman for the San Francisco bank said the timepiece would be placed in the building's lobby. ''You'll still be able to meet under the clock,'' he said.
