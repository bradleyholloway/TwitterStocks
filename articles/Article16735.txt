 Cold Snap Emboldens Oil's Bulls; Sentiment Change May Force Prices Above $60; Riding an 18% Increase   By Chambers, Matt, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2007  "When oil prices were around $60 to $65 a barrel, the prospect of noncompliance with OPEC cuts gave people a glass-is-half-empty view, but the concept of a $40 handle changed that view to glass-is-half- full," said Peter Beutel, president of trading advisory firm Cameron Hanover in New Canaan, Conn. "Now, in the $50s, people are thinking even some cuts will have an effect." Mr. Beutel predicts prices will rise above $60 within the next two weeks.  "When you see a rise like Tuesday's, it's urgent buying, and 95% of the time that tells you people were caught short and they had to cover" positions taken when crude was sliding, Mr. Beutel said. "We are seeing instances of fresh buying, but we added so many new short positions at the beginning of the year that I think this is mostly short-covering."  "I believe there has been new buying by funds, but it is hard to confirm," Mr. [Tom Bentz] said. "In the past, you could see it coming onto the floor because everybody knew who was doing the funds' business, but now with electronic markets they can do their business anonymously."
