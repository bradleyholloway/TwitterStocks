 How Some Cities Get LOOTed   By By Linda Paustian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1987  This scenario played Houston last week with the opening of the $105 million George R. Brown Convention Center. It has also played recently in Washington, New York and San Diego, and is now running in Denver, Minneapolis and in my home, Philadelphia. The script and scenery are similar in each city and all the parts are played by a bipartisan group I like to call the Leaders Of Our Town, or LOOT. The members of LOOT, most of whom suffer from an "edifice complex," think that building a new, large taxpayer-financed convention center will fix everything.  Sixty cities are now building or expanding their convention centers for a total cost of more than $6 billion. Between 1975 and 1985, more than 250 public-assembly facilities were built or renovated, adding at least 12 million square feet of exhibit and meeting space. An important reason for this boom is a relatively new source of funding: In the late 1970s, many cities passed laws levying taxes on hotel rooms and earmarking the funds for promoting tourism, especially convention centers. The biggest source of funds, however, is local and state taxpayers who subsidize visitors' conventions by paying millions in construction costs and debt service and millions more in annual operating losses.  In Philadelphia, convention-center mania has reached new heights: Instead of renovating the existing convention center, which is one of the largest in the country and which operates at a loss of more than a million dollars annually, the Leaders Of Our Town are building another one at a projected cost of $500 million. In the process, they are demolishing 89 buildings on five downtown blocks and evicting 170 businesses with 2,000 employees. LOOT is planning this based on two studies carried out by the very people who will make millions if the center is built -- so-called experts who are hotel, convention and trade-show consultants.
