 Chase Says `Relationships' Can Do It All   By By Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 1999  In a television advertising blitz that starts Sunday during "60 Minutes," Chase is keeping its longrunning tagline, "The Right Relationship Is Everything." But now the nation's No. 3 banking company hopes to portray itself as a more powerful, do-it-all financier for everything from arranging a home mortgage to managing emerging-market risk.  Of course, Chase, which merged with Chemical Banking Corp. in 1996, isn't unique in stressing relationships and power in financial services. In fact, the uplifting chorus and some of the images in the ads feel reminiscent of other financialservices promotions. Even the homes in two of Chase's ads look the same, despite the fact that one is supposed to be in Austin and one in Houston. A house in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was used for both.  The ad caused consternation among some Chase competitors, who suggest Chase isn't as powerful as it makes out. They argue Chase has built that investment-grade debt business by underwriting short-term debt paper that yields little profit but looks impressive in league tables. In fact, in the league tables for fees generated by issuing investment-grade debt, Chase's position hasn't budged in two years, staying at eighth place.
