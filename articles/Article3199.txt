 U.S. Floats Revised Iraq Resolution; Plan Sets Dec. 15 Deadline For Constitutional Agenda In Bid to Win U.N. Support   By Bravin, Jess, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2003  "The point is there is a Dec. 15 deadline, which is a big give," a U.S. official said. The measure "invites" the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council, working with the U.S.-led coalition and the U.N., to provide the Security Council with "a timetable and a program" for drafting a new Iraqi constitution and holding elections under it.  The new U.S. measure's chances may depend on whether U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan "is happy with what he reads," a Security Council diplomat said. U.N. officials said Mr. Annan was still studying the proposal.  U.N. officials said Mr. Annan isn't willing to put his staff at risk in Iraq if the organization is perceived as an adjunct to U.S. occupation rather than a separate player moving to restore Iraqi independence. The new draft asks the U.N. to provide assistance in the transition to local rule "as circumstances permit," a phrase intended to give Mr. Annan discretion in sending staff to Iraq.
