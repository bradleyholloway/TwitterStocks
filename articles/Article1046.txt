 New Import Rules On Software Items Approved in Brazil   By By Julia Michaels, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 1988  SAO PAULO, Brazil -- President Jose Sarney yesterday signed Brazil's regulations governing computer software in a move aimed at averting threatened sanctions by the U.S.  The U.S. last November threatened to impose 100% duties on about $105 million of Brazilian goods exported to the U.S. because it said Brazil was arbitrarily limiting imports of U.S. software. Until now, Brazil limited software imports but hadn't clearly defined criteria for deciding what software could be imported. U.S. software makers and government officials have pressed Brazil to relax its restrictions.  The regulations appear to provide much detail on the crucial question of how the government will compare a potential import with software already available in Brazil. In cases where a Brazilian substitute is available, the import won't be allowed. Brazil's Special Informatics Secretariat, or SEI, will make the determination on most of the imports.
