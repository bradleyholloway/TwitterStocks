 Monster Worldwide Gave Officials Options Ahead of Share Run-Ups   By Charles Forelle and Mark Maremont, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2006  Mr. [James J. Treacy], who has since left Monster, said that, like any other employee, he had no involvement in the options-granting process, which he said was "all in the purview" of the board's compensation committee and Andrew McKelvey, Monster's founder and chief executive. He said he believes the dates were "the days that the comp committee and Andy granted" the options.  Mr. McKelvey, who himself never received options from the company, said he is "completely responsible," as the company's most senior executive, for option grants to everyone else. He said Monster has begun a review to determine why the grants were often priced at lows. "To date there is nothing that we see in terms of backdating or improprieties," he said, stressing that the review wasn't complete. Monster's board has also begun a review.  Prior to the company's statement, John R. Norton III, chairman of the compensation committee of Apollo's board, said in an interview Thursday: "Our option policies are clean and straightforward. We never backdated options. Never once." Mr. Norton added that hearing about other companies that may have backdated options "just blew me away." He said he was amazed at the lengths some executives would go "to steal from the shareholders." Yesterday, Mr. Norton said he didn't have time to comment further.
