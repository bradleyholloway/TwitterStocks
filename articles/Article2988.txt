 Indonesia's Crisis Reveals Its Weaknesses --- Prescription for Recovery Will Be Hard to Swallow   By By Wall Street Journal Staff Reporters Darren McDermott in Singapore And Richard Borsuk in Jakarta, Indonesia, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1997  Executives and investors in Indonesia are still trying to figure out what just hit them. But they are also hoping that this week's financial storm -- which has battered Indonesian markets harder than any in Southeast Asia outside Thailand -- will wash away decades of inefficiency, protectionism and corruption.  A month ago, Indonesia was considered one of the least likely to suffer from the currency crisis threatening the region. But since the central bank last week freed the rupiah from its 12% trading band against the U.S. dollar, allowing the market to set its value, the currency has plunged, sucking Indonesia's stock market and economic-growth forecasts down with it.  In the process, it has become clear that while Indonesia in the past could boast more-sanguine economic data than many of its neighbors, deep-seated problems of protectionism and unrestrained foreign borrowing by private companies left it no less immune than Malaysia or the Philippines to investors' reassessments following Thailand's financial shake-up.
