 Big Board Bars Broker and Clerk In Trading Probe   By By Dean Starkman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1999  The New York Stock Exchange barred a former floor broker and former floor clerk for rule violations related to illegal-trading investigations, adding to the list of floor personnel named in administrative and criminal probes into trading activity on the exchange floor.  The disciplinary actions, taken by a Big Board disciplinary panel on Dec. 30 and announced yesterday, are the latest in a series of disciplinary actions taken against independent floor brokers in the past year. Separately, eight floor brokers, another clerk and two principals of a small brokerage firm have been charged in a criminal investigation headed by the U.S. Attorney's office in New York. Four people have pleaded guilty in that probe.
