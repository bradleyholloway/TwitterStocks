 Career Journal: The Jungle   By By Kemba J. Dunham, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2002  Upset over workers and union pension funds harmed by the collapsed Houston energy company, the AFL-CIO is lobbying 21 companies not to renominate 11 Enron directors serving on their boards. Last month, Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the labor group, sent out a letter to the companies, calling for the removal of the directors who are unable to prove how they tried to protect shareholders.  Still, despite the lackluster responses to the AFL-CIO, there have been some resignations since the letter went out. On Jan. 30, Enron director Robert Jaedicke resigned from California Water Service Group's board where he had served since 1974. A representative of the utility said Mr. Jaedicke resigned on his own. Last week, Wendy Gramm announced her resignation from the fund boards of Invesco Funds Group Inc., a Denver mutual-fund unit of Amvescap PLC, where she had served as an independent director since 1997. An Invesco spokeswoman declined to comment on whether it was Dr. Gramm's decision to resign. Dr. Gramm didn't return calls seeking comment.
