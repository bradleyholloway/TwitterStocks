 Leading the News: Bush, EU Both Fight 'Buy American'   By Glenn R. Simpson and Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 2003  In a July 4 letter to Mr. [Donald Rumsfeld], Dutch Defense Secretary Cees van der Knaap blasted the measure as "a giant leap backward" in U.S. trade policy. He said it ran contrary to a defense agreement between the U.S. and the Netherlands. "The proposals have already attracted wide attention in Europe and will undoubtedly lead to more-serious demands by some for 'Buy European' provisions in European procurement," he warned.  He nonetheless said he may be open to possible changes. "It's something that we'll negotiate," he said.  Such efforts also could hamper Pentagon efforts to transform the U.S. military into a higher-tech service. "The [Bush] administration can forget about transforming the military into anything other than a technological backwater" if the provisions survive, said Loren Thompson, president of the Lexington Institute, a defense-focused think tank. "The Soviet Union had a 'Buy Russian' policy that closed its economy to most of the world, and everybody knows how that worked out."
