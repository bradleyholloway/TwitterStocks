 IRS Says Tax Laws Hinder Oversight Of TV Ministries   By By Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1987  The Internal Revenue Service said it can't ensure tax compliance by television ministries under the current system in which churches are exempt from reporting to the government.  At a congressional hearing exploring the financial accountability of television ministries, IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs said current law "imposes substantial impediments" to the IRS effort to see that charitable contributions to these ministries aren't used for personal or business purposes.  Assistant Treasury Secretary Don Chapoton suggested that Congress consider establishing "procedural safeguards against unreasonable compensation" of ministry leaders. He added, however, that current laws governing tax-exempt organizations are "by and large adequate."
