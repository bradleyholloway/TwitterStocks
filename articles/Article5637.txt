 For `Smart' Glass, Shades of Progress   By By Raju Narisetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1998  Mr. Saxe and Research Frontiers' 10 other employees are trying to perfect a technology that will let people -- at the touch of a power switch -- control exactly how much light their windows allow into a room. Switch them off, and the windows are nearly impenetrable. Hit the switch, and instantaneously, they turn into clear glass. Turn a knob, and the windows can be "dimmed" to let in just the right amount of sun stream.  It isn't just for windows. The technology, dubbed suspended particle devices, or SPDs, could be used in sunroofs and rear-view mirrors for cars, for sunglasses and ski goggles and, if Mr. Saxe has his way, flat-panel screens for computers.  No kidding. It has taken 32 years and about $27 million for Mr. Saxe and Research Frontiers -- the last 12 years as a publicly traded company -- to bring the technology to a point where it appears ready to leave the company's Long Island lab and enter a glass factory. Even now, the most optimistic estimates don't foresee high-volume products using SPD technology appearing for at least two years. And other licensees, including Glaverbel SA, General Electric Co. and Japan Steel Works, have so far done little with the technology.
