 Hollywood Journal -- Summer Movies: Hollywood Takes a Chance   By By Tom King, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 20, 2001  Well, you said you wanted something different. After a 14% drop in movie attendance last summer, Hollywood may finally be departing from the old formulas. Instead of the usual he-man suspects, Angelina Jolie will star in one of the season's big adventure movies. Warner Bros. is betting on a potentially depressing sci-fi movie about a couple who raise -- then reject -- a robot. And then there's "Moulin Rouge," with Ms. [Nicole Kidman] testing her untested singing talent in the first major movie musical in years.  THE BUZZ: There is none, that's the problem. At the theater owners' convention in Las Vegas last month, exhibitors saw "[Shrek]" on Tuesday. After the screening, they were buzzing about "Shrek." On Thursday, they saw "Atlantis." After the screening, they were buzzing about "Shrek."  THE BUZZ: A presold hit with a practically guaranteed $100 million-plus gross. Executive producer Mr. [Steven Spielberg] passed off directing duties on this to Joe Johnston, of the fantasy hit "Jumanji." Sam Neill, the paleontologist from the first movie, is back for another go 'round. As always in Jurassic Park, the real stars are the dinos, including the new Spinosaurus who's bigger and meaner than T-Rex, and the Pteranodons, flying dinosaurs that swoop down and snap people up in their jaws.
