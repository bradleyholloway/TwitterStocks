 Cost of Medical Devices Chafes; Hospitals Fight Back, Demand Orthopedic Firms Lower Prices   By Leila Abboud and Paul Davies, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  Now some hospitals are driving harder bargains with orthopedic companies and trying to convince doctors to use less-expensive devices. Their effort to weaken the close ties between device makers and doctors has gotten a boost from a continuing Justice Department investigation into the device industry's marketing practices. In March, Stryker, Biomet, Zimmer, DePuy and Smith & Nephew disclosed that they had been subpoenaed.  Jason Wittes, an analyst with Leerink Swann & Co., downgraded the group to "market perform" and cut earnings estimates in February because of pricing-pressure concerns. Mr. Wittes doesn't own shares of orthopedic-device makers. Hospitals are challenging "the traditional ties between the orthopedic companies and the orthopedic surgeons," Mr. Wittes wrote in a March report. Leerink has conducted nonsecurities and nonbanking-related business with Stryker.  Last year, orthopedic suppliers hit HCA Inc., the U.S.'s biggest hospital chain, with a 20% price increase. This year, HCA has reduced the number of device makers it bought from, and demanded discounts in exchange for higher volume. Biomet refused to go along and was dropped as a supplier. Johnson & Johnson's DePuy, Stryker and Zimmer agreed. Leerink's Mr. Wittes says HCA won price reductions of 15% to 20% on average.
