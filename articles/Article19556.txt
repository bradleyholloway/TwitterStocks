 DSM to Buy Roche Holding's Vitamins Business   By By Dan Bilefsky and Vanessa Fuhrmans, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  The deal will give the Dutch group, which currently has no vitamins business, activities in food, animal feed and health-product supplements with 1.8 billion Swiss francs ($1.2 billion) in annual sales. With the Roche acquisition, DSM will have annual sales of about eight billion euros, helping it to reach its goal of 10 billion euros by 2005.  Analysts also were skeptical of the fit between Roche's business and DSM's food-ingredients operation, as more than half of Roche's vitamins sales are in the animal-feed market while DSM's focus is on human food.  For Roche, the sale is part of the Swiss drug maker's strategy to transform itself into a pure pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company. In a similar move, Roche recently sold its flavors and fragrances business, Givaudan. In December, the company announced it would dispose of the vitamins business, attracting a number of bidders before settling with DSM.
