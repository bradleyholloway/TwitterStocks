By ELAINE B.ULMAN  The folk songs of the Adriatic celebrate the sun, the sea and love - just what my husband and I needed after three years of restoring a derelict New England farmhouse. Since David's grandparents came from Yugoslavia, we decided to combine a visit to relatives with a trip through the islands off the Adriatic Coast. We do not speak the language and had no definite plans as to where we would go or how we would get there, but we wanted to drift south from the port of Rijeka, using the islands as stepping stones, and land in Dubrovnik 10 days later.  Nearly a thousand islands and reefs are clustered along the jagged coast of Yugoslavia. Most are barren and uninhabited, but the larger ones have supported small fishing settlements since ancient times. Venetian fleets dominated the Adriatic for nearly 800 years, and the yellowed stone palaces and churches that survive in the island towns are remnants of Venetian rule. Though the carved doorways and windows hint at past grandeur, the small scale of the towns with their fortified harbors reminded us that these were distant outposts of an empire built on the sea.  We left Venice in mid-September on a train bound for Trieste and then took a bus to Opatija, a resort town just west of Rijeka, not far from the Italian border. An eight-mile promenade along the shore of the Kvarner Bay links Opatija with several smaller towns to the south, forming what the Yugoslav tourists bureaus have dubbed the ''Opatija Riviera.'' The name conjures up visions of sandy Mediterranean beaches, but the Adriatic offers a rougher sort of beauty. The beaches are mostly pebbles and massive slabs of rock that look as if they were sheared off the hills nearby. The sea is clear and incredibly blue.  From the Belvedere Hotel's verandah, we could make out the hazy outlines of Cres and Krk, the two islands that dominate the Kvarner Bay. We wanted to visit both, but a dinner of roast suckling pig (sold by the kilogram) and djuvetch (a peppery vegetable stew similar to ratatouille) at the Zelengaj Restaurant convinced us that it was too soon to leave Opatija. Instead, we decided to take a day trip to Cres and to return the next night for the Zelangaj's ''specialties of Oriental cuisine' - Bosnian pot (a spicy lamb stew) and Dervish lamb kebab. All dinners cost about $16 for two, including house wine.  The trip to Cres, the town that bears the same name as the island, took almost three hours. Local buses run three times a day from Opatija, and the $4 one-way fare includes a half-hour ferry ride from the dock at Point Brestova, an hour south of Opatija. The single paved road on the island runs along a central ridge high above the sea. Rough limestone walls laid up without mortar crisscross the steep mountainsides, reminding us of the abandoned stone walls that wander through the New England countryside.  The town of Cres seemed deserted when we arrived at noon. The plain stucco facades of the houses around the 16-century Venetian harbor were shuttered against the sun. Cooking smells lured us into the back streets where we found dilapidated Venetian doorways and a score of stray cats, but no lunch, so we returned to the harbor and headed north along the stone quays that form an angular central piazza. The only tourists we saw were a few Germans lolling on a pebble beach. Giving into the island's lethargic pace, we stretched out on some rocks to catch the warmth of a hazy afternoon sun.  Later in the afternoon, tables in front of the slasticarnas, small coffee and pastry shops, were filled with groups of people, and David chatted with a German woman who had summered on Cres for five years. ''There's not much to do here really,'' she said. ''In the day you pack lunch, rent a motorboat, and go off to one of the little coves outside the harbor for a picnic and a swim. Then at night you go to the same slasticarna. After a while they get to know you and greet you, and then you are a friend. Life is very simple here.''  Our dalliance in Opatija and a visit with relatives near Zadar left us only an afternoon to tour Krk, the largest island in the Adriatic. On a map Krk looks deceptively close to Rijeka, but buses run infrequently and the coastal road weaves around the inner face of a huge canyon harbor, a 40-minute drive, before it reaches the new Tito Bridge. To save time and see more of the island, we kept the Zastava 101 car that we had rented for the visit with David's family. To drive over the span that has converted Krk from an island to a peninsula cost 50 dinars (just under $2).  Despite the bridge and a new airport at Omisalj, which has brought an influx of tourists, Krk's interior is a sparsely populated landscape of scrub-brush pastures and woodlands in the north and barren limestone flats in the south. During the Middle Ages a family of Croatian counts, the Frankopans, held off the Venetians from fortified citadels along the coast that have become the island's main tourist attractions. But the partially restored city walls and the Frankopan Cathedral in the town hardly seemed worth the two hours it took to get there. 1 2 3 NEXT PAGE >
