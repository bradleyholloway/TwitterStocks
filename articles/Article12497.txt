 Congress Passes Financial-Services Bill --- Late Requests for Favors And Fixes Precede Votes On Landmark Overhaul   By By Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1999  In the waning hours before final passage of the bill to sweep away Depression-era banking restrictions, lobbyists still were bombarding House and Senate leaders with requests for special favors. Among the narrowly drawn fixes slipped into the legislation to benefit powerful interests, General Electric Co.'s financial arm, GE Capital Services Inc., got a break from certain privacy provisions for retailers that use its credit-card services.  Among the many lobbying skirmishes that occurred as the legislation took shape, big business won the tug of war to limit customer-privacy protections. Financial firms must explain their privacy policies to customers and give them a chance to block the sharing or sale of personal information -- so called "opt out" notices -- to third-party firms. But financial industries beat back efforts to limit the sharing of customer information among insurance, bank and securities affiliates.  That wasn't enough for some. At the behest of the National Retail Federation, GE Capital and other third-party credit-card firms, a line was inserted in the bill without a full conference-committee debate that exempts certain retailers from having to inform card holders about privacy policies and from offering customers the option of blocking the sharing of information. The exemption applies to retailers who offer credit cards issued and serviced by third-party firms, such as GE Capital and Household International Inc.
