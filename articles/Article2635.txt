 1999: The Stage `Odyssey' Mary Zimmerman Gives Homer's Epic Journey A Contemporary Spin   By By Joel Henning, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1999  For example, this "Odyssey" begins with a prologue in which a modern young woman is struggling to understand Robert Fitzgerald's translation of "The Odyssey." A classical Muse appears and embraces her. The young woman becomes the Goddess Athena -- a feisty advocate for Odysseus, constantly struggling to help him make his way home to Ithaca. This often puts her at odds with Zeus, her father. So plucky Athena, played by the lovely sprite, Mariann Mayberry, can be mighty goddess, petulant daughter, classic warrior, as well as Odysseus' remote, unrequited lover as she skitters through virtually every scene of the play.  Ms. Mayberry adds layers of meaning to such scenes as the one where Athena urges Zeus to send Hermes to compel the witch Calypso to release Odysseus from her thrall. And Calypso is no prim maiden sprung to life from a Grecian urn. As played by Heidi Stillman, Calypso writhes seductively around and about Odysseus, suggesting the supernatural power that any passionate, beautiful woman with the will of a goddess can use to bend a man to her will.  Christopher Donahue as Odysseus convinces us of his craft and his cunning, his zest for the moment and his authentic yearning for home and wife. Odysseus, super-rational trickster, never loses control of himself. His best moment comes in the gruesome encounter with Polyphemus, the bloodthirsty Cyclops. Using no more than backlighting, some shadows, the gigantic voice of actor Ed Dixon, a few dolls and a sheet, Ms. (Mary) Zimmerman lets us join in the grisly feast, as the Cyclops munches on the heads of Odysseus' men as if they were canapes. We then watch the canny Odysseus outwit Cyclops by getting him drunk, blinding him and slipping the uneaten crew past his watchful guard camouflaged by Cyclops' flock of sheep.
