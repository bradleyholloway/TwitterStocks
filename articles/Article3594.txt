 FAA Is Tightening Oversight Of Textron's Aircraft Business   By By Andy Pasztor in Los Angeles and Jerry Guidera in Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 20, 2002  The I0-540, TIO-540 and LTIO-540 engines at issue are used on both single and twin-engine aircraft. These include Cessna T206 Stationaire models, built by another Textron unit, as well as Piper Mirage, Malibu, Mojave, Navajo, Saratoga and Aerostar models. These are all general aviation aircraft, typically owned by individuals for their personal use.  All told, the agency now has ordered special inspections of about 2,000 of the largest, six-cylinder engines with turbo-chargers made by Textron-Lycoming, virtually the unit's entire production of such engines over the past five years. Some of the planes are prohibited from further flight until the tests are completed or new crankshafts are installed. The problem stems from a manufacturing defect related to the way the crankshafts were forged.
