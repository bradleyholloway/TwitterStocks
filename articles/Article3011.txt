 Senators Pursue Sept. 11 Funds For Aircraft Maker   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2002  The start-up, Eclipse Aviation Corp., is developing a six-seat turbo jet that it hopes to market as an option for commercial travelers and as a potential air taxi for business trips. Apart from Mr. [Bill Gates], wealthy backers include biotechnology billionaire Alfred Mann and Harold Poling, former chief executive of Ford Motor Co. Eclipse's management has cultivated ties to Mr. [Pete Domenici], a senior member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations committees.  With Eclipse's encouragement, Mr. Domenici began working last fall to authorize a new loan-guarantee fund to help carry the company until its first scheduled deliveries of planes in early 2004. Eclipse has raised $220 million toward its goal of $300 million in start-up capital, and the $50 million in loan guarantees would help bridge the difference as "tail-end financing" as needed, Mr. Domenici said.  While Eclipse isn't mentioned by name, the legislation is tailored to help "manufacturers of small jet turbofan aircraft" with "eight passenger seats or fewer." Cessna also makes small jets that might qualify it for the same credits, but both Sens. Domenici and his Democratic colleague, New Mexico Sen. Jeff Bingaman, said their intent is to help Eclipse.
