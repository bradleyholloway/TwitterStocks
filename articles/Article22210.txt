 Business and Finance [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1996  WELLPOINT HEALTH is in final negotiations to acquire most or all of John Hancock's health-insurance operations. The operations are part of John Hancock's group insurance unit, which last year had premiums of $870 million. While the operations have thin margins, they would be of great value to WellPoint as the managed-care company seeks to expand beyond its California base.  Talks between GM's Canadian unit and auto workers broke down and thousands of workers started walking off the job a few hours before a union-imposed strike deadline.  The Dow Jones Industrials rose 29.07 to 5933.97, while S&P's 500-stock index jumped 4.93 to 694.01, both records. Bonds also rallied, partly on a wave of buying by foreign investors.
