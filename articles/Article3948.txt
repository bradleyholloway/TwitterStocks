 Finding an Annuity That's Right for You   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2005  That's because during accumulation the money is locked away, as with a CD. The big difference: If you cash in a CD early, you'll lose a few months of interest income. If you cancel an annuity contract, you can lose 10%, 15% or more of the contract's value to a surrender charge. Those charges can last seven to 10 years, and sometimes much longer.  For today's retirees, the big risk isn't dying too soon -- it's outliving their retirement savings, "and an immediate annuity means people who need income assurance for life can achieve that," says Earl Pomeroy, a North Dakota Congressman who recently introduced legislation that would allow tax-free treatment of a portion of the income from an annuity.  If you die first, then heirs inherit a much larger tax burden than they might have otherwise. That's because deferred annuities have no "step up" provision. With stocks and mutual funds, the value of the account at your death becomes an heir's cost basis -- even if you started with $100 that's now worth $100,000.
