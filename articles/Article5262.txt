 Panel Votes to Bar Ban on Counseling About Abortion   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1991  The legislation, which follows similar action by the House, reflects the continued pressure on the White House to modify the regulations, which were upheld narrowly by the Supreme Court in May but have sharply divided President Bush's own party. Separate from the committee's measure, which dealt with spending by the Department of Health and Human Services, a free-standing bill overturning the rules is being readied for Senate floor debate next week. Republican proponents have warned the administration that it risks losing in a final veto confrontation on the issue.  In a letter to Minority Leader Robert Dole, Budget Director Richard Darman repeated the President's veto threat but sought to leave some opening for discussions. The president's "intention is to assure that no federal funds are used to support abortion," Mr. Darman wrote, in language crafted with the White House. "He is not in any respect seeking to impose a so-called `gag rule.' The President . . . remains committed to the protection of free speech."  The appropriations provision -- barring enforcement -- passed the House last month and is incorporated in an estimated $204 billion bill that finances not only HHS but also the departments of Labor and Education for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. As part of the same measure, the Senate panel provided increased funding of $162 million for the family-planning clinics affected, but cut more than $1 billion from the House-passed levels for education.
