 Some Money-Center Banks to Emphasize Investment Banking in Wake of Ruling   By By Phillip L. Zweig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1985  Bank strategists and consultants agree that the decision is likely to have a profound effect on some big banks' efforts to compete with regional banks in lending to small and medium-sized businesses. They say it is difficult enough to compete in that market without full-service banking facilities, and as lending capacities of regional banks grow through mergers and acquisitions, the competition will become even tougher.  Gerald Weiss, senior vice president for corporate planning at Chase Manhattan Bank, says the Supreme Court's "8-0 decision makes it difficult to do classical lending" out of regional loan offices. He says Chase will concentrate on merchant banking services. "Those will be pursued even more," he adds.  Likewise, A.D. Frazier, senior vice president and head of the corporate resources department at First Chicago Corp., says he sees an opportunity for big banks that want to expand nationally. They should "press for expanded powers to offer additional products that would enable them to leverage their facilities and loan production offices." Unlike Chase, First Chicago, which has followed a Midwest-oriented strategy, applauded the court decision, Mr. Frazier says.
