 Asides: Better Green Than Growth   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1992  An editorial notes a Gallup poll that says 57% of voting-age Americans want to elect politicians who'd impose more environmental restrictions on business. The editorial says that if these are the same people who think their lives won't be as good as that of their parents, they should stop whining and enjoy the high-cost environment they're so happy to pay for.
