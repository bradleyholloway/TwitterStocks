 Grant Thornton Loses Big Client; Defection of Countrywide Comes as Accounting Firm Is Tarred by Parmalat Case   By Cassell Bryan-Low and Jonathan Weil in New York and David Reilly in London, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2004  Countrywide President Stanford Kurland said his company's move is unrelated to Grant Thornton's woes in Italy. Instead, he said the finance company, in Calabasas, Calif., is switching because it has grown so rapidly in the past several years. Countrywide -- one of only two Grant Thornton clients that are in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of big companies -- said it now will use KPMG LLP, one of the Big Four accounting firms. Countrywide, which will continue to use Grant Thornton to complete the audit of its 2003 financial statements, began soliciting bids from other accounting firms in October.  Grant Thornton has served as auditor of Countrywide since the early 1970s. In 2002, Countrywide paid Grant Thornton $1.3 million in fees, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Kurland declined to discuss whether Countrywide planned to continue using Grant Thornton for services outside the audit. "We've had a very good experience with Grant," and "they will be considered along with other firms," he said.  Grant Thornton's other S&P 500 audit client is industrial-equipment supplier W.W. Grainger Inc. A spokesman for the Lake Forest, Ill., company said, "Grainger has a longstanding relationship with Grant Thornton, and we have been very satisfied with the work they have done for us." Asked if the firm was considering a change in auditors, he responded, "We don't think it is appropriate to speculate on future plans." Grant Thornton received $764,147 in fees from Grainger in 2002.
