 Nations agree to drop computer tariffs   By Cooper, Helene; Bahree, Bhushan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 1996  At a WTO meeting on Dec 12, 1996, member countries agreed to abolish tariffs on computers, software and related goods. The pact, negotiated on the periphery of the WTO's ministerial meeting, is a boon for high-tech companies that envision global markets for the products. The US had pushed hard for the information-technology agreement, and the EU, which had less at stake, sought and won a side deal accelerating tariff cuts on shipments of liquors.
