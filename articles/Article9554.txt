 Tan, Black and Red: All Over? --- As Plaid Craze Peaks, Burberry Tries to Be More Than Trendy; Beyond Bikinis and Dog Bowls   By By Erin White and Cecilie Rohwedder, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2003  Eager to serve a wider swath of the public, Burberry also is experimenting with lower-priced lines. A collection called Thomas Burberry, now sold only in Spain, will be tested in Britain this fall. The line consists of denims, cottons and other casual clothes aimed at 18- to 25-year-olds, a younger target market than for the core of its main collection. Items will cost about 30% less than the Burberry London line.  Burberry plans to sell the line through some of its current department-store customers, but also to new shops, such as Urban Outfitters in the United Kingdom. Thomas Burberry won't use the parent's signature check. Another path to growth is increasing selling space. Burberry plans this year to open eight new Burberry stores, including four in the U.S.  Some shoppers say they like Burberry with or without the plaid. Emma Veysey, an 18-year-old from Wales shopping in London, bought a handbag and wallet, both plaid. "I just like the brand," she says. But Ms. [Tappi], the headhunter, is holding the line on her Burberry strike. She has even forbidden her boyfriend to wear his Burberry plaid trousers.
