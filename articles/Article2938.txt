 Small-Stock Focus: Macromedia, Quixote, QRS Slide Amid Technology, Telecom Tumble   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2001  The latest round of layoff announcements and profit warnings, "are causing people to be concerned about the extent of the recession," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. Stocks had run up the past few weeks on the idea that the worst of the economic downturn has passed, and that a recovery was imminent. But "it appears that the market has run too far, too fast," Mr. Ackerman said.  QRS, a Richmond, Va., supplier of merchandise-logistics systems and databases for retail stores, fell 1.88, or 13%, to 12.17. The company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue guidance and announced a broad restructuring plan, citing challenging market conditions. QRS is realigning products, cutting 10% of its full-time work force and consolidating real estate, all of which will result in a restructuring charge of $7 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter.  Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 2.84, or 15%, to 21.99. The Carlsbad, Calif., drug developer and Amgen signed a three-year agreement to develop antisense drugs, which work at the genetic level to interrupt the process by which disease-causing proteins are produced. The companies said Amgen has the right to develop and sell the antisense drugs developed by the collaboration, and that Isis will receive milestone payments upon key clinical and commercial achievements, as well as royalties on sales.
