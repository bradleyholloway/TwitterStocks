 The Unsung Authors Behind `A.I.' --- The Spotlight Is on Spielberg And Kubrick, but Others Shared in the Effort, Too   By By John Lippman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2001  "A.I." is being promoted as the historic mind-meld between two distinguished filmmakers: Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Publicity for "A.I." has adhered to a well-rehearsed script: that Mr. Kubrick came up with the idea for the movie, but dicussed it with Mr. Spielberg over the years via marathon transatlantic phone calls and secret faxes. When Mr. Kubrick died unexpectedly in 1999, this version goes, Mr. Spielberg agreed to take over the movie at the behest of the Kubrick family and Warner Brothers, Mr Kubrick's long-time studio.  Mr. Kubrick was notorious in the film world for moving from one collaborator to the next, and eventually, the [Ian Watson]-Kubrick partnership petered out as well. Mr. Kubrick then turned again to [Arthur C. Clarke] for help.  When Mr. Spielberg agreed to direct "A.I." following Mr. Kubrick's death in 1999, he was given a complete screenplay that Mr. Kubrick had written, and that incorporated much of his work with the collaborators, Mr. [Jan Harlan] says.
