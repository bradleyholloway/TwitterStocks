 Retiring, a Step at a Time   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2005  "We see phased retirement as a way to make it attractive for older workers to extend their work lives beyond the time when they would normally think about retiring," says Amy Shannon, an AARP lobbyist.  Some employers -- mainly local governments and universities that aren't subject to the federal rules -- already are experimenting with phased retirement. Other companies sometimes are willing to negotiate phased retirement arrangements individually -- particularly those companies that largely use defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k) plans. Such companies can offer more flexible arrangements for older workers, because the plans already offer penalty-free withdrawals starting at age 59 1/2.  Health-care providers, anxious to keep nurses and other high-demand medical workers from retiring, offer some of the most developed phased-retirement programs so far, says Deborah Russell, who directs AARP's older-worker program. AARP has recognized SSM Health Care in St. Louis, Mo., Bon Secours Richmond Health System in Richmond, Va., and Brethren Village in Lancaster, Pa., for their programs, which let employees work part time while also collecting full retirement benefits along with full health and other benefits.
