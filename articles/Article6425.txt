 Chinadotcom Stirs Investors' Anxiety With Late Results   By By Matt Pottinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2001  Lehman Bros. analyst Nicholas Spratt said Chinadotcom is the top pick of the Asian Internet stocks tracked by Lehman, ahead of Yahoo! Japan Corp. and Softbank Corp. of Japan. Even Goldman Sachs's Mr. [Rajeev Gupta], who last month slashed the target price for Chinadotcom from $27 to $7 after the Feb. 5 write-down, has a "market outperform," or cautious buy, rating on the stock.  Chinadotcom, whose holdings include Chinese-language Internet portals, an online advertising firm and a Web-consulting business, has postponed announcement of its year-2000 results by nearly a month. And late last month, China's state news agency Xinhua -- a pivotal shareholder and a symbol of Beijing's support for Chinadotcom -- registered with U.S. securities regulators for the right to reduce its stake by 16%. That followed a Feb. 5 announcement by Chinadotcom that the company was writing off $70 million of faded goodwill and investments that went south, negating profit for the first three quarters of 2000.
