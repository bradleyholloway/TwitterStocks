 MySpace's Pact With Google Hits a Snag; News Corp.'s Web Unit Seeks Deal With eBay, Causing Some Tension   By Julia Angwin and Kevin J. Delaney, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  The paperwork on the deal hasn't been finalized. The delay doesn't threaten the $900 million -- MySpace installed the [Google] links on its site in December and began receiving payments from Google in January -- but points to MySpace's online-commerce ambitions. Before it signs a longer document finalizing the agreement, MySpace wants to ensure that the terms originally agreed -- as outlined in a hastily drafted deal letter of intent in August -- don't limit its ability to work with third parties such as eBay, according to people familiar with the discussions.  Google isn't likely to favor any deal that promotes eBay services that compete with its own. In the past 18 months Google has been increasingly encroaching on eBay's territory. Google has added a listings service called Base where sellers can post products for sale and an online payment service called Checkout that competes with eBay's PayPal.  Tension over the issue highlights increased rivalry between Google and eBay. The two companies have long described each other as partners, and eBay is one of the largest buyers of search advertising through Google. But a person close to the MySpace deal says Google wants to encourage more eBay sellers to advertise directly on Google. That could eventually undercut eBay's online auction and retail marketplace if sellers find they can attract buyers directly through Google ads, without having to list offerings on eBay.
