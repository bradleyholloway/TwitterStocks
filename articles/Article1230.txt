 Computer Vaccines or Snake Oil?   By By Michael Selz, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 1989  For Winn Schwartau, these are frenetic days. He has granted interviews almost daily for the past month. This past Wednesday, he appeared on the "CBS Evening News." "I haven't seen a media event of this magnitude in my lifetime," Mr. Schwartau says.  Data-destroying computer viruses, like the so-called Friday the 13th or Columbus Day virus that may start infesting computers today, are spreading. Mr. Schwartau and a handful of other entrepreneurs claim to have the cure: software that prevents viruses from infecting a computer system and detects, identifies and removes viruses already there.  As the computer virus threat has grown, 50 companies, including his, have emerged to pitch anti-virus products to anxious computer users, says Robert Campbell, president of Advanced Information Management Inc., a Woodbridge, Va., computer-security consulting firm. Following the publicity about the so-called Friday the 13th virus, Mr. Campbell adds, "we can expect a dozen or two more."
