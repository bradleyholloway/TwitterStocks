 Takeoffs & Landings [1]  By By Lisa Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1997  After millions of years, eclipses are cool, and high-end tour operators are cashing in. Geographic Expeditions, a San Francisco-based outfit, is offering its first eclipse tour. The highlight: the total solar eclipse on March 9, which is best viewed from Mongolia. Never mind that travelers will be sleeping in yurts (tents made of animal skins), or that the temperatures in Mongolia in March can fall to 25 degrees below zero. The tour is totally sold out. "We've been opportunistic" about eclipses, admits Kent Madin, vice president of Boojum Expeditions, based in Bozeman, Mont. Boojum's Mongolia eclipse tour also is sold out.  In 1996, the industry spent $3.5 billion in maintenance, about 15% more than it did the previous year. A number of things explain the surge, including increased vigilance since last year's ValuJet and TWA crashes. But other explanations are less reassuring. In the early 1990s, when airlines had too many planes in their fleets, they grounded older planes and sometimes even used them for parts. Now that airlines aren't buying so many new planes as they did a decade ago, they are "bringing the older planes back," says Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. They are "increasingly flying the more maintenance-intensive planes."
