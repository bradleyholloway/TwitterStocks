 Currency Dare: Central Banks Gamble In Propping the Dollar Without Policy Steps --- They Sense a Pause in Its Fall And Bet the U.S. Deficit In Trade Will Narrow --- At Risk: Their Credibility   By By Walter S. Mossberg and Charles W. Stevens, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1988  So far, anyone betting on further declines in the dollar has been hurt. Since hitting record lows of 120.25 yen and 1.5630 West German marks in early Far East trading Monday, the U.S. currency has bounced back sharply. Yesterday in late New York trading, the dollar stood at 129.50 yen and 1.6470 marks, both up more than 1% from the day before.  The strategy was agreed upon secretly by officials of the Group of Seven countries in late November and early December but not announced until an unusual communique was issued on the night of Dec. 22. The communique offered none of the fiscal or monetary steps -- higher U.S. interest rates, additional cuts in the U.S. budget deficit or new measures to stimulate European economies -- that many economists say should push up the dollar. Nevertheless, the G-7 declared that "a further decline of the dollar . . . could be counterproductive" and hinted that the governments would intervene in markets to buy dollars to support that view.  The central banks began buying billions of dollars on the currency markets to prop up the greenback. At first, they seemed to be failing as the dollar kept sliding. But after hitting record lows early Monday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency has surged, driven by an aggressive and unusually visible central-bank campaign. The Federal Reserve has even discovered the influence of television. One currency trader at a major bank says he was "staggered" when a Fed official encouraged him to spell out in a TV interview the central bank's recent trading activity.
