 Johnson & Johnson Plan to Buy Unit Of Playtex Ended   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1988  The planned $726 million sale of Playtex Family Products Inc. to Johnson & Johnson has ended, the companies said.  The transaction would have made Johnson & Johnson a major player in the tampon business. Playtex Family, a unit of closely held Playtex Holdings Inc., Stamford, Conn., makes disposable gloves and Tek toothbrushes and commands about 30% of the U.S. tampon market. Johnson & Johnson has about a 9.5% share of that market, and its O.B. brand has met with some U.S. consumer resistance because it doesn't have an applicator.
