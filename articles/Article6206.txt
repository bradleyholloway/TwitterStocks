 Career Journal: The Jungle   By By Kemba J. Dunham, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2003  Some who have been on the job market have found that managers can be unusually, even painfully, blunt. Frank Dadino, a 43-year-old accounting clerk from Riverside, N.J., has been out of work since May 2001. After he had one interview with a payroll company and was granted a second, Mr. Dadino was told he was "too aggressive" in setting up that meeting. (He had to call five times to reach the hiring manager who was scheduling the second round, he says.)  After a phone interview at another company, Mr. Dadino was told by a hiring manager he had too many jobs on his resume, dismissing him as a "job hopper." In both cases, he believes the feedback was rude and unnecessary. "I guess there's got to be an excuse, but those excuses were so petty," he says.  Often, of course, hiring managers won't even bother giving candidates who weren't hired postinterview feedback. But many career coaches encourage job seekers to seek out this information and follow up, perhaps two weeks after the interview has taken place. Some employers won't offer any specific reason for why someone wasn't hired because of possible legal ramifications.
