 Miami Vise: The Herald Is Wooing Cuban Readers, But It Risks Loss of Anglos --- Knight-Ridder Paper Pushes Latin Hiring and News But Faces Uphill Battle --- Strong Coffee and Sympathy   By By Roger Lowenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1987  Secure in glass cages, as their offices are called, the editors had lost touch not only with the election but also with the city itself. With Miami becoming more and more Latin, the newspaper that lorded over it was becoming increasingly remote. The numbers told the story: In 1960, 79% of the households in Dade County got the Herald. By 1985, the figure had dropped to 40%. "We have, against our best intentions, created a Fort Herald," John Schueler, vice president of circulation, wrote in a memo to publisher Richard Capen last year.  What's more, Dade's Latins have created a largely self-sufficient economy. There are 30 Latin-owned banks, 1,500 Latin lawyers and eight Spanish radio stations. And although the younger generation speaks English, fresh waves of immigrants have replenished the pool of Spanish speakers. Thus, 28 years after the Cuban Revolution, nearly half the Latins in Dade rely mainly on Spanish, according to Herald research. And, according to a study by Strategy Research Corp., a consultant in Miami, the use of Spanish at home and at work is greater now than in 1975 and in 1980.  The open sore between the Herald and Miami's Latins involves politics. In editorials and news stories, the paper takes a middle-of-the-road approach to international affairs. But Miami's Cubans and Nicaraguans, who are aggressively anti-Communist, accuse the paper of being insensitive to their ideas. Some Latin radio commentators refer to the Herald as "Miami Pravda." Mr. Capen, the publisher, calls the charges "really unfair."
