 Justices Back Restriction on Coal Firms; Ruling Will Bolster State Land-Use Laws   By By Stephen Wermiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1987  The Supreme Court, in a ruling that will bolster the power of states to regulate land use, upheld a Pennsylvania law requiring coal companies to leave enough coal in the ground to avoid damaging buildings on the surface.  But the high court stopped short of adopting the suggestion by 26 states and by state, city and county groups in friend-of-the-court briefs that land-use regulations can never constitute a taking of property. These groups argued that because the aim of such regulation is to control a public hazard or nuisance, it can never be challenged as an unconstitutional taking of property.  The ruling involved a 21-year-old Pennsylvania law that was challenged by a coal-mine operators group, the Keystone Bituminous Coal Association, and by USX Corp. and Consolidation Coal Corp., a unit of Du Pont Co.
