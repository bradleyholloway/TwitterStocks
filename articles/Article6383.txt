 Moving the Market: SEC Moves Ahead to Strengthen Governance of U.S. Stock Markets   By Hughes, Siobhan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2004  The exchanges "are not immune from governance missteps," said SEC Chairman William Donaldson, who once ran the NYSE. "After a period of intense focus on public-company governance, we would be remiss if we did not seek to apply the lessons learned."  The SEC also raised the possibility of even broader changes by voting 5-0 to publish a "concept release" seeking comment on "self- regulatory organization" governance. Among the options the SEC plans to float: whether to create a single agency to replace the multiple self-regulators at each of the U.S. stock exchanges.
