 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Fusing the Impossible   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1989  Rutherford was a perfect man for the time, a hard-working, hardheaded scientist who was impatient with mathematical abstraction and complicated equipment. He declaimed that he liked to discover facts the reliable way, through experiments, without a lot of theoretical pettifogging. The experiments themselves should be quick, simple and performed on equipment scavenged from the basement of the laboratory. . . . The object was to find good, solid facts -- did X happen or not? -- to find them first, and to let other people clean up decimal places. He said, "There is always someone, somewhere, without ideas of his own, who will measure that accurately."  The world does not yet know conclusively whether Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann will enter science's pantheon with Ernest Rutherford, one of the giants of 20th-century physics. The world, however, is getting a rare look at the clash between science and the politics of science -- a clash between human curiosity's innate optimism and the compulsive naysaying of the current national mood.  Pons and Fleischmann, of course, are chemists who with a simple experiment appear to have solved one of the great riddles of human knowledge -- how to create energy through the fusion of two atoms. The fusing of two heavy hydrogen atoms was done, as Mr. Pons has said, "with equipment that could be found in any freshman chemistry lab." This announcement was not met with hosannas, but with a fair measure of boos and catcalls. Writer Robert Bazell was not much worse than most in the current New Republic, sniffing that the two had "defied the conventions that are supposed to ensure the reliability of scientific information."
