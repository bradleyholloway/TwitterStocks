 FDA Looks at Sprouts for Food-Borne Illness   By Sara Schaefer Munoz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  Ensuring sprout safety has proved elusive for food regulators and the industry itself. That's because sprouts, compared with other foods, pose some particularly thorny issues. Eggs and beef, for instance, can be properly refrigerated and cooked to avoid many safety concerns. Melons and most other produce can be thoroughly washed. But there's no surefire method of making sprouts germ-free once the seed is contaminated. Seeds can become contaminated during production and storage if they are exposed to animals or unclean conditions. Bacteria can grow inside the sprout so they can't be washed off.  Sprout growers and researchers say they have tried a variety of methods to reduce the bacterial risk at the source: sprout seeds. They have attempted to irradiate seeds, but the resulting sprout looks withered and unappetizing. Other methods include soaking seeds in hot water, using ultrasound to "shake" the bacteria off seeds and chlorination. So far, none are fully reliable, though outbreaks have fallen substantially since the industry implemented voluntary guidelines in 1999.  Mr. [Bob Sanderson] hopes that the FDA will define a standard for sprouts and leave it up and the sprouting industry to use its own methods to meet the standard. What he doesn't want to see are mandated warning labels on packages, a measure proposed by some consumer groups. "That's just like an admission of failure," he says.
