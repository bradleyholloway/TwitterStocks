 Sarkozy Elected French President By Solid Margin; Conservative Receives Mandate for Tough Steps To Revitalize Economy   By David Gauthier-Villars and Marc Champion, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2007  The new leader's social and economic prescription for France could stir up trouble, particularly among unions and others who benefit the most from France's longstanding system of social entitlements and among the country's restive immigrants, who see Mr. [Sarkozy] as part of their problems. As France's interior minister, Mr. Sarkozy introduced stricter immigration laws that led to the deportation of tens of thousands of immigrants.  "Mr. Sarkozy can use political credit . . . to win over labor unions and push through some changes," said Nicolas Sobczak, an economist with Goldman Sachs in Paris. "But there is a risk of another [Jacques] Chirac, someone who pulls back in the face of social resistance or makes so many concessions that initial good ideas are watered down," Mr. Sobczak added, referring to France's outgoing president.  Mr. Sarkozy's quest for France's highest office started more than 30 years ago. Conservative lawmaker Patrick Balkany says Mr. Sarkozy divulged his presidential ambitions in 1974, as the two men drove through Paris in a Peugeot 604 sedan. Mr. Sarkozy was a 19-year-old law student at the time, and would hold his first political rally the following year. In 1983, he became mayor of a Paris suburb, and two decades later took over the center-right RPR party, now called UMP.
