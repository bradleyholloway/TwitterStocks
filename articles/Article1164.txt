 Why Albanians Love America   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2007  Mr. [Bush] rose to the occasion in neighboring Albania, telling a press briefing in the capital Tirana that U.S. support for Kosovo's independence is "solid, firm." Without closing the door on diplomatic efforts, Mr. Bush said that, "At some point in time, sooner rather than later, you've got to say enough is enough, Kosovo is independent." The President also recognized the risk that delays could destabilize Kosovo itself. "There just cannot be continued drift, because I'm worried about expectations not being met in Kosovo."
