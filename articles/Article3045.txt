 Drive Buys / Mercedes-Benz CLK500 --- A Little Deutsche Coupe, Upsized   By By Jonathan Welsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  On the road, the CLK felt like other Mercedes models -- smooth, solid and a bit squishy. Back to that size issue: Some auto makers boast about making cars bigger and lighter at the same time. Not so for the CLK, which is about 200 pounds heavier than its predecessor. As a result, it feels sluggish -- a surprise considering its 300-horsepower engine and stiffer suspension. Acceleration to 60 miles per hour takes about six seconds, but the sense of speed is lost in the insulated interior. In bends it seems to lean more and feels less sure-footed than some other sports sedans, nearly all of which cost less.  Other small disappointments lurked in the details. While it takes only a short ride to know the CLK is built with higher-quality materials than most cars on the road, inspection reveals some downmarket features. In the glove box, a compact-disc changer takes up space and seems like an afterthought. The carpeting in the trunk feels cheap, and hidden beneath is a small "doughnut" spare tire, instead of the full-size spares that used to be points of pride in luxury cars. (Mercedes says many customers rarely touch the tires because they call on its roadside-assistance service to fix flats.)
