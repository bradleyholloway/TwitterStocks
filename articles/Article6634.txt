 Leading the News: Bush Seals a Trade Deal With Chile --- Pact Sets New Standards On Intellectual Property And Monetary Controls   By By Neil King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2002  The two countries had $8.8 billion of two-way trade in goods and services last year, which both nations expect will jump in coming years. Upon approval by Chilean lawmakers and the U.S. Senate, the pact will eliminate tariffs on more than 85% of all goods shipped between the two, with the rest being phased out over 12 years. The U.S. sends mainly computers, heavy machinery and cars to Chile, whose exports to the U.S. include copper, paper products, fish, fruits and wine.  U.S. trade officials said the Chile deal will be sent to Congress by March and is expected to win easy approval. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick hailed the pact as "state of the art" because it not only lowers tariffs but protects intellectual property and allows for enforcement of labor and environmental standards. U.S. companies have dogged the Chile talks out of concern for how it might affect future trade arrangements with nations such as Brazil and Australia.  The agreement will create duty-free trade in three-quarters of all farm goods by 2007, while all tariffs will be eliminated over 12 years. Tariffs on both countries' wines first will be equalized at the lower U.S. levels, and then phased out altogether. Chile also agreed the U.S. could put in place special surge controls if imports of individual farm products shoot up in a given year.
