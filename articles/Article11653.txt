 Letters to the Editor: The Cold War According to Camelot   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1992  I would like to thank Arthur Schlesinger Jr. for the politically correct update on "Who Really Won the Cold War" (editorial page, Sept. 14). It is refreshing to learn that the liberal Democrats under Harry Truman were really responsible for the containment of the "evils of the Communist Russian empire." For nearly 50 years I've labored under the delusion that it was Franklin D. Roosevelt and his liberal Democratic advisers who gave Joseph Stalin Manchuria, Eastern Europe and most of the Balkans at Yalta in March 1945. The Allies won World War II militarily, but Joe Stalin beat Roosevelt and his liberal Democrats politically. Thus the onset of the Cold War.  I also labored under the delusion that it was Truman's Secretary of State Dean Acheson who told the world in January 1950 that Korea was out of our sphere of interest. Kim Il Sung, North Korea's Communist dictator, promptly invaded the now unprotected South Korea. Some 34,000 American lives paid for that Democrat's "containment policy."
