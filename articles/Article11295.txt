 Fur Industry Braces for a Rough Season --- Activism Grows But Sellers Hold Some Optimism   By By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1989  On Halloween night, 100 animal-rights activists gathered in front of the South Korean Embassy in Washington to rail against the Jindo fur chain, a Korean-owned furrier that has seen impressive U.S. growth. The clapping and chanting protesters even held a service in memory of the animals Jindo has killed to make its fur coats.  "You can bet your last dollar this is going to be a tough year for fur retailers," says Chantal Hoffman, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, an animal-rights group.  PETA, which is one of the most aggressive animal-rights groups, says it will be running an anti-fur ad in the fashion publication Details next month with the headline "What disgraces a legend most?" The ad features a beautiful woman draped in a fur, and is an obvious reference to the 20-year campaign "What becomes a legend most?" created by Peter Rogers Associates for an organization of mink breeders. PETA has also produced anti-fur TV commercials starring actor River Phoenix and singer Belinda Carlisle, which various stations are broadcasting as a public-service announcement.
