 Tax Report: IRS Offers Shelter Investors a Deal   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2004  This device, an offshoot of an earlier one called BOSS -- which stands for "bond and option sales strategy" -- was "aggressively marketed" in the late 1990s and 2000 to many wealthy people and businesses, the IRS said. The shelters were developed and sold by "an interlocking network of commercial interests, including leading law firms, accounting firms and investment banks," IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson said. Losses generated by the shelters typically could be used to offset large gains from the sale of a business or other assets.  The IRS yesterday warned that it "continues to become aware of many" of these transactions through investor lists obtained in IRS investigations of shelter promoters, as well as through enforcement actions by the Justice Department. The IRS also said it has learned of "at least 500 previously undisclosed transactions in the last 90 days alone."  Taxpayers won't have to pay a penalty if they had voluntarily disclosed their involvement in this shelter under an IRS announcement in 2002. If someone didn't step forward under that previous announcement, the penalty could be heavy. The mandatory penalty will be 10% for those whose "Son of BOSS" investment reflects "the first and only abusive tax-shelter investment." But it will be 20% for those who participated in other transactions listed by the IRS as abusive.
