 K2 Falls on Profit Warning as Small Stocks Post Sharper Declines Than Broad Market, Blue Chips   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1998  The overall Nasdaq market posted the steepest declines of the major stock-market indexes. The losses came after the Russell 2000 small-cap index and the Nasdaq Composite Index posted back-to-back gains, the first time they had done so since Sept. 23.  New York Stock Exchange-traded K2 fell 4 5/16, or 30%, to 9 7/8. The company said its third-quarter earnings will fall "materially below" analysts' estimates, largely because of eroded margins in otherwise strong skate sales, late delivery by suppliers of sourced snowboard products and a greater-than-expected loss in the bike group. K2's bike group had a "significant negative impact" on third-quarter results, and the company expects the group to continue to hurt results for the rest of the year. Merrill Lynch and A.G. Edwards lowered their ratings on K2.  American depositary receipts of CBT Group Publishing plummeted 2 11/16, or 26%, to 7 9/16 after the interactive education-software company posted third-quarter earnings that were below its year-earlier profit and which fell short of analysts' projections. The company said it would take "several quarters" to restore growth and profitability.
