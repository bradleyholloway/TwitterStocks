 Don't distort Clinton education reform   By Riley, Richard W, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1993  Richard W. Riley responds to Bruno Manno's Jun 22, 1993 editorial page commentary, "Deliver Us From Clinton's Schools Bill," by correcting what he sees as the author's deliberate distortions of President Clinton's education reform proposal, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Riley focuses on the proposal's strong points, notably its bipartisan origins.
