 A Day of Terror: In New York's Commuter Suburbs, It Is a Day of Worrying and Waiting   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Blumenstein, Tim Layer and Robert McGough, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  "I turned on the news," Ms. [Sylvia Achee] said, and when she saw the collapse, "my heart fell." Another wave of calls poured into her house from people asking whether he had called again, and she almost sank in relief when he did, about an hour later. Mr. Achee had tried to help some of the injured and took a ferry across the river with a badly burned fire fighter. Ms. Achee said her husband was bruised, but otherwise all right. He was still not home as of 5 p.m.  Selma Zupnik sat waiting at the Maplewood train station last night for her daughter, [Susan Arnold, R.N.], who had escaped from the 64th floor of the second tower. "The last message I got was to bring clothes," Ms. Zupnik said. She said her daughter, an analyst for the Port Authority, is scared and chilled from the showers she had to walk through when she arrived from the ferry in Hoboken. Fire officials had all the victims shower because they feared they were covered with asbestos.  Vik DeLuca, Maplewood's mayor, said that at least a few victims had been taken to area hospitals after they stumbled off of commuter trains. He feared that Maplewood and New Jersey communities would be hit hard. "There are between 2,500 and 3,000 people who go to New York every day from Maplewood, and many of them work downtown," Mr. DeLuca said. "This is going to be a very long night."
