 Autos: Beetlemania Revs Up VW's Growth Hopes   By By Joseph B. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1998  Pumped up by the advance adulation for the comeback car, which goes on sale in the U.S. in March, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech said yesterday he wants to see VW's world-wide sales grow by 5% to 15% a year from the 4.27 million vehicles sold in 1997. Dr. Piech's goal is to hit five million vehicles in annual sales well before his scheduled retirement in five years.  The hoopla is a far cry from the gloom that has surrounded Germany's No. 1 car maker. Five years ago, VW was barely surviving in the U.S. market. Since then, Dr. Piech has put the company through a wrenching restructuring, including putting many of the company's German workers on four-day weeks. Under former purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW put the squeeze on suppliers to slash costs.  Now, the Beetle buzz has Dr. Piech triumphantly barnstorming the U.S., heading to Orlando, Fla., for a meeting with VW dealers. At those meetings VW officials will be pleading for restraint in cashing in on the expected rush of buyers for the new Beetle.
