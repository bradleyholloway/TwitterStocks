 FDA Rethinks Advisory Panel Process   By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2006  There are 16 panels housed under the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Other FDA centers such as the device center also have advisory panels, but the current effort is expected to initially involve the drug panels. Most panels have roughly a dozen members and include doctors who treat patients, academic researchers and experts from other government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. There is also a nonvoting industry representative as well as a nonvoting patient representative. The FDA can also add people on a one-time basis for certain meetings. Panel members serve for about two years.  Debbie Henderson, the director of the FDA's drug center's office of executive programs, which oversees the advisory panels and FDA staff, said over time she's heard from her own staff and even some drug companies that certain panels run better than others. The idea is to take the best practices of each panel and see if they can be applied to all of them. Some drug companies have also complained about inconsistencies in how each panel operates.
