 Ingersoll-Rand Agrees to Buy Hussmann for About $1.56 Billion   By By Karen Jacobs and Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which is expected to be announced today. Under terms of the deal, Ingersoll-Rand, a Woodcliff Lake, N.J., maker of air compressors and refrigeration products, would pay $29 a share for Hussmann's about 50.6 million shares, more than double Hussmann's 4 p.m. close of $13.375, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Ingersoll-Rand shares rose 62.5 cents to $45.875 on the Big Board. The purchase price also includes the redemption of all Hussmann stock options outstanding, people familiar with the deal said.  The purchase is expected to close in June, and would immediately add to Ingersoll-Rand's earnings. Those familiar with the accord note that Hussmann is expected to boost Ingersoll's 2001 profit by 15 cents to 20 cents a share. Ingersoll is assuming about $275 million of Hussmann debt. Hussmann had sales of $1.3 billion last year and net income of $66.6 million, or $1.28 a diluted share. Ingersoll-Rand's net for 1999 was $591.1 million, or $3.57 a share, on sales of $7.7 billion.
