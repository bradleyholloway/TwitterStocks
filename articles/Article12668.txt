 By the Numbers: The Boys of Autumn   By By Allen Barra, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2001  The Mets -- the expansion result of the Dodgers' move west -- also had numerous players with Hall of Fame potential (Messrs. [Darryl Strawberry] and [Dwight Gooden], Ron Darling, Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, Lenny Dykstra) or players that looked as if they would be. They also had a fine, proven manager in Davey Johnson to guide them. But they won relatively young, then began, season by season, to fall apart. By 1991, the dream was over.  Were the '86 Mets a flash in the pan, a collection of cocky, talented prospects whose potential was overrated? The record suggests not. As the chart indicates, if Mr. Strawberry wasn't quite Willie or Mickey or even the Duke, he was certainly, after about 800 or so games, in their class. And Mr. Strawberry wasn't the best in the group of Mets.  In 1986, everyone was arguing about who was the better flame-throwing right-hander: Boston's sensational 22-year-old Roger Clemens (then 24-4, with a 2.48 earned-run average) or the Mets' 20-year-old Mr. Gooden (then 17-6 with a 2.84 ERA, and 24-4 the season before with a 1.53 ERA). But drugs, injuries and immaturity took their toll. As Mr. Gooden told me before his 1996 World Series run, "I wasn't ready for that kind of attention at 19; no teenager is. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm ready for it now."
