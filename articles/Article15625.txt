 Waste Management Inc.'s Interim CEO Names Newcomers to Key Board Posts   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1997  Waste Management Inc.'s interim chief executive officer, Robert S. Miller, moving quickly to restore investor confidence, named newcomers to lead key committees of the trash hauler's much-criticized board.  Mr. Miller, 55 years old, was elected to Waste Management's board last May after some big institutional shareholders demanded that Mr. (Dean L.) Buntrock name some well-regarded and independent executives to the board. He became Waste Management's interim chairman and chief executive last week after Ronald T. LeMay unexpectedly quit those posts after only about three months on the job to return to his former job as Sprint Corp.'s No. 2 executive.  Mr. Miller yesterday named two new directors, Roderick M. Hills and John C. Pope, who both serve on the Federal Mogul board with him. Mr. Miller said in an interview that he told Waste Management's board, "If they were willing to come, we should just grab the opportunity, and we did."
