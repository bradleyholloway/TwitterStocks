 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1992  Grumman gives a computer employee, badly injured in a softball game, a home computer with enlarged print. It provides a cart, cafeteria access and automatic doors for a Georgia worker who has difficulty walking but must crisscross a large facility. Grumman is trimming its work force, but plans to remove barriers for disabled employees at its Long Island sites, spurred by a new disability law.  McGraw-Hill has expanded contacts with Just One Break (JOB), a New York group that finds jobs for disabled applicants. At Rockwell International's Rocketdyne division, six disabled workers got job or hours changes. At a recent New York JOB rally, 110 disabled applicants met with 30 employers; now, placements are rising, says Mikki Lam, JOB executive director.  So ruled a federal appeals court, in a case involving a Health and Human Services Department computer programmer with multiple sclerosis. The worker tried to continue working at home, citing fatigue and weakness attacks. HHS offered to change her hours and give her rest periods, among other moves. But her division head said her job required "exactness," "short deadlines" and "face-to-face contact with report requesters," so she couldn't work at home.
