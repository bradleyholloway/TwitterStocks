 Microsoft Hones Software Aimed At Smaller Firms; Strategy Steps Up Battle With Rivals SAP, Intuit By Fusing Core Products   By Guth, Robert A, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2005  The new strategy includes an accounting package for small businesses and a project code-named "Centro" to market a package of server software for medium-size businesses next year. The strategy attempts to make it easier to install and run Microsoft's products in businesses that often have less software expertise and limited budgets, Microsoft executives said.  Central to Microsoft's new strategy is reworking Microsoft "business software" such as Great Plains and Navision to better integrate with historically separate applications such as its Office software. The business software will include predetermined "dashboards" built around 50 specific job functions or "roles" that often are found in smaller businesses. The dashboard for an operations manager, for instance, would combine Excel and other applications to make it easier to handle accounts payable or order processing.
