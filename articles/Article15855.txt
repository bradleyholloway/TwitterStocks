 Microsoft to Contribute $25 Million For Research on Education with MIT   By By Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1999  The five-year partnership, to be announced today, is the largest to date by the software company's research organization. Microsoft estimated it will put $25 million into the venture, and will assign researchers to work with MIT students and faculty on new teaching methods and tools. Projects are expected to include software for long-distance learning and Internetbased virtual museums.  Microsoft lawyers initially asked for a right to prepublication review of research created through the partnership. MIT wouldn't go along with that request, university officials said. The agreement gives Microsoft a nonexclusive license to any new technology; it can seek an exclusive license, but the Cambridge, Mass., institute has the right to refuse such a request. MIT also sought the right for staff members to decline to work with Microsoft, and asked that students who work on Microsoft-funded projects not be barred from working for competitors in the future.
