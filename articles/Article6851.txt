 Global Interbank Market to Change; Two Big Interdealer Brokers To Merge, Pending a Vote; Challenger to Leader ICAP?   By MacKenzie, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2004  Steve McDermott, chief operating officer for North America at ICAP in Jersey City, N.J., said the firm is taking the merger "very seriously -- they will be our No. 1 competitor." But, he said, he questions whether the new entity can retain the market share of the combined firms when Collins Stewart is intent on extracting annualized pretax savings in fixed broker and support costs of about GBP 60 million ($108 million) from the merger. "It's difficult to maintain market share when you are cutting costs," he said.  "A merger has to be completed quickly, or the assets will walk," said Ron Purpora, CEO at Garban Securities in Jersey City. He was involved in the process of rationalizing desks when ICAP and Garban merged in 1999. "You can't choose one desk or the other, you really need to look at the entire talent pool available and make tough decisions that creates a new desk with the best possible client relationships," he added.  Moody's Investors Service cut Allied Waste Industries Inc.'s senior implied rating two notches to single-B2 from Ba3 and its senior unsecured-issuer rating to a highly speculative Caa2 from single-B3. Moody's said the downgrade primarily reflects the "recent material decline in the company's financial and operational performance because of reduced volumes and increased cash requirements to service its aging fleet." A spokesman for Allied Waste didn't return a call requesting comment.
