 In Firestone Tire Study, an Expert Finds Vehicle Weight Was Big Factor in Failure   By By Clare Ansberry, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2001  Firestone spokeswoman Christine Karbowiak said the company's own four-month study, completed in December, found that vehicle-load levels, coupled with tire pressure initially specified for the Ford Explorer, "played a role" in the tire failures. Firestone has maintained the 26 pounds a square inch initially recommended by Ford didn't provide enough of a safety margin. Ford has since changed its recommended tire pressure to a range of 26 pounds to 30 pounds a square inch. Dr. Govindjee likewise cited low inflation as a contributing factor, saying it reduces the ability of the tire to resist cracking because it causes heat to build up within the tire. Heat causes the materials in the tire to degrade.  One point in Dr. Govindjee's study was quickly seized upon by consumer groups pushing for a wider recall of Firestone tires. Dr. Govindjee noted that warranty-adjustment data on all Firestone consumer tires showed similar rates of complaints between the recalled Wilderness AT tires produced at Decatur and nonrecalled Wilderness tires made at the company's plants in Wilson, N.C., and Joliette in Quebec. "This means that the tires were equally problematic regardless of the plant in which they were manufactured, and that all Wilderness AT tires could crack and separate," said Joan Claybrook, a former official with the NHTSA who heads Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer advocates' group.  Dr. Govindjee issued what he called a "caveat" regarding the higher rate of failures on the ATX tires. "ATX tires have been in production for a longer period than [Wilderness] AT tires. Thus age could be playing a role in some of the observed differences." Firestone officials said the difference reflects improvements made in the AT tires, which replaced the ATX tires in 1996.
