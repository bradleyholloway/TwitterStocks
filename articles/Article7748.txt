 Chicago Board of Trade Establishing Trading Tie With Tokyo Stock Exchange   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1988  The Chicago Board of Trade strengthened its position in the global trading race by becoming the first U.S. exchange to forge trading ties with the huge Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The CBOT said that it reached an "understanding" with the Tokyo exchange for the U.S. futures mart to trade futures on a widely followed Japanese stock-index, as well as on Japanese government bonds, possibly as early as year end.  Japanese government bond futures already trade on the Tokyo exchange. The Tokyo exchange is expected to begin trading the Japanese index, called TOPIX, which covers the more than 1,700 largest stocks traded on the Tokyo exchange's so-called first tier, by mid-summer.
