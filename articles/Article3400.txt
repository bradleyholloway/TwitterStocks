 IPO Outlook: Shipping Firms Make Waves In IPO Market; Offerings by Horizon Lines, Others Are Part of a Trend Toward Dry-Goods Carriers   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2005  The marine-transportation industry hasn't traditionally been the stuff that IPO dreams are made of. From 1990 to 1993, the industry averaged just one IPO a year, according to data from Thomson Financial. But in the past two weeks, three carriers -- Diana Shipping Inc., Horizon Lines Inc. and TBS International Ltd. -- have filed to go public following the successful IPO of DryShips Inc. in February. Last year, five marine-transport companies came public.  "These are the kind of companies you don't see hit the market too often," says Tom Taulli, co-founder of Currentofferings.com, which tracks IPOs. "But the IPO market is not just about tech anymore. It's become much broader."
