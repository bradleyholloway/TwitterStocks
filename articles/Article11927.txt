 Library Search Hints Of Electrifying News From Big Tobacco --- Philip Morris, Among Others, Is Working on a Cigarette That Runs on Batteries   By By Suein L. Hwang, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1995  Though top secret, the electric cigarette design came to light in a recent search of patents in the most public of places -- the New York City public library -- which, like many libraries around the country, keeps U.S. Patent filings on microfilm. The device's existence is testimony to the ever-escalating war on secondhand smoke -- a war that is banishing smoking from an increasing number of public places.  The Philip Morris patent, in fact, is but one of dozens of patents on file at the library, by tobacco and other companies and by entrepreneurs, seeking the holy grail of Big Tobacco: a smokeless cigarette. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. has patented its own version of an electric cigarette -- it attaches by a flexible cord to a "power pack" that rests suavely in the smoker's shirt pocket. And a Connecticut surgeon, with no connections to tobacco companies, has filed a design for a cigarette that sends nicotine directly into a smoker's lips using electrical impulses.  Part of the quest for a smokeless cigarette is widely known. After decades and hundreds of millions of dollars of research, American tobacco companies have thus far produced one dud and one prospect. The first was Premier, a $300 million mistake tested and quickly abandoned by RJR six years ago. The latest is Eclipse, unveiled by RJR in November. Like Premier, Eclipse has a special charcoal tip that, when lit, heats, instead of burns, the cigarette's innards. But Eclipse has mechanical changes that the company hopes will overcome the taste problems that doomed Premier.
