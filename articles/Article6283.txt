 The Economy: U.S. Health-Care Spending Rose 9.3% in 2002   By Sara Schaefer Munoz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 2004  Prescription drug spending jumped 15.3% in 2002, accounting for 16% of the overall health-cost increase. The pace slowed a bit, however, from 2001 when drug costs were up 15.9% and was significantly below the peak pace of 19.7% in 1999. Cynthia Smith, an economist at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and author of an article on drug costs appearing in the same issue of Health Affairs, said the continued sharp increase in drug spending came about because patients are using newer, more costly drugs -- not because of price increases in older medicines.  Researchers also found that the costs for Medicaid, the federal- state health-care program for the poor, were approaching those of Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and disabled. Faced with growing demands and a weak labor market, Medicaid spending soared 11.7% in 2002, to $249 billion while Medicare spending grew 8.4% to $267 billion. Together, the programs accounted for about one- third of total health-care costs.
