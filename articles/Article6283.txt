 Intervention Found to Aid Depression Treatment   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2000  It doesn't take a magic bullet or expensive technology to help depressed patients. Doctors and clinics that make a modest effort to identify these patients and help them get treatment can see dramatic improvements, a new study found.  Patients treated at the 46 participating medical clinics that made such efforts were more likely to recover and remain in the work force after one year than other patients who weren't in the program, according to researchers at Rand, a Santa Monica, Calif., think tank. The study was published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association.  The Rand study showed how doctors in ordinary clinics can identify depressed patients and get help to them. Some simple policy changes to better organize care delivery within a clinic, coupled with modest additional resources to educate patients and staff, can make "a big difference in a real-world setting," Dr. [Kenneth B.] Wells said. Patients' choice of treatment -- medication or psychotherapy -- turned out to be less important than the identification of depression and compliance with whichever treatment program was selected.
