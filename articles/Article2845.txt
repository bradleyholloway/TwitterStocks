 Business World: Back to the Future When Life Insurance Was Fun --- By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  Bluntly put, viatical investors home in on policies with large face values, often $1 million or more, where the holder has suffered a health decline. After all, the investor's goal is to end up on the winning side of the bet every insurer makes with the mortality tables. By selectively keeping in force only the industry's losing policies, investors can't help but screw up the industry's returns.  Mr. [Steve Keller] has a bee in his bonnet about insurer Conseco, whose then-assistant general counsel, Barbara Farrington, drafted a 1998 memo sounding the alarm about viatical fraud. Of Kelco, says Ms. Farrington, now in private practice, "I do know they had policies on their books that were obtained by fraud, individuals who had HIV or full-blown AIDS."  Traditionally, insurers have not bothered to check the health of people who buy policies below a certain value (usually $100,000), figuring it was cheaper to live with a few applicants lying about their condition. But the fraud temptation grows enormously when policies can be flipped for cash. And even fraudulently obtained insurance becomes "uncontestable" after two years under longstanding law.
