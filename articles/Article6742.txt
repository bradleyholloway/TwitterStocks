 Palestinians Decry Weak Leadership   By Chazan, Guy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2003  As a result, Palestinians are becoming increasingly alienated from their own government. In a recent poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center, 54.1% said they "didn't feel" the Palestinian Authority's presence, while more than 60% judged its performance as "bad" or "very bad."  The stalemate prompted growing calls for root-and-branch political reform. "There is a real crisis," says Ziad Abu Amr, a former minister in the cabinet of Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. [Qureia]'s predecessor who resigned in September after only four months in the job. "The frequent changes of government are a sign of chaos, instability and paralysis. The system isn't working and people feel the PA isn't doing its job."  The frustration, however, predates the present standoff. Palestinians felt a surge of optimism in the spring with the creation of the Abbas government and the launch of the U.S.-backed road-map peace plan, which promised a Palestinian state by the year 2005. Mr. Abbas's subsequent failure to win key concessions from Israel, such as an easing of the closures, the mass release of prisoners or an end to Israeli incursions and targeted killings, robbed him of legitimacy in the eyes of many Palestinians.
