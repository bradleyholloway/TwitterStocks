 Arbitron Tests Meters to Count Radio Audience   By By Jennifer Ordonez, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2001  For more than 35 years, Arbitron has measured radio audiences by getting a small sample of consumers to document their listening habits in diaries, a system that even Arbitron now concedes is antiquated in large markets. Knowing it needs to modernize -- and eager to maintain its grip on the ratings business -- Arbitron is in the testing stage of a new measurement system that could result in a $100 million overhaul of its ratings operation.  Arbitron will finish the initial phase of its first U.S. test of the new technology this fall and expects to release preliminary results of the 300-person trial to programmers later this summer. But a significant obstacle looms in the way of a broader rollout: reluctance by Clear Channel Communications Inc., the nation's most powerful radio company, with more than 1,200 stations, to continue using even Arbitron's current rating service. In April, on the day of Arbitron's initial public offering, Clear Channel announced that it didn't intend to renew its contracts with Arbitron in some major markets. That could cost Arbitron a $28 million chunk of its annual revenue and potentially hamper the people meter's further development.  Analysts say both companies probably have too much at stake to let that happen. Arbitron, which says it doesn't expect to increase profits during its first year as a public company in part because of research costs, needs Clear Channel's cooperation to continue rolling out its new technology. And Clear Channel, which, according to analysts, does $1 billion a year in advertising based on national ratings, would have difficulty negotiating favorable rates without Arbitron ratings. "For everyone," says Keith Fawcett, a media analyst with Merrill Lynch, "this is basically high-risk poker."
