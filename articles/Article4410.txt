 Bookshelf: Drifting Through the Walled City   By By Amity Shlaes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 1988  Poor Berlin. First an Austrian made the town Nazi headquarters and the Allies bombed it into rubble. Then Soviets and East Germans locked nearly half the city behind a wall. Lately, the world's bedraggled relativists have launched a third form of abuse: They've moved into the lost old capital and converted it into a base for peddling their sulky philosophy.  With "Zoo Station: Adventures in East and West Berlin" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 329 pages, $7.95), British journalist Ian Walker gives a useful tour of their nighttime dressed-in-black subculture. And, like most of the nihilists gathering in Berlin these days, Mr. Walker distorts the city by forcing it into third-rate ideology: "Maybe," he muses, "God divided Berlin to demonstrate His proposition that facts have no intrinsic meaning."  The other paternalist economy -- the one east of the wall -- also gets some color from Mr. Walker. Even when it strains, the capital of the most successful socialist engine in the world still lags behind its Western analogues. The tacky Formica kiosks from behind which East Berlin border guards stare down at entering visitors, the tinny board-game feel of East German currency, and the vanilla-white paint on the trams combine to make the visitor feel he's stepped back in time to a hungrier, postwar Germany. "Journeying to the East," notes Mr. Walker, "is like retracing your steps."
