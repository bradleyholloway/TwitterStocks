 Bridgestone's CEO Kaizaki Is Resigning --- New Chief Signaled That He Could Forge Closer Ties to U.S. Unit   By By Phred Dvorak and Michael Williams, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2001  Mr. [Shigeo Watanabe], who worked for several years at a Firestone plant in Tennessee and parachuted into the U.S. last fall to help deal with the tire crisis at its peak, signaled that he could forge closer ties with U.S. operations. Mr. Watanabe said he might name John Lampe, Firestone's new CEO, to the board. If so, Mr. Lampe would be the first foreign director named to the Japanese parent company's board.  The defiant, tough-talking chief executive undermined the company's damage-control efforts in the U.S., Venezuela and other markets. He initially appeared to stonewall the public by declining to disclose information on the recall. Later, by repeatedly asserting there were no problems with the Firestone products, Mr. [Yoichiro Kaizaki] appeared to undercut the more conciliatory remarks of his lieutenants in the U.S., including Mr. Lampe, who were conceding Firestone must share some of the blame for the rollover accidents involving its tires.  Among Mr. Watanabe's chief challenges in coming months is working with Mr. Lampe to try to head off a wider recall of Firestone tires, as well as to limit damage from litigation. At the same time, Mr. Watanabe needs to revive Bridgestone's share price, which has fallen more than 50% since the recall. Bridgestone said last month it would post a special loss of $750 million related to the costs of the recall and lawsuits.
