 Investor's Calendar   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2006  -- Pension Protection: Landmark pension legislation that cleared Congress Thursday seeks to close the $313 billion funding gap in the nation's employer-sponsored pension plans and make it harder for companies to make pension promises they can't keep. Another bill, which would have cut estate taxes and raised the minimum wage by $2.10 an hour, fell a handful of votes short of needed support.  -- Toyota Takes 2nd: Japan's Toyota Motor, capitalizing on high gasoline prices, last month outsold Ford Motor to grab the No. 2 position in the U.S. market.  CORRECTION: Last week's Tip of the Week on Roth IRAs failed to mention that some withdrawals of earnings, such as for certain higher- education expenses and large unreimbursed medical expenses, are also penalty-free, although subject to taxation. The situations cited were those in which an earnings withdrawal avoids both tax and penalty. Details are in IRS Publication 590.
