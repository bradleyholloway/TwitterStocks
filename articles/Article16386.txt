 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; An End Run for Open-End Proposal?; Zweig Total Return's Board Proffers Conversion Plan, Then Asks Investors to Nix It   By Shipman, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2004  The board of Zweig Total Return announced Feb. 9 it would submit for a vote the conversion to an open-end structure, but the decision didn't come voluntarily. Instead, the action was required by a vestigial provision in the fund's articles of incorporation under which the board is "generally required" to submit the open-end proposal for a shareholder vote after the fund trades at an average discount from NAV of 10% or more during any fiscal quarter, according to the fund's proxy filing. The provision was triggered after the fund traded at an average discount of more than 10% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to Lipper Inc.  In a Feb. 13 letter to the Zweig Total Return directors and included in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Karpus portfolio manager Cody Bartlett said he was "very disappointed" that the board had voted unanimously to reject the open-end conversion. Mr. Bartlett contended that the board's stance was "the exact opposite action taken by a few closed-end funds recently to remedy their wide discount."  "In my opinion, it is a breach of the board's fiduciary duty to recommend against this proposal," Mr. Bartlett said in his letter to the directors. "I strongly urge each and every shareholder to vote their shares for this proposal and against the Board's recommendation," he added.
