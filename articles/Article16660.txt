 Business World: Who's Running GM?   By Jenkins, Holman W, Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2006  Mr. [Kirk Kerkorian]'s Chrysler foray a decade earlier had two parts: Shake loose the cash that Chrysler management was saving up to see itself through the next downturn; then sell to Daimler to solve the problem of Chrysler's vulnerability in a downturn. Don't underestimate the possibility that Mr. Kerkorian is simply lining up a lifesaver in the event of a sudden auto recession that some see looming. GM likely would not survive a sharp drop in SUV and pickup sales right now.  That's not Rick Wagoner, GM's chief executive, and never has been, no offense meant. After all, jumping off a cliff is a way to shake things up too. Mr. Wagoner's approach is what most competent executives would give you when faced with GM's predicament, measured steps that preserve as much of the status quo as possible while moving the economics of the business back into the black.  Mr. [Carlos Ghosn] is radicalism personified. He ended lifetime employment in Japan. He ripped up the keiretsu system of corporate welfare for Nissan's interlocking network of suppliers and affiliates. He laid out financial targets and vowed to resign if he failed to meet them. His latest iconoclasm was shutting down Nissan's U.S. headquarters near Los Angeles and moving it to Nashville. More than half his staff quit rather than make the move, including several highly valued architects of Nissan's U.S. turnaround. The shift will cut costs; it may improve communication between corporate honchos and local factory managers, as Mr. Ghosn hopes. More to the point, it blew up a status quo that was showing signs of staleness.
