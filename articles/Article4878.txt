 Teamsters Accord Meets Heavy Protest At Locals, Raising Ratification Doubts   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1988  The tentative labor agreement reached last week by the Teamsters union and large trucking firms is meeting a hailstorm of protest from local leaders and the union's rank and file.  "This has never happened before, in the history of the master freight agreement," said Kenneth Paff, national organizing director for the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a Detroit-based dissident Teamsters group that is recommending rejection of the pact. He reported "widespread opposition" from workers and local officers alike, adding, in a reference to local leaders, "the lambs revolted."  Nine locals in the New York and New Jersey area, for example, issued a bulletin to members urging rejection of the contract, which includes wage and other concessions aimed at helping struggling employers. "To suggest to any member in any area to ratify this contract would be treating all Teamsters like second-class citizens," the bulletin said.
