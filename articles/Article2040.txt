 EU Clears Plan Of Sony Governing Electronics Dealers   By By James Pressley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1995  In a decision that could influence other exclusive-distribution agreements, European Union antitrust officials this week gave Sony Corp. approval to run a selective merchandising system for consumer electronics in the EU.  The clearance came after the Japanese company made changes that the officials say will help to keep down prices on the top-line Sony video recorders, television sets and hi-fi equipment covered by the company's Pan-European Dealer Agreement.  Under the modified rules, electronics dealers in Europe only are permitted to buy such equipment from Sony, wholesalers and authorized Sony dealers. Although EU competition rules ban most exclusive-distribution agreements, they permit those deemed to benefit consumers and improve the circulation of goods in the union.
