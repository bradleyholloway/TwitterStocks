 Executives on Trial: On Deck: Veteran of Earlier Enron Trial   By John R. Emshwiller and Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2006  Today's anticipated appearance of Mr. [Kenneth Rice], a former top Enron official and close [Jeffrey Skilling] associate, comes as the trial's first witness, former Enron investor-relations chief Mark Koenig, completed his seventh day of testimony. Mr. [Kenneth Lay]'s lead attorney, Michael Ramsey, continued to challenge Mr. Koenig's claims that Enron had improperly manipulated its reported financial results. Mr. Ramsey also continued to present the defense case that Enron had been a healthy company whose December 2001 collapse resulted from a market "panic."  In last year's testimony, Mr. Rice said that Mr. Skilling told him and others that Enron's traditional energy-trading business had matured and that the company needed to look to new arenas to achieve rapid earnings and stock-price growth. "He did not believe there was any more "E" in earnings," at the company's more established operations, Mr. Rice said. As a result, Mr. Skilling wanted to emphasize newer units, such as EBS.  To impress investors, Mr. Skilling and others "misrepresented the status" of the EBS operation, Mr. Rice testified. "Mr. Skilling suggested that we be very aggressive" in talking up the EBS network. Though Mr. Rice's testimony focused largely on events in 2000, prosecutors are expected to focus more on 2001, when EBS began showing signs of trouble as part of broader problems in the tech sector. Mr. Skilling and others allegedly tried to hide the unit's woes.
