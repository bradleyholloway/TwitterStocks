To the Editor:  Like The Times, the League of Women Voters abhors the annual political maneuvering for the benefit of one party or candidate over another, but unlike The Times, the league is a long-time supporter of a permanent single June primary.  A permanent primary sets a political calendar which is predictable.  June is preferable to September because it is fairer to all participtants -voters, candidates and election boards. As proponents of increased voter participation, we also object to the September date because it requires the gathering of signatures on nominating petitions and the conducting of campaigns during the summer months, when interest is generally at a low point.  We therefore support the State Senate bill which calls for a June primary this year as a first step toward our ultimate goal of a constitutional amendment establishing a permanent June primary.  The Times's statement that there would be three councilmanic elections in three successive years is based on one questionable assumption and one clear error: (1) use of districts based on 1970 figures this year may or may not lead the courts to order a special election next year; (2) regular councilmanic elections are scheduled every four - not two - years. The next regular election would be in 1985, not in 1983. ELIZABETH B. HUBBARD, GLADYS KRASNER, New York, Feb. 6, 1981.
