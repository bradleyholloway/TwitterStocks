 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Soap-Bubble Derby   The Wall Street Journal,  May 22, 1987  Ever notice with how much fascination people watch soap bubbles form? The surface of a soap bubble is uncommonly smooth, and its colors dance and change in the light. But the bubble's surface is thin, its structure is loosely formed, and after a short, bright life, it pops. The bubble of Gary Hart's presidential ambitions popped a fortnight ago, but over this long Memorial Day weekend the soap-bubble derby will surely continue.  Jackson, Dukakis, Simon, Gore, Gephardt, Babbitt, Clinton, Biden, Boren, Celeste, Nunn, Cuomo, Hollings, Glenn. In the latest preference polls Jesse Jackson leads this field of declared and undeclared Democratic party contenders with 17%. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds 11%. Don't Know appears to have the loyalty of 51% of Democratic primary voters.  In fact, the explanation for the Bradley phenomenon holds the beginning of wisdom for the Democrats, but the bad news is that it's a little late in the day to adopt his formula for success. The pros are taking Sen. Bradley seriously because years ago he started taking political policy seriously. Unlike most of the 14 horsemen of the Democrats' current apocalypse, Mr. Bradley didn't decide he should be president and then go window-shopping for a set of ideas appropriate to the office.
