 New Wrinkle in Tax-Exempt Financing Aims to Reduce Interest-Rate Volatility   By By Elaine Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1986  Variable-rate demand issues, in effect, provide long-term funding at short-term rates because they have put features that allow holders, generally institutional investors, to redeem their bonds before maturity. After the securities are redeemed, or put, a re-marketing agent, generally an investment bank, resells the bonds at a new interest rate determined by market conditions.  In the past several months, most major investment banks have introduced products that give issuers' investment bankers greater flexibility in setting puts. The puts in a standard variable-rate demand issue are exercised on a regular daily or weekly schedule. The newer instruments allow put dates -- and thus interest rates -- to be reset at various intervals ranging from one day to several months.  For issuers, the attraction is the ability to tailor puts to market conditions, says Joseph S. Fichera, a vice president in corporate finance at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., which has done $1.5 billion in adjustable-put financings through the use of two products -- called Bond Interest Term Security (Bits) and Adjustable Tender Security (Ats). "The key word is financial flexibility to avoid being trapped," Mr. Fichera says. "It protects against changes in the yield curve."
