 BEA Expects to Miss Forecasts   By Bank, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  BEA has been hit by a wave of high-level departures as its shares have slid from a high of $15.50 last September. The latest to go are Scott Dietzen, chief technology officer, who plans to join a software start-up company, and Rick Jackson, senior vice president of product marketing, who is joining Borland Software Corp., the company said. Last month, Adam Bosworth resigned as BEA's chief architect to join Google Inc.
