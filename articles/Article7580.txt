 GTE Corp. Acts To Boost Value, Thwart Suitors --- Firm Increases Dividend, Plans a 3-for-2 Split And Buyback of Shares   By By Janet Guyon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1986  STAMFORD, Conn. -- GTE Corp. announced a host of measures, including a 13% dividend boost, in an apparent effort to boost value of its stock and ward off investors who are known to be accumulating the company's shares.  After a board meeting yesterday, the big telecommunications company increased its quarterly dividend to 91.5 cents a share from 81 cents. It also authorized a buyback of as many as 10 million of its shares outstanding, announced plans for a 3-for-2 stock split subject to shareholder approval, and called a special shareholders meeting to vote on anti-takeover changes in its corporate charter.  After a trading halt, GTE shares closed yesterday at $62.25, down 12.5 cents from Wednesday's 52-week high, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy at 2,571,400 shares.
