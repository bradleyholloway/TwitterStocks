 Target to Sell Part of Credit-Card Arm   By Zimmerman, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2008  Discount retailer Target Corp. said it agreed to sell an undivided interest representing 47% of its $8.2 billion credit-card portfolio for $3.6 billion, almost twice as much as analysts had expected, to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Target said the deal, which is expected to close by month's end, will provide "substantial liquidity" unrelated to the capital debt markets for use in expanding stores, paying back debt and repurchasing shares.
