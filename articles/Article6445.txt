 Energy Policy Unlikely to Halt a Recession --- President's Plan Focuses On Long-Term Supply; The Worst May Be Over   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 2001  Second, the current situation, unlike its predecessors, is more of a homegrown problem, and many of the benefits of higher prices, rather than flowing to foreign oil producers, are staying in the U.S. They are seen in higher refiners' margins, booming profits at gas producers, and overflowing turbine order books at General Electric Co.'s GE Power Systems unit. "It's kind of an all-in-the-family problem," says James Glassman, senior U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan. Indeed, oil and gas exploration and utility investment are finally responding to higher prices, a small positive for some businesses that offsets the big negative for consumers.  Crude-oil prices, for example, rose from an average of about $14 a barrel in 1998 to $30 last year, according to Goldman, but are forecast to drop to $25 this year. Gasoline prices have risen independently of crude oil because of scarce refining capacity. Even so, notes Thorsten Fischer, energy economist at economic consultants Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., "We had exactly the same discussion of gasoline prices last year" when gasoline averaged $1.56 a gallon during the summer, up 31% from the previous year. Mr. Fischer forecasts an average price of $1.70 to $1.80 a gallon this summer, up only 10% to 15%.  Higher prices are beginning to reverse that. The number of natural-gas drilling rigs in operation has shot up to above 900 from below 400 in early 1999, according to Merrill Lynch. Utilities, meanwhile, plan to add about 25,000 to 30,000 megawatts of generating capacity a year for the next few years (current capacity is 765,000 megawatts), says Merrill utility analyst Steven Fleishman, compared to projected demand growth of 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts.
