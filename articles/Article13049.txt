 Investment Dartboard: Luck Plays a Big Part in Picking Stocks   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2004  Then there's Tyco. Pointing out the difference between a short- term and a long-term pick, the Bermuda conglomerate won the dartboard competition just a few months before it was hit with an accounting scandal and a subsequent plunge in its stock price. With revelations of racy parties and $6,000 shower curtains still to come, Tyco stock notched a respectable 5% gain from March to September 2001, when the readers overall lost 14%. The winning reader believed Tyco at that time was a "well-managed company."  A year later, however, Tyco also became an illustration of investing skill. New Orleans Times-Picayune reader Scott Chehardy picked the company a few months after the scandal broke, betting that the battered shares would bounce back. It was a crafty move: Tyco's stock charged back, becoming our contest's only two-time winner.  -- Send your stock pick via e-mail to the sundaydartboard@wsj.com address by Sunday, June 20. -- No entries by regular mail, please. -- Include your name, address, daytime phone number, e-mail address and the name of the local paper where you read Sunday Journal. -- Financial professionals can't enter, nor can our prior contestants. -- Must be willing to be interviewed.
