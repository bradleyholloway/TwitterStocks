 Enterprise: Pressure Increases to Make the Money and Run --- Pricing Competition Cuts Window of Opportunity For Many Smaller Firms   By By Jeff Bailey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2003  James Cerkleski is investing as if he's running a start-up, but he has one eye on the exit, too, as he braces himself for a big shift in his market. Clover Technologies Group, in Ottawa, Ill., recycles toner cartridges used in office printers. Founded in 1993, the business had sales of $2 million three years ago when Mr. Cerkleski bought half of it and began an expansion drive. Last year, sales hit $50 million, as businesses seek to take advantage of the $25 or more in savings on a typical toner cartridge bought recycled instead of new.  He concedes, "We're probably taking a risk waiting" to sell the company. Pouring $4 million into plant and equipment as margins grow narrower, he knows he'll have to move fast to capture big profits. And recycling could become unprofitable if original-equipment makers drop prices far enough. "That's why we're going to get out," Mr. Cerkleski says, hoping to time his exit to preserve the profits.  says Tom Alderman, an account manager at Atlanta Computer, maintaining profits in the business, with annual sales of about $5 million, grows tougher and tougher as original-equipment manufacturers lower the price for new ATMs while simultaneously adding new features. It's becoming a little like selling used television sets: Why bother when new ones are so cheap? "The cost of ATMs has gradually declined over the years," Mr. Alderman says. And he has watched many competing used-ATM firms leave the business.
