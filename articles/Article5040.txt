 Presidential Power -- Limits of Power: Bush Vows to Protect Authority, Yet Brings Congress Into Decisions --- Some Believe His Conciliation Ultimately Boosts Clout, But Conservatives Protest --- The Politics of Contra Aid   By By Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1989  Yet a few weeks later, Mr. Bush himself announced that he had struck a deal with Congress that some of his own supporters consider one of the biggest giveaways of presidential power in recent history. He gave up trying to persuade Congress to send military aid to the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's government. Moreover, he agreed to stop sending even nonlethal aid after November unless four congressional committees give him approval to continue -- a concession that may return to haunt his administration in coming weeks as it tries to keep aid flowing.  The contrast between Mr. Bush's philosophical concerns and his pragmatic style has produced a schizophrenia in the way his administration handles the fundamental issue of presidential prerogatives. Mr. Bush has declared that he feels strongly about protecting and expanding a president's power, and has challenged Congress on some particular issues. But at heart he is a conciliator, often trying to draw lawmakers into his decisions rather than confronting them over his authority.  On some individual issues, Mr. Bush and his aides have signaled that they will confront Congress to enhance presidential authority. Mr. Bush a few weeks ago vetoed a bill that would have toughened the provisions of a deal the administration negotiated with Japan to co-produce the new FSX jet fighter. The president said the bill's provisions "unconstitutionally infringe on the powers of the executive." Lawmakers may try to override his veto, setting up another showdown.
