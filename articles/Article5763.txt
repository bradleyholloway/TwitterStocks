 GOP Considers License Auction For Digital TV --- Proposal in Senate to Affect Top 25 Media Markets; Aim: Balance Budget   By Pearl, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1995  As part of its budget-balancing plan, Congress has committed to raising $14 billion over seven years from new spectrum auctions and fees. In the House, broadcasters are likely to emerge unscathed; the Commerce Committee is expected to instruct the FCC to auction licenses for services such as satellite-delivered television and radio, people familiar with the situation said. It's unclear, however, if congressional budget officials would bless such a plan since the FCC could hold the auctions without any new congressional authority, and FCC chairman Reed Hundt has already been pushing to do so.  According to a one-page "draft" proposal circulated within the Commerce Committee late last week, giving smaller markets more time to go digital would reduce costs to smaller broadcasters and "more accurately track reality," thus generating greater revenue for the government. Winners of licenses in big markets could use the spectrum for digital broadcasting anytime after 1998, as long as they gave consumers two years' notice. Successful bidders could also use the spectrum for wireless-phone services or digital data services.
