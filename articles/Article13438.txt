 Suitor's Pledge May Help Seal Deal to Buy Australia's Coles; Wesfarmers to Top Up Offer If Its Shares Fail to Recover; Board Endorses Takeover   By Murdoch, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2007  Under Wesfarmers' revised proposal, it will issue a new form of shares -- Wesfarmers Price Protected Stock -- to provide [Coles] shareholders a buffer against volatility in Wesfarmers stock.  "Wesfarmers realized that they had to do something, that it wasn't going to be an automatic stamp of approval," said Tony Pearce, a fund manager at Legg Mason Asset Management in Melbourne. "And along with the Coles board's recommendation, it is highly probable Wesfarmers will succeed on the back of this."

But based on Wesfarmers' closing price Tuesday, the per-share value had fallen to A$15.22.
