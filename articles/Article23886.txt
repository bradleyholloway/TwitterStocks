 MarketWatch: ETFs--What You Need to Know   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2010  Of the 64 traditional index mutual funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the average expense ratio is about 0.4%, excluding funds aimed at institutional investors who can afford larger minimum buy-ins. While both index funds and ETFs can help average investors reach their goals in a cost-efficient way, "the one meaningful difference and the one that gives ETFs a real advantage is the tax impact," says Jerry Miccolis, chief investment officer at Brinton Eaton, a wealth advisory firm in Madison, N.J. Owners of traditional funds, index or otherwise, in taxable accounts may face capital-gains taxes when the manager sells securities to pay investors who leave the fund.
