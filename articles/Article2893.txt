 Koizumi's Visit to a War Shrine Causes Anger in China and Korea   By By Phred Dvorak, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2001  Mr. [Junichiro Koizumi], in a step he characterized as a way of defusing tension over the matter, paid a visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine yesterday rather than on Aug. 15, the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II and the day such visits are traditionally made. Mr. Koizumi also tried to calm protests by issuing a statement apologizing for Japan's aggression in the war and calling on his nation to never again wage such a conflict.
