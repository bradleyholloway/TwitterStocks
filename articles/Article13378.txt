 Business Technology: Microsoft Hits Google's Use of Books   By Robert A. Guth and Kevin J. Delaney, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2007  In his prepared remarks, Mr. [Thomas Rubin] says that after Google received "unfettered access" to the libraries, it then "basically turned its back on its partners" by making copies of copyrighted books without first obtaining copyright holders' permission. The approach, Mr. Rubin argues, "systematically violates copyright and deprives authors and publishers of an important avenue for monetizing their works."  In his remarks, Mr. Rubin plans to criticize what he sees as YouTube's "cavalier approach to copyright," explaining that "in the face of YouTube's refusal to take any effective action, copyright owners have now been forced to resort to litigation."  The speech seeks to find common ground between Microsoft and the AAP, the trade organization for U.S. book publishers. Mr. Rubin plans to emphasize that as a software company Microsoft is guided by the same principles as publishers. "I think we have much in common," he is expected to argue. Microsoft also has its own book-scanning projects that rival Google's, but which it says respect publishers' copyrights.
