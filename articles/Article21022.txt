 Pratt Hotel Extends Its Bid for Control Of Resorts to Nov. 10   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1986  Pratt said the move came after it learned that the estate of James M. Crosby, Resorts' late founder and chairman, sent the bid to Merrill Lynch & Co. for a fairness opinion. Pratt said it would extend its offer to Nov. 10 to give the estate, which has voting control of Resorts, time to study the opinion. Pratt's offer, its second for the company in two months, was scheduled to expire Friday.
