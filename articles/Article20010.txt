 Love & Money: Update: Decorating, iPod and a Jungle Gym   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2006  Every once in a while, I go back to close the loop on unresolved issues I've written about in the past. To that end, I'm revisiting three columns this week: first, about decorating my home office; second, regarding my son's gift of an iPod for his mom on Mother's Day; and third, about the giant jungle gym we bought the kids two Christmases back.  We've spent a lot of time just looking at furniture displays to gauge what the other one really likes. [Amy] learned, for instance, that busy patterns instantly repel me away from some pieces, though if she can find the same piece in a simple, clean fabric, then I often like it. I've learned to keep pushing her when she's frustrated that our tastes diverge; I remind her that we're on the same mission and that when we find something we both like, we'll be happier for it.  "No," she said. "Yes, we both said he was too young to have an iPod -- but that was if the iPod was for him. The fact that he thought that I could use it to exercise told me he has been listening to what I've been saying at home, and he put that to use. That makes me feel good."
