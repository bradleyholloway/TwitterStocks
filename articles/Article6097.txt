 Joblessness in Germany Rises To Its Highest Level Since 1999   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  The number of jobless in Europe's largest economy rose a higher-than-expected 39,000 to 4.09 million in June, pushing the jobless rate up to 9.8% from 9.7% in May, according to data from the German central bank. The report was especially disappointing because companies usually hire staff in June for seasonal jobs such as catering. Prospects for a rapid economic recovery looked even grimmer yesterday after an unexpectedly sharp fall in industrial production for May and a more pessimistic survey of economic conditions.  The conservative opposition disagreed, calling the latest figures "a catastrophe" and touting its proposals for tax cuts to spur the economy. Michael Glos, a leading conservative, insisted that Germany's jobless problems are "mostly homemade."
