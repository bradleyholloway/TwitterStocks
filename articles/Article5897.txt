 PacifiCare Sets Plans to Boost Its Profitability   By By Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2000  "PacifiCare does not intend to pursue or maintain membership" if the company can't provide quality health care "at rates our customers are willing to accept," said Howard Phanstiel, acting president and chief executive. Its former president and CEO, Robert O'Leary, resigned in October after just three months on the job.  Currently, PacifiCare is continuing with a "comprehensive analysis" of its businesses that could result in a fourth-quarter restructuring charge, Mr. Phanstiel said. He didn't disclose an estimate for the potential charge, but said PacifiCare expects to earn between 20 cents and 30 cents a share in the quarter before the effect of any charge.
