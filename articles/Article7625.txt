 Ashton-Tate Won't Proceed With Offering --- Analysts Attribute Decision To Drop in Stock Price; Action by IBM is Cited   By By Carrie Dolan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1987  Ashton-Tate Corp. said it won't proceed with a previously announced public offering of about two million common shares.  Ashton-Tate's stock surged early this year, but has since fallen nearly 25% from its high of $29 a share in January, to a low of $21.50 in the same month. This month the stock has traded as low as $22.25.  Brian Mutert, an analyst with Robertson, Colman & Stephens, said he expects Ashton-Tate's stock price to improve once the company begins to explain its future strategy. Because of non-disclosure agreements with IBM and because it was planning the offering, Ashton-Tate hasn't been able to discuss much of its plans, Mr. Mutert said. Ashton-Tate plans to meet with analysts in New York next week, he added.
