 GE Says Biomass Works as a Fuel For Gas Turbines   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1992  General Electric Co. said its researchers showed that it would be feasible to use gas derived from wood chips and other biomass as a fuel in gas-turbine electric generating systems.  Biomass, waste material from plants, has long been used as a fuel for boilers to make steam to power steam turbines that generate electricity. But the practicality of turning forest and agricultural products into a clean gas that can be burned in gas turbines hasn't been demonstrated before, said scientists at GE's Research and Development Center in Schenectady, N.Y.  At present, gas turbines, which are essentially jet engines, use natural gas or heating oil as a fuel. Gasified coal has been considered the only major alternative to those fuels for use in gas turbines, which require clean fuels. But the enthusiasm for coal gas has been damped somewhat because of concerns about sulfur, carbon and other environmentally damaging byproducts of coal.
