WASHINGTON, April 17â€” The Reagan Administration is moving to scrap a rule that allows high school students to file Federal complaints about restrictive dress codes.  T.H. Bell, the Secretary of Education, said yesterday that he would propose eliminating dress codes from the purview of his department's Office for Civil Rights, which enforces a law against sex discrimination in education.  Leaders of women's and Indian groups immediately charged that it would give local school officials a free hand to install discriminatory dress codes.  But Mr. Bell called the dress code section of the Title IX regulations ''another example where we've stretched and tortured the law out to the point of absurdity,'' and added, ''I don't think Congress ever intended that the department would be enforcing matters that relate to length of beards and hair or whether you come to school braless or with a bra.'' Indian 'Self-Image' Cited  Kurt Blue Dog, a Sioux Indian and staff attorney for the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder, Colo., contended that the action would abridge ''both the education and religious freedom of Indian people,'' and said that, by wearing long hair, Indians promoted ''a positive self-image that helps them relate to their own cultural and religious heritage.''  Robin Gordon of the Project on Equal Education Rights, a women's group, said: ''It's clearly allowing sex discrimination because it allows school districts to set unfair rules that apply to one sex and not the other arbitrarily. We have always maintained these sorts of rules ought to be made by parents.''  The Secretary will have to publish a notice of his intent to amend the regulations in the Federal Register and give the public 60 days to comment on it.  The department's civil rights agency has 46 grooming and appearance complaints pending.
