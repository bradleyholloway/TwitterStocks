 SmartMoney: Look Out for Costly Credit-Card Trends   By Todorova, Aleksandra, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2007  Mr. [Curtis Arnold]'s advice: Before authorizing a balance transfer, know what you're paying. "In your offer, if there's a reference to a minimum but no reference to a maximum charge, that should tip you off."  Why? Now that they got you accustomed to using plastic at the supermarket or gas station, it's on to conquering other marketplaces, says David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. To be sure, says Mr. Robertson, rewards programs are so successful in attracting and retaining customers that they're not going anywhere. "What's going to happen is they're going to be fine- tuned," he says.  To be fair, these are not credit cards. They're both prepaid, which means you preload them with cash from your bank account or credit card, so your child can't accumulate credit-card debt. But look at the fees and you may reconsider. The Allow Card has a $20 activation fee and a $3.50 monthly maintenance fee. Reload fees range from 75 cents if you use a checking account to between $2.50 and $50 if you use a credit card. The UPSide card's fees are more reasonable -- you can get a $24.95-a-year plan and pay no reload fee from a checking account, 99 cents per reload from a credit card.
