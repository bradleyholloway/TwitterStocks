 Last Stand in Louisiana --- Bush-Backed Novice Makes Strong Run at Remaining Senate Seat   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  While Ms. Landrieu led a field of nine in last month's general election, she finished four points short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff under Louisiana law. Now running head-to-head against Ms. [Suzanne Haik Terrell], the Democratic incumbent has seen her lead crumble against a restyled "Suzie" whose campaign is managed -- on the surface -- by a fresh-faced 28-year-old former Air Force logistics officer whose last station before Louisiana politics was, aptly enough, Afghanistan.  By the same token, a Landrieu victory could rejuvenate Democrats and become a model of how to cope with Mr. [Bush]'s power. Prior to the Nov. 5 election, the 47-year-old incumbent ran as "Military [Mary Landrieu]" who backed the president 75% of the time. Today, she draws a sharper line between the White House's agenda and Louisiana self-interests, such as cheap Mexican sugar imports. She ate red beans and rice at a waterfront union rally this week even as Mr. Bush was raising $1.2 million downtown, and Ms. Landrieu has countered with her own tax-cut proposal that exempts workers from payroll taxes on the first $10,000 of their income for the coming year.  Among white, typically conservative voters, the pulse runs quicker for Mr. Bush -- and therefore Ms. Terrell. The campaign is closing with a television spot celebrating the president's visit this week; after all the hardball tactics, the administration and Ms. Terrell even argue that politics would be less contentious for Louisiana if the state had both a Republican and Democrat representing it in the Senate.
