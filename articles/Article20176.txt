 Earnings Weakness Roils the Market   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2007  The Fed gave its own mixed message about the economy. In a statement accompanying the interest-rate move, it said "economic growth was solid in the third quarter," but added that "the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction."  "The broad picture for U.S. growth excluding housing is still fine," according to a recent report from Bridgewater Associates, a large investment firm. "The housing picture, however, adds clear downside risks for the economy. This is even more true now as the pace of contraction looks to be accelerating."  Lawrence Keusch, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who has an "attractive" rating on the stock, noted that Kinetic has been able to grow its earnings at a rapid clip outside the U.S. Kinetic is expected to grow profits 21% in the next year, but its price-earnings multiple is 18, a reasonable figure.
