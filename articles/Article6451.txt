 Saddled by Debt, Clothing Maker Warnaco Seeks Bankruptcy Protection   By By Teri Agins and Erin White, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2001  Warnaco's lenders grew unable -- or unwilling -- to extend additional credit. A Chapter 11 filing, said the company, became its best option. "The filing was made to assure that we would have product available on the shelves," said Stanley Silverstein, Warnaco's general counsel. Mr. Silverstein noted that the bankruptcy court has approved, on an interim basis, a $600 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement from a consortium of banks led by Citibank, J.P. Morgan Chase and The Bank of Nova Scotia. In its filing, the company listed assets valued at $2.4 billion. The financing, said Mr. Silverstein, will enable Warnaco to operate its "business as usual with customers and vendors."  While respected by some as a tough taskmaster, Mrs. [Linda J. Wachner]'s compensation led to some criticism. In 1996, for example, Mrs. Wachner earned $9.8 million as head of Warnaco, and collected an additional $975,000 for overseeing sportswear maker Authentic Fitness Corp., by then spun off as a separate company. In 1999, Warnaco reacquired Authentic, adding heavily to Warnaco's overall debt. In the interim, Mrs. Wachner realized $75.6 million from exercising stock options in 1998. She also collected a $6 million bonus that year. Mrs. Wachner wasn't awarded bonuses in either of the last two years.  Mrs. Wachner has an employment agreement with Warnaco that calls for her to receive about $24 million if she is terminated without cause. However, Mr. Silverstein, Warnaco's general counsel, tried to dispel any notion that Mrs. Wachner's job might be in jeopardy. "Mrs. Wachner continues to have the full support of the board, and her intention is to lead the company through these challenging times," he said. Mrs. Wachner declined to discuss how the filing would affect her personally.
