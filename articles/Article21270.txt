 On Sports: NBA Newcomers Good for a Laugh   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 2, 1988  Charlotte, N.C. -- If you were curious to see what $65 million buys these days, and were in the neighborhood of the Charlotte Coliseum on Tuesday night, you might have dropped by. There, clad in the usual scanty outfits, were 24 professional basketball players representing this city and Miami, which is in Florida.  They played a game, which the Charlotte representatives -- the Hornets, by name -- won, 99-84. The star of the Miami team, called the Heat, sank one of his 10 field goal tries and two of eight free throws. He celebrated his first successful free throw after four misses by hitting himself alongside the head with his fist. The star of the Charlotte team, a sharpshooter of renown during his college days, went eight of 20 from the field, and four of the shots he made were tip-ins or layups.  Afterward, the opposing coaches were all but apologetic about their charges' showings. "It's as good as a win against anybody. They don't come all that often for us," noted Charlotte's Dick Harter, whose club stood 3-10 in the won-lost columns as a result of the fray. "It's a loss. What more can I say?" shrugged curly haired Ron Rothstein, the Miami mentor. Not much when your team is 0-11.
