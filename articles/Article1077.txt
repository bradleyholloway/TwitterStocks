 Old China News Agency   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2006  [Xinhua] has released a sweeping update to a 1996 law on foreign news agencies that smacks of expropriation and may violate China's World Trade Organization commitments. The document asserts the Chinese government's right to broadly censor foreign news companies' content over a range of sensitive subjects, including "sovereignty" (read: Taiwan), "religion" (Falun Gong), or China's "interests" (Iran, Burma, Sudan). Article 12 of the new regulations gives Xinhua "the right to select the news and information released by foreign news agencies" and to "delete" offending material.  The real story here, then, may be Xinhua's ambitions. According to Sunday's document, "foreign news agencies" will no longer have the right to sell news directly to their customers. They'll have to ply their wares through a Chinese "agent," which presumably will require a few yuan for its trouble. The Journal reported yesterday that this "agent" will be the China Economic Information Service, which, no surprise, is appointed by Xinhua.
