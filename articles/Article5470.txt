 Miyazawa to Steer Talks at Summit With Clinton Toward Partnership Role   By By David P. Hamilton, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1993  When Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa holds his first summit Friday with President Clinton, he will try to steer the talks beyond trade squabbles and attempt to shape Japan's long-desired "global partnership" with the U.S.  Mr. Miyazawa will go to Washington with a series of proposals intended to demonstrate Japan's willingness to take a leading role in guiding the global economy, according to weekend Japanese press reports. In addition to measures aimed at lowering Japan's huge trade surplus, these plans reportedly include boosting aid to Russia, increasing aid to developing countries, and expanding joint scientific and technological research with the U.S.  Even before Mr. Miyazawa's trip, Japanese government officials are trying to create an atmosphere of goodwill between the two countries. On Friday, Japan's Export-Import Bank announced it will invest $12 million in a Los Angeles coal terminal project to promote industrial cooperation between the U.S. and Japan.
