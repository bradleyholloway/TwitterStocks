Can anybody get into Harvard? If you're one of the thousands of students who have just completed the grueling college admissions process and are awaiting the results from selective universities, the answer is no, of course. But if you have been to the movies in the past few months, you might think anyone could. In ''Legally Blonde,'' Reese Witherspoon plays a ditzy sorority girl who lands at Harvard Law School thanks to a video resume with generous footage of her in a bikini; in ''How High,'' Method Man and Redman play two small-time pot dealers who light up Cambridge; and in ''Orange County,'' a West Coast variation on the theme, a Stanford reject shows up on campus to plead his case.  In their own ways, the films provoke a much more interesting question: can anybody succeed at Harvard? In other words, what if what it takes to get into an elite college and what it takes to prosper there are two entirely separate things? The only way to truly test the admissions process would be to accept enough homecoming queens and homeboys to make a meaningful comparison. And not many schools are willing to take that risk.
