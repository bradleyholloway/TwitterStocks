 Big Apple Pie   By O'Hanlon, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2006  Because DHS doesn't seem to want to pay personnel costs, such units do not receive much attention or support when allocation decisions are made. That is regrettable. A better approach would either change the urban grant program to allow such ongoing costs to be partially covered by Washington, or create a new program to do so -- perhaps a "COPS II" effort, modeled after the Clinton administration's COPS program through which the federal government helped local police forces beef up their ranks for more general purposes.  In addition, some proposals for first responders -- that most or all of the nation's millions of fireman, police officers and emergency medical personnel have state-of-the-art chemical protection gear and interoperable radios, for example -- are excessive. Such a "kitchen sink" approach could cost upward of $20 billion a year, according to one estimate. Spending that much primarily to prepare for the consequences of an attack is not the best use of homeland security dollars. If we are going to boost overall expenditure so much, it would be better to spend it on more prevention -- to keep dangerous people out of the country (and help our allies track them down and arrest them when they are abroad), to secure dangerous materials before they fall into the wrong hands, to detect early signs of terrorist plots before they can be hatched. A few mobile command centers with interoperable communications, for example, are just as good a solution to most cities' needs as interoperable radios for every single first responder.
