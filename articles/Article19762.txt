 Jefferson National May Be Charged; SEC, New York Mull Action For Alleged Market Timing By Former Unit Of Conseco   By Enrich, David, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2004  The SEC and the New York Attorney General's office informed Conseco in January that they were considering enforcement actions against the company based on market timing involving variable annuity policies issued by its former unit, which at the time was called Conseco Variable Insurance Co. Conseco, the Carmel, Ind., insurance holding company, has argued that the annuity unit didn't violate federal or state laws prior to the October 2002 sale.  Under the 2002 purchase agreement, Conseco agreed to indemnify Jefferson National and Inviva for liabilities stemming from unspecified business and marketing activities that took place while the unit was part of Conseco, according to previous Conseco regulatory filings. It isn't clear whether Inviva was aware of the alleged market-timing activities when it bought the unit from Conseco.
