 Entertainment: Now Appearing in the Role of New York...Toronto!   By By Roger Ricklefs, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1998  This placid Canadian city frequently stands in for a variety of U.S. slums and suburbs, as well as foreign locales such as London, Berlin and Tangiers. With its low production costs, Toronto has played the role of New York City in more than 100 movies and television series. It mimicked New York in the 1996 movie "Mimic," pretended to be Gotham in the TV pilot for "The Pretender" and effectively fooled audiences in the 1991 film "Deceived."  Mr. Innes also finds brisk demand for his New York City bus (actually, a 1961 Toronto bus with a paint job). "If you are shooting a 1950 scene and there is a computer store across the street, you put a New York City bus there and have people getting on and off," he says. "It's a lot easier than turning the computer store into a haberdashery."  Scenic Productions of Toronto Ltd., a scenery house, sometimes covers a Toronto fire hydrant with a U.S. mailbox, then puts a fake American fire hydrant nearby. Little Feet Ltd., a Toronto set builder, constructs "tree surrounds" those low metal fences designed to keep dogs away from the trunks of trees on New York streets. Scenery companies also spend hours covering Toronto's No Parking signs with U.S. No Parking signs.
