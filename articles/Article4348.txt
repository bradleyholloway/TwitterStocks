 NMS Industrials Are Pushed Up 1.8% By Big Buyers, Despite Power Outage   By By Priscilla Ann Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1987  By the time the market ended -- with traders' computer terminals still flickering off and on -- the big buyers had snapped up enough shares to send the National Market System's industrial average up as much as the Dow Jones industrials. The NMS industrials, which best reflect prices of the biggest OTC stocks generally bought by the institutions, climbed 1.8% to 116.57.  Traders speculated that one reason the NMS price surge yesterday equaled that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was that few small OTC shares had much opportunity to trade. Prices of smaller stocks have been dragging down the average.  In fact, at the close, about 3,024 Nasdaq stocks were unchanged in price or hadn't traded at all. Last evening, Nasdaq said it doesn't know exactly how many shares changed hands in the OTC market yesterday. "In fact, we may never know," said a NASD spokeswoman, "because of the power outage," she added.
