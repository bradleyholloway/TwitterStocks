 Brazil Acts to Reform Bankrupt Pension System --- Congressional Vote Signals Key Support for Cardoso In Bid to Shrink Deficit   By By Peter Fritsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 1998  SAO PAULO, Brazil -- In a key sign of support for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to throw a rope around Brazil's runaway budget deficit, the lower house of Congress voted to remove the remaining obstacles to a long-delayed reform of the nation's bankrupt pension system.  Beyond saving the government $3.6 billion a year in a country where most "retirees" are still in their 40s, the vote was seen as an early test of congressional willingness to bite the bullet on passage of the administration's austerity package, considered a quid pro quo for more than $30 billion in assistance being negotiated with the International Monetary Fund and other international lenders. Investors around the world see the IMF's vote of confidence as crucial if Brazil is to avoid a currency devaluation with disastrous international repercussions.  Brazil's austerity plan, announced last week, seeks to save $23.5 billion next year through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. Much of that package must go through a fickle legislature, whose history of dithering when the chips are down invites comparison with Russia's lower house, the Duma. Pension reform has been stalled for more than three years, a victim of powerful special interests in Brasilia. Congress missed a chance to pass a watered-down version of pension reform by a single vote last May and then couldn't muster a quorum to vote during World Cup soccer action this past summer. Those missed opportunities cost Brazil more than $1 billion in the current quarter.
