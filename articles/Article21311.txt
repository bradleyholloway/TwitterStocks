 U.S. Farmers Are Planning to Boost Plantings Of Corn and Soybean Crops Less Than Expected   By By Bruce Ingersoll and Sue Shellenbarger, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1989  The Agriculture Department said farmers intend to increase corn plantings 8% to 73.2 million acres this spring, far less than the 11% to 12% gains expected by many merchants, processors and traders. Soybean acreage is expected to increase by 5% to 61.7 million acres, less than the 5.5% to 6% expected increase.  Nevertheless, the report issued late Friday stunned many traders and analysts who had expected the government's loosening of planting restrictions, coupled with this spring's high prices, to spur more ambitious plans by farmers. Some interpreted the report as a sign that the Agriculture Department's Conservation Reserve Program, an aggressive effort to preserve fragile land by paying farmers to idle it over 10 years, is having a significant impact on the amount of land available for crops.  At the same time, high wheat prices led farmers to plan an increase in spring-planted wheat acreage to a seven-year high. The fall-planted winter wheat crop is in trouble because of drought on the High Plains, and many farmers see big potential profits in spring wheat. The department said farmers intend to raise durum wheat acreage by 16% to 3.9 million acres, and plantings of other spring wheat by 17% to 15.7 million acres.
