 Starting Out: When You Can't Spare Much for Charity   By Saranow, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2005  With a low salary, car costs and college bills, Ms. [Shannon Radecki] doesn't have spare money to donate. She has yet to contribute. "I don't feel like I'm making enough money to actually help out," she says. "I don't see myself being able to donate for another five years."  don't race to respond to the first solicitation you receive. Instead, think about where you want your money to go. "If you can't afford to give a lot, you should give to something that is important to you," says Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy.  For now, volunteering is Ms. Radecki's giving method of choice. Once a month, she works with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, teaching kids about career paths. "That is something I can do right now," she says. "I can just give my time and still make a difference."
