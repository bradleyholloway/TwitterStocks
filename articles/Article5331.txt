 Mattel bets Barbie can sell girls on computer games   By Bannon, Lisa, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 1996  Mattel Inc's new Mattel Media Inc division is planning a splashy launch of some 15 CD-ROM products at the American International Toy Fair in New York City on Feb 12, 1996, all of them tied to Mattel's big brands and most of them targeting girls. In fact, the company's star product--Barbie--is the subject of several of the new interactive games. Mattel's success will depend upon whether girls currently avoid CD-ROM because of a lack of appealing product or just disinterest.
