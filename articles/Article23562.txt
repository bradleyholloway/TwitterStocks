 Love of Labor, Labor of Love: Mr. Grohmann's New Museum   By Dobrzynski, Judith H, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2008  Inside this converted Cadillac dealership-turned- Federal Reserve Bank back office, visitors will view men, and some women, not only forging steel, building bridges, drilling for oil and making sausages, but also collecting taxes, extracting teeth, dequilling goose feathers and lawyering. [...] it's a vanity museum out to make the point that work is noble and dignified, a conviction reinforced by its location on the campus of the Milwaukee School of Engineering, where Dr. Grohmann sits on the board of regents, rather than along some tourist trail.
