 U.S. Car Sales Stayed Weak In Late May --- Rate Slipped 1.9% From '86; Analysts Say June Pace Will Indicate '87 Tone   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1987  U.S. sales of domestic cars in late May continued at the weak pace of earlier in the month, and analysts said June results would indicate whether the industry is headed for a sales decline during the rest of the year.  The domestic industry sold 250,045 cars in the last 10 days of May, compared with 286,788 last year. On a daily rate basis, the latest sales were down 1.9% from a year ago, which was a weak period; there were eight selling days in late May this year and nine in the 1986 period.  "Overall demand seems to be worse than we thought," said Michael Luckey, an auto analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "It's hurting both domestic and Japanese companies." He said that given the economic outlook, he expects more aggressive sales incentives from the U.S. auto companies and sales programs from the Japanese as well. "The Japanese so far have been avoiding (consumer) rebates. But with Subaru's results, it will be awfully hard for other Japanese companies to avoid incentives," he said.
