 Capital: The Risks Of Aiding Airlines   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2002  Congress gave the board a set of wonderfully contradictory precepts. Approve loan guarantees only for airlines for which "credit is not reasonably available," Congress said. That can be stretched to make nearly any airline eligible. But, Congress added, only approve those loans that are "prudently incurred" and "a necessary part of maintaining a safe, efficient and viable commercial aviation system." That can be used to deny almost any application.  Fed Gov. Edward Gramlich sided with the airline, casting the deciding vote, as he probably will do with some future applicants. But even the majority acknowledged a "significant risk" that the airline might go under anyhow. And it did set some stiff conditions, including a demand that America West give the government the equivalent of a 33% stake. The airline, which was unprofitable before Sept. 11 and is now losing $1 million a day, says it can live with that.  The $10 billion loan-guarantee kitty protects U.S. travelers from disruptions like those that followed suspension of flights by cash-strapped European airlines Sabena and Swissair last year. That can be viewed as a sensible insurance policy.
