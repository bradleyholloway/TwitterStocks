 Car Sales Fall 6.2% at GM, 10.6% at Ford --- Influx of Used Autos Made Small-Car Sales Harder, Hurting January Results   By By Rebecca Blumenstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1998  Hit hard by a 35% plunge in the sales of its smaller-car segments, General Motors Corp. said its U.S. light-vehicle sales fell 6.2% in January, while Ford Motor Co. reported a 10.6% sales decline for the month.  Industrywide, U.S. sales of cars and light trucks in January declined 6.6% to 1,019,756 vehicles from the year-earlier 1,091,950. A decline was expected in comparison with strong year-earlier sales, partly because year-end sales incentives and rivalries probably lured a substantial number of customers who otherwise would have bought in January to accelerate their purchases. Most industry experts said the January decline doesn't indicate any underlying weakness in the auto market.  GM officials said the plunge in GM's small-car sales, amounting to a decline of 46% for the Chevrolet Cavalier alone, led to an 18.4% decline in its January sales of cars, compared with the year-earlier level. Partly offsetting that was a 10% increase in GM's light-truck sales, buoyed by record sales of some of the company's most expensive trucks, like its extended-cab, full-size pickups.
