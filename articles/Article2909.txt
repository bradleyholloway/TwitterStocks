 European Aid Includes Helping of Kindness   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  The ban on flights in the U.S. in the wake of terrorist attacks in New York and Washington has stranded thousands of Americans in Europe. Travelers faced another day of delays yesterday as the Federal Aviation Administration opened U.S. airspace to commercial flights but told European officials that new restrictions would be necessary before foreign aircraft would be allowed to enter. The outpouring of offers to help, both organized and individual, show just how the tragic events have struck home outside the U.S.  Mr. [Terry Holmes] says his 81-room hotel is housing about 100 travelers who were thwarted from flying to the U.S. He took a group of those stranded to Buckingham Palace Thursday morning for a special service and changing of the guard ceremony which, in a break from tradition, included "The Star-Spangled Banner."
