 Bush's AIDS Project Promises to Pay Off On Numerous Fronts   By By John Harwood, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2003  That a conservative Republican president would pledge 20 times that much -- amid economic anxiety and swelling budget deficits -- is the product of converging trends. Conservative Christians, important in Mr. [Bush]'s base, have shown increasing interest in Africa's agony. Media coverage sent mainstream opinion surging ahead of political leaders on the need to act more aggressively. Secretary of State Colin Powell bested administration hard-liners in elevating the priority of the issue with Mr. Bush himself.  A successful AIDS initiative will steepen the Democrats' climb to defeat Mr. Bush next year. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, who earlier sponsored unsuccessful relief legislation with Mr. [Bill Frist], attacked Mr. Bush early this year for ignoring AIDS in deference to "political calculation and conservative dogma." Now Mr. Bush has largely silenced that line of attack. In the recent Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina, the AIDS crisis wasn't mentioned by Mr. Kerry or anybody else.  Nor is Mr. Bush's pledge enough to fully attack a disease that has infected roughly 68 million people, killing more than one-third of them, in two decades. The Global HIV Prevention Working Group has called for an annual increase of $3.8 billion in spending on prevention, far more than Mr. Bush would devote to that purpose.
