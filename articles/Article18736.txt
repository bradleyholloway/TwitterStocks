 Letters to the Editor: Torched Apartments And Rapist Fathers   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1995  Ms. Carr also obfuscates Mr. Pileggi's complaint that Legal Services makes full-blown civil-rights issues out of "leaky faucet" cases. Mr. Pileggi's point was that where these cases have merit (and many do not, with 25 or 30 "professional plaintiffs" suing over and over again) they belong in landlord-tenant court. The only reason Legal Services clogs the federal courts with them is in order to obtain attorney's fees. There is no benefit whatever to the client, indeed the reverse, since the fees come out of the Housing Authority's operating budget, leaving it with less money for upkeep. And given that the government already pays the salaries of Legal Services attorneys, this double-dipping for cases that do not involve genuine civil rights issues is an abuse of the legal system.
