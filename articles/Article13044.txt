 Ould Ireland   By Morris, Jan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2004  So I drove away from Galway with mixed feelings, because I had loved that Ould Ireland. Out in the country I noticed on a distant hillside, across an idyllic green valley, a row of those white identical bungalows, each with its garage, which have replaced the thatched crofts and cottages of Celtic sentimentalism. I examined them sadly through my binoculars, regretting that even in that patch of paradise nothing remained of the old style, the old ways. "Give me the glassses," said my other self. "You don't know how to look -- there, outside the second bungalow on the left, clear as clear there's an old woman in a shawl, with a little black dog gambolling at her feet, peeling potatoes beside a peat-pile and smoking a short clay pipe."
