 Inflation Shows Slight Rise, Despite Energy Price Drop --- CPI Gain Is Held to 0.1%, But Asian Woes Have Yet to Exert Full Force   By By Christina Duff, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 20, 1998  Plummeting energy prices held the overall consumer price index to a seasonally adjusted rise of 0.1% in February after it stayed unchanged in January, the Labor Department said. But after stripping out volatile food and energy prices, which makes the reading more reliable, the CPI rose 0.3% in February, the biggest gain in 10 months, after a 0.2% rise in January.  Most of that acceleration reflects people paying more to live a little of the high life. Airline-ticket prices shot up 3.2% in February, and the cost of recreation -- everything from movie tickets to cable TV -- rose 0.3%. Cigarette prices jumped 2.9%, as tobacco companies raised prices in anticipation of expensive legal settlements. Also, overall shelter costs climbed 0.3% in February, reflecting rising rents for apartment dwellers and higher prices for homes and condominiums.
