 Insurance Broker ULR, a Quiet Power, Comes Under Scrutiny   By John R. Emshwiller and Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2004  Mr. Hart asked a ULR representative about the so-called communications fees. "He said that was how they made money," Mr. Hart recalls. "I said, 'You're not going to make it from Cargill.'" In Mr. Hart's view, ULR's proposal offered "to give Cargill a deal on its rate and the employees a little lesser deal," he says. "I absolutely objected to that." The company decided not to use the San Diego firm's services.  Now, ULR is under scrutiny by law-enforcement officials and trial lawyers. A suit filed late last month in a San Diego federal court accuses Mr. Cox, ULR and some big insurance companies of illegally conspiring to allow the broker to collect millions of dollars of fees "unknowingly imposed on the employees" of ULR clients. The suit, which seeks class-action status for employees of Intel and other ULR clients, also accuses the brokerage firm of improperly accepting "kickbacks" in the form of secret commissions from insurers for steering business their way. A similar suit was filed in California state court.  Mr. Cox declined to be interviewed for this article. ULR denies wrongdoing and says it is cooperating with government investigators. "It's absolutely incorrect that employees are worse off," says David Gabianelli, a ULR attorney in San Francisco. "Doug Cox and his company through these optional [supplemental life insurance] plans have saved employees over $100 million over the past five years." Citing continuing litigation, Mr. Gabianelli declined to discuss the firm's fee arrangements.
