 Many Ties Link Pension Lobby To Regulators   By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2003  Instead, among the invited guests -- aside from a smattering of congressional and Treasury staffers who work on pension issues -- was a long list of lobbyists representing employers on pension and retirement matters. They included individuals from the Erisa Industry Committee and the American Benefits Council, whose members include International Business Machines Corp., AT&T Corp. and hundreds of other large employers with a financial stake in the outcome of the pension regulations Mr. [William F. Sweetnam Jr.] is drafting.  There is nothing new about lobbyists, congressional staffers and regulators socializing. But this is a crucial time for the pension business: The Treasury is expected any day to issue regulations on cash-balance plans, determining whether the plans violate age- discrimination laws, and it is developing proposed regulations to determine whether employers can pay departing workers smaller lump sums from cash-balance plans under certain circumstances. Employers have been increasingly eager for favorable regulations since IBM lost an age-discrimination suit in a federal district court in July, and Xerox Corp. in August lost its appeal in a cash-balance case involving the underpayment of lump sums.  Ms. [Tara Bradshaw], the Treasury spokeswoman, objected to questions about the party. The policy positions of those invited to the party "had no bearing on whether they were invited or not," Ms. Bradshaw said. "This was two buddies throwing a party for friends."
