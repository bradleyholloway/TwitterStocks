DUBLIN, Feb. 15â€” The police said today that they were keeping an ''open mind'' on whether arson was the cause of a fire early Saturday in which 48 young people died. They said they were also investigating reports by some survivors that several exits at the Stardust disco were locked.  ''We cannot say one way or the other,'' said John O'Driscoll, detective chief superintendent, about some reports that arson was the cause of the fire.  ''We are keeping our minds open,'' he said. ''Our forensic laboratory is working full staff and we have 60 to 70 detectives interviewing hundreds of people.''  The fire broke out shortly before 2 A.M. yesterday at the Stardust, a large entertainment center on the city's north side. It spread quickly, engulfing the club's curtains, ceiling and foamfilled chairs, which reportedly filled the hall with thick black smoke.  The lights failed and panic broke out among the 800 patrons, mostly people in their late teens and early 20's. Survivors told of climbing over one another to locate exits, only to find some of them locked.  About 128 people remained hospitalized today, several in critical condition.
