The stock market overcame its interest rate jitters temporarily yesterday and scored a moderate gain after weeks of heavy selling. There was little in the way of economic developments to account for the small rebound, but analysts said that, with some stock prices at bargain levels, the market was due for an upswing.  Ralph Bloch, vice president of Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden, termed the upswing ''strictly technical.'' He said the market was also helped by the drop in the Federal funds rate yesterday to 14 percent from 15 1/2 percent on Thursday. The Federal funds rate, a key interest indicator, is what banks charge one another for overnight loans.  Low Close on Thursday  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.14 points, to 892.22. On Thursday the average dropped 10.18 points, to 889.08, its lowest close since it finished at 885.92 on July 10, 1980.  Since Aug. 10, the key average has tumbled about 50 points, mostly because of investor apprehension over rising interest rates and inflation. This week the Dow lost 28 points.  Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday outscored declines by 779 to 644. Few issues on the list had major price changes. The best gains were recorded by some of the special situations, which responded to specific news developments. Volume Shows Decline  Turnover on the Big Board contracted to 38 million shares from 43.9 million the day before.  As is normal for Fridays, many investors remained on the sidelines awaiting the Federal Reserve statistics on the nation's money supply for the latest reporting week. After the market closed, the Fed announced that the basic money supply, M-1B, fell $3.7 billion in the latest reporting period. Analysts said the sharp drop raised expectations that the Fed might loosen its tight monetary policy and that stock prices would benefit.  Charles M. Lewis, vice president of Shearson Loeb Rhoades, commented that the market ''is technically and fundamentally sound'' and appeared ready for ''a major upward move.''  Mr. Lewis predicted that the Fed might soon drop the 4 percent surcharge major borrowers pay on the discount rate, which is currently 14 percent. He said that, if this happened, ''other interest rates, especially the prime rate, will follow suit and the market will soar.'' The discount rate is what the Fed charges its member banks for loans, while the prime rate is the basis for the interest banks charge their most creditworthy corporate customers on loans.  A large rise in the money supply, on the other hand, would have been an indication to Wall Street that the Fed would not relax its current tight credit policy, which has been mainly responsible for the weaker stock prices. Colt Up 5 1/8 on Merger Pact  Colt Industries was a large gainer yesterday and advanced 5 1/8, to 87 3/4, after it signed a definitive agreement to merge into Penn Central. Penn Central's stock rose 1/2, to 38 1/4.  Another good mover was Holly Sugar, a major sugar beet producer, which climbed 1 3/8 points, to 36 1/8. A group of dissident shareholders of Holly said they planned to propose the nomination of a full slate of seven directors in opposition to Holly's present board. The group said it owned 5.8 percent of the Holly shares outstanding.  Amax Inc., a diversified natural resources company, tacked on 1 7/8 points, to 57 3/8. The company is reported to be a takeover candidate, and there have been rumors that some of the oil companies have approached Amax concerning a possible merger. Active Jim Walter Off 3 5/8  A big loser was Jim Walter, the volume leader, which fell 3 5/8, to 19. The building materials manufacturer cut its quarterly dividend payout yesterday to 25 cents a share from 47 1/2 cents.  There were few major price changes in the depressed energy group. Cities Service, which is considered a takeover candidate by many, lost 2 1/2, to 54 1/2, and General American Oil fell 1 1/4, to 40 3/8, after its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30 declined.  On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index rose 6.11, to 354.80. Towner Petroleum advanced 2 1/8, to 17 7/8, after announcing a major natural gas find in Caddo County, Okla.  In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.73, to 197.55.  Illustrations: diagram of market profile for Friday, Aug. 28, 1981
