It is a Civil War between Nameless Factions at an Unspecified Time in a Nameless Place. The weather is so foggy the End of the World may be nigh. A Man Named Angel declares: "If I was God, I'd change some things in the Bible." But Angel, who is crucified in Act II, is not God, and neither, apparently, is Jesus, who arrives bearing a cello just in time to delight us with some Bach.  Such is the rocky metaphysical terrain in "On the Open Road," a new play by Steve Tesich that bears nothing less than the fate of mankind on its broad shoulders, with occasional pauses for apocalyptic noises off. Although the sincerity of Mr. Tesich's concern for humanity in general is not in question, that concern is not always extended to the specific humans who have come to see his play at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. Trying to pump up some conventional ideas into grandiose theatrical metaphors -- much as he did in his previous futuristic doomsday fable, "Square One" -- Mr. Tesich has written an inflated parable in which self-importance must pass for importance.
