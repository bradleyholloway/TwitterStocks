 Aluminum Outperforms Most of Its Sagging Peers   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1998  While Asian financial problems sent these metals and other commodity prices into a tailspin, most analysts say aluminum's persistence stems from its lower exposure to Asian consumption compared to other metals. Ted Arnold, metals analyst for Merrill Lynch in London, points out that 30% of aluminum consumption came from Asia in 1996, compared to 34% of copper demand and 38% of nickel usage. For metals, "the big thing unfolding is Asia, and it's looking like the beginning of something ugly," he says. And with aluminum applications more diversified across the globe, "it has the least bearish" prospects of the base metals, he says.  New copper production came on line as prices rose to multiyear highs in the mid-1990s. Copper production increased sharply in 1997 and is expected to grow another 5.5% in 1998, says Thomas M. Van Leeuwen, senior metals and mining analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Copper mining companies already have committed to much more new capacity and will have difficulty closing a mine down, he says. Meanwhile, aluminum production growth is slated to be 3.3% this year. Further, aluminum currently trades at a price much closer to the average cost of production than copper, analysts add. As a result, aluminum prices are less likely to fall in 1998 without the closing of some production facilities, they say.
