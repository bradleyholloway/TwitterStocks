 British Airways CEO Eddington Plans to Step Down This Year   By Michaels, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2005  Mr. [Rod Eddington] will leave behind a stronger and healthier airline than the one he took over in May 2000, almost two months after his predecessor, Bob Ayling, was fired because of soured relations with British Airways's staff. Those relations have improved significantly under Mr. Eddington, but remain tense because of continuing staff cuts and the carrier's aggressive efforts to boost profitability. Since 2001, British Airways has eliminated 13,000 jobs and currently employs about 46,000 people.
