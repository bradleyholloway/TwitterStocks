 Special Texas Session Braces for Brawl Over Workers' Compensation Insurance   By By Christi Harlan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1989  Already, Gov. William P. Clements is warning that Texas will be crippled in its quest for the corporate relocations it needs to pull itself out of the economic doldrums; employers in the state are going without workers' compensation insurance to avoid the high premiums; the state's largest workers' compensation carrier has quit writing policies and others are threatening to follow suit.  All this fuss is over the rules governing payments to workers for on-the-job injuries and the cost to Texas companies of buying insurance against such claims. Employers in the state pay about $3 billion in premiums annually for workers' compensation insurance, the fifth-highest state total in the nation. That represents a 148% increase during the past five years. And the total could go higher; the State Board of Insurance is considering insurers' request for a 34.9% rate increase.  Even those high rates don't cover claims, insurance companies contend, leading to millions of dollars of losses in Texas each year. On Oct. 1, the state's largest writer of workers' compensation policies, Texas Employers Insurance Association, stopped writing new policies because of its losses.
