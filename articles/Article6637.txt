 Ethanol Bandwagon Picks Up Speed; California, Other States Push for Expanded Use; Higher Gas, Food Costs?   By Fialka, John J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2007  In separate actions aimed at reducing "greenhouse gases," California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered a cut of "at least 10%" in the carbon content of motor-vehicle fuels used in his state by 2020, while governors of 37 states prepared to push for a new federal rule to require greater use of ethanol fuel.  "We're looking at corn futures trading in the range of $4 a bushel. That's as high a price as we've seen in this decade," Mr. [Michael Swanson] said. Earlier spikes in the price of corn were caused by small crops, but this year's crop "was one of the largest we've ever had," he added.  Currently, ethanol is turned into motor fuel by mixing it with gasoline in blends of 10% or less ethanol. Both the pending California rule and the governors' proposal would require major owners of gas stations to provide pumps that distribute 85% blends of ethanol and give auto makers incentives to make more "flexible fuel" vehicles that can use this blend.
