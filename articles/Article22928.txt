 Smallpox Questions   By By Elizabeth M. Whelan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2002  For some, a more palatable alternative would be assured access to the vaccine only after it was confirmed that smallpox was indeed available as a terror weapon -- or even after exposure to smallpox had occurred, as the vaccine is effective in preventing the disease when administered within a few days of exposure. Further, a sense of urgency for widespread use of a vaccine would be reduced if there were effective anti-viral medications in place. The FDA-approved drug Cidofovir (Vistide), used in AIDS-related viral eye infections, prevents death and disease in primates with monkey-pox -- similar to smallpox in humans. Cidofovir and other future anti-virals offer considerable promise for effective treatment. Additionally, the vaccination would be regarded as less dangerous if there were a more plentiful supply of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), now in very short supply, which can effectively treat severe reactions. And indeed the government has just awarded a contract to Cangene to develop substantial supplies of this drug.  -- How does one make an informed decision about whether or not to be vaccinated? Unlike routine childhood and flu shots, the smallpox vaccine carries known risks even for healthy people, with an estimated death rate of one or two per million, and a significantly higher rate of other side-effects from adverse reactions, including brain swelling. How do we weigh a hypothetical risk of being exposed to smallpox with a small but real risk of vaccine-related death or illness? Don't count on your physician to make a decision for you: he does not have much more information on this than you do.
