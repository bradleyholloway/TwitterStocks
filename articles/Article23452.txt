 Essay; What to Wear? Retirement has its own dress code; And the rules are tough   By Graham, Ellen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 2007  By contrast, senior style (and I use the term advisedly) presents a raft of quandaries, none of them simple. Now, like some over-age runway model during Fashion Week, I'm perpetually changing costumes. I start the day with a shower, don a swimsuit under sweats for the gym, reshower after my workout, and change back into sweats for the trip home. By late morning I may need to switch into something dressier for a lunch date or doctor's appointment. Then it's back into jeans for chores and dinner. Or, if we're going out, I put on something dressy, generally preceded by another shower.  Now, sprung from those rigid uniforms, he requires close surveillance. I have to pick my battles, because there is nothing that irritates Don more than my second-guessing his choice of attire. But when we're going out and he is wearing a moth-eaten sweater, I feel I must speak up. I also keep a sharp eye out for wrinkled shirts he's plucked straight from the ironing bundle. (Ironing is the bottleneck in our household; if a garment needs ironing it rarely gets worn.)  The other point of contention is Don's Army-green padded jumpsuit, a mainstay of his winter wardrobe. I have only myself to blame for this horror: I bought it for him at a hunting-and-fishing store to wear on our boat in brisk weather. But he likes to wear it indoors as well, over his clothes to ward off drafts. It gives him the look of the Michelin tire man, except that since it shrunk in the wash the pant legs hit him about midcalf. It's so bulky it takes up an entire drawer to store off-season. And when it needs washing, which is often, it constitutes a full load unto itself. Nonetheless, this garment seems to have special allure for men. When Don's brother saw it, he dashed out and bought one for himself. And so did his brother's next-door neighbor.
