 Letters to the Editor: Civil-Rights Nominee Is No Radical   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1994  President Clinton has chosen wisely in nominating Deval Patrick to the nation's top civil-rights position. It will be hard for the opponents of effective civil-rights enforcement to defeat Mr. Patrick, but it is clear they are going to try, once again using inflammatory and misleading rhetoric. Clint Bolick, in his Feb. 2 editorial-page article "Civil-Rights Nominee, Quota Clone," used the phrase "Quota Queen" to describe the previous nominee, Prof. Lani Guinier, and enough people were prepared to believe -- mistakenly, in my view -- that she favored quotas as a remedy for past racial discrimination so that the label stuck and the misleading message it carried brought Ms. Guinier down.
