Austin Jr., resigned.  The utility's management is scrambling to respond to mounting criticism of its inability to resolve persistent problems at Peach Bottom nuclear plant, closed since March.  James L. Everett III, chairman and chief executive of Philadelphia Electric, could be pressured to resign if problems at Peach Bottom aren't resolved soon. "I have stated publicly many times that accountability begins with me and extends throughout senior management," Mr. Everett said yesterday. "I have said my job is on the line, and it still is."
