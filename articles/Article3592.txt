 BP Keeps Part of Prudhoe Open, Easing Concern   By Farivar, Masood, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2006  The Prudhoe Bay glitch reverberated through world markets because it involved supplies in one of the most secure places in the world and came at a time when substantial amounts of global oil production remains offline in places such as Nigeria, Venezuela, Iraq and the Gulf of Mexico. According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, of the U.S., a complete shutdown of Prudhoe Bay would raise the total amount of shut-in production to 2.3 million barrels a day, or 2.6% of total global output. Against that backdrop, traders' initial reaction to the potential loss of supply in Alaska was understandable, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at brokerage house Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.  The move came after U.S. companies Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips, the two other partners in Prudhoe Bay, both informed their customers that they wouldn't be able to honor their delivery commitments. BP said it saw no need for such a measure, and refiners on the U.S. West Coast that depend on the field's crude oil said they could offset the shortfall by drawing down on inventories or tapping into readily available foreign sources of oil such as Saudi Arabia's.
