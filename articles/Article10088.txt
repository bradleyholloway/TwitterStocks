 Love & Money: Readers: The Burden of Being an Executor   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  "The amount of time I spent addressing each detail consumed days, nights and weekends for months," Ms. [Patricia Marek] says. "Poring over IRS documents to make sure I submitted all the required forms became like a second job. It was a labor of love, but it's still not over yet. While the court closed the probate and discharged us of our duties in January 2007, the IRS will not release us as fiduciaries of the estate until September 2008."  Know the location of important physical assets. That includes knowing where the keys are to any safe-deposit boxes and the combinations of any safes in the house. Also, "know the secret hiding place for any special pieces of jewelry" or other heirloom items, Ms. [Lynne Elander] says. "You don't want to throw out an old can of peas only to realize it had [Mom's] special pearl earrings."  Household goods are worth less than you think. Nobody wants any of it, Ms. Elander says, unless they're good antiques. "We hired a professional estate-sale manager, and he took 20% off the top of all sales," she says. "But the biggest benefit was he also donated the stuff he couldn't sell and we didn't have to worry about trucking it to Goodwill."
