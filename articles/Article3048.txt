 The Economy: Foreign Investors See Little Luster In U.S. Assets   By By Michael M. Phillips and Russell Gold, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  The drop-off reflects hard times in Europe and Japan, where companies have less cash on hand to invest in the U.S., and the diminished appeal of American assets during a shaky U.S. recovery. It comes at a time when the record trade gap is making it all the more important that the U.S. continue to attract enormous amounts of foreign capital to finance business investment, to keep the dollar from collapsing and to prevent interest rates from climbing.  Net direct equity investment in the U.S. dropped to $8.6 billion during the second quarter, the lowest figure since 1995, the Commerce Department reported. With mergers-and-acquisitions activity in the U.S. drying up, direct foreign equity investment measured just $19.6 billion during the first six months of the year. That is way off the pace that resulted in $108 billion in foreign direct equity purchases during 2001, and much less than the $246 billion during 2000.  The current-account deficit measured 5% of the country's domestic economic output, a figure traditionally thought to be well above the danger point. Such a large trade gap sharpens the fear that foreigners might suddenly grow wary of all U.S. assets, an event that could spark a plunge in the dollar and a rise in interest rates. The dollar's fall might generate more exports, but it could also generate inflation. A market-driven rise in interest rates could frighten consumers, who are the impetus behind the U.S. economic recovery.
