 E-Commerce (A Special Report): A Consumer's Guide --- Technical Advisor: Fighting the Icon Invasion   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  I am indebted to Neil J. Rubenking, a contributing technical editor at PC Magazine, for that complete list. Mr. Rubenking also is the author of Startup Cop, an epically useful and free program that handily solves the start-up problem. You can find it at software download sites like www.download.com.  Install and run Startup Cop, and you will see a list of all of your start-up programs. This list might be somewhat cryptic, but that is not Startup Cop's fault -- since it's telling you everything it knows. You might, for example, see only a listing like "sppgm.exe" for one particular program, when what you really would like would be a lengthy description, along the lines of: "This is the start-up program represented by that weird purple icon; all it really does is spy on you and send periodic reports on your activities to wireless-camera makers and home-mortgage refinancers."  It is strongly recommended that in using Startup Cop, you select "Disable," rather than use the other choice Startup Cop gives you, which is "Pack for Removal." The latter removes the reference to the start-up program completely, so you can't undo it. But when you choose "Disable," you can always come back and make the program a start-up program again, should you find you need to. Just go back into Startup Cop and re-enable it, then start Windows again. Especially if you use the "Disable" feature, it's hard to do any damage to Windows using Startup Cop.
