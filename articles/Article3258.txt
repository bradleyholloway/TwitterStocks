 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste: Tony & Tacky   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 2004  The Marrying Kind: That would be Anthony Glenn Owens, now awaiting trial in the Gwinnett County, Ga., jail for what the Atlanta Journal- Constitution describes as wedding "nine women in 12 years without pausing to legally divorce most of them." Mr. Owens told the paper that, contrary to police claims, he is not a con artist at all but a simple preacher trying to replace the mother he lost as a child.
