 Commodities Report: CBOT, Eurex End Joint Venture As Goals and Outlooks Diverge   By By Adam Bradbery, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2002  The original plan had been to develop jointly traded products. But the two sides -- both under new senior executives not involved in the original negotiations -- now regard it as misguided and too restrictive. Eurex will, however, remain a software provider to CBOT, the second-largest US. derivatives market.  The two formed the original 50-50 joint venture, known as alliance/cbot/eurex -- or a/c/e -- in October 1999 to develop electronic trading based on Eurex's existing system. The goal for the CBOT was to obtain a state-of-the-art electronic trading system, while Eurex was to gain exposure to the U.S. market.  Eurex was restricted from offering any U.S. dollar-denominated products, and the CBOT was similarly banned from listing contracts denominated in any European currency.
