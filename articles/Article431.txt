 Retailer Chico's FAS Drops 25%; Fannie Mae and Supervalu Rise   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2006  Chico's FAS saw one-quarter of its market value sliced away, with a plunge of $6.13, or 25%, to $17.95 that made the stock by far the biggest percentage decliner on the New York Stock Exchange. The women's-wear retailer said fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 9.6%, but warned that its August same-store sales are showing a decline of about 3% and that it sees dismal same-store sales for its third quarter. The outlook chilled other clothing retailers, with Nordstrom falling 1.53, or 4.3%, to 34.19, AnnTaylor Stores losing 1.22, or 3.1%, to 38.59 and Urban Outfitters (Nasdaq) dropping 94 cents, or 5.9%, to 15.11.  Coldwater Creek (Nasdaq) was a rare exception, gaining 1.94, or 7.7%, to 27.07. The women's-apparel retailer reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' projection by three cents a share, as revenue jumped 41% to $216.4 million, also beating Wall Street's estimate.  Investors' love/hate relationship with transport stocks continued, with dislike the guiding force yesterday. The Dow Jones Transportation Average saw 18 of its 20 components fall. American Airlines' parent AMR suffered the biggest percentage decline, dropping 54 cents, or 2.7%, to 19.86. Not far behind was rail carrier CSX, losing 76 cents, or 2.5%, to 29.19, and Norfolk Southern, declining 99 cents, or 2.3%, to 41.52. Trucker YRC Worldwide (Nasdaq) lost 73 cents, or 2%, to 35.95.
