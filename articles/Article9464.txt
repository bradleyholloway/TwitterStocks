 House Panel Is Seeking Interview With Stewart   By By Chris Adams, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2002  People familiar with the situation said the assistant to Ms. [Martha Stewart]'s stockbroker has told federal investigators that Ms. Stewart sold the shares after he advised her to -- at the behest of his boss, broker Peter Bacanovic -- because ImClone's then-chief executive officer and members of his family were seeking to sell their stock. The assistant has been cooperating with federal officials investigating possible insider-trading charges against Ms. Stewart and members of the family of former CEO Samuel Waksal.  The congressional committee is asking for Ms. Stewart's e-mail records, telephone records, records relating to Ms. Stewart's business manager, and any other records that she believes could corroborate a June 12 letter from her lawyers that spell out Ms. Stewart's position.  The committee is particularly interested in determining who from Merrill Lynch spoke to Ms. Stewart the day her stock was sold. The committee has a sworn affidavit from Ms. Stewart's personal assistant indicating Mr. Bacanovic placed a call to her between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. that day, and other news reports have indicated the broker's assistant called Ms. Stewart.
