NEW DELHI, Aug. 30â€” M.O. Mathai, a former special assistant to India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has died of a heart attack in Madras. He was 72 years old.  Mr. Mathai, one of the most powerful Indian officials during the Nehru era and later an author, died Friday. He resigned in 1959 following Communist allegations of misuse of power. Mr. Mathai wrote two books that caused controversy, ''Reminiscences of the Nehru Age'' in 1978 and ''My Days With Nehru'' in 1979. In his books he mentioned the attraction of Nehru for several women and wrote critically about Nehru's daughter, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.  Mr. Mathai worked with the United States Army in India before becoming an assistant to Nehru in 1946. Nehru was India's Prime Minister from independence in 1947 until his death in 1964.
