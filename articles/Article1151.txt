 Bush Budget Book Mystery: Agencies Can't Find Page With Program Cuts   By By David Wessel and John E. Yang, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1989  Four days after the Bush administration issued its 193-page budget plan, top-level officials at agencies from the Internal Revenue Service to the Department of Housing and Urban Development are in the dark about just what programs Mr. Bush is willing to cut.  At HUD, a budget officer who asked not to be identified says the department doesn't even know what its total budget for fiscal 1990 would be under the Bush proposal. "I'm trying to produce justifications {of the administration budget} to send to the Congress early in March and I'm constantly revising them," he said. "I'm hoping things will be settled by Friday. If not, I'll blow my brains out."  But the budget office won't list the programs subject to the freeze -- let alone indicate which ones Mr. Bush is willing to sacrifice so that others can be increased at least enough to keep pace with inflation. Departmental budget officials can't even get clues through their informal contacts with budget-office staff.
