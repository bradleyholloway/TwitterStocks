 Style -- Fashion Journal: Rethinking Expensive Clothes; Designer Learns to Appreciate The Value of Cheap Chic; The Cotton Eyelet From China   By Agins, Teri, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2007  Mr. [Patrick Robinson] began working with Target last May, when he sketched out a collection of about 150 pieces -- dresses, skirts, tops, pants, bathing suits, evening dress and handbags and scarves. Inspired by ancient Greek goddesses and the "essence of summer," he had all kinds of ideas for signature prints, with faded medallions and gold coin embellishments. He combed through Target's library of fabrics, and when he didn't find the fabrics he wanted, Target came through three days later with suitable alternatives from its extensive sourcing network in Asia. One cotton eyelet fabric from China, in particular, he says was "as good as what I would get in Italy."  During the design process, Mr. Robinson had just one main point person to report to: Sally Mueller, director, marketing planning. "The fewer merchants that work on it, the better," Ms. [Trish Adams] says. "We don't have 25 people weighing in." Mr. Robinson says the process resembled his experience in traditional fashion houses, where he decided the look of the clothes as well as made major decisions on the look of the advertising.  Now, Mr. Robinson says he is so happy that his collection will reach so many customers, that he is ready to switch the course of his career to design exclusively for the masses. "I won't take another job in the designer market because I just don't believe in it," he says. "It doesn't excite me anymore."
