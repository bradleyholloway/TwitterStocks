 Ahead of the Tape   By Eisinger, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2004  News flash: The Bureau of Labor Statistics is well aware of this and takes it into account. The data may be imprecise but they aren't systematically flawed. One problem is that Wall Street depends too much on the monthly Institute of Supply Management survey, which comes out early and therefore dominates investor views of the month. But as Lehman's Ethan Harris says, the purchasing managers usually answer all the poll questions in the same fashion, even though they have little actual data on current hiring at their own firms. Another problem is Wall Street's dependence on weekly jobless claims. Economists extrapolate that if companies aren't letting people go, they usually are hiring. But clearly that isn't the case.
