 Dean's Rebel Yell   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2003  Georgia Senator Zell Miller is out with a new book describing how his own Democratic Party has told his region of the country to "go to hell." But we doubt even ol' Zell could have imagined this week's Democratic eruption of litmus-test liberalism and political correctness.  Dr. [Howard Dean] noted late last week that he wants "to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags on their pickup trucks." The reference he had been using in his speeches was to guys with "guns" on their pickups, but John Kerry had been giving him grief for that, so he switched to the flag. On Monday we tried to defend Dr. Dean for what was clearly an innocent, if clumsy, reference to the need for Democrats to once again attract white voters in the South.  Then the national Democrats unleashed rebel hell. At Tuesday's MTV debate, Al Sharpton vouchsafed that Dr. Dean may not be "a bigot" (thanks, reverend!) but should nonetheless apologize for being "insensitive." The former Vermont Governor refused, on the plausible ground that he had meant no offense. All of the other candidates and the press corps then started piling on, with forebodings about Dr. Dean's "temperament" and his inability to attract black primary voters.
