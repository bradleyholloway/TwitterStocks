 Port of Boston Faces Challenge From the North   By By Sara Kehaulani Goo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2000  That's where St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad Co. of Auburn, Maine, comes in. The railroad, a subsidiary of Emons Transportation Group, York, Pa., formed its own alliance to connect to railroads serving the Port of Halifax, Nova Scotia. St. Lawrence wants to persuade shipping lines now serving Boston to call on Halifax instead and to distribute goods on its railroad. From Maine, goods would be loaded on trucks to the rest of New England. "We provide a service people want, quicker," says Ed Foley, St. Lawrence's director of sales and marketing.
