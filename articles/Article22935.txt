 Tonight, the Concert Hall Takes Center Stage   By By Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2002  He disappeared backstage, then popped onstage, just alongside the cello section, listening intently before he scurried back to his seat in the near-empty hall. As Mr. [Ronald McKay] listened to the university orchestra perform the overture from Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro," he didn't like what he was hearing. "It didn't have the immediate and intimate sort of sound I wanted," he says. "The hall sounded too large, so I made it smaller." He lowered by four feet an overhead canopy, made of steel and curved, plywood sound reflectors, one of many adjustable, sound-enhancing features in the hall.  The Mondavi Center is expected to be one of the top-sounding performing-arts venues for performers and audiences alike, thanks in large measure to Mr. McKay and his firm, McKay Conant Brook Inc. of Westlake Village, Calif. His influence represents a recent phenomenon and newfound respect for acoustics consultants, at a time when shrinking budgets and the growing popularity of lighter, less expensive building materials has complicated the creation of quality performing-arts centers.
