 Fragile Freedoms: Slovenes Acquire Taste For the Good Life, But Party May Be Over --- These Yugoslavs' Dalliance With Democratic Values Risks Military Crackdown --- Milan Kucan Takes On Serbia   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1988  The masses drive Mercedeses in Slovenia. They burn cordwood in their Alpine weekend chalets, not because they have to but because it's chic. They live closer to Munich (200 miles northwest) than to Belgrade (300 miles southeast), shop for fashions in Austria and Italy, and speak of Yugoslavia's less-developed south as "total Balkan Asia." The electronics company in Slovenia has a subsidiary in Switzerland.  Total Balkan Asia may take Mr. Stanovnik up on that. Communists south of here, sympathetic Croatians excepted, denounce the Slovene Spring as counterrevolution. They say free speech goes too far when it leads to editorial attacks on the Yugoslav army.  While his southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan sparred last March, Mr. Gorbachev took a trip to Yugoslavia. He skipped the south, where ethnics feud, too, and made for Slovenia. Politics didn't concern him. Management did. When told that Slovenia sends 80% of its exports west and only 20% east, he was heard to mumble, "Good boys." Iskra, the electronics company, offered him a red telephone; he chose a white one, and departed seemingly unaware of the ideological storm blowing around him. The Slovenes were bemused.
