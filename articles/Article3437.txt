 The Business of Life; Shifts in Restaurant Industry Alter Tactics for Diners; Getting the VIP Number   By McLaughlin, Katy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  OpenTable sweetens the deal by giving you frequent-diner points when you reserve online, which can later be redeemed for discounts on meals. There is a little-known way to rack up OpenTable points even faster. An employee at OpenTable told us that while the company doesn't advertise this trick, it doesn't mind if you do it this way: Sign up on the Web site as an "administrative assistant." This option was developed for secretaries who book tables for multiple executives, but you can use it to reserve tables for your friends, or you and a friend can always log on to this account when you book.  If you can't get the table you want through OpenTable, try SavvyDiner.com. This is a somewhat less-convenient service because you don't find out immediately whether you got your table. SavvyDiner.com takes your request online, then calls the restaurant and gets back to you. Still, it may be able to get you a table that OpenTable said wasn't available. (OpenTable allows restaurants to "black out" certain tables automatically.)  "We don't do discounts." It's the biggest fib you'll hear at a fancy restaurant these days. In recent years, one of the most significant innovations is the introduction of marketing programs that shave 10% to 30% off your restaurant bill at some restaurants. These programs are designed to eliminate the humiliation inherent in handing over a coupon to your waiter.
