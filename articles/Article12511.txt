 Pirelli Expects New Tire Process to Boost Sales   By By Deborah Ball, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1999  The new technology, called a modular integrated robotized system, or MIRS, is an automated process that allows for high-speed production in an area about one-fifth the size required for traditional tire-making methods, allowing for minifactories to be located next to car manufacturing plants. Through the use of robots and specialized software, Pirelli said it will be able to reduce the steps in manufacturing a tire from 14 to just three, while cutting the lead time from six days to just 72 minutes.  Pirelli plans to open a pilot plant using MIRS next June at its Biccoca plant in Milan. It will follow with a North American rollout of miniplants, each with the capacity of about one million tires a year. Tires make up about half of Pirelli's total sales, and the company is investing about 250 million euros ($251.8 million) over the next five years in MIRS technology.
