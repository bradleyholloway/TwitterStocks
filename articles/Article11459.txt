 Surgeon General Hopes Spring Break Will Be a Bit Drier --- Beer Makers Being Pressed For End to Promotions During College Vacation   By By Hilary Stout and Marj Charlier, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1991  The Surgeon General launched a campaign against college drinking, calling on U.S. beer companies to do their part by halting spring-break promotions.  In a letter to the president of the Beer Institute, Surgeon General Antonia Novello urged companies to refrain from sponsoring "contests, concerts, tents and other promotional activities" in resorts where college students flock for spring vacation.  "Unfortunately, spring break has become synonymous with excessive and binge drinking by our young people," she said at a news conference that she began by showing a videotape of drunken students in Palm Springs, Calif., during spring break three years ago.
