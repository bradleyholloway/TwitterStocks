 How You Can Ensure A Newly Created Job Has Staying Power   By Lublin, Joann S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2007  He liked the idea of taking a job that never existed before. "It was an opportunity for me to help shape this position rather than inherit somebody else's approach," says Mr. [Kim Simon], a 52-year-old with a trim gray beard and boyish grin. His fantasy of trailblazing soon clashed with harsh reality.  Ms. [Lynda C. McDermott], president of consultancy EquiPro International in New York, previously counseled Alexion about team building. She told Mr. Simon to forge personal relationships with key players to gain credibility. "Find out what people want of you and establish your own internal network," she urged.  Not everything went smoothly. A drug-industry consultant handled patient-outreach before Mr. Simon showed up. "Not only was Kim taking work away, but he was the third wheel" in a relationship with Dr. [Paul Finnegan], Ms. McDermott notes. Mr. Simon reassured the adviser that he would get Alexion assignments in other parts of the world.
