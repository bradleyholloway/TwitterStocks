Paul Galasso's cello works were so warm and amiable when the composer performed them Tuesday night at the Dance Theater Workshop with his group Printed Circuit that the sarcasm, textual provocations and rock intonations that went along with many of them created an ''advanced'' feeling that was unusually engaging.  Mr. Galasso, playing an amplified cello, used the familiar repeated cells, Baroque voicings and shifting textures of the pop-minimalistfusion-performance-new-wave style (as it might be called).  But still more traditionally, ''Tainted Paint,'' with its guitar and drum accompaniments, was charmingly Spanish and ''Convict Conjunction'' could have been at home on an old-style dance floor. There wasn't much irony in these altered replicas, just charm and a hint of coy ambitions.  Those ambitions were out in force in excerpts from ''The Guilty Philosopher.'' Over a slightly sardonic accompaniment, Mary Tepper ominously intoned some profundities about the title figure with his books. The patter of the cello and percussion then continued in a passacaglia manner until a ''water apparatus'' was activated; amplified dripping, primitive drumming, and cello glissandos accompanied lyrics with countercultural allusions to research and rationalism - the ''science samurai act'' is heading for a ''deadly embrace.''  A ''beat'' attitude then, was combined with more recent styles, but Mr. Galasso was still a talented original who could iconoclastically give obeissance to what in ''Omni-Wop'' he called the ''weird,'' while still making everything cozy and charming. ''Mock Danger'' with vocals by Pamela Smith was positively sweet. Edward Rothstein
