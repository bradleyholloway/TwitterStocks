 Even if Tobacco Chiefs Did Lie, Perjury Conviction Is Uncertain   By Geyelin, Milo, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1996  "The term ["hands on"] is readily susceptible to countless interpretations," he continued. "It is used generally to connote a wide range of possible levels of involvement."  "Congressional hearings are not always a paradigm of clarity," says Mr. [Stanley Brand]. "That's oftentimes fatal." Nonetheless, some of the more controversial statements and denials made by the tobacco executives came not in response to questions but in the written statements they submitted to Congress. "Philip Morris does not manipulate or independently control the level of nicotine in our products," Mr. [William I. Campbell] wrote under oath, for example. That claim was contradicted in a written statement to the Food and Drug Administration, made public this week, from Philip Morris's former director of applied research, who described in detail Philip Morris's determined effort to find "an acceptable and pharmacologically active nicotine level."  Still, Mr. Campbell's testimony easily falls short of the proof needed for a perjury conviction, says Mr. Brand, unless it can be proved that his statements were, in fact, false, that Mr. Campbell knew they were false and that he intended to mislead his questioners. "I would submit to you that the word `manipulate' is susceptible to the same ambiguity as the words `hands on' in the [Samuel Pierce] case," Mr. Brand says. "It has to be clear and unambiguous statements of fact, not disputes over science or opinion. I just don't see it here."
