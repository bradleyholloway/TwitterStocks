 FDA Says Decongestant's Effectiveness Unclear   By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2007  Earlier this year three professors from the University of Florida in Gainesville petitioned the FDA to increase the effective dose of phenylephrine on the basis that the current 10-milligram dose isn't effective. Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) has also repeatedly asked the FDA to consider the issue. The FDA will convene an advisory panel of outside medical experts to discuss whether the current dose of phenylephrine is effective. The Florida professors said a 25-milligram dose would likely work better, but said additional studies would be required.
