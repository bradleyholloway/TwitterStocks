WOODS HOLE, Mass.â€” The Northeast Fisheries Center Aquarium, one of Cape Cod's major tourist attractions, is to close to the public Sept. 12.  The National Marine Fisheries Service, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and operates the aquarium, moved to close it two years ago.  But the funds were restored with strong backing from Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, and local groups.  The aquarium attracts at least 175,000 seasonal visitors and is said to bring more than $1 million to the economy of Woods Hole and neighboring Falmouth.  But the Reagan Administration budget provides no funds for the aquarium, and it is considered doubtful that Congress will come to the rescue in making its final adjustments on the budget. Touching Living Creatures  The aquarium, consisting of numerous displays and 16 glass tanks that hold 75 to 2,800 gallons of sea water each, along with numerous displays, enables visitors to examine and even touch living examples of the creatures that inhabit local waters. Exhibits include 30 species of fish, ocean invertebrates, a 24-pound lobster and an octopus.  The aquarium also provides research facilities, much of it directed toward studying the various species of fish for their importance as food or game and as a part of the ocean ecosystem.  In addition, the aquarium conducts an educational program that draws students from as far away as New York and New Hampshire to visit the exhibits and attend lectures. More than 3,000 students, most of them of grammar school age, visit the aquarium annually. There is no admission fee.  The 20-year-old aquarium is expected to continue its research and educational programs, according to Richard Hennemuth, laboratory director. He said the space now devoted to the aquarium could make possible an expanded research program.
