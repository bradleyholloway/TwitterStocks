 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Selwyn Feinstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1988  Consultant Towers Perrin says 56 of the 100 largest companies give restricted stock to top executives, up from 44 in 1987 and 35 in 1984. Almost all still award stock options. Options, though, clearly lost much allure when last October's market collapse dramatized the downside risk. Executives can't lose on grants; they pay nothing for the stock. But options become worthless if the market drops below the offering price.  Yet stock grants aren't for all, contends Towers Perrin's David Swinford. While they have less risk, they also have less upside potential because companies typically grant fewer shares than options. Steven Gross of consultant Hay Group says stock grants are best used to retain managers in depressed industries, since restrictions usually require holders to stay with the firm three to five years to keep the shares.  But enough is enough. "I'm not going to saddle myself to a desk" with breakfast or dinner, too, asserts Charles Fries of Fries Entertainment Inc. Elaine Jansen, a manager at Western Digital Corp., walks after lunching in "so I don't feel I've been in the same cubbyhole for hours and hours." Richard Boyle, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp., avoids serious business when eating in with staffers; "I don't want to give people indigestion," he explains.
