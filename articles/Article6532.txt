 Enron Didn't Corrupt Washington   By By Bradley A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2002  While the campaign-finance "reform" lobby frantically waves the bloody shirt of Enron, they can't even agree on why it relates to their pet cause. One version championed by Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) goes like this: Campaign contributions should not buy special favors. When Enron asked for special favors, its request was rejected. However, Enron should have gotten special favors, and the only reason it did not was the administration was afraid to be criticized by Democrats.  The Clinton administration supported the Kyoto global warming treaty, which Enron wanted passed. The Bush administration opposed it. The Clinton administration tended to support Enron when Enron sought greater regulation of markets, and opposed Enron when Enron sought deregulation. The Bush administration did more or less the opposite.  Much of what has come out in the wash with Enron is the intellectual bankruptcy of those who argue for campaign finance reform. In the past few weeks we have been repeatedly told that "more than 250 members of Congress received political contributions from Enron between 1989 and 2001." Well, not quite. Candidates for federal office are barred from taking corporate contributions. The figures reflect individual contributions, in amounts of $1,000 or less, from Enron employees and their families, or from Enron's political action committee, which is funded the same way.
