 Questioning the Books: Enron Memo Shows Watkins Urged Lay To Restate Earnings   By By Tom Hamburger, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  In August, Ms. [Watkins], vice president for corporate development, warned Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a memo and a follow-up meeting about the Houston energy-trading concern's involvement in dubious partnerships that hid company debt and enriched several executives. Mr. Lay responded by ordering an investigation by Vinson & Elkins, an outside law firm that was involved in setting up some of the partnerships -- a step Ms. Watkins had told him was unwise.  The memo urged Mr. Lay to fire Andersen and Vinson & Elkins. Ms. Watkins told House investigators that Mr. Lay agreed to take that step but reversed himself the following day, telling her he had decided to turn the matter over to an internal inquiry, a spokesman for the House committee said. As for restating earnings, Enron did so on Nov. 8, about a month before it filed for bankruptcy-court protection.
