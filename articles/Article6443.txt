 Revolt Topples Deutsche Boerse Chiefs   By Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and David Reilly in London, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2005  The departures followed a concerted campaign, unprecedented in Germany, by rebellious shareholders to unseat the executives after a botched bid by Deutsche Boerse for London Stock Exchange PLC, operator of Europe's biggest stock market. Led by United Kingdom and U.S. fund managers, the campaign to oust Deutsche Boerse's management signaled an end to the days when companies in the world's third-largest economy could rely on docile German investors to support them.  Mr. [Rolf Breuer] could no longer rely on the support of other German banks, and in recent years Deutsche Boerse's shareholder base had switched from German to international investors. That left Mr. Breuer vulnerable when dissident shareholders proposed to remove Deutsche Boerse's supervisory board at the company's annual shareholders meeting later this month. A supervisory board is roughly akin to a U.S. board of directors.  Relations between the company and shareholders soured soon after Mr. [Werner Seifert] announced in mid-December that Deutsche Boerse planned to offer GBP 1.3 billion ($2.46 billion) to buy LSE. TCI and Atticus, which had accumulated large holdings in Deutsche Boerse, said Mr. Seifert was paying too much and that Deutsche Boerse should instead use a cash hoard of about 700 million euros, or roughly $900 million, to buy back its own shares.
