 Pixar Animation Posts Lower Earnings, But Raises Profit Projections for Year   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 2001  The falloff in Pixar's earnings and revenue from its first quarter of last year was expected. Pixar had just released "Toy Story 2," the popular sequel to its earlier hit film, "Toy Story," significantly boosting the company's year-earlier first-quarter earnings and revenue.  For the rest of its fiscal year, Pixar said it was raising its 2001 earnings projection range to 40 cents to 55 cents a share, up from previous guidance of 30 cents to 50 cents a share. Ann Mather, Pixar's chief financial officer, said the company expects earnings of between 10 cents and 13 cents a share in its fiscal second quarter. She attributed the higher full-year earnings projections to the changed timing in network television licensing, among other reasons. For the full year 2000, Pixar posted net income of $1.57 a share.
