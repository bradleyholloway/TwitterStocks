 Bill to Speed Check Clearing Voted by Panel   By By John E. Yang, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1987  The House Banking Committee approved legislation that would limit the time financial institutions may hold deposited checks before making the funds available.  The amendment, adopted on a voice vote, represented a compromise between Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.), chairman of the committee and sponsor of the measure, and Rep. Thomas Carper (D., Del.). Rep. Carper had successfully sponsored an amendment making the limits slightly longer than Rep. St Germain had wanted when a subcommittee considered the bill in February.
