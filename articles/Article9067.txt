 Small-Stock Focus: Nasdaq Edges Higher in Actively Traded Session; Allied Holdings, Novel Denim Holdings Plummet   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1999  The exception was the overall Nasdaq Stock Market, which edged higher in an actively traded session. The gains, while slim, were ample enough to push the Nasdaq Composite Index to its second straight record close.  The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 1.21, or 0.30%, to 401.08, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, at 2563.17, rose 3.11, or 0.12%.  Novel Denim Holdings, a Hong Kong supplier of denim and chino garments and fabric, dropped 2 13/16, or 29%, to a 52-week low of 6 15/16 after saying its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings will fall short of analysts' projections. Novel said that a cyclone in Mauritius, a tropical volcanic island about 2,000 miles northeast of South Africa in the Indian Ocean, disrupted production, and that it expects a drought to hurt fiscal 2000 results.
