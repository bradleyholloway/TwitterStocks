 Bush Shifts to Senior Posts at Cabinet Agencies   By By Bob Davis and Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2001  Turning his attention to subcabinet positions, President-elect George W. Bush is planning to name former State Department official Kenneth Dam as deputy treasury secretary, while former Pentagon official Paul Wolfowitz has emerged as the leading contender for deputy defense chief, Bush advisers said.  Both men fit what has become the standard Bush administration profile: They have experience in Republican administrations and links to other top officials in Mr. Bush's cabinet. The 68-year-old Mr. Dam, currently a University of Chicago law professor, has long ties to Treasury Secretary-nominee Paul O'Neill, who recruited Mr. Dam as a director of Alcoa Corp., when Mr. O'Neill was chief executive of the aluminum company. Mr. Wolfowitz was an aide to Vice President-elect Dick Cheney when Mr. Cheney served as defense secretary in the administration of President-elect Bush's father.  Washington lawyer David Aufhauser, of the firm of Williams & Connolly, is set to be named general counsel at Treasury, the department's top lawyer and a senior adviser to the secretary, said two senior Bush advisers. A specialist in securities and tax litigation, Mr. Aufhauser worked for the Bush election team during the Florida recount, where he monitored the tally of overseas ballots.
