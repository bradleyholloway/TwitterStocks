 HEALTH COSTS   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1989  Not surprisingly, the promotional offer has angered at least one major insurer. Prudential Insurance Co. protested the practice in a letter to hospitals, saying it undermines efforts to promote cost-effective use of health services by asking patients to bear some of their medical expenses.  It also threatens to siphon patients from a preferred provider network Prudential has set up. The network of hospitals and doctors provides lower-cost service in return for getting a certain volume of patients; consumers pay a deductible and part of each bill.  Some doctors tell patients seeking treatment at network hospitals that other hospitals would accept the insurance share as full payment, says Vincent Contorno, a Prudential vice president.
