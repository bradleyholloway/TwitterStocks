 To Have and to Hold, Cheaply --- Saudi Crown Prince Moves to Rein In Lavish Royal Weddings   By By Simeon Kerr, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2002  Saudi Arabia's strict brand of Islam bans many forms of public entertainment, but wedding receptions are private affairs. They are also a primary battlefield for royal one-upsmanship. One family imported Italian-designed furniture for a wedding, then destroyed to ensure that no one else would sit on it. Costs skyrocket when families hire top Arab performers, such as Emirati singer Ahlam or the all-female drum troupes and bellydancers who entertain the more lively women's gatherings of the sex-segregated receptions. Saudi superstar Mohammed Abou is sometimes commissioned to record songs dedicated to the happy couple, and the tapes are distributed to guests. The lavish dinners are often prepared by the country's top chefs, especially those from Riyadh's premier hotel, the Faisaliyah, who cater to thousands of guests at a base price of $500 a head. While most diplomats say the economy has yet to deteriorate to the point where royal overindulgence would prompt political unrest, [Abdullah] apparently sees the writing on the wall. The prince says Abdullah wants close relatives of the king to use the more-egalitarian location -- where the only personal flourish allowed will be the thrones for the bride and groom -- to set an example for more lowly royals.
