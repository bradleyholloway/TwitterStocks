 Half a Millennium in the Middle Kingdom   By Gurewitsch, Matthew, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2004  The pleasure is greatest where the objects speak for themselves. The bronze chariots and guards on horseback, about one-third life-size, marching across a tabletop in stately parade in the first room will slow down any but the most distracted visitor; so will the bold, stylized curves of a nearby stone chimera. There are golden trinkets of exquisite delicacy, and rough-hewn little wooden geese (attended by a large moody monkey, also wood) aptly described in the catalog as "minimalist." A seated bodhisattva in the so-called pensive pose -- with pieces of arm missing but with gilt and pigment intact -- distills Buddhist doctrine at its most gracious.  Earlier assemblages of Chinese treasures have accustomed us to jades and silks. We see less of such things here; anyone hoping simply to bask in the luster of precious objects is apt to be disappointed. The materials are often humble; several important carvings are represented by the makeshift of rubbings. But the energy of a thought need not dwell in the stuff in which it is expressed. Like just about every other institution with a major Chinese collection, the Met owns a pair of Tang dynasty tomb guardians executed in costly three-color-glazed ceramic. These old favorites are excluded from "China: Dawn of a Golden Era," which instead features these fierce watchdogs of the dead in painted wood: more unusual, less lordly -- and explosive to the max.
