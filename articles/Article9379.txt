 Pork Barrel at Ground Zero   By By Steven Malanga, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2001  Private hospitals are the first big New York industry to seek a handout from Washington, and already a predictable pattern is emerging. Gov. George Pataki set the tone last month when he asked Washington for an eye-popping $54 billion for New York State, including billions for dubious projects unrelated to Sept. 11. The hospitals' plan smacks of similar opportunism. More than 60% of the "losses" they claim have not occurred yet and have little to do with the terror attacks. Both requests are typical of New York's entitlement culture, which knows little about fiscal restraint and expects all misfortune to be solved with taxpayers' money.  Gov. Pataki's state bailout plan takes the most chutzpah. Beyond the $20 billion in clean-up and reconstruction the federal government has earmarked for New York, Mr. Pataki called for a host of goodies, including $12 billion to replace state and local tax revenues likely to be lost in New York's economic slowdown. This money would prop up what is already one of America's fattest state budgets, nourished by the country's highest state and local taxes. Never one to lead by example on fiscal matters, after handing this bill to the federal government, Albany's legislative leaders finished off a new state budget that increases spending by 5.5%, or about $4.5 billion.  The entreaties of the hospitals and New York State stand in sharp contrast to the approach taken by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. On the same day Gov. Pataki requested the $54 billion, Mayor Giuliani vowed to cut $1 billion out of his budget, a move that sent an embarrassed Mr. Pataki scrambling a few days later to impose a state hiring freeze. Asked what Washington could do to help the city, Mr. Giuliani has lobbied for a federal tax cut that would allow New Yorkers to keep more of their own money.
