 TEXAS JOURNAL --- Houston Design Firm Is Regional Rarity   By By Laura Johannes, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1994  Despite its low profile and small size, closely held CMA -- formerly Creative Marketing Associates -- claims to be the biggest firm specializing in food packaging in the Southwest. Several Texas design firms do some food packaging, including Richards Group in Dallas and Hixo Inc. in Austin, but most big design firms are based in New York, Chicago or California.  But CMA, which doesn't advertise, make sales calls or bid on jobs, doesn't seem hurt by its Texas location. Its billings jumped 35% last year to $3.5 million, says Mr. Sawyer, who left a job as manager of creative services at Coca-Cola Co.'s Houston-based food division nine years ago to start his own company.  Nearly all of CMA's business comes through word-of-mouth and industry connections, including those Mr. Sawyer made at Coca-Cola Foods. Frank Blod, a former vice president of marketing at the Coca-Cola unit, now is a principal at the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn., and refers some of his clients to CMA. He recently referred a small food company looking to hire some design talent on a modest budget.
