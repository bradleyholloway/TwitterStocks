 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Axing Farm Exports   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1985  Farm-state legislators have been in a state of near hysteria lately over the the U.S. trade imbalance, the plight of farmer-debtors and the troubles of country banks. Yet it is within their power to relieve all three maladies, simply by changing federal laws.  As a warm-up exercise, here's a small test of seriousness: Congress could vote to repeal the Cargo Preference Act, which says the U.S. must ship half its food aid abroad in U.S. vessels, at substantial costs imposed by the maritime industry and unions. A federal court has just blocked the U.S. Department of Agriculture from ducking cargo preference on grain shipments that are outside the usual aid programs but carry federal credit subsidies. These latter sales involve competitive markets. Thus, the court effectively stalled a half-billion dollars in U.S. grain shipments. Congress has never had a better opportunity to rid the U.S. of the cargo-preference curse and thereby hand farmers a whopping victory.  That task, though useful, however should not stand in the way of still more important business, passage of President Reagan's Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1985. With the expiration this year of the hoary 1933 New Deal farm act -- along with the incredibly unwise price-support amendments passed in 1981 -- Congress has a marvelous chance to put American farmers back on an equal footing with their competitors in international trade. The 1981 price supports were so high they priced American farmers out of important markets. Mr. Reagan's bill would begin lowering prices to the world market level.
