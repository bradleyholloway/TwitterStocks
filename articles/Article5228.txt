 Dollar Soars, Lifts Bonds; Stocks Slip --- Defying Intervention, U.S. Unit Reaches Six-Month Highs   By By Michael R. Sesit and Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1991  Up nearly 10% in the past four weeks, the dollar yesterday posted further solid gains against both the mark and the yen. The dollar's vigorous rise contributed to a surge in bond prices; the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond gained nearly one point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount. But stock traders took profits, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15.84 to 2939.36 in active trading.  The dollar's climb began in Far Eastern markets, and shortly after trading began in Europe the central banks of Germany and other European nations quickly began selling. Traders described the intervention as a concerted attempt to stem the U.S. currency's climb. Later in New York, a second round was led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
