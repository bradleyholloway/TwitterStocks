 J&J Wins Stent Patent Appeal Against Boston Scientific   By Winstein, Keith J, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2009  The Washington, D.C., court, which handles patent-related cases, said Boston Scientific's patent wasn't innovative enough and was invalid in light of a 1996 patent on coated stents held by rival Medtronic Inc. That removed an avenue by which Boston Scientific may have cut its legal exposure to J&J. In another case brought by J&J in the same court, Boston Scientific is appealing a $703 million judgment against it, after a jury found several of Boston Scientific's stents infringed patents held by J&J. Boston Scientific will have to pay the judgment if it loses its appeal.
