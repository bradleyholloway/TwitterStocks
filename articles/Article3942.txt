 Barclays ETFs Defect From Amex; NYSE, Archipelago to Get Listings for 81 Products, In Blow to Rival Exchange   By Gaston F. Ceron and Jen Ryan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2005  "This, if nothing else, is a huge image blow to the Amex because the Amex had traditionally been the place for ETFs," said James Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University and a former visiting academic at the National Association of Securities Dealers regulatory body. "It's going to raise a lot of questions as to what's going on here."  Cliff Weber, senior vice president of the Amex's ETF Marketplace, said the exchange will "continue to trade [iShares] even as they move the listings, just as the other exchanges have traded our products as we've listed them." Mr. Weber said the Amex has other ETF products in the pipeline, which may help lessen the blow of BGI's defection.  Lisa Dallmer, an executive at Archipelago, said the Chicago company began courting ETF issuers in earnest last summer. Although Archipelago trades ETFs, it doesn't list any of them, so BGI's decision to move 20 products there "is really great," she said. "We're hoping to capture more of the order flow as a result of being the primary listing."
