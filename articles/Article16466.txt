 SmartMoney: Small Stocks, Big Promise   By Hough, Jack, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2004  The 11 firms found by our recent small-cap screen have low debt, rising profit estimates and a history of beating estimates lately. All are projectedto boost earnings at least 15% annually over five years and have average analyst ratings of "buy" or "strong buy." Smart investors use screens as a starting point for research.  Today, Ixia's stock-market value is more than $900 million. It has $81 million in cash and no debt. Sales and profit growth have been strong lately. Trailing 12-month sales for Ixia -- the name, by the way, comes from a "South African bulbous plant of the Iris family, remarkable for the brilliancy of its flowers," according to Webster's -- total $105 million. And this figure is projected to top $115 million for all of 2004, and $140 million in 2005. That's a marked acceleration from the company's three-year average sales-growth rate of 8%.
