 What About Hillary's Role in the Pardons?   By By James B. Stewart, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2001  Like all sequels, the plot sticks close to the original script. No one even passingly familiar with Whitewater should be surprised by the Clintons' behavior during the past months. The Whitewater investment, not to mention [Hillary Clinton]'s subsequent speculation in cattle futures, suggested a keen interest in money, an indifference to ethical standards, and, most revealing, a sense of entitlement that is entirely consistent with the Clintons' willingness to help themselves to a White House sofa or two.  The money trail also leads to Hillary. Hillary raised $29 million for her New York senatorial race, some of it from [Denise Rich] and pardoned insider trader Edward Downe Jr. Ms. Rich is a prominent Democratic fundraiser and Hillary was a major beneficiary of party fundraising efforts. Ms. Rich also gave Hillary some furniture (since reimbursed). [Bill] may need $200 million for a library in Little Rock, but no one knows better than he that Hillary will need untold millions more should she mount her own presidential bid, as many expect she will despite her recent denials. Were future contributions to Hillary's campaigns a subtext of any pardon conversations?  President Bush and the Justice Department show scant interest in investigating yet another Clinton scandal that with each passing day steals more of the spotlight from the new administration. Congressional Democrats, suddenly willing to distance themselves from an ex-president, show no such inclination towards a fellow senator, who now wields enormous power in her own right. But if the truth is ever to be known, someone accountable to the public will have to investigate Hillary Clinton's role in the pardons and tell us the results.
