 Californians Await Draft Order on Power Rates   By By John R. Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2001  The FERC filing came in response to a petition filed with the court last week by Southern California Edison, which asserted that FERC hadn't done enough to rein in wholesale power costs. Edison has asked the court to direct FERC to order lower wholesale power prices and possible refunds from electricity suppliers.  FERC has taken some steps to address California's electricity problems. Last month, the commission ordered prices capped, on an interim basis, at $150 a megawatt hour, though it allowed higher prices if suppliers could demonstrate higher production costs. FERC also ordered California utilities to move 95% of their power procurement out of the spot market.
