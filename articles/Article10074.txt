 Chrysler Signals Drive by Hiring Toyota Executive   By Gina Chon and Neal E. Boudette, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2007  Chrysler's hiring of Jim Press, which comes just a few weeks after Cerberus Capital Management LP picked former Home Depot Inc. Chief Executive Robert Nardelli to be the auto maker's CEO, also suggests that Cerberus is determined to accelerate Chrysler's overhaul, partly by spending freely on executive talent.  The recent credit crunch has also had an impact. Cerberus's banks -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group, Bear Stearns Cos. and Morgan Stanley -- recently tried to raise $20 billion from investors to help finance Chrysler's continuing operations. But the banks were forced to keep $10 billion of that debt on their books as investors balked at the loan sale amid the gathering turmoil in financial markets. Cerberus and Chrysler's former parent, DaimlerChrysler AG, together took on an additional $2 billion in debt in connection with the buyout.  In hiring Mr. Press, Mr. Nardelli and Cerberus, which owns 80.1% of Chrysler, have landed one of the auto industry's most respected leaders. He brings knowledge gained during 37 years at Toyota's U.S. operations, mostly in the sales arm. His strong reputation among auto dealers is likely to be a major asset as Chrysler begins to scale back its dealer network and overhaul its sales and marketing strategy.
