 Enron Justice   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  The plea, which includes a pledge of cooperation in the probe of Enron higher-ups, is a huge break for the government's case. Mr. [Andrew Fastow] was the architect of Enron's "special-purpose entities," the arcane investment vehicles that he now admits were at the heart of a "conspiracy" to commit fraud. If there is any evidence to be had about the complicity of former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay, the 42-year-old Mr. Fastow is likely to have it.  Perhaps Mr. Fastow also concluded that just about any jury of his peers was likely to find him guilty. Enron was hardly a victimless crime, since it prompted what at the time was the largest bankruptcy in American history. Thousands of people lost their jobs, their life savings, or both. As Mr. Fastow admitted as part of his plea, "I also engaged in schemes to enrich myself and others at the expense of Enron's shareholders and in violation of my duty of honest services to those shareholders."
