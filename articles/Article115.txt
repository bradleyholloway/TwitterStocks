LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16â€” Leonard Goldberg, a longtime television executive and producer, was named president and chief operating officer of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation today.  Mr. Goldberg, 52 years old, will be in charge of Fox's movie and television production, distribution and marketing and will also oversee the company's home video and television syndication operations. The announcement was made by Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Inc.  The post of president has been vacant since the resignation of Alan Horn last September. Mr. Goldberg will assume his new duties Dec. 1.  Mr. Goldberg - who is best known as the co-producer with Aaron Spelling of such successful ABC series as ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''Hart to Hart'' and ''Fantasy Island'' - had previously worked his way up through various jobs at ABC from 1963 to 1969. When he was an ABC vice president, Mr. Goldberg gave Mr. Diller, who was then a young talent agent, his first job in television. Together, the two men initiated the idea of original weekly movies made for television.  ''I've always wanted to run a movie studio,'' Mr. Goldberg said today. ''I've done almost everything else in this business.''  Mr. Goldberg, who grew up in Brooklyn and went to New Utrecht High School, received a B.S. in economics in 1955 from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has been president of Screen Gems, a television production company, and worked as an independent movie producer. His films include last summer's ''Space Camp,'' a box-office failure, and a 1983 hit, ''War Games.''  Mr. Goldberg is assuming a position that was vacated Sept. 1 by Mr. Horn, who lasted less than a year. When Mr. Horn departed, both he and Mr. Diller said they had different views of the responsibilities of the job. It is known that Mr. Diller had approached Mr. Goldberg before hiring Mr. Horn, but Mr. Goldberg was not interested at that time.  Mr. Horn was the second high-ranking executive to leave Fox this year. Lawrence Gordon, the president of 20th Century-Fox Entertainment Group, a subsidiary, resigned in January. He cited health problems, but disputes with Mr. Diller were believed in the industry to have been a factor in the departure.  Mr. Goldberg said today that he was particularly excited to be joining Fox. ''There are no layers of management,'' he said, ''only Barry Diller and Rupert Murdoch, who owns the company.''
