 Callaway to Reduce Work Force by 24%, Focus on Golf Clubs   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1998  Callaway Golf Co. said it will lay off 700 employees, or 24% of its work force, as it refocuses on its core business of making premium golf clubs.  The shake-up follows the October return of Ely Callaway, the 79-year-old founder of the company, to the post of chief executive after a 2 1/2 -year absence. Mr. Callaway, who never relinquished his chairman's title, said changing market conditions have convinced him to curtail the recent expansion into ancillary lines.  Callaway's back-to-basics moves include bringing its Odyssey Golf subsidiary into the parent company while maintaining a separate brand, and discontinuing such ventures as golf-book publishing, driving ranges and interactive-golf sites.
