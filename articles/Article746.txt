 Domenici Unveils 3-Year Budget Plan That Would Slash Defense, Add Taxes   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1986  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici proposed a three-year plan that would cut more than $81 billion from President Reagan's defense buildup and add $70.3 billion in taxes to meet Gramm-Rudman deficit targets through 1989.  For fiscal 1987, the proposal would trim more than $21 billion from the Pentagon's budget and generally substitute a freeze on domestic programs for the deep cuts sought by the Reagan administration. The plan assumes new revenues of $16.2 billion next year to help meet the $144 billion deficit target. By fiscal 1989, the plan envisions reducing the deficit to $69.3 billion, or less than one-third of last year's level.  New defense budget authority for fiscal 1987, which begins Oct. 1, would be $299 billion, a significant reduction from what Mr. Domenici sought earlier. But that is still $12 billion over current appropriations and well above what most Democrats on the panel are willing to accept.
