 Leading the News -- A Global Journal Report: Bush Is Open to New Iraq Resolution --- President Makes Clear He Won't Wait Long For U.N. to Take Action   By By Jeanne Cummings in Washington, Alessandra Galloni in Milan and Carlta Vizthum in Madrid, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2003  U.S. officials have said privately for several weeks that Mr. [Bush] would back a second resolution only if he could be certain it would pass. That seemed very much up in the air yesterday; few nations appeared to change their view on whether to move toward a military confrontation after Secretary of State Colin Powell's detailed arguments Wednesday to the U.N. Mr. Bush's remarks came after the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector challenged a part of Mr. Powell's presentation: the charge Iraq is hiding vast quantities of forbidden weapons.  The [Vladimir Putin] campaign began late last week in an Oval Office meeting with Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi. Mr. Bush stressed how committed he is to disarming Iraq -- and to winning Russia's backing. On Saturday, he said much the same to Mr. Putin in a telephone call. Two days later, Mr. Berlusconi met with Mr. Putin in Moscow, and reinforced the American's message. A few hours later, Britain's Mr. [Tony Blair] added to the chorus in a telephone conference call with Mr. Putin and Mr. Berlusconi. And on Wednesday, Mr. Bush rounded out discussions with another phone call to Mr. Putin.  During an hourlong dinner on Monday night, the president reassured Bahrain's king that if there is a war, the U.S. will move quickly to help the Iraqi people -- and cut down on the number refugees pouring into the region. According to an official at the dinner, Mr. Bush said the U.S. will use the U.N.'s current aid distribution centers in Iraq. "We know what streets they are on. We know exactly how to get the food out to the people," Mr. Bush said.
