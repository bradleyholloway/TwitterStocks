 Chevron Taps Into China's Energy Output With Pact to Develop PetroChina Gas Field   By Winning, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2007  Isikeli Taureka, Chevron's China manager, said he couldn't comment about his company's bid. PetroChina spokesman Zhang Anping declined to comment.  PetroChina issued a tender for the development of the Luojiazhai field in December. Luojiazhai has proven reserves of 2.03 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and a sulfur content of between 7.13% and 10.49%, Ma Xinhua, vice president of PetroChina's exploration-and- production company, told an industry forum in September. Any field with a sulfur content of more than 2% is classified as high sulfur.  Luojiazhai will be PetroChina's third natural-gas field jointly developed with a foreign company. Last year, it signed a contract with Total for the joint exploration and production of gas in the Sulige field in the Ordos Basin in northern China's Inner Mongolia region. PetroChina also has signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell to jointly explore the Changbei field in the Ordos Basin.
