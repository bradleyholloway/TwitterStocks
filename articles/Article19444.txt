 Shares Multiply, As Do Chances For Dilution At Tech Firms   By By Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  Besides JDS, prolific issuers include telecom company WorldCom, whose shares outstanding reached more than 2.9 billion in the second quarter, up more than 50% from about 1.9 billion in 1998 when WorldCom completed its acquisition of MCI Communications for $38 billion, mostly in shares. Aside from the WorldCom Group shares outstanding, a further 116 million shares are attributable to WorldCom's MCI operations, which now trade as a separate tracking stock.  "Yes, we have more shares outstanding, but we also have what I believe is a much stronger company, albeit a smaller company these days," says JDS Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Anthony Muller. Each of JDS's major acquisitions "remains today a very important part of the company with significant amounts of sales and earnings power," he says. JDS has about $1.8 billion in cash, but has no plans for a major stock buyback to reduce its shares outstanding, since that would "weaken our financial condition," he adds.  At Nortel, the acquisition spree included the purchase of numerous companies with little or no revenue or earnings, as the company focused on buying promising technology. Since the start of this year Nortel has slashed 30,000 jobs and closed businesses, including one that Nortel acquired in early 2000 for $778 million of stock. At the start of this year Nortel thought it was on track to reaching nearly $40 billion in annual revenue. Instead, at the current rate it will post less than half that amount of revenue for this calendar year, and the bottom line is bleeding.
