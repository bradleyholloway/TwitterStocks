 Chinese Trader Of Copper Missing After Going Short   By Hotter, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2005  Mr. [Liu Qibing], who couldn't be reached at his office at the State Reserve Bureau in Beijing, hasn't been at work for weeks, colleagues at his office said. Traders on the London Metal Exchange who have dealt with Mr. Liu in the past said they haven't heard from him for "many weeks." Some people familiar with Mr. Liu said he was removed from his job weeks ago.  Compounding the confusion, the bureau denies it has an employee with that name. Though London metal traders have Mr. Liu's business card, Wang Huimin, director of the bureau's Materials Management Center, denied knowledge of such a trader or of a London short copper position. "I've never heard of this person," he said. "Neither have I ever heard anything about the SRB selling short in London. I'm not clear if he is our staff. The SRB has no traders."
