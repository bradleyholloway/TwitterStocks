 Letters to the Editor: The Illogical Iraqi WMD Kerfuffle   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2004  In his Feb. 2 commentary "'Kay' Sera Sera," James Woolsey brings logic back into the discussion of WMD, and remind us of recent history, given our short-term memories. Even David Kay, who until recently provided a thoughtful approach to discussion of the search for WMD, suddenly threw logic to the wind by determining that the WMD must not exist simply because he, like others, couldn't find a needle in a country full of haystacks.  In other words, our intelligence about Iraq's WMD capability was no worse than [Saddam Hussein]'s own: we "knew" what Saddam and his generals "knew."
