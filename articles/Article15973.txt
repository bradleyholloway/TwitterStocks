 Republicans Reach Deal on Legislation On Drug Importing   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2000  The agreement among Republicans followed talks involving House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Rep. Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri and Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The latter two lawmakers have championed the drug-import bill.  Under the agreement reached by the Republicans, the provision would be based mainly on legislation authored by Sen. Jeffords and approved by the Senate last summer. It would allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are made in FDA-certified facilities.
