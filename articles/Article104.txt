The North American Soccer League reverted to the 35-yard line as its offside marker and restored its three-substitutions rule last night after the United States Soccer Federation received permission from F.I.F.A., the international federation.  Under a directive from F.I.F.A., the league opened its season 14 days ago using the midfield line for offsides and limiting game substitutions to two players a team, in accordance with international rules.  In New York, Phil Woosnam, commissioner of the North American league, said the league would abide next season by whatever rules the international federation decides to impose.
