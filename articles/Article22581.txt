 Abbott to Pay $100 Million In Fine to U.S.   By By Thomas M. Burton, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  The news drove Abbott's shares lower. At 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, Abbott closed at $37.5625, down $2.75, a decline of 6.8%. Abbott said the charge will result in a downward adjustment in its previously announced third-quarter results.  The test kits at issue, manufactured at Abbott's main medical-diagnostics facility in Lake County, Ill., north of Chicago, are used to test samples of patients' blood, urine and other bodily fluids. Some of the tests that will be pulled off the market, when the agreement takes effect, include tests for vitamin B12, folate and ferritin in patients with anemia, and other tests for the presence of therapeutic drugs in the blood. For the laboratories and doctors' offices that use these tests kits, plenty of competing options exist.  Abbott's most important diagnostic test kits, such as those for HIV, hepatitis, prostate and colon cancer, will stay on the market. In most cases, this was because Abbott, the world leader in medical diagnostics, is the sole or primary supplier of those 175 products that won't be affected. Nevertheless, Abbott faces increasingly intense competition from companies such as Germany's Bayer AG to supply medical laboratories and doctors' offices with these kits and the machines used with them.
