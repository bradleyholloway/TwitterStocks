 U.S. Convinced Soviets Want Summit in '86 --- But No Firm Date Set Yet; Libya Is Singled Out In Tokyo Communique   By By Jane Mayer, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1986  The Reagan administration no longer doubts that there will be an arms-control summit between the Soviet Union and the U.S. this year, according to a senior White House official attending the Tokyo economic summit.  Plans for the U.S.-Soviet summit were upended following the April 14 U.S. air strike on Libya. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev denounced the action as "criminal" bombardment and promptly canceled a planning session for the summit that was to have been held in May between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George Shultz.  The reason for the administration's new certainty is a message that Leonid M. Zamyatin, the newly appointed Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, sent last weekend to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. While Britain hasn't released the full contents of the message, the senior White House official made clear that the message signaled a Soviet willingness to hold a summit this year. "This guy (Mr. Gorbachev) has just said again that he's coming," said the White House official. "He used a high-priced messenger, but he's coming."
