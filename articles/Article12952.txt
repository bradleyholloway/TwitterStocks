 Carnage in Jakarta   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2003  Yesterday's bombing at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta offers an important lesson about fighting al Qaeda world-wide: It won't happen through law enforcement alone. If, as is expected, the investigation shows that the blast was the work of Jemaah Islamiyah -- the al Qaeda- affiliated group responsible for October's Bali bombing -- it will reinforce the fact that law enforcement must go hand in hand with education reform. Governments in Islamic countries can't delay taking action against those who are spreading messages of hate among their young people.
