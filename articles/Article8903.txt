 What Drives Politics   By By Richard Miniter, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1997  ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Reporters, pundits and political opponents derided Jim Gilmore's "No Car Tax!" slogan as "simplistic." But on Tuesday Mr. Gilmore was overwhelmingly elected governor of Virginia, leading an unprecedented Republican sweep of statewide offices. Meanwhile in New Jersey, the little-known mayor of Woodbridge almost upset GOP Gov. Christine Todd Whitman by promising to trim the cost of nation's most expensive auto insurance.  Virginia's unusual personal property tax, which amounts to a direct assessment on car ownership, proved decisive in a race that otherwise seemed evenly matched. Mr. Gilmore, a former state attorney general, and the man he beat, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer, are both political veterans, well known to voters. Both are in the ideological mainstream; neither is an electrifying speaker. They raised roughly equal sums of money. But Mr. Beyer -- who, ironically enough, owns Volvo and Land Rover dealerships -- opposed cutting the car tax. He tried every issue that usually drives voters away from Republicans: abortion, education, ties to the tobacco industry and the religious right. Yet Mr. Gilmore's statewide victory margin was a stunning 56% to 43%.
