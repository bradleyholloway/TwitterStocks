 Additional Reader For Mammograms Is Urged by Study   By Sara Schaefer Munoz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 2004  Physician assistants shouldn't be solely responsible for interpreting the mammograms but should prescreen or double-read mammograms, the study said. That would provide a more thorough examination than is typical at most mammography facilities and expand their capacities, it added.  Nevertheless, the American College of Radiology, a Reston, Va., group representing radiologists, said it opposes the use of physician assistants because it doesn't safely increase access to mammography. "We should not lower the bar so that women have a perception of increased access only to find that the access is to inferior care," said James Borgstede, the ACR's board of chancellors' chairman. The practice could also lead to higher rates of malpractice insurance, ACR said.
