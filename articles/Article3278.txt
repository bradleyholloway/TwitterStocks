 What Happened to Asia's Great Fire Sale? --- Most U.S. Firms Return Empty-Handed After Scouring Region   By By Robert Frank, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2000  As the Asia president of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Mr. [Ted] Teng was to comb through the rubble of the financial crisis and buy a few good hotels. He traveled to Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand and looked at more than 50 properties. Now, sitting in his office in Singapore about to board another flight, Mr. Teng tallies his purchases.  Mr. Teng's tale of woe is shared by dozens of U.S. companies that came to Asia looking for bargains. Sales in Japan, which has been in and out of economic crisis for almost 10 years, have been plentiful. But the rest of Asia, which suffered a sharper financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, hasn't been so deal friendly. Though some notable acquisitions did occur, after two years of scouring the region for deals, the horde of merger-and-acquisition specialists who arrived in South Korea, China, and Southeast Asia in 1998 have largely gone home with empty bags.  Asian sellers, meanwhile, say Americans don't appreciate the value of the assets. They argue that growth is resuming in the region, and they shouldn't give away vital assets to foreigners simply because of a short-term crunch. Nationalism is a big factor: Asian governments, such as South Korea and Thailand, have backed out of several privatization deals after voters accused the government of pandering to the U.S. There is still an underlying fear in the region that the West instigated the financial crisis to try to recolonize Asia -- largely through corporate acquisitions.
