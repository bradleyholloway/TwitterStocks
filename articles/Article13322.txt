 Big Banks On Campus; Looking to Lure Lifelong Clients, Firms Dangle Plane Tickets, iPods; Worry Over Credit-Card Debt   By Kim, Jane J, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2006  Consequently, banks' campus handouts are a far cry from the free- pen-and-T-shirt fare they have traditionally given to new student customers. For opening a new checking account, KeyCorp's KeyBank is giving away a free iPod shuffle music player, and Chase, a unit of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., is offering a dozen 12-packs of Coca-Cola. Bank of America Corp. will pay $50 to students who open accounts online, and Sovereign Bancorp Inc.'s Sovereign Bank is dangling free airline tickets.  "Young adults tend to be very loyal to their first card," says Ed Stolbof, senior vice president of marketing for Morgan Stanley's Discover Financial Services LLC. "It's really important to get to card members as soon as we can in their credit life cycle."  Since parents often influence where their kids bank, firms are offering incentives if both have accounts at the same bank. Chase will waive a $10 monthly service fee and provide free online bill paying on a student checking account if it is linked to a parent's account at the bank. Under Wachovia's "College Connections" program, students get 12 free out-of-network ATM transactions each month if their checking account is linked to a parent's account at the bank.
