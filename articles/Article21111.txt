 Japan's Joblessness And Trade Surplus Decreased in June --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1987  The prime minister's office said Friday that Japanese unemployment averaged a record 3.1% of the labor force in 1987's first half but that the figure in June alone fell to a seasonally adjusted 3% from 3.2% in May, which was a monthly record. Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry said that the surplus on the current account, which is the broadest measure of the nation's trade, declined further in June.  For some time, the unemployment and trade figures have been illustrating the impact that the yen's strength has had on Japan's economy. On the one hand, the jobless rate, although low by the standards of many other industrialized nations, had risen to unprecedented levels for Japan as the strong currency raised the cost of exports, eroding manufacturers' sales and earnings and causing them to curb production and employment.
