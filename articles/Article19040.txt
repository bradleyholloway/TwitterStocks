 IPO Outlook: Caliber Learning Is Cited As One of Week's Promising Offerings   By By Dunstan Prial, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1998  In a market devoid of potential Internet blockbusters or deals from safe, well-established companies, IPO followers are watching an offering from Caliber Learning Network Inc. The Baltimore company plans to one day offer graduate-level courses from prestigious universities through a network of video-conferencing centers scattered across the country.  Ten diverse deals are expected to raise $996 million this week, according to MCM CorporateWatch. Eleven deals raised $2.25 billion last week.  Smaller deals such as Caliber Learning will dominate the coming calendar, in contrast to last week when three deals alone raised nearly $2 billion.
