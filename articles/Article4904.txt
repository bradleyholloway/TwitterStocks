 Sun Electric Says Group Misled SEC On Stake in Firm   By By Francine Schwadel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1988  Sun Electric Corp. sued a group of investors that has expressed an interest in acquiring Sun, claiming the investors made "false and misleading" statements concerning their Sun stake in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Martin Cohen, a New York investor and member of the group, said in an interview that the group prefers to negotiate an acquisition of Sun Electric, but would consider a hostile takeover bid if Sun's management continues to rebuff its overtures. "We would be willing to pay more if management cooperates than if management doesn't cooperate," he said.
