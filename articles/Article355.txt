 Fans of Pentathlon Parry Olympic Thrust To Slim Down Games --- Ancient Ties May Mean Less Than Its Marketability; A Mountain-Bike Fix?   By By Stefan Fatsis, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2002  Pentathlon officials quickly mobilized, dividing the planet into seven regions. Supporters were assigned to track down as many of the IOC's 127 voting members as possible. Joel Bouzou, a former world champion who heads the sport's international governing body, has traveled from pentathlon's offices in Monte Carlo to Beijing to the U.S. to drum up support. At meetings with IOC President Jacques Rogge in Switzerland, he brought along Prince Albert of Monaco and Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., the son of the IOC's former president. Both men are IOC members who had joined pentathlon's cause in recent years.  The prince has met with about 25 IOC members himself in recent months. Mr. [Robert Marbut Jr.] hit a pentathlon meet in Rio de Janeiro to lobby an IOC member from Brazil. A U.S. fencing team coach knew someone who knew four-time Olympic discus gold medalist Al Oerter, who buttonholed a few IOC members at a track federation meeting in Europe.  The sport achieved a spasm of publicity in 1996 in Atlanta, where the actor Dolph Lundgren managed the U.S. team. Mr. Lundgren, best known as the Russian foil in "Rocky IV" had starred as an East German athlete in the 1994 film "Pentathlon." The movie "could cause irreversible brain damage," says Mike Gostigian, a three-time Olympian who helped Mr. Lundgren train for the role. But the actor was taken with the sport and agreed to schlep bags and hand out towels in Atlanta. "It helped," Mr. Gostigian says. "The Italians thought Ivan Drago [Rocky's fictional foe] was on the other side."
