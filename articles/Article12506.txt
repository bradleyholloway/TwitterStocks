 E-Business: Starting Gate   By By Lisa Bransten, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1999  Accel Partners is expected to announce today that Microsoft Corp., Dell Computer Corp. and entrepreneur Rob Glaser, the founder and chief executive of RealNetworks Inc., are among the investors joining the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm's new pair of funds totaling $600 million.  Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, says such investments are important because venture capitalists help foster relationships between his company and start-ups that might be good partners. On the other hand, having blue-chip participants can convince choosy entrepreneurs that the venture firms have the relationships to help young companies strike business deals. "Building very deep relationships with corporate partners can {make} a profound difference in how fast a company can grow," says Jim Breyer, Accel's managing partner.  One, Secure Commerce Services Inc., the company behind Paytrust.com, is expected to announce today that it raised $30 million from a group that includes Softbank Corp., American Express Co. and General Electric Co.'s GE Capital. The financing values the 14-month-old company at about $90 million and brings total investment in the company to $37 million. At the moment, Paytrust has about 20,000 customers, but Ed McLaughlin, its chief executive, believes membership will grow quickly. As part of the financing, American Express agreed to a marketing deal in which it will promote Paytrust to its 29 million members.
