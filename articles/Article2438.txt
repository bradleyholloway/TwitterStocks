 If Tuscany Is Full . . .   By By Harry Rolnick, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1998  Tirana, Albania -- The town of Korce advertises itself as "the Paris of Central Albania." A Paris with no water supply at night, where the streetlights have no bulbs, and where the roads are all potholes and mud. Don't even try to visit the southwestern coast, once known for 100 miles of pristine beaches between Vlora and Saranda. Explained an official from the Ministry of Trade and Tourism: "In most places here, the bandits come out after sundown. In the south, they are out all day and all night."  Going into a bar-cafe for a refreshing Albanian arak in five different towns, I was unable to pay for a single glass. In the great fortress town of Berat, an old man and a young girl spent hours looking for keys to different old churches, then explaining each 16th century icon in faultless Italian with a few English words thrown in. They were almost shocked that I would offer them any money at all. My thanks were all that was needed.  But above all, after a history bloody even for the Balkans, Albania has preserved an unimaginable collection of monuments and a haunting natural landscape. Mountains make up 75% of the country, and those in the north live up to their reputation as the "accursed hills." Fronting on the Serbian province of Kosovo, where over 90% of the population is ethnic Albanian, the hills are supposedly filled with mines to stop Albanian guerrillas from crossing to help their "countrymen." Yet, neither land mines nor land borders have ever had purpose to Albanians. Gun-smugglers habitually make the journey to the Serbian province, and since the March uprising, they have been reportedly joined by ragtag guerrillas returning from Western Europe to help their "compatriots."
