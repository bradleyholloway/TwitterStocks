 Viewpoint: American Tantalus Reaches for the Dream   By By Michael Kinsley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1987  For months now I have been brooding about a survey released in February by Dow Jones, the company that publishes The Wall Street Journal, on the subject of "The American Dream." The survey is part of an elaborate promotion keyed to the Journal's advertising slogan that it is "the daily diary of the American Dream." Conducted by the Roper Organization, the poll purports to find that the American Dream "is still alive." Like all such mock-scientific explorations of the national psyche by opinion pollsters, however, the "data" can be used to reach the opposite conclusion, or almost anything in between.  The upbeat determination that the dream is still alive derives from findings such as one that most of the public believes the dream is either "very much alive" or "somewhat alive"; that the average person thinks he or she will get to 8.2 on a scale of 10; and so on. On the other hand, less was made of findings that a majority think the dream will be harder to achieve in the next generation, and that the desire to do better than one's parents is actually leaching out of the American dream as that prospect becomes less and less likely. (Sixty-nine percent of those over 45 say this is part of their dream, but only 52% of those under 30.)
