 Year of Gains Ends on Quiet Note   By Schreiber, Cynthia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 2004  As the new year begins, "there is going to be a wait-and-see approach to see how the market acts," said Andrew Baker, head of equity trading at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "The first test will come when we get some interesting news or data."  FreeMarkets, a Pittsburgh operator of online auctions, gained 38 cents, or 6%, to 6.70, after saying it has agreed to acquire the auction business of Covisint LLC, which was founded by the Big Three auto makers to help them do business online with their suppliers. Financial terms weren't disclosed.  Lamson & Sessions (NYSE), a Cleveland producer of thermoplastic parts, lost 65 cents, or 10%, to 5.77, after the company slashed its fourth-quarter earnings estimate, as intense price competition reduced margins in its PVC pipe unit.
