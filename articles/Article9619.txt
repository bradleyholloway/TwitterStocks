 Production Numbers -- Behind Surging Productivity: The Service Sector Delivers; Firms Once Thought Immune To Boosting Worker Output Are Now Big Part of Trend; Getting More Mozart for Less   By Hilsenrath, Jon E, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2003  Much of the service sector, in contrast, was thought to be ailing from a condition called "Baumol's Disease," named after economist William Baumol. When he first wrote about the subject in the late 1960s, Mr. Baumol argued that productivity in large chunks of the service sector tended to rise more slowly than in manufacturing because services required more hands-on activity that machines couldn't replace.  "It is the end of Baumol's disease," says Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard economist whose own work has found productivity trends improving in services. He says service companies in finance, retailing and trade have "become much more like factories" in search of inefficiencies that they can use information technology to eliminate. Mr. Baumol himself says computers may be helping services "more than the remainder of the economy," though he adds education and health are still lagging behind.  Workers aren't happy about the development. The kiosks "are very impersonal. They can't answer questions and can't give directions," says Robert Roach, general vice president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, a union representing 35,000 gate agents at airlines across the U.S. "The most important thing in the service industry is that one-to-one, person-to-person handling."
