 Aches & Claims: Sudden Death on Sports Field   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2002  "If we find one kid it's worth it," says Maxwell L. Axler, a primary-care doctor in Missouri City, Texas, who has screened about 600 students. Dr. Axler established a private company called HeartScreen LLC to perform the tests, using a device and printer that he purchased for about $30,000 from SonoSite Inc., of Bothell, Wash. The device weighs about seven pounds and is the size of a 300-page book. Dr. Axler says the 600 screenings yielded eight abnormal results of which five turned out to be "false positives" and three turned out to be true positives. He charges $30 per screening.
