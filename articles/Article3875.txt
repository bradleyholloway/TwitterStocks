 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / TV: The Ultimate Terror   By Nancy deWolf Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2005  The notion that equations can help solve crimes is not nearly so silly as the premise behind several other shows on TV that psychics can help police. At least "Numb3rs" celebrates intelligence and academic learning. If this week's pilot is any guide, it even makes erudition exciting. In it, Agent [Don Eppes] is after a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. It seems a hopeless task until his brother offers a little lesson in probability theory. When a water sprinkler is on, Charlie explains, it's impossible to predict where the drops will fall; but if you know where the drops hit and work backward, it is possible to closely pinpoint their point of origin. He suggests that they take everything the FBI knows about how serial killers -- in general, and this one in particular -- operate. Then Charlie will work out a mathematical formula that predicts the area where the killer lives. Watching him do calculations on a blackboard, it all makes a beautiful kind of sense. As the show moves briskly to a satisfying conclusion, we look forward eagerly to the next lesson in forensic physics.  "Monk," which begins its third season tonight on USA (10-11 p.m.) is that rare thing, a show with a gimmick that doesn't grow tiresome. The gimmick is the widower Adrian Monk, a genius detective with obsessive- compulsive disorder and innumerable phobias. This week, a new one manifests itself. Searching for clues to a burglary that ended in death, Monk and a client dash through a science center and into a huge walk-through model of the female reproductive tract. "You are standing in the uterus," a taped announcer intones. "Turn left at the Fallopian tubes." Hyperventilating, Monk staggers around in the pink cave. His phobia in this instance? "The miracle of birth."
