 FCC Proposes to Reimpose Regulation Of Certain Syndication Rights for TV   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1987  The Federal Communications Commission proposed re-regulating certain syndication rights, a move that would aid local television stations at the expense of cable operators.  The action represents a sharp turnaround for the FCC, which has strongly pursued telecommunications deregulation. "It's virtually unprecedented," said Bruce Fein, a former FCC general counsel. He said the agency's "theme has been, 'Let's remove government interference from the marketplace.'"  Currently, cable systems, which carry television stations from different markets, may show several versions of the same syndicated show. WRIV-TV in Houston, for instance, airs the show "Facts of Life" at 5 p.m. daily, the same time as the local cable system shows "Facts of Life" from WGN in Chicago. Thomas Herwitz, vice president of Fox Television Stations Inc., which owns WRIV, said the overlap amounts to "grand larceny."
