 FDA Proposes Drug Ads Without the Fine Print   By Anna Wilde Mathews and Brian Steinberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2004  Pfizer Inc., for one, said the FDA's proposals look promising, though the company said it needs to review them further. "We're supportive of any ways to get clear information about our products to consumers," says Robert Clark, Pfizer's vice president of regulatory affairs. The New York drug maker already has tried an alternative to the brief summary along the lines of the FDA proposal for Norvasc, a blood pressure medicine, he said. The plain-language patient insert cut most of the medical fine print to focus on the main benefits and risks of Norvasc. Subsequent consumer research by the company showed that patients were able to understand the information.  Advertising executives believe the FDA's push for ads that mention diseases but not treatments may run into challenges. If a manufacturer with a product that is fourth in the market launched such an initiative, the ads would benefit the entire category, including rivals, says Michael Guarini, managing director of the health-care practice at WPP's Ogilvy & Mather, an agency that has worked with clients including Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC. "You'll get a share of that, but obviously, the leaders will get more," he says.  The FDA has drawn questions for its recent enforcement of rules on drug advertising. A 2002 report by the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigation arm, found that a change that routed all regulatory letters that criticized drug companies' ads through the FDA's chief counsel's office "sharply reduced FDA's effectiveness in issuing ...letters in a timely manner." The number of regulatory letters sent by the agency to crack down on deceptive ads also has fallen, to 24 last year from 27 in 2002 and far-higher numbers in 1999 and 2000, according to a tally released by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California.
