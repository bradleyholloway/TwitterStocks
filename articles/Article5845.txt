 Catalog Critic: What to Wear in Warm Weather   By By Kym Canter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 2000  Those who really want to make an entrance might try the dress we picked from the Victoria's Secret catalog. The silk leopard-print wrap dress is reminiscent of the Diane von Furstenburg wrap dress, but costs about half the price ($78). This dress is flattering and easy to wear, even during a heat wave, although the print might be too wild for some. At the other end of the spectrum was the floral silk sheath dress from the Brooks Brothers catalog ($158). This one was nice -- maybe a little too nice. Although it would be very appropriate for work, we felt it lacked any kind of a fashion edge.
