 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  Rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have a negative "outlook" on Merrill Lynch & Co., which refers to the potential of a downgrade over a medium-term ranging from six months to two years. In Thursday's Fund Track column and in a page-one article Oct. 25, it was incorrectly reported that the firms have placed Merrill on negative "watch," which refers to the potential of a downgrade over the short-term.
