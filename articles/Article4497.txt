 Next We'll See Moby Dick Recite Shakespeare Sonnets, by Heart Yet   By By Andrew B. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1989  Although whale songs consist primarily of growls, grunts, twitters and squeals with a few longer melodic notes, an article in the journal Ethology (named for the study of animal behavior) asserts that some whale songs are arranged in "rhyme-like structures." The authors theorize that this is how whales memorize important information, just as humans use rhythm and rhymes to remember things like how many days hath September. The songs, which range in length from three to 30 minutes, evolve gradually, and are shared by whales throughout the world.
