 The Jungle   By Williams, Nakisha, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  "It's very easy for interns to make themselves the victim and blame the institution when the internship isn't living up to an expectation," says William Coplin, a public-policy professor at Syracuse University and author of "10 Things Employers Want You to Learn in College." Interns should realize a company doesn't owe them anything, Mr. Coplin says. "You have to pay your dues and earn the right for a company to trust you," he says.  "If you have a boss who doesn't have time to speak with you, try talking to other people around the office to get feedback -- be flexible," says Bradford Agry, a partner of CareerTeam Partners, a New York career-management consulting firm. "Perhaps other workers are more accessible and have more time to help."  "I was hoping I'd be doing research and constantly talking to important people," Mr. Shtraks says. "Instead, all I did was gather statistics and open mail."
