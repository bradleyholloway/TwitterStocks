 Dialing for Free: Thanks to Hackers, Cellular Phone Firms Now Face Crime Wave --- An Altered Computer Chip Is Permitting Easy Access To Networks Nationwide --- Mr. Sutton's Key Omission   By By John J. Keller, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1991  Mr. Sutton is a computer hacker, a technical whiz who used an acquaintance's home-grown computer chip to alter cellular phones so that they dial for free. Mr. Sutton went into business selling the chips, authorities say, and soon fraudulent cellular phone calls were soaring nationwide.  In February 1989, federal agents finally nabbed Mr. Sutton in his pickup truck at a small Van Nuys, Calif., gas station. He was about to sell five more of the custom chips to a middleman. But by then it was too late. The wave of fraud Mr. Sutton had helped launch was rolling on without him.  It was Mr. Bailey, investigators say, who actually cracked the cellular system. In early 1987, Mr. Bailey allegedly took apart a Mitsubishi cellular phone and discovered that he could use a personal computer to rewrite the software in the phone's memory chip. Authorities say his new program made it possible to change the phone's unique electronic serial number, which tells a cellular phone company's computers to accept a phone call and let it pass. By replacing the factory's chip with one of Mr. Bailey's homemade devices, a user could gain free access to the phone system.
