 Judge Orders FDIC To Repay Ex-Owners Of Far West Federal   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1992  The decision is the latest round in a long-running court fight by the investors -- including the venture capital firm of Trinity Ventures, led by San Francisco investor David Nierenberg -- who claimed that regulators reneged on promises to exempt Far West from stricter capital requirements after they agreed to invest in and run the deeply insolvent thrift in 1987. The Office of Thrift Supervision seized Far West last May, citing its deteriorating financial condition.
