 New $20 Bill, Aimed At Improved Security, To Be Unveiled in May   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1998  It will be the third in the U.S. currency series containing new security features aimed at thwarting counterfeiters. A redesigned $100 bill was issued in March 1996 and a $50 bill in October last year. They include an embedded security thread that shows up only under certain light conditions among other hard-to-duplicate features.
