 Boeing's de Havilland Sells 9 Dash 8 Planes For $58.5 Million Total   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1986  The de Havilland Aircraft unit of Boeing Co. said it sold nine of its Dash 8 commuter planes to two U.S. airlines in a transaction valued at more than $58.5 million.  The purchase of three of the 37-passenger, turboprop Dash 8s by America West is unusual in the airline business because Phoenix, Ariz.-based America West currently flies only jet equipment. It has a fleet of 34 twin-engine Boeing 737s, with 10 others on order. Michael J. Conway, America West president, said the carrier's plan is to build routes from Flagstaff and Yuma, Ariz., to its Phoenix hub.
