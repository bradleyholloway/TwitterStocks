 Whiff of Good News Sparks Strong Stock Rally --- Nasdaq Soars 8.9%, Industrials Jump 4.2%; Skepticism Remains   By By Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 2001  The Nasdaq composite, just two days removed from Tuesday's frightening 6.2% tumble, rallied 146.20 points to 1785.00. Adding to the tech-led index's strength was a rating upgrade on Yahoo!, which jumped 22.6%, by analyst Holly Becker of Lehman Brothers. To put the Nasdaq rise in perspective, its close is still lower than the 1840.86 that the index began the week, and is still down nearly 65% from its all-time high reached about a year ago. Just as a 20% drop from a high is considered the barometer of a bear market in an index, the bear label wouldn't be removed unless the index were to rise at least 20%.  The Dow industrial average's eye-catching point jump represented only about half the percentage jump of the Nasdaq. The index advanced 4.2% to 9918.05. While it wasn't one of the biggest one-day percentage moves in the industrial average's history, which is much longer than the Nasdaq's, it was the fifth-best percentage gain since 1990. For the record (even though percentage moves matter more than points), it was the second-best point gain, behind only the 499.19-point gain on March 16 of last year.  It is clear that yesterday's gains are no guarantee of things to come. To wit: 15 of the Nasdaq's 17 best one-day gains took place during the past year, even as the market was in the midst of its bear-market downturn. In fact, the last time the Nasdaq gained about 8% in a day, in October of last year, it proceeded to give the gains right back in just 16 days. As for the Dow, after it banged out its best-ever 499.19- point gain on March 16 of last year, it took less than a month to register its biggest-ever one-day drop, of 617.78 points, on April 14.
