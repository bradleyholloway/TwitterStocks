 Bank Portfolio Plans Target Investors   By By Nancy Ann Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1996  But, with brokerage firms and mutual-fund companies grabbing the assets of wealth-building baby-boomers, tradition is fading. Worried banks have begun to offer asset-allocation accounts that provide investment-advisory and portfolio-management services for the masses.  The accounts divvy up investors' money among a mix of stock, bond and money-market mutual funds -- tailoring portfolios to customers' financial goals and taste for risk, and readjusting the mix when market ups and downs throw the original asset allocation out of kilter. Typically, the accounts are geared toward people with $50,000 to $100,000 to invest, but some banks have much lower minimums.  Such plans can be a big help to people who want guidance on how to spread their money among today's daunting array of funds. But, like the brokerage-firm and fund-company programs on which they are modeled, the banks' asset-allocation plans usually carry hefty fees that can be a drag on performance. Moreover, in contrast to many similar programs at other financial-services firms, some bank asset-allocation services offer a limited menu of funds.
