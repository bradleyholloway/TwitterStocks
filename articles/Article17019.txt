 No Quick Recovery for Hard-Hit Target Funds   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2009  Many of the funds that target a 2010 retirement date maintain a 50% or higher allocation to stocks, even long past investors' retirement date, because, managers say, that's the only way to make sure retirees' savings last and beat inflation throughout retirement, a period of about 20 years based on average life expectancy. [...] it's true that over the long haul, the best-performing target funds have beat the market. [...] that's a major problem with them -- take any two 2010 target-date funds and you may find one is 20% in stocks and the other is 55% in stocks.
