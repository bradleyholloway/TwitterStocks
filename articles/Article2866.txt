 A Fond Look Back at the Busy, Messy, Loud Newsrooms of Yesteryear   By By Diana McLellan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2001  TODAY'S SORRY NEWSROOMS -- silent, smokeless, boozeless, cursor-cursed funeral parlors -- bear no resemblance to the divine hell-holes that persisted at newspapers and wire services until the mid-1970s. They were seas of grunge and debris, rackety with the clatter and jingle of teletypes and typewriters. Their mostly male, adrenaline-high, Masters of Slot and Spike ruled a universe of controlled chaos, suspended in a perpetual stinking fog of cigarette smoke and worse. Young Priscilla ("Pitts") [Priscilla L. Buckley], fresh out of Smith, where she'd been managing editor of the daily paper, tripped blithely into this seedy but stimulating territory in 1944.  Ms. Buckley's fluent French sprang from childhood years spent in Paris with her large and privileged family. (She was the third-born out of 10.) There, Papa "Buquelet" was considered un homme formidable. Setting up house with his family, a French governess, two Mexican nurses and a "Negro homme de menage," he had discovered that he could not buy proper milk locally. So he ferried to the Isle of Jersey, bought a cow and installed it down the street, whence two foaming buckets of Jersey milk arrived daily for the Buquelet menage.  Speaking of milk, the rule at the Paris UP bureau was that "a Kansas City milkman" must be able to understand writers' dispatches. How he must have clanked his bottles enjoying the ephemera Ms. Buckley now rescues from her Paris scrapbooks: the French tramp who believed himself the Archangel Gabriel; the White Russian general turned chef, now peeling spuds and accepting salutes; the duke of Windsor and the ex-king of Yugoslavia vying for a table at Maxim's; the recipe for the perfect French salad dressing. (It requires chicken livers from hens born and raised in the region of Bresse.)
