 Italy Steps Up Its Conversion To Natural Gas --- Country's Need to Reduce High Fuel Import Costs Is Forcing the Change   By By Guy Collins, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1992  MILAN, Italy -- Italy's urgent need to cut its high fuel import bill is driving it to switch increasingly to natural gas from petroleum products for power generation and domestic heating.  The country's unusually high dependence on imported energy, and its total lack of a nuclear power program, have caused it to rely proportionately more heavily on gas than do its European neighbors, industry officials say.  Industry officials say natural gas is likely to account for more than 30% of primary energy consumption in Italy by 2000, up from 24% in 1990 and just 9% in 1970. "I think as a minimum by 2000 it will be 30% of the total, and could be 32% or 33%," says Eugenio Lancelotta, finance director of Italian gas distributor Italgas S.p.A.
