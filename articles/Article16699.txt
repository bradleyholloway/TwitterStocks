 Why Not Be Smart as Well as Generous   By Ransom, Diana, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2006  Since Aug. 17, gifts of clothing or household items each worth $500 or less have been required to be in at least "good" condition to qualify for a deduction. You can still deduct a gift of an item in lesser condition if the value is more than $500 -- and if you attach a "qualified appraisal" of that value to your tax return.  In the meantime, the onus of determining the "fair market value" -- which is the thrift-store price and not the price you paid for your items -- rests with you. The Salvation Army offers a "Valuation Guide" online at www.satruck.org. There are also software tools such as Intuit's ItsDeductible, which costs $19.95 at itsdeductible.com and is included in some versions of the company's TurboTax tax-preparation software.  For gifts of $250 or more, taxpayers will continue to be required to get a thank-you note or gift receipt from the charity. Those acknowledgements should contain the name of the charity, the date of the contribution and the contribution amount (reduced by the value of any goods or services received in exchange). "We are constantly going back to charities and getting better letters," says Mr. [Bill Fleming].
