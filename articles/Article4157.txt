 Leisure & Arts -- Opera: Santa Fe's Busy 'Tales,' Bloody 'Butterfly,' Tinny 'Flute'   By Waleson, Heidi, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2010  Allen Moyer's handsome set for the opera's Prologue was a detailed replica of a German tavern with three long tables, a shelf of ceramic beer steins, a wall of portraits, and Constance Hoffman's period uniforms for the university students. Jean-Marc Puissant's set updated the time period slightly, including power lines and street lights beside the traditional Japanese house, and Butterfly's bedroom, revealed in Act II, had newspaper articles pinned up on the walls beside her wedding kimono.
