 Our Martian destiny   By Bradbury, Ray, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1996  Author Ray Bradbury comments on the latest fragment of data on the possible existence of life outside our universe--the apparent discovery of evidence of life on Mars contained in a meteor found in the Antarctic. Bradbury says that once we have looked at our own planet with new wonder and recognition, we should turn back to this Martian rock and let it be the touchstone that sends us on a predestined flight across space and time, seeking some ramshackle sort of immortality.
