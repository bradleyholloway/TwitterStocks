 Government Bond Brokerage Firms To Get New Rival   By By Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1989  More than 50 brokers and other employees have left Fundamental Brokers Inc., one of the leading brokers, and joined a new firm, BCA Securities, that will open Monday.  Fundamental, a unit of British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC in London, wasn't happy about the exodus but quickly recovered and will do just fine, a spokesman said last night.  "It was a short, minor irritant to lose the people, but the labor market in that industry is rather liquid, and within a short period of time, we were fully staffed," said Christopher Woodhouse, an associate director at British & Commonwealth. "So the impact on our revenue was minimal." He added that Fundamental has a total of about 650 people.
