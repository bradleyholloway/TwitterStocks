 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Congress Abdicates   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1994  Three weeks ago, the House voted 238 to 181 to continue exempting Members of Congress from the independent counsel law that covers other government officials. The House's leaders solemnly declared that Congress must take the lead in policing the behavior of its own. Fat chance. This week, when Rep. Ernest Istook wanted the Ethics Committee to finally probe the two-year-old embezzlement scandal at the House Post Office, more than 95% of the Members who voted against independent counsels for Congress also voted against Mr. Istook. He lost 238 to 186.
