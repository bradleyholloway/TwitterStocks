 ... And a New Dawn for Immigrants [1]  By Bhagwati, Jagdish, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2004  That law assumed that the problem of illegals in our midst could be solved by a two-pronged approach. The existing stock of illegals would be eliminated by an amnesty, while the flow of new illegals would be stanched by tougher enforcement, including employer sanctions. We would then have fulfilled two objectives central to our concerns: one, "regained control of our borders," with legal immigration left as the only route into the U.S.; and two, an end to the ethical blight of an illegal underclass, simply because there would be hardly any left!  So the illegals continued to pour in; by some estimates, the inflow has even increased. And the ethical dimension of the problem increased, too, but in an unforeseen direction. The enforcement at the border, but not at home, really got out of hand. The "border" became the "frontier" -- quasi-militarized, with night sensors, fences, ditches, armed border patrol agents and helicopters. The main routes through cities such as San Diego were the initial areas of attention. But even as the attempted entries through them declined, the illegals turned to ways through arid and deadly deserts, where they were abandoned, often to their deaths, by unscrupulous "coyotes."
