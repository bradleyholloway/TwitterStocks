 Bally Total Fitness Ousts CEO And Scraps Plan to Pursue Sale   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2006  Chief Executive Paul A. Toback, 43 years old, has left the company, effective immediately, Bally said. Mr. Toback joined Bally in 1997 and had been president and chief executive since 2003. He could not be reached for comment.  Messrs. [Barry R. Elson], 65 years old, and [Don R. Kornstein], 54 years old, were two of the three candidates elected to Bally's board in January, pushed by two dissident hedge funds. The hedge funds, Liberation Investment Group LLC and Pardus Capital Management LP, both of New York, pressed unsuccessfully at that time for Mr. Toback's resignation. The investors have been unhappy with Bally's strategies and financial problems. Their offices did not return phone calls seeking comment.
