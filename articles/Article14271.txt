 OPEC Agrees On Pact to Cut Oil Production --- Iranian Proposal Is Viewed As Setback for Saudis; Several Obstacles Seen   By By Youssef M. Ibrahim, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1986  OPEC's action, viewed as a major political victory for Iran and a defeat for Saudi Arabia's price-war policy, was enthusiastically endorsed by as many as 11 of the cartel's 13 members. There was widespread agreement in the oil industry that if the cartel adheres to the Iranian plan, depressed oil prices could increase sharply. In U.S. and European markets, oil prices rallied in response to the news.  The OPEC agreement to cut the cartel's total daily production to about 16.7 million barrels a day could have broad economic ramifications. If adhered to, the accord would be a boon to debtor nations, such as Mexico, which have been hurt badly by plummeting oil revenue. Higher oil prices also would help revive the battered U.S. oil industry. But the pact would mean higher prices for gasoline and heating oil as the winter heating season approaches. And it would result in higher fuel costs for airlines and other transportation industries.  The agreement still must overcome major obstacles -- including the different needs of the 13 OPEC nations -- to have a lasting effect on oil markets. Moreover, the cartel hasn't been able to sustain a production quota policy in its 26-year history. The OPEC delegates said they will meet today to discuss some Saudi conditions on the agreement and to iron out final details.
