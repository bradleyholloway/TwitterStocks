 Georgia-Pacific Pleads Guilty To Tax Evasion --- Penalty Totaling $21 Million Is Faced in Settlement Over Value of Donation   By By Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1991  Georgia-Pacific Corp. pleaded guilty to criminal tax evasion and faces $21 million in payments and fines, in settlement of a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.  Georgia-Pacific had purchased the 5,400-acre Santa Fe Swamp near Gainesville for about $2 million in 1981, saying it intended to harvest peat to power a nearby paper mill. After donating the land, the company took a $24 million deduction on its 1984 tax return for the land.  Sentencing in the matter is scheduled for Tuesday. Georgia-Pacific said the government has recommended a fine of $5 million. A U.S. District Court judge will have the option of increasing or decreasing that fine. In addition, Georgia-Pacific said it has agreed to pay the IRS $16 million, which includes tax deficiency, interest and civil penalties.
