 Radical Steps: Fear of Islamic Fervor Spurs Harsh Crackdown In Central Asian Land --- So Harsh It May Fuel Fire, Not Quell It, Say Critics Of Uzbekistan's Regime --- Oil and Osama bin Ladin   By By Steve LeVine, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2001  The U.S. fears that Uzbek Islamic radicals are allied with Osama bin [Ladin], the Afghanistan-based Saudi the U.S. blames for attacks such as the bloody 1999 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. This concern, in turn, plays into broader U.S. security and economic interests in the region: Uzbekistan stands between Afghanistan and the Caspian Sea's huge oil fields. American officials see the possibility of an IMU assault on the oil fields, financed by Mr. bin Laden.  Mr. [Islam Karimov]'s crackdown plays well abroad. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who regards the Chechnya revolt as an Islamic movement, has repeatedly offered military aid against the IMU. Indeed, he has been so eager that Mr. Karimov for a short time last fall voiced concern that Russia was using the IMU as a pretext to re-establish its military presence in the region. In an abrupt reversal of his rhetoric, Mr. Karimov accused Russia of overblowing the Islamic threat to foment "insecurity and panic." His National Security Committee director, following this lead, complained of "a bogeyman, a myth about the so-called Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which in reality represents a band of inveterate bandits."  Given such concerns, a parade of U.S. officials came through last year to demonstrate support for the hard-line Uzbekistan government: Ms. [Madeleine Albright], Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet and Louis Freeh, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Gen. Tommy Franks of the Army's Central Command commended how Uzbekistan "undertook to quiet the IMU problem." The U.S. has supplied training and equipment such as hand-held radios but, officials say, no weapons.
