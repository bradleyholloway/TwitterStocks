 Time Warner, EMI Venture May Be Closer To EU Blessing   By By Brandon Mitchener and Philip Shishkin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  "There has been no decision yet on either deal," said a spokeswoman for the European Union's antitrust arm, referring to the EMI-Time Warner deal and to Time Warner's separate merger with America Online Inc.  European regulators have indicated that they are likely to approve the AOL merger if concerns related to the EMI deal are resolved, either by way of significant divestitures or if the deal is dropped or blocked first. The potential of a giant EMI-Time Warner-AOL to dominate the market for online distribution of music has been one of the commission's major concerns.  The commission's main concern about the merger is that it would reduce the pool of the major recording labels to four from five and strengthen the remaining majors' grip. Selling Virgin to a record company that isn't one of the big five -- EMI, Time Warner, Seagram Co.'s Universal Music, Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment and Bertelsmann AG's BMG -- would address concerns about the potential for collusion. The sale of Virgin, whose artists include Janet Jackson, David Bowie and the Rolling Stones, would reduce EMI's market share in European recorded music to around 8% from about 14.4%. Warner Music's market share is about 15%. Some of the independents expressed to Mr. [Mario Monti] an interest in buying Virgin.
