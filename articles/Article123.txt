NASHVILLE, April 29â€” The Government's chief witness in the trial of former Gov. Ray Blanton testified today that he used $23,000, or 20 percent of a year's profits from his liquor store, to help pay a debt incurred by Mr. Blanton.  The former Tennessee Governor, his 1974 campaign manager, Jim Allen, and his campaign treasurer and special assistant, Clyde Edd Hood Jr., are on trial on charges of extortion, conspiracy and mail fraud.  They have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, each faces maximum penalties of 70 years in prison and a $29,000 fine.  They are accused of assigning liquor licenses to political supporters in exchange for 20 percent of the stores' profits. Jack Ham, a Nashville businessman, said the $23,000 was from Mr. Blanton's concealed interest in the store. Mr. Ham, whose testimony was shown on videotape because he was too ill to appear, said he owed the money to Mr. Blanton, ''because that was my agreement with him.''
