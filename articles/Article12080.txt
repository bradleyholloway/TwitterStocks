 Dollar Outlook Weakens Against Mark's On Pressure From Falling Bond Prices   By Birt, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1996  Bronwyn Curtis, head of currency research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, expects the dollar to fall against the mark this week. Figures last Thursday, which showed U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, leaped by a stronger-than-expected 2.8% in the first quarter after only 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter, led to a fundamental rethinking about the U.S. currency's prospects, Ms. Curtis said.  "The GDP was very strong and made people fearful," she said. The figures sent the bond and U.S. equities markets into a nose dive Thursday, giving currency players an excuse to sell dollars. Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls data sent a more equivocal message with a lower unemployment rate but a much-lower-than forecast rise in payrolls.  In a paradoxical twist, last week's buoyant U.S. economic data has reversed the recent market view that the dollar's outlook was brighter than the mark's because the U.S. economy was far more exuberant, some economists say.
