 Leasing Company Seeks Protection Under Chapter 11   By By Paul B. Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1989  Continental Information Systems Corp., a big lessor of computer equipment and airplanes, filed under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code here Friday as it ran out of cash.  The Syracuse, N.Y., company had said earlier in the week that it missed a $3.8 million payment on debt it restructured in October, and that news apparently made other Continental sources of cash dry up. Further details weren't immediately available because the filing was announced after the bankruptcy court closed for the three-day weekend, and a company spokesman said he didn't have a copy of the filing.
