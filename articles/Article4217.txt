 Technology (A Special Report): Research --- The Old College Tie: When Companies Fund University Research, The Relationship Sometimes Gets Stormy   By By Seth H. Lubove, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1986  "There's a lot of fine-tuning that needs to be done in university-corporate relationships," says G. Frank Pittman, assistant director of Carnegie-Mellon's Robotics Institute, which last year derived half of its $8 million research budget from corporations. "There's a fundamental difference in the culture between industry and the academic world," he adds. "When industry talks about long-range, they're referring to this afternoon. Academics talk of 20, 30 and 40 years from now."  Universities certainly aren't turning away corporate money. Government support for research is slowing, spurring professors to search for other sponsors. Meanwhile, a 1980 federal law expanding universities' rights to own patents has made academic labs more aggressive about developing patentable products and licensing them to corporations. In all, the National Science Foundation estimates that corporate spending on university research this year will total about $600 million, a 155% increase since 1980.  But Remington didn't seem to understand that Mr. German's staff consisted mostly of part-time graduate students, as is usual in academic research. "They expected nice, uniform progress," says Mr. German, even though graduate students, busy with courses, typically work slowly and sporadically. The company also insisted on immediate progress reports despite Mr. German's argument that it would take months before he could produce any results.
