 Donna Karan Cuts Work Force by 8%, To Take $11 Million 4th-Period Charge   By By Teri Agins, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  The company said late yesterday that it is implementing a series of "strategic initiatives" that included consolidating its women's divisions, closing seven of its 59 outlet stores and laying off 175 employees, mostly connected with the outlet stores. The moves are expected to yield annual cost savings of $6 million beginning in 2000, the company said.  "This company has been criticized for not keeping its expenses in line," John Idol, Donna Karan chief executive, said. "We are prepared to take action regularly to keep our expense in line." He added that the company intends "to return to respectable profitability."  As a result of the restructuring, Susan Sokol, president of the company's high-end women's-collection division since 1996, resigned to pursue other interests and won't be replaced, Mr. Idol said. The unit headed by Ms. Sokol is being combined with the company's DKNY women's division under the consolidation plan.
