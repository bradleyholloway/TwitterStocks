 Indonesia Pact On Debt Averts IMF Impasse   By By Jay Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1998  JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia agreed not to insist on quickly selling hundreds of companies that it is to receive from bankers repaying the central bank nearly 100 trillion rupiah ($11 billion) in loans, according to officials involved in the negotiations.  Mr. Hasan will also turn over his 5% stake in the giant copper- and gold-mine company PT Freeport Indonesia, a unit of U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., as well as a nearly 10% stake in PT Astra International, Indonesia's largest auto maker. Mr. Hasan wasn't forced, however, to divest himself of stakes in companies he controls with Mr. Suharto through the investment company PT Nusantara Ampera Bakti, which is 10%-owned by Mr. Hasan; 10%-owned by Mr. Suharto's eldest son, Sigit Harjojudanto; and 80%-owned by foundations presided over by the former president himself.
