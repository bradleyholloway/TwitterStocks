 Blue Chips Lose `Brand Power' To Lower-Tier Firms, Survey Says   By By Ronald Alsop, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2000  The halos on America's most revered corporate brands are losing some of their luster, according to a survey of senior executives.  For the first time in the 10-year history of the survey, many of the best-known, most highly regarded companies experienced a notable drop in their "brand power" scores. Corporate Branding, a Stamford, Conn., consulting firm, last year surveyed about 8,000 executives at large U.S. companies who graded 575 corporate brands on familiarity, overall reputation, management strength and investment potential. Each respondent rated 40 companies, with scores ranging from one to 100.  It isn't unusual to see newer or weaker brands leap ahead in the annual survey, but the broad decline among the most powerful brands in the latest survey is startling, say the managers of Corporate Branding. Such blue chips as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Walt Disney, General Electric and Procter & Gamble saw their scores slip in 1999. In fact, of the top 10 brands for 1999, only one -- Hershey Foods -- beat its 1998 rating. (Corporate Branding officials say Hershey rose in the ratings, despite serious computer-related distribution problems, because some respondents were surveyed before the trouble surfaced and some take a long-term view of a company's prospects.)
