 FCC's Zeal in Enforcing Regulations Delays Sales of New Electronic Products   By By Karen Blumenthal, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1986  FCC regulations limit the amount of radio-frequency interference that can be emitted from electronic products used in homes in order to prevent them from, for instance, causing static "snow" on television screens. The more aggressive enforcement of the regulations is intended to force inexpensive Asian computer products to meet U.S. standards. But along with a huge increase in fines levied, the agency's new zeal for catching violators has led to a large backlog of computers and equipment waiting to be tested.  In late July, Tandy introduced two advanced versions of its Tandy 1000 computer, the popular model that accounts for a large portion of the 15,000 to 20,000 machines it sells each month. But while inventories of its previous 1000 model dwindled, Tandy's newer machines were awaiting FCC certification.  The new 1000 SX model, aimed at small businesses and more serious home users, received FCC certification just last week. Its 1000 EX model, designed for schools and home users, hasn't yet received approval, and Tandy can't sell the model until it does. Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy, which operates the Radio Shack electronics retail stores, cited the delays as a major cause for a meager 3% increase in its U.S. retail sales for August, to $203.7 million from $198.6 million a year ago.
