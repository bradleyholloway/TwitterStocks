 Tisch Acts Fast to Exert Control at CBS, Backing Top Executives; Sauter Resigns   By This article was prepared by Laura Landro, Joanne Lipman and James B. Stewart in New York, and Bob Davis in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1986  But in a memo to the CBS staff, Mr. Tisch, the chairman of Loews Corp., which owns 24.9% of New York-based CBS, said he had given his "complete confidence" to three top CBS executives: Gene F. Jankowski, president of the CBS Broadcast Group; Walter Yetnikoff, president of CBS Records; and Peter A. Derow, president of the CBS Publishing Group.  The vote of confidence assuaged some fears both within the company and among CBS's 208 affiliates. But CBS's problems aren't over, and there is mounting concern about what actions Mr. Tisch will take to slash costs and improve results at CBS. In addition, in Washington, regulators have expressed some concern over whether Mr. Tisch's stake in CBS, combined with his interim executive role there, constitutes a change in control of the network, which would require extensive Federal Communications Commission hearings.  Many employees of CBS's news division have hailed the changes and the return of CBS's founder and former chief executive, William Paley, as acting chairman, saying CBS News will return to its roots and the traditional news values of the Edward R. Murrow era. But it isn't clear that changing values had anything to do with the management upheaval or that CBS will be able to recapture its past. Joseph Carriere, president and general manager of KBIM-TV, a CBS affiliate station in Albuquerque, N.M., and who until recently was president of the CBS affiliate board, said: "Paley may try to run the news department like he did 20 years ago, but he can't. Times have changed."
