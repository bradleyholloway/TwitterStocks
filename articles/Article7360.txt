 Raytheon Estimates 10% Rise in '84 Profit On Continuing Lines   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1985  LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Raytheon Co. expects to report 1984 profit from continuing operations of $340 million, or $4 a share, up about 10% from $309 million, or $3.65 a share, in 1983.  Thomas L. Phillips, chairman and chief executive officer, said revenue for the year was "just shy of $6 billion," up about 6% from $5.63 billion in 1983, adjusted for the sale of Raytheon Data Systems Co. Raytheon Data makes computers for commercial use.  Mr. Phillips said fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations rose about 7% to about $1.05 a share from 98 cents a share a year earlier. Pre-tax earnings rose about 10%, he said. The company's tax rate in the quarter was 33%, up from 31% last year, because credits for foreign taxes fell.
