 As More Employees Quit Jobs for Kids, One Couple's Tale   By By Sue Shellenbarger, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2001  AT THE MOMENT, [Keely]'s paycheck as public-relations director at edocs, a Natick, Mass., billing-software concern, is paying most of the bills, including college loans and payments on their Cambridge, Mass., condo. It is enabling [JASON Krantz] to launch a promising new business he co-founded in 1999, Infinata, an Arlington, Mass., marketing-analytics software concern. "He's an entrepreneur at heart," Keely says.  Keely's job offers a psychological payback as well. She loves helping launch new products. And the new workplace flexibility makes it harder for her to quit. Edocs co-founder Jim Moran, who praises Keely's work ethic, makes several offers of flexible setups after childbirth, offers she finds hard to refuse. Keely assembles a spreadsheet of business contacts and presses Jason to get her home computer set up for e-mail. "It scares me a little to think about losing touch," she says.  She is gaining confidence as a mother. Jason helps by noticing small milestones in [Aidan]'s development and praising Keely's role. On a visit to her old office, Keely is given a completed project she started last spring. Once, she would have rushed to add it to her portfolio; this time, she throws it away. "I hope I don't regret doing that," she thinks later.
