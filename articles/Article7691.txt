 Renovation of U.S. Embassies May Slow for Lack of Funds   By By Willaim Celis III, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1987  The State Department sought $488 million for fiscal 1988, the second year in a $2.1 billion, five-year effort to rectify structural and security deficiencies at embassies. Congress is still working on a final budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, but because of spending constraints, the State Department only expects to get $61 million, or less than 13%, of its request. Says Richard N. Dertadian, deputy assistant secretary of state for foreign buildings: "The money just ain't there."  That's disappointing news for a number of U.S. construction, engineering and architectural concerns, some of which count embassy contracts among their largest jobs. Security Source One Ltd., an electronics concern, for example, says it won its biggest job ever through the renovation program last year, a $10 million contract to install, among other things, closed-circuit television systems in the Honduran and Guatemalan embassies. Svedrup Corp., a St. Louis engineering concern, got what had been one of the most sought-after jobs: a consulting contract potentially worth several hundred million dollars to advise the department on engineering and security on an embassy by embassy basis. The contract, which Svedrup calls one of its most significant in recent years, enabled the company to hire more than 100 new employees.  ALL TOLD, CONTRACTS totaling $220 million were awarded to American companies under the embassy upgrading program in fiscal 1987. U.S. companies are guaranteed most of the work. For example, if at least two American companies submit a bid for an embassy project, the job must go to a U.S. company even if a foreign concern submits a lower bid.
