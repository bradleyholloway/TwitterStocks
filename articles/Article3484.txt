 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2005  "I am absolutely certain -- I know -- that the success of this coalition will be measured by the question: Are there more jobs?" Ms. [Angela Merkel] said. She spoke as details emerged of an agreement that paves the way for a "grand coalition" to replace Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left coalition government at the end of this month.  The information was gathered for a report by a U.N.-appointed panel headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and detailed the ease with which Mr. [Saddam Hussein] managed to bend the U.N.'s oil-for-food program to his own purposes with the help of companies willing to pay illegal kickbacks, U.N. officials willing to look the other way, and an array of politicians willing to support the Hussein regime in exchange for lucrative oil allocations.  There is a threat the information could be partially lost because it needs to be returned to the people who provided it, said Mark Pieth, a member of a committee charged with investigating wrongdoing. In a keynote address Saturday to Transparency International's Annual Membership Meeting, Mr. Pieth said the U.N. would have to return all the information because the Volcker committee is being disbanded. There are "no funds" in the U.N. budget to preserve the information, said Mr. Pieth, who is Mr. Volcker's deputy.
