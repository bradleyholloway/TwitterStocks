 Ozal of Turkey Joines Sanctions 'on Principle,' but Enjoys New Leverage, Importance Anyway   By Revzin, Philip, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1990  That Mr. [Turgut] Ozal's telephone log during a crisis often resembles a United Nations roll call is no fluke: Turkey and its ebullient 62-year-old president more often than not find themselves smack in the middle on strategic planners' maps. The Iraqi crisis is just the latest example: Turkey is within missile range of eastern neighbors Iraq, Iran and Syria. But Turkey has in the past, and will in the future, come under pressure from the west and north, too.  East-West tensions may have cooled, but the Middle East crisis puts Turkey back in the middle. And this time Mr. Ozal is determined to harvest all the long-term benefit he can. By taking actions that not only back the U.S. and Western Europe, but also support Saudi Arabia and other conservative Gulf states, Mr. Ozal is extracting economic and political concessions in return for his cooperation.  Because of that decision Turkey now has a chance to get what it has lacked for many, many decades: attention, and a place in Europe. It has already started. Mr. Ozal was delighted that President Bush called him a "staunch friend of the United States" during the president's televised announcement that he was sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Ozal was also flattered that Secretary of State James Baker came here first before going on to the NATO meeting in Brussels on Friday. In talks with reporters at that session, Mr. Baker and NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner mentioned five times that NATO would spring to Turkey's aid if it was attacked.
