 Former HUD Chief Pierce Won't Be Charged in Probe   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1995  Arlin M. Adams, who has obtained 16 convictions as the result of his probe of HUD scandals, said he would not prosecute Mr. Pierce, 72 years old, because of the former secretary's age and "multiple health problems." In a statement released by Mr. Adams, Mr. Pierce admitted that his own conduct "failed to set the proper standard" to prevent wrongdoing by his underlings at HUD.
