 Sony Scrambles to Restock PlayStation 2   By By Khanh T.L. Tran, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  When Sony cut in half its initial batch of PlayStation 2 machines for first-day sales in North America to 500,000 because of a graphics-chip shortage, the company said it would ship 100,000 units a week to ensure there would be a steady flow of product by the end of the year. U.S. retailers would receive the bulk of these shipments, with the remainder allocated to Canadian stores, which accounted for less than 10% of Sony's PlayStation business.  According to Matt Gravett of PC Data Inc., an independent research firm in Reston, Va., shipments of the PlayStation 2 are "sporadic at best." In the five weeks following the game machine's launch on Oct. 26, U.S. retailers sold 325,585 units, short of the roughly 500,000 units expected for sale in the U.S., according to PC Data.  Some retailers said Sony alerted them that the company planned to end shipments during the Thanksgiving holiday week in the U.S. to free up 500,000 machines for the European launch on Nov. 24. PC Data said that during Thanksgiving week, U.S. retailers sold only 16,311 units.
