 Takeoffs & Landings [1]  By By Lisa Miller, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1995  Prices in the Caribbean will be out of sight, in part because hurricanes essentially shut down a few islands, boosting traffic on others. Florida, on the other hand, will be surprisingly inexpensive. With Southwest's entry in Florida, air fares won't rise. And hotels will be cheap, too. Choice Hotels, for example, just announced a low-rate promotion at all its brands that will last through February. (Usually, low rates expire after Christmas.)  The reasons? Florida has not entirely recovered from its reputation abroad as a crime-ridden destination. And Hurricane Opal has frightened vacationers away from the Gulf Coast.  Federal law says that any cruise ship embarking from an American port must be able to give full refunds in the event of a canceled voyage. This was welcome news to the hundreds of passengers who were stranded recently on a Florida pier, waiting for their Regency ship to come in -- unaware that the ship had been seized by authorities as part of the company's demise. Similar laws do not cover ships that dock exclusively outside the U.S. -- which is why a number of Caribbean cruise ships never dock in the U.S. "The best advice to consumers is go American," says Tom Dickerson, author of Travel Law.
