Winston Churchill led a double life during the last few decades of the 20th century -- or rather his life was being told in tandem. While Sir Martin Gilbert was writing the ''official'' Churchill biography in eight volumes, a task that began in 1966 and ended in 1988, William Manchester was working on a three-volume biography of the same man. Both authors welcomed the kinship between their books. If the more popular biography -- Mr. Manchester's -- depended on research done by Sir Martin, it also sent many readers to the more scholarly work.  But there will be no third and final volume of Mr. Manchester's Churchill. After two strokes and the death of his wife, he has reluctantly conceded that he no longer has the Churchillian stamina required of any person who chooses to write about that man. To those waiting since 1988, this is the sad news we feared all along. It is grievous to imagine a writer of Mr. Manchester's vitality having lost his exuberant command of fact and language. There is really no good way for a literary career to end, because invariably it means, for readers as well as for the writer, the loss of spirit itself.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
