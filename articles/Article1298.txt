 Retail Sales Increased 1.6% During January --- Huge Rise in Auto Buying Leads to Largest Gain Since October of 1988   By By Katherine Walsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1990  WASHINGTON -- Retail sales surged 1.6% last month, driven by a huge increase in automobile buying, the Commerce Department said.  The January jump, to $146.39 billion, followed a meager 0.2% rise in December and was the largest gain since October 1988, when sales surged 2.1%.  Many economists said the strong sales figures don't signal a rebound in consumer spending, however. Mostly they attributed the gain to widespread price-cutting, particularly at car dealerships and department stores. Peter Pekkala, domestic economist at Ford Motor Co., said the overall retail-sales figure "reflects the fact that consumers will spend when prices are favorable."
