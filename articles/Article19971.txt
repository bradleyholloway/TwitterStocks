 Politics & Economics: Libby Trial to Begin in January In Case Stemming From CIA Leak   By Squeo, Anne Marie, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2006  Mr. [Patrick Fitzgerald] has been criticized for not charging anyone with violating the intelligence-protection law, and some have argued he avoided it because Ms. [Valerie Plame]'s role at the CIA no longer met the stringent definition of who is considered a covert agent. Mr. [Libby]'s attorneys have recently asked the court to compel Mr. Fitzgerald to provide information about Ms. Plame's employment status at the CIA when her name became public in mid-2003. A judge hasn't yet ruled on that matter.
