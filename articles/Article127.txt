 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Ethiopia's Problems Remain   The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 1991  The fall of Ethiopian tyrant Mengistu Haile Mariam is morally satisfying, but it does not mean an automatic end to hunger and death. The two largest rebel forces, whose military successes are an immediate cause of Mengistu's resignation, are about as equally committed to Marxism and are hardly less callous about human suffering. Democracy's champions here are relatively weak -- some student and community groups, the exile community, some of the smaller tribal armies. Democracy can come to Ethiopia only if the West promotes democrats.
