 Career Journal: The Jungle   By By Kris Maher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2003  Limit your letter to a few paragraphs, expressing thanks, and reinforcing your strengths and enthusiasm for a position. Personal touches -- and even humor -- can be powerful ways to build rapport with a hiring manager. Avoid overfamiliarity and have someone read your letter over to check the tone. Above all, the letter is a chance to showcase your business-communication skills. "You don't want to be too aggressive," Mr. [Ron Krannich] says. "You want to make sure it's very employer-centered." Make sure the letter is flawless in grammar and usage. You can go overboard obsessing over what quality of paper to choose, but even a typo can negate a positive impression. In most cases, it's appropriate to type a thank you. The letter should be free of coffee stains, white out, cross-outs and smudges. Blemishes signal a lack of care.  Much as it seems like entering a minefield, however, a good thank-you letter can make a positive impression and nudge the hiring process along, says Judit E. Price, a principal of Berke & Price Associates, a Chelmsford, Mass., career-counseling firm. She advises clients to state in a thank-you letter that they will follow up with a hiring manager. "You have to show that you're proactive," she says. "Don't wait for the hiring manager to call you." Just knowing a candidate will be calling can force a manager to make an evaluation.
