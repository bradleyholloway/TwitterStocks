 Highflying Lifestyle Of Robert Brennan Is Now Down to Earth --- Supreme Court Won't Review Judgment of $75 Million For Huge Securities Fraud   By By Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1997  But that may now be changing. Earlier this week, Mr. Brennan, 53 years old, exhausted his last avenue of appeal when the Supreme Court declined to review the judgment against him. And, since June, Donald Conway, a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, has been working to bring Mr. Brennan's finances down to earth.  Mr. Conway, a principal in the Princeton, N.J., accounting firm of Druker, Rahl & Fein, has taken control of Mr. Brennan's chief holdings, including PAB Aviation, an air-charter service; Due Process Stables, a golf course and real-estate complex in Colts Neck, N.J.; and more than 15 realestate holding companies. He controls all corporate-checking accounts, signs off on all company disbursements and has established operating budgets for all of the companies.  He is arranging for the sale of financial investments, including shares, that Mr. Brennan owned. He is sifting through Mr. Brennan's books and records in an attempt to piece together the true financial shape of the financier's myriad holdings. He is negotiating to settle a New Jersey Bureau of Securities case and a private class-action suit pending against Mr. Brennan. He has cut Mr. Brennan's salary to $150,000 a year, an amount he says reflects Mr. Brennan's continued involvement in Due Process and PAB Aviation.
