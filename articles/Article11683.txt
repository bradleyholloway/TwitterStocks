 Digital Equipment Senior Executive Plans to Retire   By By John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1993  Mr. Smith's move is the latest in a series of high-level departures from Digital. The 57-year-old executive had recently taken on a series of interim assignments for Robert B. Palmer, who became president and chief executive in October, succeeding Mr. Olsen. Mr. Olsen was forced out by the computer maker's board in the midst of steep losses and management turmoil.  Mr. Smith served the Maynard, Mass., company for 34 years through a succession of senior positions and had worked closely with the sometimes irascible and autocratic Mr. Olsen since 1987. But his role in Digital's future was unclear and he said his post as senior vice president for operations won't be filled.  Nonetheless, Mr. Smith insisted that his decision to retire was his own and was unrelated to Mr. Palmer's appointment to lead the computer company. Mr. Palmer's ascension "had nothing to do with my decision to retire -- in fact I was thinking about it before" the changes, he said.
