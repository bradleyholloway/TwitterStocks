 The Clinton Budget: Army Officials Feel Shortchanged by Military Outlays   By By Thomas E. Ricks, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1998  Despite five major post-Cold War reviews of the shape of the defense establishment, the services' shares of the military budget remain about the same: roughly a third each for the Air Force and the Navy and a quarter for the Army, with the leftover slice going to Defense Department-wide functions. That was true in 1989 as the Cold War was ending, and a decade later remains true in the administration's proposed defense spending authority of $257.3 billion for fiscal 1999. Adjusted for inflation, the fiscal '99 budget represents a 1.1% decline from the current level.  The Army begs to differ. As a current Army briefing slide puts it, "The world has changed, the strategy has changed, the requirements have changed, the Army has changed," but "The funding paradigm has NOT changed." The Army argues that it's doing most of the heavy lifting in recent and current operations in Haiti and Bosnia, yet continues to get the smallest slice of the budget pie. "The Army gets 24% of the money but carries 70% of the load," retired Army Lt. Gen. Richard Trefry said in a comment representative of the frustration the Army feels.
