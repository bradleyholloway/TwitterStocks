 Health-Care Program After 9/11 Is Lesson on Reaching the Poor   By By Scott Hensley, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2002  After last year's terrorist attack, fraud prevention took a back seat to getting help for needy people. Immediately after the attack, New York received a waiver from certain Medicaid requirements. The state trimmed the application for Medicaid to one page from eight. Authorities relaxed income standards, and officials required less proof of financial eligibility for benefits. People could qualify by giving a Social Security number and answering a few questions about their income instead of providing copies of pay stubs, leases, and a full accounting of their assets.  Still, the emergency program was just that -- for emergencies. By this fall, the waiver and several extensions have expired for most people. They now must apply for Medicaid the old-fashioned way, and some aren't making the transition. Roughly half of the beneficiaries of the emergency plan have applied for traditional Medicaid, according to early statistics from the city, and about three-quarters of those are qualifying.  Despite the success of the New York experiment, governments seem reluctant to permanently simplify Medicaid enrollment requirements. Larger Medicaid rolls would further strain tight health-care budgets. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. is urging the state to permanently streamline the Medicaid enrollment process. But Nina Johnson, a spokeswoman for the city health provider, said there's been "no progress in achieving the goal."
