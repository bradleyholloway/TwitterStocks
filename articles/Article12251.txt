 Why an Acquisition? Often, It's the People   By By Bernard Wysocki Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1997  WorldCom Inc.'s audacious $30 billion bid to acquire MCI Communications Corp. is the latest vivid example of how big companies try to become gigantic companies to gain clout and dominance over an industry. But while the power plays grab headlines, a less-noted but interesting development is occurring on the merger-and-acquisition front. In an economy with ever-tighter labor markets, some deals are being driven by a need for workers. Companies are being acquired for quick access to scarce talent.  Yet the reasons companies put up with the risks, uncertainties and expense of buying companies for the human talent of the target point to powerful underlying forces. In today's economy, building work teams from scratch can be yesterday's luxury. So, when you can't build fast enough, you buy.  Case in point is Cisco Systems Inc. The San Jose, Calif., networking giant has bought 19 companies since 1994. Most of them have been small software outfits, with 50 to 100 employees, just on the brink of launching commercial products. In short, Cisco is buying new product teams on the open market because it takes too long to assemble them from the ground up. And it is paying lofty prices-sometimes as much as $2 million an employee.
