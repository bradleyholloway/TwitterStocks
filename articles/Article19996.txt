 Politics & Economics: China Breaches Vatican Accord By Naming Two Catholic Bishops   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2006  The dispute highlights Beijing's efforts to keep a tight grasp on organized religion at a time when Christianity's popularity is spreading among Chinese. China's government officially recognizes five religions, including Catholicism, but requires practitioners to register with state organizations and insists on its right to name key religious officials. Believers who hold that only their own leaders have such authority, such as Roman Catholics and Tibetan Buddhists, are forced into "underground" worship and subject to harassment and detention.  Cardinal Joseph Zen of Hong Kong has long been an enthusiastic advocate of restoring the Vatican's formal ties with China, which were severed shortly after the Communists took power in 1949. But Cardinal Zen's tone changed sharply this week after Chinese authorities consecrated Ma Yinglin as bishop of Kunming and Liu Xinhong as bishop of Anhui. Neither priest has been approved by the Church in Rome, breaking with an informal arrangement of nearly five years under which Chinese candidates for bishop were approved by both the Vatican and the government-sponsored Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.
