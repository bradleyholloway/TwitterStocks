So if you don't catch sight of the birds themselves, you can easily spot their trails in the snow. Mice cozy up to tree roots in the winter, and the squirrels that bury acorns usually forget where they are, but that's good for propagating oaks. These are some of the tidbits you may pick up on a walk in the upper woodlands of Alley Pond Park in Queens on Saturday, beginning at 1 P.M. The guide will be Arthur Wagner, a naturalist, who also plans to point out ways in which the park is being misused. The fee is $1. Meeting place is the park house in the upper parking field picnic area of the park, reached from the Grand Central Parkway or Winchester Boulevard. Information: 229-4000. OLATUNJI FAREWELL  Olatunji - the Nigerian percussionist, teacher and exponent of African rhythms and culture, who has been influential in American jazz - has decided to return to Nigeria after 30 years.
