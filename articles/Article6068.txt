 Japan's Corruption Scandal Hits Central Bank   By By Jathon Sapsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1998  The Tokyo District Prosecutors Office accused the official, Yasuyuki Yoshizawa, of accepting 4.2 million yen ($33,000) in entertainment over the past five years in return for leaking sensitive information to the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita called Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and offered to resign over the scandal, according to several Japanese media reports. Mr. Hashimoto declined to accept the offer for the time being, but said he would take Mr. Matsushita's intentions "very seriously." The central bank and prime minister's office couldn't confirm the reports.
