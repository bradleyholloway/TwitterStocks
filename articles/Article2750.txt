 Online Corporate-Bond Sales by Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank Get Mixed Reviews From Investors   By By Shella Calamba and John Dooley, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2000  Bear Stearns's sale Thursday of $600 million of seven-year securities was the first Dutch auction of corporate bonds via the Internet. In Dutch auctions, bids are accepted from the highest down to the level at which the desired amount of securities is sold. The bonds then are all awarded at that level, which is called a clearing bid.  On Friday, Deutsche Bank sold $250 million of three-year floating-rate notes via a sealed-bid auction on its Debt Capital Markets Web site, www.dbbonds.com. The format differed from Bear Stearns's in that the issuer and investors couldn't observe the live auction, the amount of securities bid for or the clearing bid as it developed.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 119.04 points to close at 11027.80. Treasurys often decline when equities rise sharply, as investors shift money from shorter-dated Treasurys -- which are perceived to be the safest among securities -- into stocks. Conversely, when equities fall sharply, money often flows from stocks into Treasurys.
