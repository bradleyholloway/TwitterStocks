 Letters to the Editor: Some Risks Are Against the Grain   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1996  Scott Kilman's July 2 article "Hedge Row" should make it clear to your readers that commodity futures markets such as those at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) are simply more open and safer than the unregulated, over-the-counter hedge-to-arrive (HTA) contracts currently used by some in the agricultural community. The article also points out the need for further clarification and education in the ag community on HTAs.  Farmers and grain elevator operators are experiencing problems with HTAs because these unregulated contracts lack the benefits of price transparency, daily mark-to-market of positions, and daily margining that are the strength of exchange-traded futures and options contracts found at the CBOT. There has never been a default in the history of the CBOT due to the financial strength and integrity of the Board of Trade Clearing Corp., which guarantees all trades. However, some participants enter into HTA transactions simply to avoid these safeguards.
