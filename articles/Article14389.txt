 It's the Raiders vs. the Coliseum, And the Clear Winner is Acrimony   By By Hal Lancaster, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1987  A battle between Mr. Davis, the mercurial owner of the National Football League's Los Angeles Raiders, and the star-crossed Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission would seem to ensure drama and confusion -- and the participants haven't disappointed. Almost as much acrimony hovers over the Coliseum these days as smog. "At times, I wish I'd never heard of the Coliseum Commission," sighs Alexander Haagen, the commission's president -- and the eye of the storm.  The argument seems so trivial that it's hard to understand the uproar. It involves Mr. Haagen's last-minute objections to a renovation project the Raiders wanted completed for the coming season, and which the team insists was verbally committed to by previous commissions. Mr. Haagen "has redefined the concept of bad faith," says Jeffrey Birren, Raiders' general counsel. In retaliation, the Raiders have stopped negotiating with the commission and say they plan to move the team elsewhere in Southern California.  But almost everybody else thinks that this is more than a dispute over renovations. To many, this is a clash of major-league egos between Mr. Davis and Mr. Haagen, both proud, willful men used to getting their own way. "Davis is supposed to be a tough guy and Haagen sees himself as a tough guy," says William Robertson, the commission representative who negotiated the Raiders' lease. "Haagen is going to show Davis he's just as tough."
