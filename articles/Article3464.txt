 Brazil's Not-So-Favored Airline; Once a Government Darling, Varig Faces Vagaries of Competition   By Samor, Geraldo, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2005  When politicians wanted flights, Varig was lavish in handing out courtesy tickets. As the government sought to weave together this massive country, Varig flew to the hinterlands, whether or not routes were profitable. When Brasilia strengthened ties with Africa in the 1980s, Varig started flying to unprofitable destinations there.  Many non-Brazilians know Varig as the Latin American arm of the Star Alliance airline network, which includes United Airlines and Lufthansa. Varig has agreements with 211 airlines, including its 15 Star Alliance partners. According to a Varig spokesman, Star Alliance partners account for almost half of Varig sales made through other airlines.  As part of its reorganization plan filed Monday, Varig said it will cut staff by 13% by the end of 2006 as it tries to trim annual costs by roughly $168 million. It also will create a special-purpose company with the right to use its aircraft, brand and mileage program as well as other assets yet to be determined. Control of the new company, which won't carry the heavy debt that has crippled Varig, will be offered to investors such as private-equity funds. Portugal's state- owned TAP Air Portugal -- run by a former Varig CEO -- said it is interested in a stake in the Brazilian carrier. TAP has hired J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Brazilian law firm Mattos Filho to advise it on a possible bid.
