 House Adds $4 Billion to Clinton's Defense Plan   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  The House Appropriations Committee gave initial approval to a $288.6 billion Pentagon budget, adding $4 billion to President Clinton's request and greatly accelerating plans to transform the Army into a more mobile, advanced force.  Nearly half the extra funds would go to the Army, and the committee wants to double the pace at which the Pentagon will upgrade five to eight infantry brigades. While the administration had proposed enough money to begin fielding the first of the new brigades next year, the House bill sets a goal of upgrading two brigades in fiscal 2001 and each year thereafter.  More than $1.1 billion is added for this purpose on top of the $637 million requested by the service. The Army also would benefit from about $600 million added to operations and maintenance accounts. And the House panel fully funds the Army Comanche helicopter program and adds 11 Blackhawk copters to the service's budget.
