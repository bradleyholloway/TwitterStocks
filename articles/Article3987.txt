 Plots & Ploys   By Michael Corkery, Christine Haughney and Ryan Chittum, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2005  Construction of the 33 apartments in the former Western Union building in the business district resumed earlier this month. It hasn't been easy. Mr. [Marcel Wisznia] says he has had to deal with contractors raising their prices because of increases in the cost of labor and supplies after the storm. The building wasn't flooded, though it suffered about $1 million in storm damage. Mr. Wisznia plans to use tax credits awarded for restoring a historically significant building to subsidize some of the $8.2 million project, which he hopes to complete early next summer. The apartments are aimed at white-collar professionals, and rents will range between $1,100 and $1,700 a month.  Chairman Douglas Shorenstein has sold five of the company's major San Francisco properties since 2004, partly because of concerns about San Francisco's high prices. Shorenstein executives have been shopping in other markets such as Boston and suburban San Francisco for deals. They said they chose these two office properties because Walmart.com had leased the entire two buildings for the next six years -- at rents negotiated at the height of the tech boom. Shorenstein Managing Director Andrew Friedman also noted that vacancies in the area had dropped to less than 20% from 25% in December 2004, and that surrounding areas also are picking up.
