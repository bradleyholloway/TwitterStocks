 Art & Money   By By Brooks Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2001  ARMS DEALERS: Christie's starts the new year off with a bang by auctioning a pair of pistols Lafayette gave George Washington in 1778. The "saddle pistols" are expected to net seven figures. . . . THE NEW `IT' ARTISTS: California art is on a tear. Last week, Bruce Nelson's "A Coastal View" from the 1920s soared above a presale estimate of $10,000 to sell for $195,375 at Butterfields, the San Francisco auctioneer.  The squabble actually had something more at stake. Miffed dealers say they lost hundreds of dollars keeping rented U-Hauls idling while techs for Ms. [Britney Spears] had "preferential access" to freight elevators. Some dealers even resorted to hauling antiques down the five flights from the Garden's Expo Center, which rents for $10,000 a day, to get out of the building. "It was horrendous," says Jerome Eisenberg, head of Royal-Athena Galleries and the fair's co-organizer.
