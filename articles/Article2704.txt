 TXU in Dallas Makes Unsolicited Bid Of $2.3 Billion for a Utility in Spain   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Keith Johnson in Madrid and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2000  TXU Corp., attracted by Spain's fast-growing, partially deregulated electricity market, made an unsolicited 2.4 billion euro ($2.3 billion) offer for Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico SA, the country's fourth-largest utility.  TXU acquired a 5% stake in Cantabrico in 1998 and has two seats on its board. Phil Turberville, chief executive of TXU Europe, said the deal permits two "likeminded companies" to work together and create a "stronger pan-European company, growing faster in Iberia and mainland Europe than we would apart."  No date has been set for the Cantabrico board to vote on the offer of 21.25 euros ($20.40) a share, a 13% premium over Cantabrico's closing price Friday. Speculation about a takeover has fueled a 63% surge in Cantabrico's stock since early February; the shares rose 10% yesterday. TXU shares rose 62.5 cents to $26.6875 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
