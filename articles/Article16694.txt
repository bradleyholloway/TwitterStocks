 Politics & Economics: Japan Befriends Neighbors to Pressure North Korea   By Evan Ramstad in Seoul, South Korea, and Sebastian Moffett in Tokyo, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2006  Despite North Korea's announcement, Seoul isn't parting with its policy. South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun told his cabinet to prepare a "cool-headed and stern" response to Pyongyang's latest provocation. "We need measures to let North Korea know clearly what consequences it will cause if it really goes ahead with a test," he said.  South Korea's signals contrast with the sharp criticism the U.S. and Japan leveled at North Korea in the wake of its statement Tuesday that it would test a nuclear bomb. Washington and Tokyo may ask the United Nations to invoke sanctions against North Korea that can be backed up militarily if it proceeds with a test, analysts say.  Mr. [Shinzo Abe]'s trip will include the first summit meeting between the Japanese and Chinese leaders in five years. China refused to hold summits with Mr. Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, because of his visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni war shrine, which honors war criminals as well as conscripted soldiers.
