 Why Revive the Cold War?   By Feith, Douglas J; Shulsky, Abram N, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2009  [...] on Nov. 13, 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the U.S. would unilaterally reduce its "operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level between 1,700 and 2,200 over the next decade." Mr. Obama seems willing to pay for arms reductions that Russian officials have made clear will occur soon, due to aging or the planned modernization of systems, with or without a new treaty. [...] the Obama administration is opposing modernization measures designed to protect against the risk that the aging of U.S. weapons will compromise their safety or reliability.\n
