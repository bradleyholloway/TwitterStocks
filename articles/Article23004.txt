 A Trading Firm's Failure Lands Deutsche Bank in Court   By By John R. Emshwiller, The Wall Street Journal,  May 2, 2003  Here is how it worked, according to the suit: Ultimate Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda-based firm connected to Mr. [Adnan Khashoggi], was a major shareholder of GenesisIntermedia. Ultimate and others loaned many of the company's shares to Native Nations, a small New Jersey brokerage firm that is now out of business. (Native Nations, the first securities firm controlled by a Native American, was featured in a 2001 front-page article in The Wall Street Journal.) In return, Native Nations sent cash to Ultimate Holdings and other stock owners. Native Nations then lent the stock to MJK, which posted cash with Native Nations. Additional transitions took place, and large numbers of GenesisIntermedia shares ended up at a brokerage arm of Deutsche Bank, according to the suit.  When MJK tried to collect money from Native Nations, the brokerage firm said that it didn't have the funds, according to the suit. That's because Native Nations had passed the money on to Mr. Khashoggi and others, who didn't return it, says the complaint. The suit alleges that the scheme produced losses of $209 million to MJK and other brokerage firms that were relying on MJK for repayment of the stock loans. Native Nations isn't a defendant in the suit, though one of its former officials is. Calls to GenesisIntermedia, which is a defendant, weren't returned.  At one point, Deutsche allegedly held more than five million shares in GenesisIntermedia, which in 2000 had a $33 million loss on revenue of $42 million. The Deutsche Bank spokeswoman says the institution viewed the transactions as straightforward loans in which the GenesisIntermedia stock was held as collateral for the cash that the bank had lent. "The amount of stock held was not only appropriate but necessary," she said. She added that "Deutsche Bank senior management had no knowledge of any alleged manipulation."
