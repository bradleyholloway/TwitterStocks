 Manufacturing Stayed Sluggish In November   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2002  Manufacturing has been depressed by a drop in automobile sales and weakening overseas markets and companies' reluctance to boost capital spending amid uncertainty over the economy, a backlash against corporate governance scandals and possible war with Iraq. The small uptick in the November index was driven by an increase in production, which might reflect a bounce back from disruptions in October caused by a West Coast dock strike.  New orders shrank after increasing modestly in October, the pace of job cuts among manufacturers accelerated, and export orders shrank after several months of growth. One bright spot was that inventories were used up at a faster rate, which makes it more likely manufacturers will have to boost production in coming months, especially if holiday sales prove robust.
