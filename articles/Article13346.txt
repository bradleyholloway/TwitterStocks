 Comverse Ex-CEO May Have Fudged Option Exercise Dates, Not Just Grants   By Levitz, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2006  Gradient didn't conclude that Mr. Alexander's exercise was backdated, and his favorable timing might have been just a matter of luck. Robert Morvillo, the lawyer who is representing Mr. [KOBI ALEXANDER], who is fighting extradition from Namibia, declined to comment.  Comverse, a New York telecommunications-software maker, uses an independent broker to administer stock-option exercises, a practice that should make manipulation of the exercise date more difficult. But the company doesn't know whether the broker was used for the 1998 transaction highlighted by Gradient. At that time, the broker wasn't being used by the company on a full-time basis, a person familiar with the matter said.  A Comverse spokesman said a special committee was reviewing "all matters related to this company's stock-option practices." The Gradient analysis doesn't demonstrate that Comverse had a pattern of low exercise dates. The report also doesn't mention possible legitimate reasons for the dates, including chance and the desire of executives to exercise options at low price points and hold the shares.
