Mayor Koch yesterday revived his proposal for a new statewide tax to help finance the operation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He also said the city still had the option of trading in Federal funds for the Westway highway project if state financing did not materialize.  In Washington, New York's two Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato, reaffirmed their support for the Westway, a proposed superhighway on the West Side of Manhattan, but said they would work for a trade-in of funds if asked to do so by city and state officials.  Senator Moynihan, attempting to clear up confusion about a statement he had made earlier suggesting that there were insufficient funds for a trade-in, said the Reagan Administration had not ruled out such a move.  A meeting is planned for today in Albany among Governor Carey, the Mayor and Richard Ravitch, the M.T.A. chairman, to discuss financing for the transit system. Four Areas of Taxation  ''I am for taxes,'' the Mayor said. ''I have no objection to a special regional tax, a statewide regional tax that would be devoted exclusively to mass transit.'' Mr. Koch made a similar proposal last year.  Mr. Koch also said the bus and subway fares should continue to support the same percentage of the system's operating budget as they do now - about 55 percent.  ''The balance must be borne by state subsidies,'' he said. Deputy Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. mentioned four areas in which he said taxes for mass transit could be sought: a higher gasoline tax, an income tax surcharge, an additional tax on new automobiles or an increase on payroll taxes, divided equally between employer and employee. Capital Improvements Sought  Mr. Wagner said he hoped the meeting with the Governor today would be ''the beginning of a real discussion on operating assistance for mass transit.'' It would be a ''victory,'' Mr. Wagner said, ''if the Governor would recognize that the question of operating subsidies is on the table.''  If the state does not provide a satisfactory level of financing for capital expenditures for the mass transit system, Mr. Koch indicated, he would press for a trade-in of the Westway funds. ''We will opt for the boulevard which costs about $700 million and take a billion dollars and put it into the mass transit system,'' the Mayor said.  Senator D'Amato said he could support that decision. ''There comes a time when the leadership of the state and the city have to make a decision,'' he said. ''If the local decision is to go for a trade-in, I would work for it.'' Moynihan Supports Westway  In a separate news conference, Mr. Moynihan echoed his Republican colleague's position. ''I think Westway is a good idea, but I intend to support what is wanted in New York City,'' he said.  Mr. Koch, reacting to suggestions that he had attacked Mr. Ravitch's performance too harshly at a news conference Tuesday, said he had merely been critical of the M.T.A. and had not ''savaged'' Mr. Ravitch, as one news report said.  ''I believe that John Simpson and Dick Ravitch are doing a good job,'' the Mayor said, referring to the system's new executive director. But, Mr. Koch added, ''I believe they could be doing a better job.''  Mr. Ravitch, while conceding that there were problems with the M.T.A., took exception to the tone of the Mayor's criticism. ''All I can say is that ad hominem comments don't contribute to the solution of the problem,'' he said.  ''As the man knows very well there are tremendous middle management problems,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''We are trying to deal with them with the limited resources we have. They can't be done with the snap of a finger.''  In Albany an aide to the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, contended that, although there was no legislative support for a statewide tax to finance the city's transit system, a request by the city for a local or regional tax could not be ruled out. ''The city could ask for that power and would probably get it if it were a reasonable request.''
