 Going Global: Currency Conflict Shakes Market --- Governments Aim to Steal Growth, Export Deflation; Power of a Weak Dollar   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2003  In the current environment of slowing inflation and outright deflation -- when prices actually decline -- it makes no sense for a country to have a strong currency, says Stephen Jen, chief currency economist at Morgan Stanley in London. "In the late 1990s, having a strong currency was cool, but the name of the game now is to have a weak currency. Japan and the U.S. realize this, and it'll be only a matter of time before euro-zone policy makers do," he says.  The [Bush] administration's goal, analysts believe: to boost U.S. exports and growth, battle deflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, prod the European Central Bank to cut short-term interest rates and push Japan to overhaul its moribund economy -- all in advance of the November 2004 presidential and congressional elections.  In theory, a weaker greenback should benefit U.S. sales, profits and growth. But there is also the risk that a cascading dollar will spook investors and degenerate into a "sell U.S. assets" scenario, warns Mr. Jen.
