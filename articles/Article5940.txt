 Deregulation Will Pinch Gaps in Basic Phone Rates   By By Caleb M. Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1997  For Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., the difference between Abilene and the three cities of Houston, Dallas and San Antonio is 26%, 18% and 12%.  That's how much more the phone company charges for basic residential service in those cities, respectively, than in Abilene, even though providing phone service in big cities with higher population densities is much cheaper than in smaller cities such as Abilene and in rural areas.  According to the Public Utility Commission in Austin, which began this month making the phone-rate comparisons as competition for local phone service draws near, the urban-rural divide is even wider for basic business service. In Houston, where people pay the most for a phone line in the state, Southwestern Bell charges business customers 37% more than in Abilene. And in Dallas, business-line customers pay 22% more.
