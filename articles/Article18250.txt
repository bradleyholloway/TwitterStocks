 RJR Nabisco Plans Offering Of $4.9 Billion --- Common, Preferred Issues Aim to Cut Debt Costs, Expand Overseas Market   By By George Anders, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1991  RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said it plans to issue $4.9 billion of common and preferred stock, allowing it to cut its debt costs and raise money for expanding its overseas tobacco business.  The proposed new financing, which comes in two steps, is RJR's fourth major debt-reduction measure in the past 15 months. RJR is proposing to retire about $3 billion market value in 11.5% preferred stock by offering holders a total of 274 million shares of common in return. RJR also said it plans an underwritten offering of $1.88 billion of new preferred equity redemption cumulative stock, known as Percs.  RJR currently pays an average interest rate of about 11.7% on its $16.5 billion of bank and junk-bond debt. But "with the shackles of HLT status thrown off, we should be able to work down the cost of debt for our entire balance sheet," RJR's chief financial officer, Karl von der Heyden, said in an interview.
