 Mr. Gore's Bible   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1998  In recent days, opponents of racial and gender preferences in public institutions have been attacked by Vice President Al Gore as hypocrites, while in Seattle a leading talk-show host has been fired by a station after he'd been criticized by local leftists.  Vice President Gore gave an extraordinary Martin Luther King Day address in which he used the Bible to support the view that opponents of preferences are hypocrites who refuse to recognize that the "sin" of racism persists. "The Gospel of Luke tells us of Jesus's reaction to people who willfully refuse to see the evidence before their eyes," he told a gathering in Atlanta. He then quoted the Lord in Luke on "ye hypocrites."  The Vice President said, "They're in favor of affirmative action if you can dunk the basketball or sink a three-point shot." He believes that Martin Luther King "would be genuinely surprised that some who actively oppose his agenda roll his words and phrases off their tongues even as they try to roll back equal opportunity." Meanwhile this White House threatens vetoes of bills to extend choice vouchers to students in the educational war zone known as the District of Columbia. Perhaps Mr. Gore could find a quotation in his Bible to support this position as well.
