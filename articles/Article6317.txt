 Krispy Kreme Issues Profit Warning; After 1st Forecast Reduction Since IPO, Stock Falls 29%; Low-Carb Fervor Is Blamed   By Terhune, Chad, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2004  Carbohydrate-conscious dieters got most of the blame for a slowdown in sales that Krispy Kreme said forced it to lower its earnings target for the current fiscal year by 10%. "It's hard, if not impossible, to predict whether this low-carb phenomenon is a passing fad or a fundamental, lasting change in consumer behavior," said Scott Livengood, Krispy Kreme's chairman and chief executive.  John Tate, Krispy Kreme's chief operating officer, said Friday that "retail customer counts" in Krispy Kreme stores have declined slightly "for the first time in recent memory," nearly wiping out the higher revenue the company gets from boosting doughnut prices. The company's average weekly sales declined last fiscal year for the first time since Krispy Kreme went public at a split-adjusted price of $5.25 a share.
