 Nasdaq Falls 3.16%, Sliding to Loss for the Year   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2000  Another rough day for small technology stocks wiped out the last of the mammoth gains the Nasdaq Composite Index had posted since the year began. But Old Economy stocks kept on advancing.  Small biotech, semiconductor and fiber-optics stocks led the Nasdaq composite down 132.30 points, or 3.16%, to 4055.90. But financial, industrial and drug stocks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 100.52, or 0.9%, to 11287.08. Recently rallying Treasury bonds, meanwhile, had their worst day in two months.  The Nasdaq composite is down 19.7% since its March 10 record close, just shy of the 20% drop that many on Wall Street use as a rule of thumb to declare a bear market in that index. The Dow industrials, by contrast, are down less than 4% from their record, and the other broad indexes are far from a bear market.
