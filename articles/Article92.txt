PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Aug. 16â€” Vietnam's Foreign Minister said today that Hanoi would not fight to seat the Phnom Penh Government at the United Nations General Assembly this year. For more than five years, Hanoi has been trying to gain United Nations recognition for Phnom Penh.  ''It is useless,'' the Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told journalists after a two-day meeting here of the Foreign Ministers of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.  In another development, the Foreign Minister said he expected high-level talks to take place in Hanoi with United States officials by the end of the month. Mr. Thach said he had proposed that the meeting begin on Aug. 28. [In Washington, the State Department announced that a delegation would travel to Hanoi for talks on Aug. 28-29 and that the meeting would focus ''exclusively'' on the issue of Americans missing in action in Indochina.] No U.S.-Vietnam Diplomatic Ties The United States lists 2,464 Americans as missing in Indochina, with more than 1,300 of them in Vietnam.  Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Hanoi. The Reagan Administration has made improved ties contingent on resolution of the M.I.A. issue and withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.  Vietnam supports the Government of Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh, which it installed in 1979 after invading Cambodia. Three Cambodian groups - the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and a group that supports a former Cambodian leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk -are fighting the Vietnamese and support a coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk.  It is the coalition that is recognized by the United Nations.  Among the officials of the Khmer Rouge is Pol Pot, who was the leader of Cambodia until he was ousted by the Vietnamese. At least a million Cambodians are believed to have been killed by the Khmer Rouge while Pol Pot was in power.  After saying that it was useless to continue fighting for Cambodia's seat, Mr. Thach added: ''Pol Pot is at the U.N. This will be a heavy burden for the prestige of the United Nations.''  Driven Out of Cambodia  Envoys from the guerrilla coalition have already fanned out through the third world to campaign for votes to hold their seat.  The coalition was driven from its bases inside Cambodia last year, and diplomats in Asia have suggested that the coalition will be hard pressed to defend its seat because of that loss.  Other Issues Discussed  A communique said that these were among the other subjects the Foreign Ministers discussed:  * Vietnam will actively try to revive talks with China on the resumption of normal, friendly relations between the two countries.  * Hanoi will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by 1990 but will retain the right to ''take appropriate measures'' if any anti-Phnom Penh factions take advantage of the withdrawal. Western analysts put the number of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia at more than 150,000.  * The three Indochinese Communist countries expressed willingness to talk with Thailand about a nonaggression treaty. Thailand has permitted anti-Phnom Penh rebels to use its territory for support bases.  Earlier in the day, the Cambodian Prime Minister, Hun Sen, said at a news conference after the two-day meeting that his Government would be prepared to begin internationally supervised talks with the guerrilla coalition battling Phnom Penh if those talks were limited to Cambodians.  The Prime Minister said talks to end the war could begin immediately if the two non-Communist factions in the guerrilla coalition broke away from the Khmer Rouge, the third faction.  The leaders of the Khmer Rouge, which is the largest of the groups with some 30,000 guerrillas, are Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan. Son Sann, the former Cambodian Prime Minister, leads the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, a group that is thought to have 15,000 to 20,000 guerrillas. Prince Sihanouk heads the third force, with about 5,000 rebels.  ''If Sihanouk and Son Sann are ready for a dialogue tomorrow,'' said Mr. Hun Sen, who is also Foreign Minister, ''then I am ready the day after tomorrow to go to a convenient place to talk with them.'' ----U.S. Announces Visit WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 (UPI) - A United States delegation will visit Hanoi later this month to discuss Americans missing in action in Indochina from the Vietnam War, the State Department announced today.  The visit was announced by a State Department spokesman, Charles Redman, who said the Vietnamese Government informed American officials in Bangkok today ''that they accept our proposal for a P.O.W.-M.I.A. delegation in Hanoi and they have proposed the delegation visit Aug. 28 and 29.''
