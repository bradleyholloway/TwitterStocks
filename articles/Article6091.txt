 Private Properties   By By Felicia Paik, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1998  Don Henley, former drummer of the 1970s rock band the Eagles, has just sold an eight-acre site in Los Angeles near Beverly Hills for $3.7 million. The asking price for the property, which he owned since 1976, was $3.85 million. In a January 1994 earthquake, the Santa Fe-style, 2,000-square-foot house on the property was damaged, and Mr. Henley subsequently had it razed, according to his real-estate agents Nick Segal and Bernie Katz of Dalton, Brown & Long in Los Angeles.  The buyers were Tony Krantz, co-chairman and chief executive of Imagine Television, and his fiancee, Kristin Dornig, an independent-film producer. Imagine Television is a production company owned by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard and Mr. Krantz, whose mother is the novelist Judith Krantz. Mr. Krantz says he plans to build a home on the property and is interviewing architects.
