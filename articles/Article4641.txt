 U.K. Tories May Seek Changes in the Party Following Broad Loss   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1986  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives took such a thumping in last week's nationwide elections that worried officeholders may demand changes in party policies and personnel.  The Tories are being put through a political wringer, squeezed by Labor in the big cities and threatened by the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance in their traditional rural heartland. Mrs. Thatcher, clearly troubled by the results, urged party workers to keep their spirits up.  The Tory chairman, Norman Tebbit, said the party will undertake a major study to see what went wrong. But some party officeholders said one of the big problems was Mr. Tebbit himself. They blamed his "raucous" style for making a difficult election a disastrous one.
