 Executone Files Suit Against BDO Seidman Over 1990 Acquisition   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1992  Executone Information Systems Inc. filed a lawsuit against BDO Seidman alleging that the big accounting firm conspired to boost the price Executone paid to acquire a Texas distributor.  In the lawsuit, which seeks treble damages from BDO Seidman under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, Executone alleges that BDO Seidman helped the phone equipment distributor inflate the 1989 sales figures. As a result, Executone paid $2 million more than it should have when it acquired the distributor, the lawsuit said.
