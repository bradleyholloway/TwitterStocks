 Good Officers, Good Care Can Result in Elite Troops   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2005  In early 1944 [Joseph W. Stilwell] led the Chinese troops, along with Merrill's Marauders, back into northern Burma to defeat the Japanese. With Stilwell's personal front-line leadership and the continuing upgrade of Chinese leadership, the Chinese soldiers gained confidence in their own abilities and became the first Chinese force in history to defeat a first-class enemy in a sustained operation. Stilwell had proved that, given proper leadership and care, the Chinese soldier could be the equal of any Allied soldier.
