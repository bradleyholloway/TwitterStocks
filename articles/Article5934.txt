 Dollar Loses Ground Against Euro, Yen   By By John Hardy, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  The dollar saw a high in Asia at 120.38 yen but then lost momentum and fell back in New York trading. The euro remained pretty much on the sidelines, although the euro/yen cross moved in a range of more than 1% as the yen's fortunes fluctuated.  The currency managed to regain some stability, however, after comments from Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami that a strong yen is good for Japan causing long dollar/yen position holders to bail out. Mr. Hayami's comments that a strong yen wasn't against the nation's interest, as well as his assertion that his remarks Wednesday on intervention were misinterpreted, served to boost the yen through European trading.  In late trading, the euro was at $0.9318, down from $0.9320 in London but up from $0.9302 in New York late Wednesday. The dollar was at 119.69 yen, up from 119.50 yen in London but down from 119.98 yen late Wednesday in New York. The dollar fetched 1.6533 Swiss francs, down from 1.6561 Wednesday, while sterling was at $1.4687, up from $1.4606 late Wednesday.
