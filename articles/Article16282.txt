 Buffett Expects Berkshire to Post Record-High Operating Profit   By By Joseph T. Hallinan in Omaha, Neb., and Ann Zimmerman in Dallas, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2003  McLane is one of the biggest such distributors in the U.S. It has annual sales of about $22 billion, with roughly two-thirds of that coming outside of Wal-Mart. Mr. [Warren E. Buffett] said McLane serves about 36,000 of the nation's 125,000 convenience stores, with average annual sales to each of them at about $300,000. He said it also serves fast-food restaurants, notably those of Yum Brands Inc. chain, which includes KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  It wasn't all good news. Mr. Buffett said the company's NetJets unit was losing money, especially in Europe, and was being hurt by a soft market for used planes that has caused it to take write-downs. But he said the unit, which offers fractional ownership of aircraft, is gaining market share. In the event that the industry undergoes a shakeout, Mr. Buffett said, "I can assure you we will not be one of the shook."  Discussing the McLane deal, Mr. Buffett told shareholders that Wal-Mart, through Goldman Sachs Group Inc., had approached him with the offer to buy McLane. Then, a week ago Thursday, Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe and McLane CEO Grady Rosier came to Omaha to discuss the subject. The deal was concluded in an hour or two, Mr. Buffett said, and was sealed with a handshake.
