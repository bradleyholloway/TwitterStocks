 GM Combines All Its Transmission, Engine Operations   By By Joseph B. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1990  General Motors Corp., in a further consolidation of its North American auto operations, said it combined its separate engine and transmission divisions into a single unit.  The merger of GM's Hydra-matic transmission unit and its engine division into GM Powertrain Division is the latest in a series of in-house mergers. In all, they have cut the number of free-standing GM auto-parts divisions to nine from 13 just two years ago. The new unit's headquarters are in Pontiac, Mich.  GM officials said there won't be any immediate layoffs as a result of the latest consolidation. However, it's probable that GM will see opportunities to cut staff by attrition or early retirements as the two operations merge. "We know there are efficiencies to be gained," a GM spokeswoman said.
