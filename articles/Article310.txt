LENOX, Mass., Aug. 15â€” If history is a fable agreed upon, as the saying goes, what story are we to invent that describes music at the end of the 20th century? Chronicle implies chronology and chronology direction. Direction, in turn, dares to call itself progress, though it would take some artful fiction or hopeful imagining to make anyone believe that at the century's close a new and progressive lingua franca will soon be coaxed down from music's Tower of Babel.  Yearly events like Tanglewood's Festival of Contemporary Music can at least freeze the present. This past week of concerts, sometimes three in a single day, have again been presided over by the Dutch conductor Reinbert de Leeuw, and performed largely by Tanglewood's skilled corps of students. New composers have mixed with established ones; there has been some 20th-century archeology, ranging from the sublime (Stravinsky's ever-remarkable ''Petrushka'' music) to the inane (Edward MacDowell's D minor Piano Concerto with Andre Watts).
