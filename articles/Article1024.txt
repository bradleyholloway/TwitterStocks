 Worry Over Dollar Reduces Volume Of Eurobond Sector --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1988  Uncertainty about the dollar is reducing the underwriting volume of Eurodollar bonds and is helping to make international bonds in other currencies more attractive.  But the new negativism about the dollar is far from universal. Early last week, traders said that Ente Ferrovie dello Stato, the Italian state railroad, is expected to offer a $500 million, five-year issue linked to a swap into West German marks. J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. is the probable lead underwriter.  Other syndication specialists believe underlying interest remains strong enough to ensure success for such an offering even if dollar buyers aren't as plentiful as before. They cite the success of recent offerings by Italy, which probably will guarantee the Ente Ferrovie bonds.
