 Dollar Eases on Rivals in More Range Trading   By Azam, Ahmed, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2006  Late in New York, the euro was trading at $1.2147, close to its intraday peak at $1.2155, and up from $1.2104 late Monday. The dollar was down at 118.23 yen from 118.40 yen, and at 1.2975 Swiss francs from 1.3031 francs. The pound was at $1.7489 from $1.7419. The euro was at 143.65 yen from 143.41 yen.  "The market has shown itself increasingly immune" to the U.S. trade gap, said Mr. [Marc Chandler]. That the trade deficit will be huge isn't a surprise, and with trading reduced ahead of the holidays, Mr. Chandler doubted there would be a significant reaction to the figure.
