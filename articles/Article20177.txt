 Getting Going: Make It to the End With Money to Spare   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2007  Edina, Minn., financial planner Ross Levin uses this strategy with retired clients, except he's more aggressive and sets aside just three years of spending money in conservative investments. "We try to replenish the cash reserve on strength," he says. "If we get good markets, we'll sell regularly. If we get a bad market, we might not sell stocks for three years."  Alternatively, you could designate your home as your financial backstop and plan on taking out a reverse mortgage at age 85. You could even purchase "longevity insurance" from an insurer such as Hartford Financial or MetLife. With longevity insurance, you hand over a lump sum at, say, age 65, in return for guaranteed lifetime income starting at age 85 -- assuming you live that long.  "Nobody knows how long they will live," notes Victor Friedmann, author of "The Loafer's Guide to Successful Retirement and Slow Cooking." "I'm looking at longevity insurance for myself. I see it as pure income insurance."
