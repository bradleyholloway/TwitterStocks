TANAGRA, Greeceâ€” In aircraft hangers sprawled over a 475-acre site adjacent to the Tanagra air base, 38 miles north of Athens, Hellenic Aerospace Industry is repairing or modifying jets and missiles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as well as commercial planes from a long list of countries.  At nearby facilities, the Greek company is simultaneously training personnel from Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, as well as other Arab countries from which it expects to receive large contracts for the overhaul of civilian and military aircraft.  Conceived in 1971 to make the Greek Air Force less dependent on foreign contractors, Hellenic Aerospace has emerged as one of the largest aerospace maintenance and overhaul centers in the Mediterranean area. It is providing stiff competition for its bigger counterparts in West Germany, Italy and Belgium.  'Incredible' Progress Cited  ''When I try to relate H.A.I. to anywhere in the world, and bearing in mind that the Greeks had to start almost from scratch, then the progress registered here is incredible by international standards,'' said Herb Mack, the aerospace center's general manager, who was assigned to the plant by a subsidiary of the Lockheed Corporation.  Hellenic Aerospace's biggest move into aircraft maintenance came only two months ago, when it outbid 12 other competitors for a contract to overhaul the General Electric Company's J79 engines, used by American Phantom jets stationed in Europe. Competitors for the contract, valued at about $18 million, included some of the largest European names, such as Fiat of Italy, Fabrique Nationale Herstal of Belgium and M.T.U. Friedrichshafen of West Germany.  ''This contract proves we can now compete with the world's giants in the aerospace industry,'' Mr. Mack said. ''It means we are now a competitive threat to the Germans, Italians, Israelis, French and British.''  Hellenic Aerospace has also received contracts from Namsa, a NATO support organization, for the overhaul and maintenance of Sidewinder missiles and for the manufacture of parts for the Patriot missile. And in early March, it signed a $13 million contract for the manufacture of the door frames for Airbus passenger jets.  With a work force of 2,600, Hellenic Aerospace operates as a private company with 87 percent of the shares held directly by the Greek state, and the rest by the state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank. The company is headed by a nine-member Greek board of directors, which is in addition to the operating management staffed by Lockheed, one of the companies that provided technical skills.  Spyros Karayannis, a Hellenic Aerospace spokesman, said that, because Greece lacked the technology to establish such a company, it signed five major contracts with foreign companies to serve as contractors. Lockheed Supplies Management  The Lockheed Aircraft Service Company provides the aircraft and accessory technology, and Lockheed Aircraft International is supplying the operating management for up to 15 years, until Greek counterparts are trained. General Electric provides the engine technology and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation the electronics technology.  Snecma, or the Societe Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, a French engine-manufacturing company, provides the overhaul technology for the Atar 9K engines of the Greek Air Force's Mirage F-LC jet fighters, while the Austin Company provided the architectural plan and supervised construction.  The original aim, Mr. Karayannis explained, was to provide overhaul and service only for the Greek Air Force and Olympic Airways, the national carrier. But it was soon realized that the investment was too high to be utilized just for Greek needs and that up to 65 percent of the total work load had to be drawn from foreign air forces and airlines. The aim is to meet this target by 1984. Handles 24 Types of Planes  Hellenic Aerospace's aircraft depot has a low-bay hangar with a handling capacity of up to 50 jet fighters at a time, and a high-bay hangar for two jumbo or Airbus passenger jets. It can support full overhaul, major modification and repair of modern high-performance military aircraft and helicopters, as well as commercial aircraft structures and systems, and now handles 24 types of plane.  The engine depot has overhaul and computerized test facilities for more than 20 engine types, while the electronics depot serves military and commercial airborne and ground-to-air electronics equipment and instrumentation, including communications equipment, radar units, missiles, gyroscopes and inertial guidance platforms.  ''From the start we wanted to avoid becoming just an assembly line owned by a foreign company, and to develop a multi-direction aerospace industry handling all aspects of the business,'' Mr. Karayannis said. ''This plan is now paying off, and more and more manufacturers are queuing up for us.''  Illustrations: Photo of F-4E jet
