 Stocks Enjoy a Good First Week; Gains of Major Indexes Encourage Bulls to Predict a Prosperous Year; 'Almost a Perfect Environment'   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2004  "It's almost a perfect environment for stocks," says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird. Inflation and interest rates are low, and the economy still is growing handsomely, despite a foggy jobs picture. "The same forces at work in 2003 are still here," he says.  Of course, stocks likely will face obstacles along the way. "We're coming off a very strong December, which I think sets us up for some sort of correction," says Patricia Van Kampen, managing director for stocks at Mason Street Advisors. The S&P 500 hasn't had a 5% drop since last March, based on closing prices, making it the longest stretch without such a fall since 1996. Ms. Van Kampen expects gains this year after a strong second half.  Others argue that slow job growth shouldn't worry investors too much. "I don't think this is bad news for stocks," says John Silvia, chief economist for Wachovia Securities, referring to Friday's employment report. Modest job and wage growth suggest the Fed isn't going to raise interest rates for a while and that companies should be able to maintain profit growth, he says. "A weak employment number doesn't mean a weak GDP," he says.
