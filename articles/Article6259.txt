 Coffee Futures Rise on Dry Brazilian Weather   By By Angela Privin, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1999  Coffee futures leapt on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange as a lack of rain in parched areas of the Brazilian coffee belt led traders to anticipate damage to next year's crop.  That news, combined with a report showing large speculators were heavily short, or holding large bets that prices will fall, spurred speculators to cover those shorts, buying futures to balance their previous sales, traders said.  While rumors of damage have circulated in the market for weeks, traders shrugged off the talk until yesterday, when lack of weekend rain and no sight of rain through next weekend broke prices out of their recent slump. The December CSCE contract gained 5.85 cents to 90.95 cents a pound, after hitting a high of 93.25 cents in the first few minutes of trading.
