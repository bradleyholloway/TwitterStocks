 Small Business: The Benefits of Using Your Own Bootstraps   By Spors, Kelly K, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2007  Today, Mr. [Seth Riney]'s business, PlanetTran, has grown to a fleet of 35 hybrids and about 75 employees. He recently expanded his taxi service to San Francisco with the help of some investors. The company had $1.5 million in revenue in 2006, and Mr. Riney expects it will reach $4 million this year. "It was the kind of business that could grow organically without spending a lot of money in the early stages," he says.  There are many compelling reasons to do it. For one, the fewer outside investors you take on, the less equity and control you forfeit to people who often have vastly different priorities than yours. Outside investors may want the business to grow as rapidly as possible so they can see quick returns on their money, even when slow growth is the better business model. "When you bring on other investors, you're instantly conflicted because what's in the best interest of shareholders may not always be in the best interest of you as the CEO of the company," says Bill Payne, an expert on private investing for the Kauffman Foundation, a Kansas City, Mo., center for entrepreneurs. What's more, keeping a tight lid on spending during the start-up phase means the mistakes you make will be far less expensive than if you'd spent a lot, he adds.  "Cash is king," Ms. [Brush] adds. "If you manage your cash well, you're probably going to do a better job of making the business work."
