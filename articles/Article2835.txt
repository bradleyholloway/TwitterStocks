 Fidelity, GM To Offer In-Car Stock Trading   By By Gregory L. White and Robert Tomsho, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2001  To use the system, drivers have to have a vehicle equipped with OnStar and subscribe to the service. That costs $199 or $399 a year, depending on the level of service, though GM has been making OnStar standard on a wide variety of vehicles and giving away the first year of service in an effort to expand its subscriber base. OnStar now has about 800,000 subscribers and is adding 4,000 new ones daily. The only additional charge for the Internet service is wireless air time, which costs between about 18 cents and 35 cents a minute.  Amid the growing popularity of two-way pagers and Web-enabled cellular phones, Fidelity's move is symbolic of the increasing competition for wireless-trading revenues and exposure. Among its 16 million individual clients, Fidelity already has 100,000 customers using its wireless-trading service. "By offering this channel, I think we'll see much faster growth than ever before, due to the amount of time people spend in their cars," Robert Reynolds, Fidelity vice chairman, said.
