 Loose Ends: Frayed by Recession, Japan's Corporate Ties Are Coming Unraveled --- Sales of Interlocking Holdings Fuel Nikkei's Tumble, Boost Foreign Ownership --- A Chair and a Crystal Ashtray   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Phred Dvorak, Robert A. Guth, Jason Singer and Todd Zaun, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 2, 2001  [Shunichi Suzuki], associate senior vice president at NEC, says he looked at his bloated empire of affiliates and thought: "Let's take a surgeon's knife to the keiretsu." He quietly reduced NEC's stakes in three listed companies, including Ando, in which he sold a 15% stake. Consultants had warned him that Ando, while still promising, would need large investments to stay competitive -- cash NEC couldn't spare.  Last October, Messrs. Suzuki and [Masao Motohashi], longtime acquaintances, faced each other across a table in a spartan conference room. "We no longer see Ando as part of our core business," Mr. Suzuki said. Another Ando executive pleaded for more time: "If you could hold onto the stock a little longer, our semiconductor business will bloom," both Mr. Suzuki and Mr. Motohashi recall the executive saying.  Between March 1999 and September 2000, the bank sold off its entire 4.9% holding in Hoya. Last year, [Hiroshi Suzuki] put one of Hoya's big cash-management contracts out for bid. Sanwa and another bank shareholder, which had previously handled most of the account, lost out to a European bank. Hoya also is planning to put out for bid the group insurance contracts it now has with two life insurers who are major shareholders. Mr. Suzuki expects those insurers to sell down their Hoya holdings. That, he says, could boost the presence of foreign shareholders, who now own 31% of Hoya, to more than 50%.
