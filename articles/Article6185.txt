 Visa's Dispute On Ads Recalls Past Miscue   By By Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1999  There was nothing wrong with the system. It worked just fine, and small banks loved it. But the big banks, who were paying most of the tab because they contribute most of Visa's $1 billion in annual funding, didn't. Their reasoning: Why should they, in effect, help small banks by building a home-banking system that the smaller institutions couldn't afford on their own?  Visa's entry into, and quick exit from, the home-banking business passed virtually unnoticed. But it was a sign of tensions building within Visa, an association that is owned and funded by the 6,000 banks that issue Visa USA cards. Today, Visa faces a more serious dilemma over how to satisfy both its smallest and largest members. This time, the issue is Visa's aggressive promotion of the Visa brand name, on which it spends more than $200 million a year in the U.S. alone.  Like with home banking, small banks strongly support the advertising campaign because it lets them compete with the big boys. And like with home banking, several big banks grumble that Visa's efforts give small banks national exposure-even though the big players foot most of the bill. Unhappy with Visa, Citigroup Inc. is already negotiating to switch as much of its business as possible to MasterCard International.
