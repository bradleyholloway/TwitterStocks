 Oh Deer!   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  John McCain: I am concerned about our ability to train our men and women to engage in combat. And also as a former member of the military, I know the importance of being able to train with the use of live ordnance. And I note with some interest, Ms. [Jamie Rappaport Clark], your rest of the story stuff here. Somebody's got to get these reconciled. We've got to get some objective person in here, or entity, because they differ wildly. But one that I don't think there's a lot of difference of concerns the Barry Goldwater Range. The DOD assertion is that [in] calender year 2000, almost 40% of the live fire missions at the [range] were canceled, and the rest of the story is that we have 99 Sonoran pronghorns in the U.S. You can't run a military efficiently, Ms. Clark, by canceling 40% of the training that's being conducted. You cannot do that. Now, we're faced here with a choice between the pronghorn -- Sonoron pronghorn, and conducting a realistic training for our men and women who as we speak are in harm's way. Is that our choice here?
