 Gold Futures Slide After Rising Before Election; Traders Reduce Exposure Established Amid Worries About a Legal Quarrel   By Maguire, Gavin, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2004  As the polling date neared, however, market watchers determined that gold already had "priced in" a legal spat and closely fought contest, and so deemed it would struggle to gain much further ground should lawyers be called in to settle disputes.  "The funds are realizing that interest rates could rise, or oil prices could come off further, and the U.S. dollar can rise after the election, and so are pre-empting those possibilities ahead of the election," said George Gero, a senior vice president at Legg Mason Wood Walker.  Players also reacted to the recent softening in the oil price, Mr. Gero said. The threat that sustained high energy prices posed to global growth also was supportive for uncertainty hedges such as gold, and so oil's easing helped tarnish gold's allure further in recent days, he added.
