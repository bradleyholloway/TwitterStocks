Two days after being hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat, Rockets center HAKEEM OLAJUWON, 33, was released from the Methodist Hospital in Houston yesterday after tests, including an exercise stress test, showed no problems.  He will begin supervised workouts today, but it could be a week before he plays again, JAMES MUNTZ, the team physician, said.  Olajuwon's heartbeat returned to normal Wednesday after doctors used a defibrillator to restore the proper rhythm. The irregular heart rate, similar to an episode he had in 1991, occurred during halftime of a game Tuesday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves. (AP)
