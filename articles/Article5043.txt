 Business and Finance [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1989  LIN BROADCASTING and BellSouth agreed to merge their cellular phone operations, creating the second-biggest firm in the industry. The accord, which includes the spinoff of LIN's TV broadcast units and a special $20-a-share dividend for LIN holders, may force McCaw Cellular to raise its $110-a-share offer for LIN. The pact also shows the Baby Bells will aggressively participate in the cellular industry's consolidation.  Manufacturers Hanover is near an accord to sell a majority stake in its asset-based lending unit, CIT Group, to Japan's largest bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, for an estimated $1.2 billion. Manufacturers badly needs capital to shore itself up against a heavy load of troubled Third World loans.
