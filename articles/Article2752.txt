 World Wire [12]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1995  PIONEER ELECTRONIC Corp. expects to post an unconsolidated pretax loss of 4.70 billion yen ($48.3 million) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996. In yesterday's World Wire column, the forecast was erroneously given as 6.8 billion yen. (WSJ Aug. 22, 1995)  Pioneer Electronic Corp. of Japan swung to a loss for its fiscal first quarter, and the consumer-electronics maker blamed the yen's appreciation against major currencies, lower sales in Japan of video equipment and increased global competition. Pioneer posted a group pretax loss of 3.06 billion yen ($31.5 million) for its first quarter ended June 30, compared with year-earlier pretax profit of 2.25 billion yen. Sales fell 1.4% to 114.67 billion yen. For the full year, Pioneer expects to post a unconsolidated pretax loss of 6.8 billion yen.  Tokyo Kyodo Bank could take over business left by the defunct Cosmo Credit Corp. of Tokyo, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said. The bank was created late last year to assume nonperforming loans of two failed credit unions, Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen. In talks with Cosmo's main creditor banks, all agreed to forgive 60% of their loans to the credit union but the agency wanted some to forgive 100% to ease the burden on the central bank and government to cover the remainder.
