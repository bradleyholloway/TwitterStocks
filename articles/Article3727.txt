 Personal Health -- Aches & Claims: Are 'Natural' Hair Dyes Safer?   By Davis, Robert J, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2003  Other "natural" products, which contain everything from rhubarb to soy, vary widely in their ingredients. Often these plant-based dyes also have PPD or related ingredients, a fact that's not readily apparent. One way to tell is to look for chemical names on the label that contain "phenyl" or "amine." While some "natural" products may have lower concentrations of these chemicals than conventional dyes, there's no way to be sure.  Whatever type of coloring you use, it's important to do a patch test first to make sure you're not allergic. Always wear gloves, and don't leave the dye on any longer than necessary. Rinse your scalp thoroughly after use. If you use a coal-tar or petroleum-based dye, consider a lighter color, and apply it as infrequently as possible.
