 Press Baron Black Guilty in Fraud Case; Jury, in a Mixed Verdict, Finds Executives Skimmed Millions From Hollinger   By Emily Steel and Ashby Jones in New York and Douglas Belkin in Chicago, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2007  The verdict came on the 12th day of jury deliberations and after three months of testimony from dozens of witnesses. Mr. [Conrad Black]'s three co-defendants -- Jack Boultbee, 64, former Hollinger chief financial officer; Peter Atkinson, 60, former Hollinger vice president and general counsel; and Mark Kipnis, 59, corporate counsel in Hollinger International's Chicago base -- were each found guilty on three counts of mail fraud.  "We're gratified by the jury's verdict," said Mr. [Patrick Fitzgerald], who led the investigation against former White House aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby. "We think the verdict vindicates the serious public interest in making sure that when insiders in a corporation deal with money entrusted to them by the shareholders . . . that they not break the law to benefit themselves instead of the shareholders."  Mr. Black was forced out of Hollinger in 2003, after an investment firm that held stock in the company began questioning management fees and noncompetition payments made to Mr. Black and other top executives. A subsequent internal investigation labeled Hollinger's business practices "corporate kleptocracy." The government drew much of its evidence from this investigation, telling jurors that the former Hollinger executives were the same as bank robbers and street criminals. Defense attorneys painted Mr. Black as a victim who was wronged by his top lieutenant and business partner, F. David Radler.
