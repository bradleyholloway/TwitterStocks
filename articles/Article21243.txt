 Bond Prices Show Nearly No Movement In Day of Waiting for Employment Data   By By Tom Herman and Laurie Seidler, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 1988  In contrast to the stock market, where prices fell sharply, bonds hovered in a very narrow range all day. Most interest rates finished at nearly the same levels as late Wednesday. For example, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was unchanged at 9.30%.  Trading volume often evaporates just ahead of the monthly employment statistics, which are exceptionally difficult to predict. As usual, forecasts vary widely. Some analysts expect signs that the economy's growth rate moderated last month, which they say will calm inflation fears and boost bond prices. But Mr. Leuzzi and many other analysts disagree.  The employment report is likely to depict an economy that "still is growing at a solid pace," with hourly wages "moving up rather fast," Mr. Leuzzi said. The figures "probably will exacerbate inflation fears." Moreover, he said, they probably will indicate that the Federal Reserve "will once again lift rates at some point later this month."
