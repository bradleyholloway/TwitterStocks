 In China, No More 'Easy Money' for Foreign Telecoms --- Motorola and Others Face A Less-Profitable Market As Cellphone Growth Slows   By By Ben Dolven, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2002  To be sure, many equipment makers remain profitable in a slowing market, and growth potential abounds. The number of cellphone subscribers in China, already the world's highest at 198 million, is likely to surpass the number of wired phone lines early next year. That's more cellphone lines than there are people in Northern Europe, and still it represents a mere 14% penetration rate in China. What's more, the average Chinese consumer buys a new cellphone every 26 months. "If you compare China with the rest of the world, the fundamentals are very good," says Albert Lu, Ericsson's head of strategic planning for China.  Cellphone penetration is now more than 50% in big cities, including Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou -- levels that rank with the most mature markets in the world. New subscribers have to come from poorer parts of the country. "The economics of the next 200 million [cellphone subscribers] are different from the economics of the first 200 million," warns Mr. [Duncan Clark] of BDA.  Motorola, Nokia and others are counting on China to start purchasing so-called third-generation networks and phones, which allow technologically sophisticated services such as mobile video conferencing. But even that market seems elusive for the foreseeable future. Third-generation service is off to a rocky start in Japan and Europe, and Chinese regulators have shown little inclination to push 3G services until there is clear demand for them. Minister of Information Industry Wu Jichuan said last week the government has yet to set a time to dole out 3G licenses to Chinese phone companies.
