 Cuttings: Planting the Flag -- In the Garden   By By Sarah Collins, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2001  All this has sales of red, white and blue plants booming. The Netherlands Flower Bulb Information Center has been flooded with calls asking about bulbs for patriotic gardens. Online retailer van Bourgondien just added premixed "Old Glory" and "National Pride" bulb combos to its offerings. And local nurseries from Virginia Beach, Va., to Santa Clara, Calif., report that sales of everything red, white and blue are up as much as 20% in the last month. McDonald Garden Center, in Virginia, has been discounting blue and white pansies and red roses by 50%. "It's our way of contributing," says owner Eddie Anderson.
