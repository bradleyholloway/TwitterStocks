 McDonnell Douglas Picked For Seoul Fighter Project --- Company Values Contract At $3 Billion; Opposition Expected in U.S., Korea   By By Damon Darlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1989  The South Korean government selected McDonnell Douglas Corp. to help it build a jet fighter and an aerospace industry in a contract the company valued at about $3 billion.  But the next hurdles may be convincing the U.S. Congress that South Korea won't take advantage of the U.S. and convincing the Korean public that the U.S. hasn't taken advantage of South Korea.  The announcement, at a news conference closed to foreign reporters, came after about two years of testing and deliberation in the closely fought battle between McDonnell Douglas' F/A-18 and General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16. The South Korean government plans to buy 12 off-the-shelf F/A-18s, assemble another 36 from kits sent from U.S. factories, and then co-produce at least another 72 planes in South Korean factories with McDonnell Douglas's help. The planes are expected to cost about $35 million apiece and the purchase of the first fighter is expected in 1993, the South Korean government has said.
