 Marvin Warner Sues ESM Auditor, Seeks $1.15 Billion Damages   The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1985  In a suit filed yesterday in U.S. District court here, Mr. Warner charged Alexander Grant and Mr. Gomez, who was in charge of the E.S.M. audits, with violations of the anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law, fraud and negligence in connection with the unqualified audit opinions issued on E.S.M. for 1977 through 1984.  The suit alleged that Mr. Warner held an interest in businesses that relied on the audited financial statements in deciding to invest in E.S.M. The statements were certified by Mr. Gomez and Alexander Grant, the suit said. E.S.M., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based securities firm, was closed March 4 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged E.S.M. with massive fraud. It owes an estimated $322 million and has been placed in bankruptcy-law proceedings to be liquidated under Chapter 7.
