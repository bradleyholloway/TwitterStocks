 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Compiled by Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 1986  Reaganites hope that intelligence cooperation among the U.S., European allies and moderate Arabs over Libya's Qadhafi will lead to a more coordinated anti-terrorism push. One Pentagon official says repeated statements that "promise retaliation" are partly designed to soften resistance within the U.S. to the use of force. But Libya remains the top focus.  "I don't think the president expects to stop all terrorism," one Reagan official says, but he just "has a thing about Qadhafi." Some Mideast experts charge that Reagan is underemphasizing the roles of Iran and Syria in world-wide terrorism. They also worry that if the Mideast peace process remains on the back burner, the Palestinians may get edgy and step up terrorism.  Congress seems sympathetic to some industry goals on taxes. One is to restore some oil-depletion allowances for large companies. Another is to trim the crude-oil excise tax in the House "Superfund" bill for toxic-waste clean-up. Oil-state members of the Senate Finance Committee plan an "emergency" package of tax benefits for oil drillers capping or closing their wells.
