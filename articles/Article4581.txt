 They Run, Kick, Cheat and Bribe, But One Thing They Never Do   By By Ann Monroe, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1985  Coached by Editor Tom Lamont, an avid sports fan whose idea of fun is a week at a baseball camp for grown-ups, the reporters play against teams fielded by the investment-banking concerns covered in the newsletters. They always lose. Last month, the newsletter crew suffered its worst massacre ever: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 60, Reporters 0.  The team's first game, with White Weld & Co., was "a precursor of things to come," Mr. Lamont says. A key member of the newsletters lineup hit the field "in wing-tips, with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth." The White Weld team "had an offense, a defense, a varsity, a junior varsity, cheerleaders -- everything but a band and a bus." White Weld, now owned by Merrill Lynch & Co., won 42-12.
