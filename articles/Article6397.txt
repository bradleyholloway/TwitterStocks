 Supreme Interests: For Some Justices, The Bush-Gore Case Has a Personal Angle --- Scalia and Thomas Were Campaign Flashpoints; Two Owe Jobs to Clinton --- A Son at Bush's Law Firm   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Jess Bravin, Richard B. Schmitt and Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2000  Justices [Eugene Scalia] and [Virginia Thomas] saw their judicial performance become an issue in the campaign they may now decide. Their names entered the fray in November 1999, when a television interviewer asked Mr. [George W. Bush], "Which Supreme Court justice do you really respect?" He pointed to Mr. Scalia, saying, "He's an intellect. . . . He's witty, he's interesting, he's firm." Gov. Bush was also asked whether his father was correct when he said, in choosing Justice Thomas, that the nominee was the most qualified candidate -- a question raised by liberals at the time. "I do," Mr. Bush responded. "And I think he's proven my dad correct."  Left-leaning interest groups picked up the cudgel in campaign ads opposing Mr. Bush, depicting a Supreme Court chamber of horrors if he won. People for the American Way spent $500,000 on one late-campaign television spot that parodied a credit card ad, calling Justices Thomas and Scalia "George W. Bush's favorite Supreme Court justices" and portraying them as ardent opponents of gun control and other "priceless" personal freedoms.  More recently, as a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, Ms. Thomas has been gathering resumes from congressional aides who want to work in the next administration. She recently solicited nominees in an e-mail sent to 194 Capitol Hill aides, including some Democrats. In an interview, Ms. Thomas denied any interest in working for Mr. Bush herself and said she wasn't soliciting resumes on behalf of the Bush campaign, although she acknowledged that Mr. Bush would be more likely than Mr. Gore to get help from Heritage.
