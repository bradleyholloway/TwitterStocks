 For Parmalat, the Name Smells Sweet; In Keeping Appellation, Firm Focuses on Products -- Not Bankruptcy, Fraud   By Saitto, Serena, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2005  The new television ads focus on Parmalat's people and products -- which include milk, yogurts and juices -- evoking the company's successful industrial roots. Former Chairman Calisto Tanzi founded Parmalat from a salami and preserves shop in the small northern Italian town of Collecchio. He made it big with what was then a novel concept for the dairy industry: branded milk.  "Parmalat's future starts with quality," the tag line of television ads says. Images of Parmalat's products alternate with shots of employees, farmers, retailers and consumers.  Several experts say keeping the Parmalat name makes sense because unlike scandals involving companies that sell services -- such as WorldCom -- Parmalat's products weren't affected by the company's financial shenanigans. Parmalat reported a 25% increase in gross operating profit at its core business in the first 11 months of 2004 to 238.9 million euros despite a 2% revenue decline.
