 More Eurobond Market Borrowers Avoid Competitive Bids Despite Higher Costs --- Special to The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1985  When General Motors Acceptance Corp. issued $250 million of seven-year Eurobonds last week, its annual borrowing cost was 10.44%. GMAC easily could have lowered this expense to 10.33% by asking an array of investment banks to bid separately for the securities and picking the winner.  Despite a general trend of rising Eurobond prices this year, competitive bidding for new Eurodollar issues has been "a recipe for disaster," says P. Joan Beck, a syndication specialist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., a leading underwriter of Eurobonds. That is largely because the winning bid for borrowers often turns out to be a losing bid for investors. As soon as such new issues are launched, "their performance is rotten," the specialist says.  "This year has been a sensational example of competitive bidding resulting in new offering prices that make little sense to investors," says Theo Max van der Beugel, a managing director at Swiss Bank Corp. International Ltd., a London-based concern that arranged the latest GMAC issue.
