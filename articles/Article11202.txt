 Letters to the Editor: Privatizing Public-Housing Problems   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1989  The average public-housing household has an annual income of $6,000 and by law pays 30% of its income in rent. That does not cover all operating costs, so public housing currently receives a federal operating subsidy of $1,225 per unit per year. Even if we gave the apartments to tenants for nothing, their new costs (rent plus subsidy) would be more than 50% of their income. That is a prescription for disaster. Indeed, public-housing tenants in my district -- and they are numerous -- tell me that they oppose privatization.  The Wall Street Journal, with its emphasis on hard economic analysis, should know better than to treat such economic realities as "technicalities." Possibly misled was your columnist, Paul A. Gigot, who in his Dec. 23 Potomac Watch article wrote that "Rep. Bill Green . . . declared that the poor really are different -- they aren't up to Mr. Kemp's ideas for home ownership." Well, to paraphrase the well-known Fitzgerald-Hemingway colloquy, "Yes, the poor are different from us. They have less money."
