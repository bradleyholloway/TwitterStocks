 Crusader for Island In Soviet Union Says The FBI Paid a Visit --- Seidenberg Says Two Agents Freed Him After Seeing Journal Story About Him   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1987  Mr. Seidenberg's crusade -- to get the U.S. to reclaim from the Soviets Wrangell Island, which is north of Siberia -- was the subject of a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal Monday. Wednesday night, Mr. Seidenberg says, he was visited at his suburban apartment near Washington by two FBI agents, Robert Osgood and Keith Bolcar, who questioned him about a recent letter he had written to the State Department concerning the negotiations.  An FBI spokeswoman, Barbara Wallace, said the agency won't discuss the activities of its agents or whether an investigation is under way. However, Mr. Seidenberg's attorney, David Nolan, said he spoke to Mr. Osgood's supervisor, who confirmed that the two agents visited Mr. Seidenberg.  At his apartment, says Mr. Seidenberg, he wouldn't answer questions and refused to grant permission for a search because the agents didn't have a warrant. According to Mr. Seidenberg, the agents then told him they were taking him into custody. They refused Mr. Seidenberg's request to call his attorney; indeed, he says they even refused to let him bring along a Treasury bond that he wanted to use to post bail.
