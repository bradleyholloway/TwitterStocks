 Merck's Quasi-Victory   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2007  One is helping to rehabilitate the Vioxx name and removing the drug's notoriety as a sticking point for investors. On news of the settlement, Merck shares were up 2% when the market closed on Friday. Merck's early decision to pull the drug off the shelves may have been the cautious choice, but ample evidence has since emerged that Vioxx is a good drug when used for the right reasons.  The small cardiovascular risk posed by Vioxx, as revealed in Merck's own trials, was only seen in patients who used the drug continually for a year and half. That didn't stop many who'd only used it for days or weeks from getting in line to sue. But the evidence was strong enough that an FDA advisory panel in 2005 recommended that the drug, with a new safety label, go back on the market.
