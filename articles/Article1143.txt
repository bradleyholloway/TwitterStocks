 Plan to Build Bridge Linking Italy, Sicily Proceeds but Still Faces Huge Obstacles   By By Michael C. Bergmeijer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1989  Stretto di Messina S.p.A. is forging ahead with plans to build what would be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, linking Sicily to the Italian mainland.  "The bridge should be up and operating in the year 2000," Mr. Gilardini said in interview. He said he is already being courted by foreign construction and engineering companies, which are after a piece of the contract, valued at about 5.4 trillion lire ($4 billion).  The project made an important step forward last May, when the state highway and railroad authority approved a feasibility study by Stretto di Messina that calls for a bridge 9,900 feet in length -- almost 1.9 miles -- hung up on two towers, each 1,320 feet high, with cables 5.6 feet thick. By comparison, New York's Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the longest suspension span in North America, measures 4,260 feet in length.
