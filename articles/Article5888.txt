 Showing Its Age: Fed's Huge Empire, Set Up Years Ago, Is Costly and Inefficient --- It Has Far Too Many Banks, Often in Wrong Places; Losses in Check-Clearing --- `Post Office Problem' Looms   By By John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1996  But the plumbing at the Fed banks seems to be getting rusty, despite their heavy spending. Rapid changes in technology, consolidation in banking and rising competition in some of their basic services threaten to make Fed banks costly relics. Except for the New York Fed, the system's link to world markets, many Fed functions could be centralized at far less cost and some Fed banks could be closed, federal auditors say.  What concerns some in Congress and its GAO watchdog agency is the sprawling Fed empire, which reaches far beyond its marble headquarters in Washington to maintain a presence in most major American cities. The Fed has 25,000 employees, runs its own air force of 47 Learjets and small cargo planes, and has fleets of vehicles, including personal cars for 59 Fed bank managers. It publishes hundreds of reports on itself each year -- even Fed comic books on monetary policy for kids. A full-time curator oversees its collection of paintings and sculpture.  Yet Fed spending gets little public scrutiny, even as the rest of the federal government struggles to tighten its belt. That's because the Fed funds itself from the interest on its vast trove of government securities acquired in its conduct of monetary policy. Last year, it kept $2 billion of those interest earnings for itself and returned the rest, $20 billion, to the Treasury. Thus, every dollar spent on a new building in Minneapolis -- or anything else -- is a dollar that could have been used to cut the federal deficit. Unlike every other part of government, the Fed doesn't have to ask Congress for money, and that's the key to its independence from political interference on monetary-policy issues.
