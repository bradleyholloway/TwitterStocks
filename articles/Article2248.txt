 Guess Shifts Apparel-Making to Mexico From Los Angeles Amid Labor Charges   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1997  Maurice Marciano, Guess's chairman and chief executive, said the percentage of Guess garments sewn in Los Angeles will drop to 35% next month from 75% five months ago. Guess has long been one of the largest makers of clothing in Los Angeles, using 60 to 70 contractors to sew its mostly denim garb. That number has been cut to 35, the company said.  Mr. Marciano said the shift was mainly "a commercial decision" to "stay competitive" and "lower costs." But union activists' nagging charges that Guess products are made in sweatshops, combined with various government investigations, are "a factor as well," volunteered Mr. Marciano, one of Guess's four founding brothers.  Guess's latest round of labor woes began almost a year ago when the national apparel workers' union, Unite, began an organizing drive inside company headquarters here. In August, Unite filed a class-action lawsuit against Guess and several of its contractors, accusing them of violating labor laws by failing to pay minimum wages and overtime. Guess fired back with a defamation suit against Unite and some of its officials.
