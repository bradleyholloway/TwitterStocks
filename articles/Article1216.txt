 Credit ratings of some bank obligations could be hurt by the thrift bailout law   By Guenther, Robert, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1989  The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, & Enforcement Act gives the FDIC discretion in deciding what obligations it will accept of a failed bank thus reducing bank bailout costs. Analysts believe this will lead to downgradings of certain bank obligations. The new legislation also allows capital to be set aside based on the net amount of swap exposure rather than the gross. This reduces swap costs and interbank exposure.
