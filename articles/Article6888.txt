 Microsoft's Finance Chief Quits To Join Venture-Capital Firm   By Guth, Robert A, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2005  Mr. [John Connors] leaves the finance job in better shape than he found it. Finance -- along with other support functions -- long had been relegated to second-class status at Microsoft, behind the core technology groups. With backing from Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, Mr. Connors in recent years revamped the finance role, installing senior finance executives at each of Microsoft's seven business units.  The job is one of the biggest in corporate finance. With forecast revenue of $39 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, Microsoft is the world's largest software company and one of the world's most widely held stocks. Mr. Connors oversees 3,000 people as well as all of Microsoft's procurement, real-estate holdings and investments. Microsoft reported holding $64 billion in cash and short-term investments on Sept. 30, before it paid a one-time dividend of $32 billion. The company generates roughly $1 billion in cash each month.
