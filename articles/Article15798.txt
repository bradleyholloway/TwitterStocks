 SUVs May Be Added to Supercar Project   By By Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1999  The Big Three auto makers have agreed to consider adding sport-utility vehicles to a government supercar project aimed at tripling the gasoline mileage of popular vehicles.  After meeting for more than an hour with Vice President Al Gore at a Detroit airport, top officials from General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler unit agreed to consider adding the popular, low gasoline-mileage cars to the program, said a senior Clinton administration official.  The auto makers have been pressing the White House to promulgate rules that would sharply lower the sulfur content in gasoline. They argue that low-sulfur fuel is a prerequisite for superhigh-gasoline-mileage cars. Last weekend, President Clinton proposed such a standard. In return, Mr. Gore pressed the auto makers to add the popular sports vehicles to the project, officially called the Partnership for New Generation Vehicles, or PNGV.
