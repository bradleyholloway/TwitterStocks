 International Paper is planning charge in first period for imaging businesses   By Welsh, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1996  In a move likely to result in a first-quarter loss, International Paper Co said in Feb 1996 it expects to take a $50 million charge for the period, largely to overhaul its lackluster photography-related imaging business. The charge, which amounts to about $1.35 a share, includes the write-down of certain assets, severance costs and cancellation of leases.
