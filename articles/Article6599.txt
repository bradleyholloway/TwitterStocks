 MarketWatch: Next Car: New or Used?   By Coombes, Andrea, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2006  Despite the advantages of buying new, Mr. [Philip Reed] says "there are huge savings" in buying a used car. "It's worth the extra effort that it takes to shop the used-car market."  You'll find the cheapest used cars through private parties. "If you're doing it right, you should save 10%" compared with buying a certified preowned car through a dealer, says Jack Nerad, executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book, in Irvine, Calif., which operates the car-pricing and information Web site KBB.com. But "you don't have that warranty coverage. You're buying a car as is."  Ask about scheduled service checks. "At 36,000 miles, a lot of cars go out of warranty. They also require a significant amount of maintenance," Mr. Reed says. "If the 36,000 service has not been done, it could be very costly for you to do it. At around 60,000 miles, you go through another major service point in a car's life. Make sure that's been done."
