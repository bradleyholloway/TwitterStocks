 Letters to the Editor: Love and Adventure In a Cold Climate   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 1999  In regard to your July 8 editorial "Air Power," in which your wrote: "Most Americans got their first taste of air conditioning by going to the movies. . . . People went in droves -- in the 1930s -- to movie theatres offering romance, drama and frothy escapist tales of the high life, and, in the midst of some fiery heat wave, hours of wonderfully frigid air."
