 For China's Foreign Investors, the Door Marked `Exit' Can Be a Tight Squeeze   By By Julia Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1991  A foreign company can exit a Chinese venture by selling its interest, typically to another foreign investor or a government agency. Failing that, it can agree with the Chinese partner to liquidate the venture. Either way, the foreign investor is largely at the whim of Chinese officials.  For example, Beijing officials have opposed Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s efforts to sell its 25% stake in the An Tai Bao coal mine, the largest Sino-foreign joint venture. Occidental apparently erred by failing to advise its Chinese partners before declaring its intention in January to quit the venture. That misstep cost the company valuable support from top Chinese officials and could delay its withdrawal.  Occidental may be learning what Sover S.p.A. has known for a long time: In China, you can't just pick up and go home. Last June the small Italian spectacles maker formally proposed to liquidate its 50%-owned sunglasses factory in Suzhou, near Shanghai, alleging that the Chinese partner sold pirated copies of the joint venture's products in the domestic market. But the partner, Suzhou Spectacles No. 1 Factory, denied any wrongdoing and refused to approve the liquidation. (Dissolution requires unanimous approval by the joint venture's board.)
