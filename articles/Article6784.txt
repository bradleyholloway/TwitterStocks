 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2004  The shareholder, state-run Banco do Brasil's pension fund Previ, owns 14% of AmBev's nonvoting stock and 8% of its capital overall. A spokeswoman said Previ has lost about 600 million reals ($206.2 million) on that investment since last week, when AmBev and Interbrew said they would merge.  The two beer companies announced last week that Interbrew would acquire a majority stake in AmBev in exchange for Interbrew assets in the Americas, including Canada's Labatt, 70% of Labatt USA, and 30% of Mexico's Femsa Cerveza. Previs investment director Luiz Aguiar says he will ask Brazil's securities regulator, the CVM, to look into whether AmBev paid too much to acquire Labatt from Interbrew as part of the merger deal.  The accounts were in five different Swiss banks, which Ms. [Natalya Vishnyakova] didn't name. The Swiss also froze accounts belonging to Mr. [Mikhail Khodorkovsky]'s colleagues -- Platon Lebedev and Leonid Nevzlin -- and Yukos shareholders Vladimir Dubov and Mikhail Brudno, both of whom are named in international arrest warrants.
