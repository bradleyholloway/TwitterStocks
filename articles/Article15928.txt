 Beaming Some Light Into the Darkness   By By Nancy deWolf Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2000  Great stuff. Think how he squirmed, and how many suffering spirits were raised that day. Yet "Messages" did not survive. In a way, it was a victim of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, when RFE was accused of fomenting rebellion. Mr. [Arch Puddington] refutes that charge. But he does find a handful of Hungarian scripts offering advice to the rebels or otherwise violating the norms of responsible broadcasting. He believes the safeguards instituted in Munich after that episode ensured that RFE/RL would become a credible and thus uniquely influential source of news and commentary.  Arch Puddington, who was deputy director of RFE/RL's New York bureau from 1985 to 1993, actually sat down and did the hard work, and the result, "Broadcasting Freedom," is the best record we are likely to have for some time to come. Mr. Puddington notes that "most histories of the Cold War deal with RFE and RL as footnotes, or as CIA-manipulated propaganda instruments." No one who reads this book can think that way again.  "Operating under the covert and relatively relaxed oversight of the CIA," Mr. Puddington notes, "ensured that the radios could avoid the meddling of congressional critics." That changed after the CIA funding was exposed in 1971 and the Radios' budget entered the political debate. Even when a campaign to close the Radios, spearheaded by Sen. J. William Fulbright, was defeated by an even more persistent group of political supporters, other critics continued to carp.
