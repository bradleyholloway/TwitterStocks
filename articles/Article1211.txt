 Letters to the Editor: Flight Attendants Protect Passengers   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1989  I've been a flight attendant for nearly 20 years and am proud of my profession. The hearts of the world stopped for a while on July 19, awaiting information on the crash of our Flight 232. My own heart bled on Friday when I learned of the crash-related death of a fellow flight attendant.
