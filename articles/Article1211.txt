 Union Orders   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2007  Last week the Columbus Dispatch published emails showing that Mr. [Marc Dann] and the Ohio Education Association are in cahoots to close down certain charter schools in the state. Mr. Dann was elected last November in a Democratic sweep that included Governor Ted Strickland and was helped by Big Labor. As a token of his appreciation, Mr. Strickland earlier this year proposed placing a moratorium on new charter schools and restrictions on private-school vouchers, only to be rebuffed by the Legislature. Now it's Mr. Dann's turn to send a thank-you.  The emails show that Mr. Dann and the union also conspired to decide which charters to sue, carefully selecting schools that were too poor to fight back on their own. So far, the AG has targeted just three charter schools in Dayton, which happens to be the district of Jon Husted, the Republican Speaker of the House and the Legislature's most vocal proponent of school choice. But Mr. Dann told the Dispatch that "certainly there are 30 or more that scream out for this kind of attention."
