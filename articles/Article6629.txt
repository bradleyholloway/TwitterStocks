 Leading the News: H-P President Capellas Resigns --- Likely Move to WorldCom Tightens Fiorina's Control As Compaq Deal Is Digested   By By Pui-Wing Tam, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2002  H-P said Mr. [Michael D. Capellas], 48 years old, had resigned to "pursue career opportunities." Regardless of whether or not he ultimately goes to WorldCom, H-P said he will leave the company and that Ms. [Carly Fiorina] will assume his duties. His exit is the first from H-P's new executive team, and the company said it doesn't intend to fill the position. H-P closed its $19 billion acquisition of Compaq in May.  One person familiar with the situation said that shortly after the completion of H-P's purchase of Compaq, Mr. Capellas informed Ms. Fiorina that he didn't plan to play second fiddle for long. He "wanted to go and run a company" again, the person said. While being wooed for WorldCom's top job, Mr. Capellas indicated that he "had other overtures," the person recalls. Mr. Capellas gave the impression those feelers were for CEO posts, too, but didn't identify the companies involved, this person said.  Despite Ms. Fiorina's reassurances, Mr. Capellas's impending exit spooked investors. In early trading, investors sold H-P's stock down 10%. In 4 p.m. composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, H-P was at $14.85, off $1.83, or 11%, wiping more than $5 billion off its market capitalization. Many investors said they had seen Mr. Capellas as key to pushing through the Compaq acquisition and to the continued integration of the two companies.
