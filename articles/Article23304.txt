 Stocks Reach Highest Levels In Past Month   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2005  An immediate catalyst was Time Warner's strong quarterly profit report and its announcement that it was expanding the number of shares it would buy back. More broadly, with Tuesday's Fed meeting past, investors focused again on signs of economic strength, such as tomorrow's report showing robust third-quarter growth and Tuesday's report of strong October manufacturing activity.  "That's the picture that is starting to be painted -- that the economy is pretty darn resilient and strong," said Todd Clark, director of stock trading at San Francisco money-management and brokerage firm Nollenberger Capital Partners. The sight of the transportation stocks hitting a new record, together with the broad buying volume on the stock exchanges, helped pull more investors in.  Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, rose 0.73%, or 1.35 points, to 185.12.
