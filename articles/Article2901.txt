 Aftermath of Terror: Trade Center Leaseholder Is Determined To Rebuild, but Will Wait to Make Plans   By By Peter Grant, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2001  "It would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of New York," said Larry Silverstein, who closed on the $3.2 billion deal with his partner Westfield America Inc. in late July. "It would give the terrorists the victory they seek," Mr. Silverstein said in an interview from his Fifth Avenue office. He hadn't given any interviews since the attack Tuesday.  Mr. Silverstein says that once the victims of Tuesday's attack are found and their families cared for, he will turn his attention to the insurance, leases and enormous legal issues. The 99-year lease is insured in case of an act of terrorism. As for leases and other documents, many of them were destroyed, he said. "It's going to take huge amounts of time to deal with the magnitude of the paper issues," he says.  Mr. Silverstein said he learned that the first plane had hit one of the Twin Towers when he was at his Manhattan home. He raced down to his Fifth Avenue office in time to watch the second tower get hit. Then he watched in disbelief as first one and then the other tower crumbled. Later in the day the Fire Department told him that the tower he developed at 7 World Trade Center also was about to go.
