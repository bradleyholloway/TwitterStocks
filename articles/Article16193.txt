 Disney Theme-Park Business Isn't Rebounding as Forecast --- Stock-Market Turbulence And Sept. 11 Worries Are Hurting Attendance   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2002  Combined with other Disney problems, especially its lagging ABC network, the news sent Disney's already depressed stock price tumbling even further on Friday. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Disney shares were down 9% at $15.31 -- their lowest closing price since early 1995. Some analysts cut their earnings estimates for the company and Standard & Poor's put Disney's A-minus long-term corporate-credit rating on watch, with a downgrade possible in the next few weeks.  Options might include deeper discounting of admission tickets and hotel rooms, or more aggressive television advertising. But Disney says it has kept a close eye on the discounting efforts of hotel companies and airlines, and has determined that such programs in recent weeks have not been stoking demand. So Disney will stick with existing plans. Those have been mostly limited to an adult-admission discount to its struggling California Adventure park in Anaheim, Calif., as well as some hotel discounting at the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Fla. There, for example, low-end Disney hotel rooms that usually go for $89 or $99 a night now can be had for $59 or $69.  Disney thinks business will perk up when measures of U.S. consumer confidence improve for three months in a row. The company was optimistic last spring that things were headed that way, but Mr. [Paul Pressler] concedes that it was "a lot of wishful thinking on all of our parts." But when consumer confidence makes a solid return, he adds, Disney doesn't think it will "have to wait six months to achieve the business results." At that time, Disney will increase marketing spending in hopes of ushering visitors quickly back to the Magic Kingdom.
