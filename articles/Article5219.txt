 World-Wide [7]  The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1995  Chairman Archer of the Ways and Means Committee outlined a measure that departs only slightly from the individual and corporate tax breaks promised last fall as part of the GOP's "Contract With America." The bill's centerpiece is a $500-a-child tax credit for families earning $200,000 or less. "We are keeping our word. Taxes will be cut. Relief is on the way," Archer said. But there is mounting evidence that the tax-cut bill faces an uphill course in an increasingly deficit-conscious Congress. The Ways and Means panel will vote on the package next week, and the full House late this month.  Budget plans are being developed by at least two Democratic House members, aiming to balance the budget by slashing defense and health-care spending and cutting Social Security benefits for some Americans. The plans pose problems for Democratic leaders, who have vowed to protect Social Security.  A product-liability bill is expected to win House approval today. The measure, which would be the last of three GOP-backed legal-reform bills passed this week, would make it harder for consumers to win product-liability damages. Trial lawyers are gearing up to fight the legal-reform legislation in the Senate.
