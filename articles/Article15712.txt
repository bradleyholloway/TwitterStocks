 Lawrence to Leave Post as Publisher Of Miami Herald   By By Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1998  Alberto Ibarguen, who joined KnightRidder only three years ago, will succeed Mr. (David) Lawrence as publisher of Miami Herald Publishing, effective immediately, and will take over next year as chairman. Mr. Ibarguen, 54, is publisher of el Nuevo Herald, Miami Herald Publishing's Spanish-language daily, and vice president of international operations for the unit.  It isn't clear yet whether Mr. Ibarguen's appointment will result in any significant changes at the Herald. The Herald's parent, Knight-Ridder, has gone through a major transformation in the past few years under the leadership of Tony Ridder, who took over as chief executive in 1995. Mr. Ridder has taken the once-diversified media company back to its roots as a newspaper publisher.  Mr. Ibarguen's background is a marked contrast to his departing boss. Mr. Lawrence is a veteran newspaperman who joined Knight Ridder in 1971 as managing editor of the Philadelphia Daily News. Mr. Ibarguen, who was born in Puerto Rico and grew up near New York, is a lawyer by training who joined Times Mirror Co. in 1984 as senior vice president of finance and administration for the Hartford Courant and later became executive vice president of operations for Newsday and New York Newsday. He came to Miami in 1995 to become publisher of el Nuevo Herald.
