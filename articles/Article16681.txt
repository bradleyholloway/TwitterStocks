 Politics & Economics: ICBC Could Raise Up to $19 Billion In Double Listing   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2006  As stock markets in mainland China have developed, the pricing gap with Hong Kong has narrowed. Bank of China Ltd. priced the shares in its mainland IPO in July at 3.08 yuan (39 U.S. cents) apiece, close to the price of its June Hong Kong IPO of HK$2.95 (38 U.S. cents).  ICBC wouldn't commit itself to a simultaneous listing in the two markets if conditions don't allow it, the materials said. ICBC and its underwriters will have to meet different disclosure rules in the mainland and Hong Kong, which could hamper its simultaneous listing efforts.  Merrill Lynch & Co., Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank AG, China International Capital Corp., of Beijing, and ICEA Finance Holdings are managing the Hong Kong share offering. China International Capital, Citic Securities Co., Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. and Guotai Junan Securities Co. are managing the mainland IPO.
