 World Watch   By Compiled by Chris Bain, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 2, 2002  The U.S. will fund a study of Russia's offshore oil and natural-gas reserves as part of a new push to increase Russia's role on world oil markets, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said during a visit to Moscow. Mr. Abraham also repeated U.S. objections to Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. Moscow last week said it would go ahead with plans to build five nuclear reactors in Iran. Cooperation with Russia on the oil front has been slowly growing since Sept. 11, when the U.S. began to see Russia's rising oil output as a useful counterweight to Mideast oil-market dominance. Mr. Abraham said the U.S. would pay for an analysis of four unexplored regions off Russia's Arctic coast that he said could contain vast deposits of oil and gas. Separately, Russia's biggest privatization sale this year was abruptly canceled when the government pulled the sale of a 5.9% stake in the country's No. 1 oil producer, Lukoil, saying it wasn't happy with the current market price. The move came just hours before trading in the shares was scheduled to start on the London Stock Exchange.  Romania became the first country to promise that it won't turn over any Americans suspected of war crimes to the new International Criminal Court. Although a member of the ICC, Romania, in an accord signed in Bucharest, promised instead to hand American suspects to U.S. authorities for possible prosecution in U.S. courts. The war-crimes court, which is backed by the European Union and Canada, is opposed by the Bush administration, which believes it could be a forum for political attacks on U.S. foreign policy.
