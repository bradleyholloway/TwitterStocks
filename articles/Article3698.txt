 State Farm, Louisiana Near Katrina Claims Deal   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  The Mississippi agreement calls for State Farm to pay at least $50 million to homeowners there. In Louisiana, details of the deal are still to be settled. While State Farm has more homeowner claims in Louisiana than in Mississippi -- at 221,000 compared with 84,000 -- it has fewer than 400 slab claims in Louisiana. There are two to three times as many slab claims in Mississippi. No timetable has been set to begin offering Louisiana customers a review of their claims.
