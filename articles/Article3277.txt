 Shell Canada Stresses Oil Sands; Playing Up Gains Keeps Attention Off Gas Declines, Critics Say   By Carlisle, Tamsin, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2004  Some analysts believe Shell Canada talks up its oil-sands gains to deflect attention from declines in its natural-gas reserves, which have fallen by nearly half in the past seven years, to just 1.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of 2003 from 3.4 trillion cubic feet in 1997. In January, a reduction by nearly 300 billion cubic feet of natural-gas reserves associated with Shell Canada's 31.3%-owned Sable Offshore Energy Project off the coast of Nova Scotia knocked Shell Canada's shares down to 57.70 Canadian dollars (US$43.22), a 12% drop from the 52-week high of C$65.85 reached the week before. At 4 p.m. yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Shell Canada shares stood at C$63.40, down 10 Canadian cents.  Concern over Shell Canada's reserves arose in January, when it said in its fourth-quarter earnings release that "revisions, extensions and additions to Shell Canada's proved reserves in 2003 were positive" despite the 300 billion cubic-feet cut in natural-gas reserves. Using an industry-standard oil-to-gas equivalency ratio, Shell Canada's oil- sands gains in Alberta equaled roughly 400 billion cubic feet of proved natural-gas reserves and offset the decline.  To be sure, Shell Canada provided separate breakdowns in its 2003 annual report and in its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That filing included separate management discussions of the two types of reserves, and it doesn't contain any estimate of total reserves including oil sands. Shell Canada's release combining the two was "an overall summary of the changes in 2003. We very clearly broke out the details," said Jan Rowley, a Shell Canada spokeswoman.
