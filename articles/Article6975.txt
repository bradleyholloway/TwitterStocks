 FDA to Bar Use Of Term 'Sinusitis' On Decongestants   By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2005  The agency released final rules that require drug makers to stop using "sinusitis" on products, like Sudafed, that are designed to relieve nasal congestion associated with colds or allergies. Some products, including some types of Sudafed sold by Pfizer Inc., also state they can be used to treat nasal congestion "associated with sinusitis," a phrase that would also be prohibited.  In making the rule change, the FDA said it found studies examining the role of decongestants for treating sinusitis "lacking." The data that exist, the FDA said, are "limited and controversial." Some studies, for example, suggest that using a decongestant spray might increase sinus swelling in people with sinus infections.
