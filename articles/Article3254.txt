 Why Comcast Covets ESPN   By Flint, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 2004  Since its launch to a doubting marketplace in 1979 (with a slow- pitch softball game between the Kentucky Bourbons and Milwaukee Schlitz that was sponsored by Budweiser), Disney's ESPN has grown from a single cable channel to a miniempire, comprising TV, radio, publishing and even restaurants. ESPN is one of Disney's most important assets: The company doesn't break out ESPN's results, but analysts and other people close to it say ESPN generates profits of more than $1 billion a year and is valued at between $15 billion and $20 billion.  It isn't clear that a successful bid from Comcast would ultimately lower programming costs. "They may say we're part of the cable industry, and we have an obligation to keep these fees down," says Barry Frank, vice chairman of Trans World International , a unit of sports-marketing and representation firm IMG. But as ESPN's owners, Mr. Frank adds, Comcast also would want to keep ESPN's revenues growing. Furthermore, Comcast also owns the Philadelphia 76ers professional basketball team and the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team, both of which count on television dollars for their operations.  Besides its flagship channel, distributed in some 88 million homes, ESPN has six other domestic cable networks, including ESPN2, in almost 87 milion homes; ESPN Classic, in 50 million homes; and ESPNews, in 40 million. It has the recently launched ESPN Desportes, a Spanish- language channel, and ESPN HD, a high-definition simulcast service of ESPN. Its bi-weekly publication "ESPN The Magazine" has guaranteed circulation of 1.75 million, making it a serious rival to Time Warner Inc.'s venerable Sports Illustrated.
