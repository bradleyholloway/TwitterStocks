 Oxford Health Loss Hits $507.6 Million   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1998  Oxford, Norwalk, Conn., had an operating loss of about $85 million in the quarter as it battled higher medical and administrative costs while a new management team mapped a turnaround plan. Charges related to restructuring, increased reserves for losses and other items pushed the total loss to $507.6 million.  The results were significantly worse than expected, and the big question is whether the managed-care company will be able to execute its plan and return to profitability by the second half of next year, as it has pledged. Norman C. Payson, chief executive officer, said the huge loss reflects a "thorough housekeeping" that separates Oxford's future from "the diversions of the past."  A physician and HMO executive who joined Oxford in February, Dr. Payson outlined a strategy that would transform the company from a once-formidable growth engine to a smaller but more stable enterprise. The company plans to jettison unprofitable operations and focus primarily on its core commercial-business products in metropolitan New York. Oxford likely will have fewer members and less annual revenue in two years than now, Dr. Payson said.
