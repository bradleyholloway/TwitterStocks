 A Nobel Tiger in the Tail   By Henderson, David R, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2004  What's the way out, assuming we don't abolish central banks? In 1985, economist Ken Rogoff, drawing on Kydland's and Prescott's work, called for an independent central bank, headed by someone highly averse to inflation who would resist the government's pressure to inflate. Just two years later, inflation hawk Alan Greenspan became chairman of the Fed. The result: in the last 17 years, U.S. inflation has averaged only 3%. And this overstates inflation by about one percentage point annually because the consumer price index fails to account adequately for quality increases and for the "Wal-Mart effect" of people purchasing lower-price items at big-box stores. Reforms that gave more independence to central banks in New Zealand, Sweden and the U.K. were explicitly based on Kydland's and Prescott's work.
