 Identity-Software Sales Are Soaring   By McWilliams, Gary, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2005  Installing and operating the management systems isn't cheap. VW estimates it will spend $4 million to $5 million for licenses and operating costs at data centers in Europe, North America and Africa using a combination of BMC Software Inc. identity-management and International Business Machines Corp. access-management packages. Courion says its password-management software starts at about $25,000 for a company with several hundred employees.  Using identity-management software can help achieve audit compliance required of U.S. companies under the federal Sarbanes-Oxley act effective this year. "It's not good enough to throw a 300-page document at auditors. You have to prove to the auditor that you have implemented all these things," says Joe Anthony, a marketing manager with IBM's Tivoli software unit. Identity-management programs are "very key to show auditability," he says.  For a company like VW that shares computer links with many outside partners, federation technology is the next logical step. "In order to reduce the complexity, we're going to federated identity management," said Dr. [Hans-Ottmar Beckmann].
