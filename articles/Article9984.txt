 Nasdaq Deal Gets Support of Analyst At LSE Stakeholder   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2006  LSE management has snubbed Nasdaq's approaches. Ms. [Tina Larsson] agrees that the current share price of LSE indicates that the Nasdaq offer "is not enough." As a passive shareholder, Ms. Larsson says her company has no plans to push LSE management into talking to Nasdaq about a friendly deal.  Meanwhile, Nasdaq Chief Financial Officer David Warren said at a conference in London that Nasdaq's November proposal to buy LSE for GBP 12.43 a share came with a "fair, full and final price that reflects the prospects" of LSE and the potential benefits of a Nasdaq merger.
