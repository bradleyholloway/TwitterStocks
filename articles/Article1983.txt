 Retail Sales Declined 0.1% in December --- Statistics Suggest the Fed May Realize Its Hopes For Slower Economy   By By Lucinda Harper, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1995  The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.1% in December to $191.92 billion, which suggests the most recent Christmas selling season wasn't as good as the previous two. Furthermore, November figures -- originally reported as showing a healthy 1.2% gain -- were restated to show a mere 0.2% increase.  Investors sent stock prices higher on signs of the slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 3900 for the first time since late October, climbing 49.46 to 3908.46. Analysts said the signs of a slowing economy allowed the bond market to rally, which bolstered the stock market's advance. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond added nearly a point, or nearly $10 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield about 7.86%.  The government's figures are seasonally adjusted, so sales didn't actually slip during December but instead rose less than anticipated for the holiday month. Without that seasonal adjustment, sales actually showed an increase of nearly 20%.
