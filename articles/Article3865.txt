 Dow Industrials Rise But Again Fall Short Of a 3 1/2-Year High   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 2004  Helped by falling oil prices and mild optimism about the Christmas shopping season, the Dow industrials began the day pushing almost to that 10737.70 mark, which the index reached in February. But then the advance ran out of steam, as the Dow finished at 10661.60, up 11.68 points, or 0.11%. It has risen 2% this year.  "It is getting a little frothy up here," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at New York brokerage firm SG Cowen, referring to the sharp stock gains of the past few weeks. "We did trade up to the high, but there was no impetus to get us through and we came off a little bit."
