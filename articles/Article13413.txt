 Politics & Economics: U.S. Still Luring Investors; Despite Scrutiny, Foreign Purchases Are Highest in Years   By McCary, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2007  Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who is chair of the Joint Economic Committee, which reports on and makes suggestions to improve the U.S. economy, agreed that the U.S. has always encouraged other countries to invest in a range of U.S. companies and industries, but with one caveat: "That openness needs to go both ways."  According to the Commerce Department, Europeans led among foreign investors last year, more than doubling their purchases from 2005, to $109.8 billion. A falling U.S. dollar "makes U.S. assets relatively attractive, especially compared to Europe," said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. Additionally, investors chasing high returns helped fuel a boom in global mergers and investment last year.  Last month, President Bush said in a statement that global terrorism and other concerns have caused the U.S. and other countries to focus more intently "on the national security dimensions of foreign investment." But he added that the administration "is committed to ensuring that the U.S. continues to be the most attractive place in the world to invest."
