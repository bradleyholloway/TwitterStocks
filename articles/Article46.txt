IN the long line of concentration-camp literature, the stories of Tadeusz Borowski occupy a special, horrifying place. As the author urged himself: ''Tell about the daily life of the camp, about the hierarchy of fear, about the loneliness of every man. But write that ... a portion of the sad fame of Auschwitz belongs to you as well.'' His collection, ''This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,'' is a heart-stopping study of man attempting to accommodate himself to the Holocaust, of victims abetting executioners, of survivors paying a supreme price in guilt.  A non-Jew, imprisoned for political reasons, Borowski lived through Auschwitz and Dachau. Six years after his release, as one of the most acclaimed young Polish poets and authors of his generation, he took his own life. A shared sense of responsibility pervades Borowski's autobiographical work and is the most propulsive force in Steven Reisner's stage version of one of Borowski's stories, ''A Day at Harmenz'' (at the Theater for the New City). Mr. Reisner, himself the son of an Auschwitz survivor, has, as adapter and director, undertaken a most difficult task, first in trying to dramatize Borowski, and second in his choice of story.  In contrast to some of the other pieces in the collection, such as the title story, ''A Day at Harmenz'' is one step removed from the carnage. It accents the strange averageness of the experience that some people had in prison camps, the apparent placidity within a savage environment. The author's spokesman, a deputy Kapo named Tadek, playing soccer on a field near a crematorium while victims are calmly led to their slaughter, becomes a silent, contributory ally in the inhumanity.  With certain minor embellishments, such as one captive announcing, ''This way for the gas, ladies and gentlemen,'' Mr. Reisner is faithful to the story. His dramatization is a thoughtful attempt at encompassing Borowski, but the result lacks the urgency of the original. We are left with views of a starved man greedily eyeing his neighbor's food, of petty thievery and cowardice. So much of Borowski's narrative power comes between the lines of dialogue, as in his description of the ''permanent fever'' that seems to infect the prisoners.  Mr. Reisner's play is a bit like an extended version of the rock removal in Martin Sherman's ''Bent,'' in which prisoners endlessly shift stones from one side of the stage to the other. Even the activity itself, in this case work on railroad tracks within the camp, should rivet our attention, as it did in ''Bent.'' Instead, at times the play becomes undramatic. For the most part, the actors seem self-conscious in their habitat; they are unable to internalize the horror.  On the other hand, the stage design is extremely evocative. Lise Engel's set, a railway leading nowhere, is like an arid stretch of Purgatory; as the captives dig, dirt flies, fogging the sky. Lisa Fahrner's costumes have a threadbare seaminess. Mr. Reisner's production has the look if not the mordant immediacy of Borowski's apocalyptical vision.
