 Efficient Networks to Be Bought By Siemens AG for $1.5 Billion   By By Alfred Kueppers, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 23, 2001  "I hesitate to say that this is Siemens's last all-cash purchase in the U.S., but in the future they will be able to offer shares as part of any deals," said Klaus Repges, an analyst at WestLB Panmure, referring to Siemens' March 12 listing. That move is expected to lead to more U.S. acquisitions by making it easier for Siemens to finance future purchases with stock instead of cash offers that reduce company earnings.  In the last fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 22% of Siemens' revenue came from the U.S.; it generated 24% of its revenue from its home market. At its annual shareholders meeting yesterday in Munich, the company said that within a few years the U.S. would become its largest market.
