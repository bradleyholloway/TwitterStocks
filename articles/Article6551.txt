 Mutual Fund Returns Are Different Amid New Rules --- Effects of Taxes, Sales Charges Make Some Impressive Results Far Less Alluring for Investors   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2002  Over the 10 years through February, the Vanguard index fund returned an average 12.5% a year, topping Magellan by 0.4 percentage point. That spread widens to 1.5 percentage points -- 10.3% for Vanguard 500 compared with 8.8% for Fidelity Magellan -- when taxes and the maximum 3% sales charge on Magellan are factored in. (These figures from Morningstar, following a Securities and Exchange Commission methodology, assume that fund shares are sold at the end of the holding period and that distributions and gains on sale are taxed at maximum federal rates.)  Ranking fund performance after taxes and sales charges also makes Vanguard 500 look considerably more attractive and Fidelity Magellan less attractive relative to a universe of other large, established funds. On a pretax basis, for the decade through February, Vanguard 500 ranked 53 of 108 diversified U.S.-stock funds with at least $3 billion in assets. Fidelity Magellan, now closed to new investors, was No. 64.  After taxes and sales charges, though, Vanguard 500 jumps to 31st place, while Fidelity Magellan slips to 71st, according to Morningstar. On that same basis, Van Kampen Comstock tumbles from 19th place to 67th place after taxes and the fund's 5.75% maximum sales charge.
