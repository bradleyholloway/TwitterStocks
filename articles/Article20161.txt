 The Call That Can Save Your Life in a Heart Attack   By Winslow, Ron, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2007  One big reason to call for an ambulance is the risk of sudden death. Up to 5% of patients go into cardiac arrest en route to the hospital. If you're not revived within two minutes, your odds of survival plummet. "If you go into a lethal arrhythmia while you're driving to the hospital, it's pretty hard to do CPR on you," says Barbara Unger, head of cardiac emergency services at the Minneapolis Heart Institute. An ambulance is typically equipped with gear to spark your heart back into rhythm.  Conventional wisdom is that people balk at calling 911 because they're in denial. But embarrassment and loss of control may be more important. Joseph Ornato, chairman of emergency medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, says a Baltimore woman called an ambulance for her first heart attack, but came by car when she had a second a few years later. Her neighbors, drawn by sirens and flashing lights, had come to watch as she was carried from her home on a stretcher, and she vowed she "would never let that happen again," Dr. Ornato says.
