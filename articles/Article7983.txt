 Raiders, Shorn of `Junk,' Gird for Proxy Fights --- `Time-Honored' Ploy Is Getting Wider Use   By By Randall Smith and David B. Hilder, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1990  Without junk bonds to finance takeover bids, some corporate raiders and hostile bidders are having to fall back on proxy fights and other shareholder votes to attempt to gain control of target companies.  With the annual meeting season just getting into full swing, raiders and dissidents have already announced challenges against Lockheed, Armstrong World Industries, Avon Products, National Intergroup and Xtra. Other dissidents are mulling tilts against United Airlines parent UAL and against USX.

Georgia-Pacific recently prevailed in a $3.5 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa, because Nekoosa faced likely defeat in a shareholder vote at its annual meeting.
