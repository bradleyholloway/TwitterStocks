 U.S. Trade: Olive Branch or Big Stick? --- Trade Representative's Bid to Calm Relations With Europe Hurt by Others' Moves to Retaliate   By By Michael Schroeder, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2003  In Congress, several lawmakers, including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican, have advocated restrictions on French goods in response to that nation's opposition to the Iraq war. In addition, farm states are pressuring the U.S. trade office to launch a formal World Trade Organization complaint against a refusal by 15 European nations to accept bioengineered agricultural products. After agreeing to shelve the issue until after the Iraq conflict, Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley in a letter last week urged Mr. [Robert Zoellick] to file the challenge quickly.  Agriculture remains the most stubborn hurdle, particularly since Europeans are resisting an overhaul of their extensive farm subsidy system. Mr. Zoellick wants to close the gap between the roughly $65 billion in allowable subsidies Europe's farmers receive each year and the $19 billion the U.S. pays its farmers. France, the most adamant about maintaining subsidies, also has been critical of other U.S. trade initiatives, including a U.S. effort to strike bilateral agreements.  The Iraq war has solidified Mr. Zoellick's view that trade on many levels is the most lasting diplomatic -- and antiterrorism -- weapon. Under the [Bush] administration policy of using bilateral agreements to open trade and reward friendly nations, he has opened talks with such Muslim nations as Morocco, and plans similar talks with Egypt. The U.S. also has worked with Saudi Arabia to help it become a WTO member.
