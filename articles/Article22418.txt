 A Special Background Report On Trends in Industry And Finance   By By Pamela Sebastian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1998  June went out in a blaze of heat in many parts of the country. That left some electric utilities scrambling for power and others happy to sell it -- for a sweet price. Ultimately, in a deregulated market, customers will be able to do the juggling, buying directly from the power market and adjusting their needs to rapid price changes, says Steven Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. "It will be much more of a true market," he adds.  But it won't happen this summer. "Right now, we're in a transitional phase where the consumer isn't `incentivized,'" he notes. But the utility companies are -- and they are taking several steps to curb use. Last week, several Midwest utilities asked customers to cut back on their use of air conditioning and appliances, and some businesses closed to ease energy demand.  The number of beginning golfers rose 51% to three million players last year, says the National Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Fla. At some courses, that means more wear and tear on the grounds and game etiquette. "The swearing and throwing of clubs is the worst," says Oneda Castillo, the teaching pro at Bobby Jones Golf Course in Atlanta. At Eagle Watch Country Club outside Atlanta, the grounds-keepers are on constant "wilt-watch" as the greens see increased traffic and heat, says Joyce Wilcox, club manager.
