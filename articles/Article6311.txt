 Lonely Causes -- Redbait and Switch: The Far Right Warred Against Fluoride; Now It's the Lefties' Turn --- And Fluoridators Still Win, Even as Ms. Sherrell Rails Tirelessly Against Them --- L.A. Opts for the `Poison'   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2000  "I came here to get away from fluoride -- to live!" says Ms. [Darlene] Sherrell, who started living 59 years ago in Michigan. "I ought to apply for asylum from the country that's been poisoning me."  "My okra is making seeds now," Ms. Sherrell says, moving inside, out of the sun. She is small, dressed in loose cotton, with hair long and gray, a face only slightly lined and teeth just a bit off-white. She turns a plastic bucket over and sits, letting a guest sink into her hammock. "Snug as a bug and happy as a lark," Ms. Sherrell says, reaching behind her to bring out a bottle of Guinness.  People who know fluoride as something benign -- and this covers most of the scientific world -- consider Ms. Sherrell's views dubious. But no one could doubt the strength of her devotion to them, or the power they have over her. She is fixated -- and realizes it. "There are 1,000 things I could have picked up on and gone with," she says. "There's no way to know where this came from. I never felt anything like it." Ms. Sherrell sets down her Guinness and rolls her hair up in a bun.
