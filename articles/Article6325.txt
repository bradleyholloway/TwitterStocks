 Medicare Monitor: How a Whistle-Blower Spurred Pricing Case Involving Drug Makers --- High U.S. Reimbursement Caught Eye of Newcomer To Home-Care Business --- Toilet Seat as a Talking Point   By By David S. Cloud and Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  Ven-A-Care Inc., the little Key West company where Mr. Bentley worked, bought the anti-cancer drug to administer to patients in their homes. He noticed that Ven-A-Care paid wholesalers about $10 for a 50-milligram dose, but Medicare reimbursed the company $56 -- for a hefty $46 profit. Incredulous, he started looking into why.  Mr. Bentley, 47 years old, is a stocky, tanned father of two who grew up in the Bahamas and married a woman from Key West. Her brother, Luis Cobo, co-founded Ven-A-Care in 1987 with a close friend of Mr. Bentley's, T. Mark Jones, a registered nurse. Mr. Cobo also runs a Key West pharmacy his parents founded.  Mr. Bentley joined Ven-A-Care in 1989. Having previously run a marine-supply store and co-owned a marina, he knew little about Ven-A-Care's business, known as home infusion. He knew even less about Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly, or Medicaid, the state/federal program for the poor and disabled. Mr. Bentley handled insurance billing.
