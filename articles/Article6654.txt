 Crude-Oil Prices Slide 2.6% As Warmer Weather Beckons   By Farivar, Masood, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2007  "It just seems like the momentum ran its course," said Mike Zarembski, an analyst at brokerage Xpresstrade in Chicago, referring to petroleum contracts. "It just seems no one was eager to buy ahead of the weekend, especially with products selling off."  Gasoline has led energy futures higher in recent weeks, as refinery glitches and falling inventories have raised supply worries ahead of the peak spring-and-summer driving season. Benchmark RBOB gasoline futures climbed to a six-month high this week after the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday a bigger-than-expected decline of 3.8 million barrels in U.S. gasoline inventories. The April RBOB contract fell 2.4 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $1.9021 Friday.
