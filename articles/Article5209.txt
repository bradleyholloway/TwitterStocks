 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By Compiled by Ronald G. Shafer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 1991  Senate and House votes expected tomorrow on using U.S. force will give the president congressional backing, despite heated debate over the reasons and costs of war. "Then he can say, `I've got the Congress behind me,'" says Massachusetts Rep. Mavroules, who opposes force. Iraq's rebuff at this week's talks tipped some fence-sitters to back Bush.  The Soviets say they will try again to communicate with Baghdad. But U.S. officials are pessimistic. The one hope is Iraq will blink at the last minute. "If I were Saddam Hussein, I would now start to feel maybe the Americans really mean it," says former Defense Secretary Harold Brown.  If war erupts, the U.S. will pound Iraq's army from a distance before committing ground troops, commanders in the field say. In addition to 2,000 or more air strikes a day, the U.S. would fire giant howitzers and rapid-fire rocket launchers to hit Iraqi positions as far away as 80 miles. "Silencing the enemy's artillery will be high on our list," Lt. Col. Pat Sweeney says.
