 Moscow Easing Laws Governing Foreign Trade --- Firms From Abroad Would Be Allowed Participation In Soviet Joint Ventures   By By Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1986  Soviet officials have told American business executives that Moscow soon will allow capitalist companies the opportunity to participate in joint ventures within the Soviet Union.  James Giffen, president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, said senior Soviet officials have told him that "business and trade motivations" have prompted Moscow to draw up new foreign trade laws that will take effect in "the coming months." Other U.S. business sources said they understand the new laws will take effect Jan. 1.  American executives and Soviet experts expect the Kremlin to introduce the laws with great caution to avoid ideological resistance within the Soviet Union and to avoid giving too great a role for capitalist companies in their state-run economy. They are concerned that rules regarding the repatriation of profits, corporate decision-making authority and other matters might damp enthusiasm among Western businesses.
