 Wired for Genius and Success, but Not Politics   By By Holmans W. Jenkins Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2001  Given their dislikes, you have to wonder why Mr. [Wade Randlett] and his friends bother being Democrats at all. Hostility to lawyers particularly animates John Doerr, the legendary venture capitalist who lurks in the background as Mr. Randlett's political godfather. Mr. Doerr was an early backer of such Internet-age wonders as Netscape, Compaq and Amazon.com. His No. 1 enemy is Bill Lerach, the frizzy-headed attorney and big-money Democratic donor who specializes in making life miserable for high-tech executives by suing them whenever their stocks fall.  Messrs. Randlett and Doerr figure it will be easy, with enough money and hectoring, to take the Democratic Party away from the likes of Mr. Lerach, the AFL-CIO's John Sweeney and Jesse Jackson. Those guys are the past, after all. Silicon Valley is the future -- and rich. Plainly the party must heed their command and transmute itself into something closer to the Republicans, minus the annoying Christians and anti-abortionists.  How dumb this conceit was is the central theme of Ms. [Sara Miles]'s story, though she prefers to suggest that the Valleyites just lacked nuance and a sense of history. Not that all their efforts failed. Their political organization, TechNet, did win some battles along the way, aided by such redoubtable allies as San Francisco investment banker Sandy Robertson and Dan Case, chief of the technology underwriting firm Hambrecht & Quist (since bought by Chase). In one of the book's most amusing scenes, Mr. Doerr goes to Washington and barks instructions at Jay Rockefeller and Dianne Feinstein, both U.S. senators, to get with the program on legislation to curb Y2K lawsuits. Amazingly, it works.
