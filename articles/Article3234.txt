 The Economy: UAL Seeks to Shift Some Costs Of Medical Benefits to Retirees   By Carey, Susan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  Some of United's unions reacted angrily. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 20,000 active workers, castigated the company for its plans to impose "devastating" cuts "not necessary for United's successful reorganization." The union said the carrier "enticed" more than 2,500 attendants to retire last summer by pledging their medical benefits would be protected. "United management's bait- and-switch tactics will hurt retired flight attendants on fixed incomes," said union President Greg Davidowitch.  A United spokeswoman denied that the flight attendants who retired last year were told that their medical benefits would be protected. "We were clear with them that we couldn't guarantee that retiree medical benefits wouldn't change in the future," she said.
