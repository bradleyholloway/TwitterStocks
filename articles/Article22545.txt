 Nasdaq Suit: Filing Tips For Claims   By By Terzah Ewing, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 1999  Two weeks ago, many investors discovered, via a form in the mail, that they may be eligible for some of the $1.03 billion settlement fund that resulted from a pricefixing lawsuit against Nasdaq Stock Market dealers. While the prospect looks tantalizing, many individual investors (and even their financial advisers) have been perplexed by the form and the process of filing it.  There are several e-mail addresses, a Web site and different mail addresses set up -- many with similar-looking addresses. The Web site for general questions is www.nasdaqlitigation.com, and the main hotline is 1-800-993-8991. You can also email questions @nasdaqlitigation.com or write to Nasdaq Market-Makers Antitrust Litigation, P.O. Box 180, Philadelphia, Pa. 19105-0180.  Request basic or electronic forms through the Web site or 1-800-933-6363. To request the basic form, e-mail basic@nasdaqlitigation.com or write: Nasdaq Market-Makers Antitrust Litigation, P.O.
