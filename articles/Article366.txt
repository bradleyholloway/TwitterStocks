 Catalog Critic: The Roast of the Town   By By Lisa Kalis, The Wall Street Journal,  May 23, 2003  What has buyers so jumpy? Experts say beans taste best when they're freshly roasted, and lose flavor quickly after a couple of days. Yet unroasted "green" beans keep for a year or two -- and cost half as much as pre-roasted. So with these countertop contraptions arriving at our door, we planned our own cupping -- that's coffee talk for a taste-test that involves slurping loudly from a spoon and spitting -- inviting veteran roaster George Howell, owner of mail-order coffee roaster GHH Select, and Peter Lynagh, who roasts 200 pounds of beans a week there. As they pondered volatile compounds and polysaccharides in our small-farm Kenyan and Brazilian, we had a couple of our own questions: Which cup tasted the best? And where's that smell coming from?  Our other models solved the singe issue by roasting with circulated hot air. The Hearthware roaster, $99 from Whole Latte Love, held the beans in a glass carafe so they were easy to see. But it roasted four ounces in about four minutes -- too fast, said Mr. Howell. Meanwhile, the smaller Fresh Roast Plus, $69 at Coffee Bean Corral, was fairly quiet and had a glass chamber that let us watch our beans. But our experts said that it, too, was roasting too fast -- three ounces in about three minutes. Slurping the results, our panelists pronounced the beans from both machines "flat."
