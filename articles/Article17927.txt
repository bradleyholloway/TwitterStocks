 Jet-Bomb Probe Points at Radical Palestinian Unit   By By John Walcott, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1989  U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that a radical Palestinian terror group that has close ties to Libya, but also appears to be forging a new alliance with Iranian-backed Shiite terrorists in Lebanon, probably is responsible for the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.  Although investigators say it may be months before they determine who blew up the plane, U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials now believe the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) probably placed a sophisticated bomb on the Boeing 747, killing 270 people. Intelligence officials also have concluded the bombing was a "corporate venture" sponsored by Iran or Libya.  "If you asked us if we can prove the PFLP-GC did it, the answer is no," said a senior American official. "But if you polled 100 analysts, 99 of them would agree it was the PFLP-GC."
