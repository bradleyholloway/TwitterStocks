 Ad Notes....   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1998  WPP'S ASIAN STAKE: WPP Group said it will wind up with a 20% stake in Japan's third largest advertising company, Asatsu, after the Japanese concern merges with the smaller Dai Ichi Kikaku Jan. 1. WPP, which previously said the two were planning a "strategic alliance," said the stake will cost $208 million and added that Asatsu will "make a reciprocal investment of the same value" in WPP shares. Plans call for a new holding company, WPP Japan Holding, to develop opportunities in the Japanese market in such areas as media planning, buying and research.
