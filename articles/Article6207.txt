 Theater: Staging John Irving   By By Amy Gamerman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1999  New York -- Moments into "The Cider House Rules" at the Atlantic Theater Company, a woman climbs onto a delivery table, parts her legs and starts shrieking. Up pops the fully grown Homer Wells (Josh Hamilton), a wide-eyed young man with a shock of unruly brown hair and a startled, hopeful expression.  Homer makes his entrance with all the unceremonious elan of the hero of his favorite book "David Copperfield," which begins with the declaration, "I am born." But while David Copperfield quickly leaves the delivery room behind, our hero will embark on a series of Dickensian adventures that never stray too far from the OB-GYN unit. Birth, abortion, venereal disease, hysterectomies, even an extreme case of eclampsia -- you name it, these gynecological dramas take center stage in "The Cider House Rules." We're even treated to a graphic lecture on how to perform a D and C (which stands, I now know, for dilation and curettage -- medical lingo for an abortion), complete with a display of the relevant medical instruments.  This sprawling play is set in St. Cloud's, the Maine orphanage-slash-abortion clinic that Wilbur Larch (Colm Meaney), a kind but emotionally detached doctor, founded for pregnant women in desperate straits. As he puts it, "I help them have what they want. An orphan or an abortion." It's one of the rare moments when he's not speaking of himself in the third person: Most of the script seems to have been lifted straight from Mr. (John) Irving's novel. While Dr. Larch is delivering a string of babies from that woman on the sheeted table, for example, he delivers lines like, "Dr. Larch made it a firm policy that the orphans' adoptive families not be informed of the names the nurses gave with such zeal."
