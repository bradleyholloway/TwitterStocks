 Crude Climbs on Norway Outage, OPEC Plans   By Farivar, Masood, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2006  "It wasn't a bad recovery for the week, but the market feels vulnerable," said Tom Bentz, an analyst at brokerage BNP Paribas Futures in New York. "Once again, the rally failed to hold, and you failed to convince that we're going to move higher."  Norwegian state-controlled Statoil ASA shut down the 115,000-barrel- a-day Snorre A and the 85,000-barrel-a-day Vigdis fields, while Royal Dutch Shell PLC halted production at the 80,000-barrel-a-day Draugen field. Statoil said work to repair the lifeboats will start as soon as possible.
