 Professional Detailing Surges As Nasdaq and Small Caps Post Gains,   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2000  Hispanic Broadcasting (NYSE) fell 12% after saying it expects fourth-quarter revenue growth in the midteen range, excluding a brokerage-agreement fee recognized a year earlier. The shares were at 32.50, down 4.56. The Spanish-language radio broadcaster, based in Dallas, expects fourth-quarter broadcast cash flow of $30 million, or 21 cents a share. A First Call survey of four analysts was for 12 cents. Also, the company said the fourth quarter will be affected by additional expense to promote radio stations in three markets.  Professional Detailing surged 32.94, or 39%, to 117.94. The Upper Saddle River, N.J., provider of software for the pharmaceutical industry posted a third-quarter profit that exceeded analysts' projections. Prudential Securities and Chase H&Q raised their ratings on the company.  Priceline.com dropped 2.13, or 31%, to 4.72. The Norwalk, Conn., concern that allows customers to name their own prices for a range of products posted a third-quarter operating loss that was in line with analysts' projections. But the company said softness in the sale of airline tickets in October and restructuring charges -- including those related to job cuts -- would hurt its fourth-quarter results. In addition, the company's chief financial officer resigned. Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs lowered their ratings on Priceline.
