 Multi Media: Tribune Co. Deal Puts Cross-Ownership Rule In the Cross Hairs --- Foes of Ban on Holding Print, TV Outlets in Same City Say It Is Outdated Now --- Legacy of Bluefield, W.Va.   By By John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2000  While the combination is expected to pass muster with U.S. antitrust enforcers and the Federal Communications Commission, a significant regulatory problem looms. The combined company would own both newspapers and TV stations in Los Angeles, New York and Hartford, Conn., in violation of the FCC's cross-ownership rule. Tribune Co. would have to obtain a waiver from the agency to keep both the stations and the newspapers in those cities, or else get the rule changed before the stations begin to come due for license renewals in 2006.  "The whole world has changed in 25 years," says Richard Wiley, a Washington lobbyist leading the newspaper industry's charge to eliminate or relax the rule. It certainly has changed for Mr. Wiley; he helped create the rule as chairman of the FCC in 1975. Now he contends that, with most cities served by dozens of voices, including TV and radio stations, scores of cable channels, satellite-TV services and the Internet, the threat of newspaper publishers monopolizing any single market is long gone. The National Association of Broadcasters also wants the cross-ownership rule repealed.  Tribune Co. already has sued the FCC in a cross-ownership dispute arising from its purchase of a TV station that serves Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and last year, nearly the entire newspaper industry took up the cause. In an emergency petition now before the FCC, the Newspaper Association of America, the industry's lobbying group, argues that, even if the rule once served a noble purpose, today it is arbitrary and unconstitutional, unfairly forcing publishers to watch as choice properties are picked over by competitors.
