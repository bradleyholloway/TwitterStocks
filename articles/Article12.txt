To the Editor:  In this Republic of ours, such officials and administrators who are appointed rather than elected are nevertheless responsible to others who are elected, with one outstanding exception.  Members of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, once they are appointed, are responsible to no one.  They set their own rules, whether the Administration or the financial community like it or not.  They decide unilaterally how to fight inflation, and there is, so far as I know, no legal way in which they could be forced to account for such decisions. The sole exception would be an act of Congress.  It seems to me that there should be some machinery to cause the activities of the Federal Reserve Board to be responsive, responsible and coordinated with the appropriate agencies of the Government, which are responsive to the electorate.
