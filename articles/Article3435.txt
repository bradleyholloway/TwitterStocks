 Enterprise: Firm Offers Designer Talent For Logos at Bargain Prices; With Internet, Businesses Can Cut Costs and Pool Work From Free-Lancers   By Bounds, Gwendolyn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  Designers acknowledge that in addition to a financial incentive, there's an ego factor when it comes to peer ranking. "It keeps it competitive and forces everyone to do a good job," says Columbus, Ohio, designer Michael Lancaster, a.k.a. "artboy," at LogoWorks. Since 2001, he says, he's taken in $52,000 crafting designs for LogoWorks. Designers also get paid extra for revisions as well as for additional work, like stationery, that the client might request.  The structure has the curious side effect of forcing designers to look beyond the pure commercial appeal of their work. Mr. Lancaster, for one, estimates that customers pick "bad logos" more than half the time. "They'll want swirls with starbursts and too many colors, and it will give you a headache." Peers, says the expert-level designer, will see that and "dock you for doing something ugly."  Meantime, the laissez-faire operational structure suits designers such as stay-at-home mom Heather Frandsen, a.k.a. "Sprigg," who averages about 10 new projects a week. Last year, Ms. Frandsen says she took in $35,000 in supplemental income and earned most of it from her Flower Mound, Texas home. "There are no meetings," she says, "and I don't have to interface with the clients who most of the time are talking in circles."
