One reason Louis Andriessen's music has been embraced by new-music audiences is that he has drawn on some of Minimalism's central moves - mainly its use of repetition as a propulsion system - but not to the exclusion of more harmonically austere or even outright dissonant styles. His work is a melding of the avowedly stripped-down and the avowedly complex, and a cross-breed of American and European musical languages. And it may be because of the way that combination of influences is balanced that Mr. Andriessen's music has been influential on both sides of the Atlantic.  That seemed the point of two installments of Sonic Evolutions,'' Lincoln Center's celebration of this Dutch composer. In the first, on May 5 at the Clark Studio Theater, the Dutch ensemble Electra juxtaposed Mr. Andriessen's music with works by three younger composers Mr. Andriessen admires. In the second, the following Saturday evening at Alice Tully Hall, the Bang on a Can All-Stars played two of Mr. Andriessen's works along with an hourlong reading of Terry Riley's ''In C'' (1964), a cornerstone of the Minimalist style that Mr. Andriessen incorporated into his own.
