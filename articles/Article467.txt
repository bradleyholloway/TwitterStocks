SYDNEY, Australia, April 8â€” Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser turned back a challenge to his leadership today, defeating a former Cabinet Minister, Andrew Peacock, in a special ballot for leader of the governing Liberal Party.  In the voting by 81 Liberal legislators, Mr. Fraser received 54 votes to Mr. Peacock's 27.  Mr. Fraser, 51 years old, had been confident of defeating Mr. Peacock since the former Minister for Industrial Relations mounted the challenge after the Liberal Party's defeat in Victoria's state elections last weekend. He is now almost certain to remain Prime Minister until federal elections scheduled for 1983.
