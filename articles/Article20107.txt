 French High-Speed Train Sets Record on Rails: 357 mph   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2007  Roaring like a jet plane and kicking up a long trail of dust, the black-and-chrome V150, with three double-decker cars, surpassed the record of 320 mph set in 1990 by another French train, and surpassed the stated goal of the train's maker, Alstom SA.  While in the days leading up to the test, Alstom said its goal was to top 335 mph, Philippe Mellier, president of Alstom Transports, said before the test that the train would try to break the record held by the Japanese maglev train. Normally, French TGVs travel at a cruising speed of about 186 mph.
