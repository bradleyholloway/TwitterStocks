 Companies Try to Score With Athletes Who Blog   By Kang, Stephanie, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2007  His criticism of Adidas' new signature shoe created an even bigger issue. Adidas, which wasn't ready to talk about the design, wasn't happy with Mr. Arenas's criticism, according to Adidas spokesman Travis Gonzolez. But "we all took a step back. We said, 'It's Gil being Gil and there's not a lot we can say.' We don't want to affect what he writes," says Mr. Gonzolez.  In the end, Adidas says it benefited from Mr. Arenas's commentary. The company reworked the design with Mr. Arenas, who blogged "I think people are going to like the colors, but they're also going to like the shoe." Starting in November, Adidas is releasing 20 different versions of the shoe, which is dubbed the GilIIZero after one of Mr. Arenas's nicknames, "Agent Zero."  Fans have responded. "Agent Zero: The Blog File" has drawn about three million page views since it started in October 2006, according to the NBA. That makes it the most popular athlete blog on the NBA's Web site, says the NBA. Mr. Arenas is the only one of the group from last year still posting, though he'll be joined this season by new NBA player bloggers -- the Utah Jazz's Morris Almond and the Chicago Bulls' Luol Deng.
