 Deals & Deal Makers -- Playtime Ends: EToys Infusion Shows Funding Gets Tougher   By By Lisa Bannon and Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2000  The transaction was initiated by Promethean, which first met with eToys executives nearly two months ago. Mr. Schoch says eToys spent about a month looking to close the deal and didn't really consider many other financing options. "The public markets have essentially closed the door on everyone," he says. "The private market is the only one really working right now. They're more discriminating and focused."  The convertible preferred-share issue announced yesterday to Promethean and two other private equity funds could result in their owning anywhere from 4% to 13% of eToys eventually. The 10,000 Series-D convertible shares carry a 7% dividend (the public market rate is closer to 6%, dealers say), which is payable either in cash or additional eToys stock.  Still, eToys' chief financial officer, Steven Schoch, says that given market conditions the deal is good for the company, as well as for shareholders. Even if eToys had been able to issue common stock in a secondary offering -- something that would have been virtually impossible in the current climate -- it would have had to sell about 16.7 million shares to raise $100 million at current stock prices. That would have meant increasing the number of shares outstanding by 12% to raise the same amount.
