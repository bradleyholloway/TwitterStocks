 In Wake of Wal-Mart Deal, Shares Of Farah May Stop Slacking Off   By By Jeff D. Opdyke, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1997  After topping out at nearly $22 a share in March 1994 amid excitement over the company's pioneering wrinkle-free trousers, Farah's stock has spent much of the time since then trading between $6 and $8. Investors bailed out of the shares during a string of deep quarterly losses stemming from competition in the wrinkle-free market that left Farah holding huge supplies of unsold pants that had to be marked down drastically to be moved.  Now Farah is bursting at the seams. On the strength of stronger-than-expected earnings, a more focused sales strategy and news of a deal with Wal-Mart Stores, the shares recently pushed past $10 for the first time since October 1994. The surge, say some analysts, could be just the beginning of a substantial move.  However, submerged in the red ink was a one-time charge of $2.5 million, or 24 cents a share, related to a fire that destroyed the company's production plant in Galway, Ireland. Factor out the charge and Farah earned five cents a share, topping analysts' consensus projections of a penny a share. (Some analysts even say the fire was a blessing in disguise; it will allow Farah to shift production from Ireland to North Africa, where labor costs are lower.)
