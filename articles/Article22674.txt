 A Long Love Affair With the PC Might Be Holding Back the U.S.   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2000  c EVER SINCE THE personal computer came on the scene in the 1970s, the U.S. has dominated the digital world. Most of the new technologies and applications flowing from the PC -- including multimedia, local networks and the Internet -- were invented in the U.S. and adopted there first and most extensively.  Europeans and Japanese, not Americans, are first to get all the cool new wireless stuff. Their wireless voice and data networks are more extensive and will soon be much faster than those in the U.S. Their wireless-device companies are the leaders. Teenagers in Tokyo have far more versatile digital mobile phones than power users in New York do, and they use them for e-mail, games and a whole lot more. A potent consortium called Symbian, dominated by British and Scandinavian companies, is planning even more wireless innovation.  Of course, all is not lost for America. For one thing, the PC and the U.S. still dominate today. And there are some bright spots on the wireless and info-appliance fronts. U.S. companies like Palm and Handspring, America Online, Metricom and Motorola get it. Even some traditional computer-hardware makers, like Compaq and Gateway, are preparing to sell appliances. Also, a host of American software and Internet companies, including Microsoft, are gearing up for the wireless Web.
