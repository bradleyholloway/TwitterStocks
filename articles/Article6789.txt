 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Hollywood Report: The 'Passion' Payday; Gibson May Make $350 Million, One of Industry's Top Takes; A Challenge to George Lucas   By John Lippman and Merissa Marr, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2004  Not even the distributor of "Passion," Newmarket Films, anticipated the size of the audiences that have been flocking into theaters since the movie's opening on Feb. 25. "I don't think anyone expected the film to do $125 million in the first five days," says Robert Schwartz, Newmarket's senior vice president of marketing and distribution. "We thought it might be capable of $45 million to $50 million, but beyond that it's a big gap."  Calculating Mr. [MEL GIBSON]'s personal take of at least $350 million is fairly straightforward, although the final total will depend on a number of complicated factors. According to people familiar with the film, if the U.S. box-office receipts from "Passion" reach $400 million -- as many observers now expect -- Mr. Gibson will take home about $108 million. That number is derived by subtracting the theaters' share of the box-office receipts, Newmarket's distribution fee, and production and marketing costs. A spokesman for Mr. Gibson said he wasn't available for comment.  Mr. Gibson hasn't announced his next movie project. A spokeswoman for Twentieth Century Fox says he is still "attached" to star in the fourth "Mad Max" movie, which the studio had hoped to release this summer. The movie is now mired in development limbo, but Mr. Gibson said recently that he is no longer interested in being in it. Fox has completed production on "Paparazzi," a thriller produced by Mr. Gibson's Icon Entertainment, but no release date has been set. In a recent TV interview, Mr. Gibson remarked that there are other stories in the Bible he could foresee making into movies.
