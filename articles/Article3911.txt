 Blue Chips Fall Close to 10000, Finish off 1.14%; Upbeat Profit Announcements Can't Outweigh Inflation News; Fifth Decline in Six Sessions   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2005  Upbeat profit announcements couldn't outweigh bad inflation news contained in both the March consumer-price report and the Federal Reserve's "beige book" report on the economy.  "Buyers seemed just to pull away. They were willing to let stocks drop," said stock trader Michael Driscoll at New York brokerage firm Bear Stearns. "There was no one who was going to be heroic enough to stand here and buy."  The Dow industrials have been unable to stay lastingly above 10000 since first crossing that mark in March 1999. They have fallen back and finished below that level 24 times since then, and are threatening to do it for a 25th time. They last finished below 10000 Oct. 26.
