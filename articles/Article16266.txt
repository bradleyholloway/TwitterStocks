 Qwest Seeks Wireless-Lease Deals   By By Almar Latour, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2003  Qwest officials hope to expand their wireless offerings and bundle them with other Qwest services that are offered nationwide. Still, wireless carriers in the U.S. have been struggling because there are already six national players and price competition has been intense.  In Europe, several companies including BT Group PLC and T-Mobile International AG's United Kingdom unit have already tried similar efforts in recent years, with mixed success. BT has such an arrangement with wireless company mmO2 PLC, BT's former wireless arm, for corporate customers, while it has an agreement with T-Mobile, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, for consumers. In the U.S., Virgin Mobile and Sprint two years ago established a wireless joint venture, branded Virgin and running on Sprint's network, aimed at signing up young mobile-phone users.
