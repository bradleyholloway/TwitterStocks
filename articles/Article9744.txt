 Asbestos-Related Firms Catch Fire, but Some Are Wary   By Gregory Zuckerman and Daniel Nasaw, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2004  Asbestos, a chemical substance once widely used as a fire retardant, is known to have caused debilitating and often fatal lung disease to some of those exposed to it. Asbestos began to be widely used in construction and in other areas after World War II. Beginning in the 1970s, trial lawyers began suing manufacturers of asbestos products claiming that their clients suffered injury from asbestos exposure. The number of claims has increased in recent years as more workers have become sick from exposure, and as plaintiffs' lawyers have become more aggressive at seeking out possible claimants. A 2002 study by Rand Corp., a nonprofit think tank, estimates asbestos-related liabilities could exceed $250 billion.  If asbestos legislation doesn't happen in the near future, "there's going to be carnage in the group," said Jim Barrett, an analyst with C.L. King & Associates who has a neutral rating on USG and doesn't own any shares of the company.  Selling the stake would be more complicated than Aon's sale. Marsh's 9.7% ownership of Axis is through direct stock ownership as well as stakes in investment funds, including a private-equity fund managed by a Marsh unit. These Marsh-affiliated funds generally are required to act in all their investors' best interests, so any decision to sell Axis shares couldn't be driven by Marsh's objectives alone, according to a person familiar with the matter. A person close to Mr. [Eliot Spitzer]'s probe said Marsh's stake in Axis hasn't been a focal point of his investigation.
