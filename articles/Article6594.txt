 Delta Instructors Resume Nonunion Status   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2002  Delta is the least unionized of the major airlines, with only its pilots and a handful of dispatchers unionized. In a statement, the airline said, "Delta's management team has stated repeatedly the belief that it is in the best interests of both the airline and Delta employees to communicate directly and openly, without the intervention of a third party. Therefore, Delta is pleased that the pilot ground training instructors have chosen to return to nonunion status."
