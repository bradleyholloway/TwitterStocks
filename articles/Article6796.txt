 Martin Act Martinet   By Vacco, Dennis, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2004  Last September, Mr. [Eliot Spitzer] assembled a controversial bundling of the Martin Act and an obscure provision of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Rule 22(c)-1 to bring a criminal complaint for alleged violations of the Martin Act. The illegal practice? "Late trading." The alleged criminality is said to occur when a mutual fund is traded after 4 p.m. The problem is that neither the Martin Act nor Rule 22(c)-1 makes any reference to "4 p.m." or "late trading." While Rule 22(c)-1 embodies a complicated formula for the computation of net asset value (NAV), it is strikingly devoid of any specific time of day after which a trade would be "late." In fact, it is well known that most mutual funds do not calculate their NAV until 5:30 p.m. or so. As if to underscore this statutory lapse, the SEC in December proposed replacing Rule 22(c)-1 with one that would establish a "hard 4 p.m." cutoff.
