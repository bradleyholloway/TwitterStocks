 Index Futures Trading Curbs Are Supported --- Staff of Brady Panel to Urge Mandatory Daily Limits Be Adopted, Source Says   By By Richard E. Rustin and Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 1987  Mandatory daily limits on price swings of stock index futures contracts will be urged by the staff of the presidential commission studying October's market crash, according to a source familiar with the staff's thinking.  Robert Glauber, head of the commission staff, said no recommendations have been prepared, and declined to say if the staff is contemplating placing limits on stock index futures. Nicholas Brady, chairman of the commission, couldn't be reached for comment.  Until the crash, there weren't any price-swing limits on the futures contracts. Since then, exchanges have required them on an emergency basis. The entire stock-index futures market is trading with limits already, subject to approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
