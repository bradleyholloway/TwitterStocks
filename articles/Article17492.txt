 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Spy vs. Sub   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 1985  The FBI has already arrested three men -- John A. Walker Jr., a retired warrant officer; his son Michael, an enlisted man on the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Nimitz; and his brother Arthur, a retired lieutenant commander employed by a naval contractor in Virginia. All three had access to vital secrets, in particular regarding our nuclear-armed submarines and our anti-submarine warfare programs. Navy investigators reportedly found stolen documents near Michael Walker's bunk on the Nimitz -- where he handled secret communications -- weighing several pounds.  What we do know suggests the Walkers are only the most visible part of a vast Soviet program aimed at finding a way to track and destroy U.S. submarines at sea. The Soviets have already tested, aboard their Salyut space station, a synthetic aperture radar that may render the invisibility of submerged subs a thing of the past. The radar reads subtle waves created by U.S. subs as they churn through the water. The Soviets are at work at detecting thermal disturbances, or even changes in plankton, that submarines cause, as well. As early as July 1981, in Izvestia, Soviet scientist B. Nelepo argued that "because of satellites we can know not only the surface patterns of {ocean} phenomenon, but also the volumetric, deep picture."
