 Bayou Transfers Set Off Alarms; As Money Moved About the Globe, The Stories Got More Creative; Bank Employees Blow the Whistle   By Ian McDonald, John R. Emshwiller and Ianthe Jeanne Dugan, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  Bayou's woes burst into public view last month, after Mr. [Sam Israel III], 46 years old, announced he was closing shop but failed to return investors' money. Authorities say investors had entrusted his Stamford, Conn., firm with more than $300 million, and Bayou claimed that those assets had grown to well over $400 million. But federal prosecutors say in a Sept. 1 civil suit that the firm had "overstated gains, understated losses and reported gains where there were losses" since 1998, the year after it started investing. The suit calls Bayou's assets, including the $100 million seized by Arizona, "the proceeds of criminal activity" and demands that all remaining funds to be turned over to the federal government for return to the investors.  The authorities decided they had stumbled upon a massive attempt at what experts call "prime bank instrument fraud." Perpetrators, Mr. [Holmes] explains, "use specific language, like MT103, that implies some kind of special knowledge, but it's just an emperor's-new-clothes situation." The funds are funneled through various institutions to "remain ahead of the trailing train of original victim investors," an Arizona investigator adds in court papers.  That's what Arizona officials say was attempted at Wachovia, Smith Barney and Commerce Bank. "These three financial institutions are really good examples of compliance people working smoothly with customer service people," says Mr. Holmes. "It's also an excellent example of people resisting the lure of a big deposit." (Wachovia and Smith Barney declined to comment; representatives of Commerce Bank didn't return calls.)
