 NCNB Walks Loudly, Carries a Big Stick --- Suitor's Boldness Presages Battle With Citizens   By By Rick Christie and Glenn Ruffenach, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1989  With those words, Hugh L. McColl, chairman of NCNB Corp., began his quest Thursday to acquire Citizens & Southern Corp., the sixth-largest banking company in the Southeast. The message, according to top strategists at Citizens, was addressed to none other than Bennett A. Brown, Citizens' chairman, when Mr. Brown asked for time to meet with board members.  The exchange reflects the difficulties that NCNB now faces in its efforts to buy Citizens. On Monday, Citizens rejected NCNB's $2.4 billion merger proposal as "clearly inadequate." NCNB responded by asking Citizens to reconsider the offer. But NCNB's aggressive approach has all but eliminated any chances for friendly discussion. "I think it's too late for that," said a source close to Citizens.  Even if NCNB is ultimately successful, its brash attitude may have permanently alienated Citizens' management -- a problem that could seriously damage NCNB's plans for the merged companies. NCNB's management corps is already thinly spread. The company has had to send four of its top 10 managers to Texas to whip the company's new unit, NCNB Texas National Bank, into shape. If Citizens' senior executives decide they want no part of an NCNB takeover, NCNB would be forced to dig even deeper for new management talent.
