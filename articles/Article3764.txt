 Home Depot Lowers Its Earnings Forecast; Stock Buyback Also Delayed Amid Housing Slowdown; Net Income Plunges 27%   By Lloyd, Mary Ellen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2007  The results and outlook for the Atlanta home-improvement retailer were slightly below Wall Street's forecasts, which have been falling in recent weeks amid evidence of softening trends. Confirmation that Home Depot will delay the second half of its $22.5 billion buyback further worried those who expected repurchases to bolster per-share earnings amid weak demand for expensive renovation projects and as the company spends more to improve stores and customer service.  After the ouster of Chief Executive Robert Nardelli in January, Home Depot focused on retail-level home improvement, to the exclusion of its wholesale business. In the past quarter, it sold an 87.5% stake in its supply business for $8.5 billion and spent $10.7 billion to buy back 15% of its shares. It said it will "take a cautious stance" on completing the stock-buyback plan "until a more positive environment develops."  Analysts expect that many of the trends that hurt Home Depot's results also have affected those of [Lowe]'s, which this year took a more-optimistic view on sales growth than Home Depot did.
