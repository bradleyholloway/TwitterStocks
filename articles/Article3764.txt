 State Street Research Settles NASD Charges; Regulators Assert Firm Didn't Try Hard Enough To Block Market Timers   By Lauricella, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2004  "The message here is that you need to have systems and processes in place to thwart this kind of conduct," Barry Goldsmith, head of enforcement at the NASD, said of State Street Research's antitiming measures. "While they did make some efforts with respect to market timing, they didn't follow up to make sure the timing wasn't continuing."  As a result, market timers were able to continue trading in State Street Research even after their accounts had been blocked by the fund company, the NASD said. "When you see red flags you need to follow up on them," according to the NASD's Mr. Goldsmith.  Julie Allecta, an attorney specializing in mutual funds at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker in San Francisco, said the NASD had taken a "novel" action in the State Street Research case. "Any system could be looked at in hindsight and be judged inadequate." But by pursuing charges in the case, she said the NASD was sending a message that firms should "dedicate serious resources" to resolving problems after they were detected.
