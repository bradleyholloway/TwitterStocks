 Argentina Puts Big State Assets Up for Sale In Bid to Cash In Spoils Before Next Election   By By Craig Torres, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1998  President Carlos Saul Menem's economic team is trying to sell a 14.9% stake in publicly held oil giant YPF SA, valued at around $1.42 billion at today's market prices. The government is also trying to sell a 25% stake in state-owned mortgage bank Banco Hipotecario SA; the initial offering is expected to ring up at least $300 million for federal coffers.  Aside from the timing, the government has disturbed analysts with suggestions of changing the bylaws of YPF to allow a possible takeover. The move has also ruffled the company's chief executive, Roberto Monti, who has made shareholder returns his personal mission in his 20 months at the helm of the $6 billion oil giant. In a country where mediocre managements routinely enjoy high fees unrelated to stock performance, Mr. Monti has won unusual favor among fund managers. "YPF is the one company in Argentina that respects shareholders," says Edward Schneider, a fund manager for Lloyds Bank PLC in Geneva.  Rather than simply sell its YPF stake as a block of stock in the market, the government has attempted to get a higher price by marketing the deal to 16 of the world's big oil companies with the possibility of increased control. The government's total stake is 20.3%, and it has told these strategic buyers that it would vote its remaining shares in favor of a tender offer, should the buyer desire to purchase the entire company. Given the consolidation in the oil industry today, YPF is an enticing target, analysts say.
