 Your Taxes: Don't Scream "Audit Me!"   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2005  "The IRS has limited resources, and it's going to spend the time and effort on auditing where it can get more tax money," says Eric Tyson, a financial counselor and co-author of "Taxes 2005 for Dummies." The IRS tends to target higher-income taxpayers and the self-employed, Mr. Tyson says.  Unfortunately, the IRS won't forget. Banks and other companies tell the IRS how much they paid you and the IRS computers will likely flag you if the figures on your return don't match. If it's a small amount, you may just get a notice telling you of the adjustment. But larger amounts could make the IRS think you have more to hide.  "If you have a business and are continuously showing losses, expect to get audited," says Eva Rosenberg, a tax preparer in Northridge, Calif. According to IRS data from 2002, the IRS audited 3% of people who filed Schedule C showing a small or negative business income, compared with 0.5% of total returns.
