 Why I'm Filing Chapter 11   By McCourt, David C, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  Even more irritating to consumers is the way the cable giants package their programming. This may be the only business in the world in which you have to purchase a product you don't want in order to get the product you do. If you want to watch a ball game, you are forced to buy the garden channel. If you want to watch a movie, you're forced to buy kids' channels, even though your kids may have left home long ago. In some systems, cable operators own nearly 50% of cable programming, so they have decided that consumers are going to pay for it. Can you imagine if Wal-Mart insisted that you buy a hairbrush when all you want is a toothbrush? Or toilet paper when you only want wallpaper?  Comcast's recent bid to acquire Disney would have taken this anticompetitive approach one step further. Had the merger plan taken off -- and if not this one, other, similar mergers will -- then Disney's content would have been harder to get, more expensive, or less convenient to find for any consumer not part of the Comcast family.  Fortunately, the telecom story is not over. For many telecom companies -- including my own -- bankruptcy is not the end, but a new lease on life. I believe that the wave of bankruptcy filings will help launch a new era in telecom. Over the next year or two, I suspect we will see many companies re-emerging from bankruptcy, now in a much better position to compete without the dead weight of debt on their back. These may well be the companies that bring Voice-over-IP technology to the cable world, creating "Video-over-IP" competitors who change the way customers bring television into their homes. That possibility should worry today's cable giants who have been ignoring the logic of economics, the possibilities of technology and the interests of consumers for far too long.
