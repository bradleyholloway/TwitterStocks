 Reagan's Fondness for Covert Action Threatens His Activist Foreign Policy   By By John Walcott, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1986  The Reagan administration's penchant for substituting covert action for foreign policy is threatening to revive the partisan squabbling that crippled U.S. policy and paralyzed the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon a decade ago.  The Democratic leaders of the new Senate have promised to begin digging deep for the secrets of the administration's policies toward Iran, Libya and Nicaragua. The press already thinks it smells Watergate-style abuses of presidential power, while congressional investigations, coming as a wide-open battle for the presidency begins, could unravel the fragile consensus that has favored the activist foreign policy Ronald Reagan struggled so hard to create.  It is Mr. Reagan's self-assurance and his visionary nature, the very qualities that have made him an effective leader, that have gotten him into trouble. He isn't one to quit doing what he thinks is right simply because Congress, or his cabinet, won't support it. Borrowing from Robert Kennedy (who in turn borrowed from George Bernard Shaw) Mr. Reagan isn't one to look at things as they are and ask "Why?"; he is more apt to look at things that never were and ask: "Why not?"
