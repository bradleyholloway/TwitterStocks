 Chrysler Shakes Up Marketing Team Amid Falling Sales   By Boudette, Neal E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2006  A year ago, Chrysler was Detroit's only hot car company, gaining market share and making money while its larger rivals foundered. Chrysler seemed to have hit a formula for success: Offer boldly designed cars and trucks, such as the Chrysler 300 C, greenlight cheeky, sometimes borderline bawdy advertising and promote heavily what rival Japanese and Europeans didn't offer, namely a big, beefy V- 8 engine nicknamed "Hemi," a name redolent of the days when Detroit iron ruled the streets.  This year, Chrysler has hit an air pocket, presenting a major challenge for Tom LaSorda, the manufacturing expert who was given the top post at Chrysler last September after Dieter Zetsche, leader of Chrysler's dramatic post-2001 turnaround, took over the parent company. Chrysler's woes carry risks for Mr. Zetsche, too. He needs Chrysler to stay profitable while he focuses on fixing problems at DaimlerChrysler's luxury Mercedes-Benz unit. And Mr. Zetsche's reputation as a turnaround leader could get tarnished if Chrysler bogs down so soon after he leaves.  Perhaps the key model is the completely redesigned Chrysler Sebring, a midsized sedan that has to compete with two of the industry's megasellers, Toyota Motor Corp.'s Camry and Honda Motor Co.'s Accord as well as Ford Motor Co.'s Fusion.
