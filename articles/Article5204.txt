 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Saddam's Protectors   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 1991  With typical cynicism, the congressional opposition has turned the issue of war or peace into an opportunity to vote both ways. Yes, we are tough enough to use force to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, say the Nunns, Mitchells, Borens and Gephardts, but not just yet. Mobilize the troops, array the landing craft off Omaha Beach, wait till the weather clears, the moon is right and the tides rise. Then come back and we'll debate whether D-Day is a good idea.  In saying they might ultimately approve force, of course, the Democrats may simply be dissembling. Senate Majority leader Mitchell seemed to suggest yesterday that he was not prepared to risk any American casualties whatever, and this is the position that seems to win in his party's presidential primaries. That war is never justified is an honorable position, but it is not the position Mr. Mitchell put before the Senate. His resolution is not for no war, but a later war. We wonder if it can even be supported by the sincere doves, Senator Harkin, say.
