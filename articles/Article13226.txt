 Judge Dismisses One DeLay Count, Keeps Top Charge   By Mullins, Brody, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2005  The judge didn't set a trial date. Mr. [Tom DeLay] and his lawyers have pressed for a trial to begin by mid-January. If acquitted by early February, Mr. DeLay could reclaim his position as Republican majority leader -- the No. 2 post among House Republicans -- before the party can hold elections for the position.  Kevin Madden, a DeLay spokesman, said that Mr. DeLay is "very encouraged by the swift progress of the legal proceedings and looks forward to his eventual and absolute exoneration on the facts and the law."
