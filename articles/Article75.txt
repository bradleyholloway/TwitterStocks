 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The German Disease   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 1988  West Germany's government-regulated Sick Funds now foot the entire bill for the doctor, the dentist, the hospital and medications. The system's expenses have risen from $5.2 billion in 1960, to $14 billion in 1970, $66 billion in 1986 and $72 billion this year. The employee-employer contributions to the Legal Sickness Funds, which cover 92% of the population, have climbed to an average of 13% of salaries, up from 8% in 1960.  Whenever a government comes under pressure from mounting costs such as these in a system with little incentive for frugality, it is inclined to impose controls on something. West Germany has chosen primarily the drug industry. The proposed Health Reform Act, which is scheduled for final reading in Parliament today, features a fixed reimbursement schedule for drugs -- in effect, price controls. The law is supposed to reduce Germany's annual health-care bill by 10%, or more than $6 billion. This "reform," however, is likely to carry its own price: a weakening of the research commitment that now makes West Germany one of the world's leaders in pharmaceutical science.
