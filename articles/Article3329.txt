 WSJ(9/14) UPDATE: How Alabama Fund Bet, Lost On US Airways   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2004  Buying into US Airways after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks "always seemed like a pretty big gamble to me," said Olivia Mitchell, director of the pension-research council at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia. "Obviously losing this amount of money is potentially troublesome to the taxpayers of Alabama, and maybe to the [pension plan] participants" There are a number of stakeholders who should be taking a hard look at this transaction."  In a September 2002 interview with a trade magazine, Pensions and Investments, Mr. Bronner predicted the airline industry would turn around "once we get through with Iraq" and said US Airways had plans in place to slash its costs. He predicted the Alabama fund could make $1 billion on its investment in five to seven years. When US Airways emerged from bankruptcy the following year, Mr. Bronner was elected chairman and appointed a majority of the board. As the airline continued to struggle, he later installed his handpicked CEO, Bruce R. Lakefield, a former chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers International. Mr. Bronner also repeatedly said he hoped to use US Airways to help Alabama's economy. Soon after he agreed to invest, the carrier added service from Washington, D.C. to Birmingham, Ala. It also moved some maintenance work to a facility in that state, prompting a lawsuit by the airline's machinists' union.  The airline's Web site lists Alabama as its first "featured domestic destination," inviting travelers to "experience an unforgettable getaway in scenic Alabama." It also beckons travelers to the "magnificent" Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail. The courses are owned by Mr. Bronner's pension fund.
