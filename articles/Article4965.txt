 Crude Oil Prices Surge Past $18 on New Reports Of Strong Petroleum Demand, Lower Supplies   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1989  In the U.S., crude oil prices broke through an important technical level of $18 a barrel largely on the basis of this week's American Petroleum Institute report of a big drop in crude inventories.  Although the rise elsewhere was more subdued, prices were up, nevertheless. On European spot markets, prices of the important North Sea Brent crude were five cents to 15 cents a barrel higher late in the trading day.  Although spot-month WTI traded briefly above $18 a barrel during one day in late December, it hadn't closed above that mark for nearly a year. The U.S. benchmark crude for near-month delivery closed at $18.27 last April 27 but then began a downward slide until last November, when OPEC reached its 1989 production agreement. Since the OPEC decision, petroleum prices have been moving up in a series of rallies broken occasionally by corrections.
