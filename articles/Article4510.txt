 Dozens Indicted In '82 Collapse Of Italian Bank   By By Laura Colby, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1989  MILAN, Italy -- Magistrates investigating the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano indicted 35 former officials and associates of the bank for fraudulent bankruptcy, but absolved Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, who had been accused of extortion.  Friday's indictments culminated a seven-year investigation into Italy's biggest-ever bank failure. Ambrosiano collapsed in August 1982, shortly after Chairman Robert Calvi was found hanged under Blackfriars Bridge in London. The bank had debt of $1.3 billion, mostly in loans to Panamanian shell companies controlled by the Vatican bank. Judicial sources said the case probably won't go to trial before fall at the earliest, and that it could take years before a verdict is reached.
