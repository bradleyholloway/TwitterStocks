 US Airways Says Its Loss Narrowed To $335 Million   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2002  US Airways hopes to receive $900 million in government loan guarantees so it can secure a $1 billion loan to fund its emergence from bankruptcy. The federal agency administrating the aid program already has given conditional approval to US Airways' bid, but has set thresholds the company must meet before it will extend the assistance.  Indeed, the dismal outlook led US Airways last month to tell its creditors that it was boosting by $100 million to $300 million a year the amount of cost savings it must achieve, on top of $1.3 billion already pared from its annual expenses, in order to return to profitability. US Airways' employees now are shouldering about $850 million in annual labor-cost cuts, which helped explain a 23% year-to-year decline in personnel costs in the just-ended quarter.
