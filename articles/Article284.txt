RCA reported yesterday that it had a third-quarter loss of $109.3 million on sales of $1.99 billion. It was the first earnings report since Thornton F. Bradshaw became RCA chairman and chief executive on July 1 and includes a $230 million pretax charge to cover anticipated losses.  The $230 million reserve will cover write-downs on some NBC programs that will not be shown a second time, and a devaluation in the assets of the company's picture tube operations and its Hertz truck rental and leasing operations that RCA plans to sell off as a franchise.  In a statement, Mr. Bradshaw said he believed these write-offs would ''permit the company to resume its progress in the months ahead.'' These results compare with third-quarter earnings for the sa me period last year of $80.4 million, or 80 cents a share, on salesof $1.98 billion.  Operating earnings were hurt by high interest costs on RCA's borrowings; by higher than expected start-up costs stemming from RCA's videodisks, which it introduced last March; by losses from its Hertz division, and by programming costs at NBC that offset any sales increases, an RCA spokesman said. Operating earnings totaled $22.6 million, or 7 cents a share.  Interest expenses were $45 million higher this quarter than in the comparable quarter last year and high short-term interest rates squeezed earnings at C.I.T. Financial, a consumer finance company.  ''I thought there might be some write-offs, but this was more than expected,'' said one analyst, who declined to be named. ''And the economy hasn't helped them. Basically, the company was operating at just modestly above break-even. Then they had heavy videodisk introduction expenses, Hertz hasn't done that well and the spread at C.I.T. was affected by short-term borrowing rates.''  For the first nine months of 1981, RCA reported a $9 million loss, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $5.89 billion. This compares with a profit of $236.2 million, or $2.40 a share, on sales of $5.9 billion for the same period in 1980. Mead  The Mead Corporation, a major producer of paper products, reported a 30.8 percent drop in third-quarter earnings. It attributed the decline to a seven-week industrywide strike in British Columbia. Mead also said that its wood operations were ''particularly hard hit'' because of the low level of housing construction.  The company reported third-quarter net income of $22.5 million, or 83 cents a share, on sales of $760.4 million. This compares with 1980 third-quarter earnings of $32.5 million, or $1.19 a share, on sales of $692.1 million. For the first nine months of 1981, Mead reported earnings of $92.2 million, or $3.37 a share, on sales of $2.19 billion. This compares with 1980 earnings of $99.7 million, or $3.66 a share, on sales of $2.02 billion. Colt Industries  Colt Industries, a specialty steel producer that has agreed to merge into the Penn Central Corporation, reported third-quarter net income of $27.9 million, or $2.02 a share, on sales of $538 million. This compares with earnings for the same period in 1980 of $13 million, or 97 cents a share, on sales of $473 million.  For the nine months ending September 1981, Colt reported earnings of $88.7 million, or $6.53 a share, compared with earnings for the same period in 1980 of $70 million, or $5.36 a share. Dow Jones & Co.  Dow Jones & Co. reported a drop in third-quarter earnings because of a write-down in the book value of its Book Digest magazine, which the company said would probably not reach its anticipated profit levels.  Dow Jones reported third-quarter earnings of $13.l million, or 42 cents a share, on revenues of $163 million. This compares with 1980 earnings for the comparable period of $14.9 million, or 48 cents a share, on revenues of $134 million. The write-down of Book Digest was $9.4 million, or 30 cents a share.  The 1981 nine-month net income was $48 million, or $1.54 a share, on revenues of $467 million. This compares with 1980 net income for the same period of $39.5 million, or $1.27 a share, on revenues of $383 million.
