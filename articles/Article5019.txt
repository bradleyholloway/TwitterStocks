 Sam McKeel's Assignment in Chicago: Transform Tabloid Into 'Media Empire'   By By Andrew Patner, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1989  In a series of publishing posts with Philadephia Newspapers Inc., Mr. McKeel was the business half of a two-man team that helped transform the Philadelphia Inquirer into one of the country's leading newspapers. With the help of executive editor Eugene L. Roberts, Mr. McKeel knocked out the rival Philadelphia Bulletin and with a couple of scrappy editors breathed new life into the evening tabloid Daily News.  With solid balance sheets and a proposal for a new satellite printing plant awaiting board approval in September, Mr. McKeel was receptive to a headhunter's call. "After 18 years in Philadelphia, it was time to move on," Mr. McKeel says.  Mr. Shaykin proposed that Mr. McKeel head the company formed around the Sun-Times, Chicago's No. 2 circulation paper, and to turn it into a major media company.
