 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 1995  The severity of the panel's surprise move reflected anger over Packwood's recent demand for public hearings on the sexual misconduct charges.

Packwood, head of the Finance Committee, condemned the decision. He signaled he would fight to keep the seat he has held since 1969, but he didn't rule out a later decision to quit.
