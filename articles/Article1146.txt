 Proposed Sale By Herbert Hunt Irks Federal Judge   By By Andy Zipser, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1989  Judge Harold C. Abramson, who is overseeing the personal bankruptcy proceedings of Nelson Bunker Hunt and W. Herbert Hunt, ruled last week that the latter violated his orders by using a company he controlled to buy an 11-story office building from a company controlled by his son, Douglas. Mr. Hunt failed to disclose details of the $18.7 million transaction to Judge Abramson or to his creditors, who contend that it was structured merely to help Mr. Hunt's relatives.
