 Federal Reserve Cuts Rates Half Point --- Tenth Reduction This Year Results in 40-Year Low; Further Easings Loom   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2001  "Heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity," the Fed said in a statement. The Fed also cut its more symbolic discount rate to 1.5% from 2%. Commercial banks responded by cutting their prime lending rate, used for setting business and consumer loans, to 5% from 5.5%.  Some policy makers may have settled on a half- instead of a quarter-point cut only in the past few days. Just one of the Fed's 12 regional Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, had voted for a half-point cut before yesterday's announcement. The reason for the absence of the other banks wasn't given. But many probably voted for a smaller move because their boards met before seeing last week's dismal news on consumer confidence, manufacturing and jobs -- not out of disagreement with Chairman Alan Greenspan over the pace of easing. Indeed the Richmond Fed is considered hawkish on inflation and thus likely to want less rather than more monetary ease.  "The Fed is chasing the neutral rate down and inflation expectations are lower than they thought," said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. Indeed, though trading in futures contracts based on the federal funds rate suggests it will bottom out at 1.75% next February, many economists expect it go to 1.5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks.
