 The Economy: January Showed More Expansion In Manufacturing   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2003  "The continued high level corroborates other hints of a factory revival," said economists at UBS Warburg in a research note. "Low inventories and a falling dollar are giving the factory sector a lift."  Within the purchasing managers index, the subindex for new orders was especially strong, at 59.7. Though down from December's level, it didn't fall as far as some economists had expected. It still shows that a sizable proportion of manufacturers are experiencing growing order books. The index of new export orders also rose to 55.6 from 52.5 in December, evidence the weaker dollar may be helping U.S. companies sell overseas.
