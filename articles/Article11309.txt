 `Not a Violation of Any Rule or Law'   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1989  The House Committee conducted an extensive inquiry into congressional contacts by Speaker Wright with Mr. Gray and other FHLBB officials regarding Texas constituents. Counsel found that Speaker Wright had: (1) pressured Mr. Gray to change "specific regulatory results" of Bank Board investigations; (2) sought to have FHLBB attorney William Black fired due to a personal vendetta; (3) sought to "get rid of" H. Joe Selby, described by others as the top banking regulator, by claiming he was a homosexual; (4) arranged what one official described as "special deals" for constituents with regulatory problems before the Bank Board, including appointment of an outside investigator in an "extremely unusual, even extraordinary" process that one official believed wasted taxpayer money; (5) asked for or was successful in delaying the shut-down of at least two insolvent Texas thrift institutions; (6) caused Mr. Gray to violate Bank Board regulations by meeting directly with one of the Speaker's constituents; (7) held up a FSLIC recapitalization bill, needed to provide funds for shutting down insolvent thrift institutions and mounting losses, in reprisal for Bank Board regulatory actions; and (8) engaged in what counsel concluded were an "ill-considered series of interventions" before the FHLBB.
