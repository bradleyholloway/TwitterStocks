 House Approves Highway Bill, Setting Stage for Tax-Break Fight   By Schatz, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2004  "Talk about free riders. They have no place in the highway bill," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a taxpayer watchdog group. Lawmakers, he said, "just snuck them in there."  The bill "doesn't completely do the job, but it is the best we can do at this time," House Transportation Committee Chairman Don Young (R., Alaska) said Friday during debate. He originally wanted an additional $100 billion for highway funding.  House lawmakers seem unfazed by the White House's veto threat, partly because they appear to have enough votes to override a veto. Mr. Bush hasn't yet used his veto power.
