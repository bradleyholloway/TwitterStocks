 Letters to the Editor: The Overvalued Dollar   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 20, 2001  If manufacturing recovers, it can continue to generate the productivity gains necessary to achieve high overall growth rates. Allowing the dollar to fall to levels that reflect true market forces, not excessive speculation, will guarantee an industrial and economic rebound.

The consequent loss of jobs is especially damaging to the economy because jobs associated with trade tend to be among the better compensated. Mr.
