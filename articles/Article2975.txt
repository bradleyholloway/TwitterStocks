 Upbeat Applied Materials Forecast Helps Other Chip Makers' Stock   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, which had boosted its rating on Applied Materials a week ago, applauded the results, saying the company's growth guidance came in at the high end of its range of forecasts. Thomas Weisel Partners, which similarly found the results encouraging, said the forecasts also suggested good things for chip foundries such as United Microelectronics, which advanced 23 cents, or 2.8%, to 8.38, and Taiwan Semiconductor, which tacked on 37 cents, or 2.1%, to 17.65.  XL Capital climbed 5.86, or 6.4%, to 97.11, despite issuing fourth-quarter results late Tuesday that the company itself described as disappointing. However, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, in a research note, said it liked the environment for property/casualty insurers. Shares of Renaissance Holdings, which maintained its 2002 earnings guidance yesterday, advanced 6.75, or 6.6%, to 108.80. Everest Re increased 3.59, or 5.1%, to 74.35. PRXE, which released its fourth-quarter results late Tuesday, rose 1.70, or 9.7%, to 19.20.  Tricon Global gained 1.85, or 3.4%, to 55.52. Deutsche Banc Alex.
