 U.S. News: States Draw Up Plans for Year of Even Bigger Budget Cuts   By Merrick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2009  In hard-hit Michigan, Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm directed state agencies last week to plan for 20% budget cuts for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2010, on top of 10% cuts made to balance the current budget. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said Wednesday that, without more federal help, state budget cuts will shave nearly a percentage point off growth in U.S. gross domestic product, eliminating roughly 900,000 jobs in fiscal 2011, which for most states begins on July 1, 2010.
