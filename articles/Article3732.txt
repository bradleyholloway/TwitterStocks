 Rule Change Ticks Off Some Traders   By Aaron Lucchetti and Peter A. McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  Gary Lahey, a former chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, says it's hard to quantify the added volatility given all the turmoil of late but there is no question it has had an impact. "You're going to get more volatility because it's easier to whack a stock," says Mr. Lahey, who nevertheless favors the rule change.  On the New York Stock Exchange, Seaport Securities broker Theodore Weisberg agrees: "They quietly changed the ground rules," says Mr. Weisberg. "There's no question it's been an aphrodisiac for volatility."  Strategist Howard Simons, of Bianco Research in Chicago, says the old short-sale rules reflected investors' traditional bias that stocks rise in value. "I mean, there was never any rule that said you could only buy" when the stock of a price was falling, "so why did we need the opposite for shorts?" says Mr. Simons.
