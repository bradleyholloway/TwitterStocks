 Supreme Court Narrows Scope of Wetlands Law   By By Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2001  The justices split along 5-4 ideological lines, as they often do in federalism cases, with conservatives, led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, voting to limit federal power, and moderates and liberals championing federal involvement. Joining the chief justice were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. On the other side were Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.  The case involves a consortium of 23 Cook County, Ill., municipalities that joined to buy a 523-acre property to use as a landfill. The site had been mined for sand and gravel for about 30 years, ending in the 1960s, after which the trenches became ponds visited by migratory birds. The consortium sued the Corps after the agency refused to issue it the necessary Clean Water Act permit for development.  In a statement, Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner warned the ruling "will make it even more difficult to effectively protect against the loss of wetlands." Perry Plumart, a spokesman for the Audubon Society, said wetlands provide flood control and help filter water supplies. "Too often, when developers look at wetlands, they see a useless piece of property," he said.
