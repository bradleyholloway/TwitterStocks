 Norway's Giant Gas Accord Is No Panacea   By By Stephen D. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1986  After months of plunging oil prices, the pact seemed certain to help revive the flagging economy and battered state finances. Moreover, the accord with West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France was hailed by the Reagan administration as a step toward energy security in Western Europe by reducing reliance on Soviet gas supplies.  As the euphoria fades, however, it's increasingly clear that the gas pact is far from a panacea. It will cost the equivalent of $8.1 billion to launch production in the huge Sleipner and Troll gas fields in the North Sea. But there isn't any certainty that the recent accord to reduce output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will keep oil prices up -- and, because gas prices are tied to oil, a long-term slump in oil prices means the project could bring in far less revenue than expected.  The agreement calls for Norway to sell 450 billion cubic meters of gas between 1993 and 2020 to distributors in the four West European nations. Around the turn of the century, annual deliveries would reach a peak of 20 billion cubic meters. The price of the gas is pegged to the market price of oil products at time of delivery -- and the $64 billion valuation of the accord assumes that oil will cost $28 a barrel. (North Sea Brent oil, the benchmark European crude, was quoted yesterday at $12.55 a barrel.) Even with a short-term rebound in oil prices, a sustained price slump could make the value of the pact far less.
