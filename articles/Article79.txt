Altschiller, Reitzfeld, Jackson, Solin/NCK has become the ad agency for the Teleprompter Corporation, the country's largest cable TV operator, with 115 systems in 540 communities.  The previous agency was Ralph Kent Cooke Inc., Los Angeles, named for its president, who is the son of Jack Kent Cooke, chairman and chief executive of Teleprompter. The elder Mr. Cooke, formerly the largest stockholder, sold his 10 percent in January to Westinghouse Electric, which is seeking to acquire the corporation.  The 16-year-old West Coast shop, the Teleprompter agency since 1969, developed advertising programs for all of the individual systems. It was paid on a fee. Apparently, Westinghouse preferred working with a New York agency.
