There is an old-fashioned, independent drugstore, the  Tschiffely Pharmacy, on Connecticut Avenue, near Dupont Circle, that has a cure for odd-penny anxiety.  It is a cup full of pennies on the counter near the cash register. On the cup is a note: ''If you need a penny take a penny. If you have a penny give a penny.''
