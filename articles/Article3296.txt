 France's Danone To Sell Beer Assets To U.K. Brewery   By By Amy Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2000  PARIS -- French food group Danone SA is selling most of its beer assets to the United Kingdom's No. 1 brewer, Scottish & Newcastle Breweries PLC, in a further step toward recentering its business around three core activities, Danone said.  In the first stage of a deal that will net Danone at least 18 billion francs ($2.67 billion) in cash, dividends, S&N shares and options, the French group will transfer its French, Belgian and Italian beer activities to a venture to be run by S&N in exchange for an initial payment of five billion francs. Half will be cash, one billion francs will be in S&N shares accounting for about 4% of the U.K. brewer's capital and 1.5 billion francs in preferential shares and warrants, Danone said.
