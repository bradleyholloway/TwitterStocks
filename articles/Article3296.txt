 Boss Talk: The Music Man; Apple CEO Steve Jobs Talks About the Success of iTunes, Mac's Future, Movie Piracy   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2004  Mr. Jobs: A PDA. We got enormous pressure to do a PDA and we looked at it and we said, "Wait a minute, 90% of the people that use these things just want to get information out of them, they don't necessarily want to put information into them on a regular basis and cellphones are going to do that." So getting into the PDA market means getting into the cellphone market. And you know, we're not so good at selling to the enterprise where you've got, in the Fortune 500, five hundred orifices called CIOs. In the cellphone market you've got five. And so we figured we're not going to be very good at that.  Mr. Jobs: You know, we've got 25 million customers. We've got a retail store business that's now over a billion dollars and bringing in a lot of new customers. Over half the customers that we're selling CPUs to in our retail stores are new to Mac. So I think we've got a very healthy customer base and we love them and we love to delight them with new products, and that's a very healthy business; it's growing.  Mr. Jobs: No, I don't think there's an attitude problem, there is just an experience problem -- that people from technology don't understand the creative process that these companies go through to make their products, and they don't appreciate how hard it is. And the creative companies don't appreciate how creative technology is; they think it's just something you buy. And so there is a gulf of understanding between the two of them.
