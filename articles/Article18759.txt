 Rival Satellite-TV Services Plan A $300 Million Marketing Attack   By By Mark Robichaux, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1996  Both Primestar and DirecTV, which market their digital services as an alternative to cable, posted huge subscriber gains in 1995 after a flurry of national TV and print ads introduced the new service to viewers. Primestar almost quintupled its base of 200,000 last year and reaches nearly a million homes today.  DirecTV, which started offering its pizza-pan size satellite dishes in late 1994 with a bigger marketing splash, reaches about 1.2 million homes. Subject to "general market conditions," DirecTV says it hopes to add nearly two million new subscribers in the coming year.  By comparison, DirecTV plans to emphasize its brand name and position as market leader, after nearly a year of educating customers about what the service is. Aside from a smaller dish, DirecTV offers a third more channels than Primestar, most of which are pay-per-view movies. Moreover, while both services offer full packages of games from pro basketball, hockey and baseball leagues, DirecTV is the only service, for now, to offer the complete schedule of games of the National Football League.
