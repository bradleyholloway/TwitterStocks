 At Power-One, 'Who' Revealed More Insight Than 'How Much'   By Cooke, Tony, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2004  Mr. [Wilton R. Stephens Jr.], however, isn't an insider in the commonly understood sense, said David Coleman, editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report. As a direct and indirect holder of more than 10% of the company's shares, Mr. Stephens is obliged to report his transactions as an insider even though he holds no position in the company's management or on its board. "Beneficial owners aren't the guys in there making decisions and seeing what happens day to day," Mr. Coleman said.  Power-One's Mr. [Randall H. Holliday] endorsed that view -- though he said his past sales weren't motivated by a belief that the stock was overvalued. "If you can spell 'college tuition,' you can understand some of the timing" of the sales, Mr. Holliday said. On the other hand, Mr. Holliday said, he believes the stock's recent slide -- it was more than $14 for a while in January -- "offered a good entry opportunity."  Mr. Holliday said Power-One's stock has declined "for reasons I can't figure out. I don't think it's reflective of anything at Power- One."
