 Takeoffs & Landings [1]  By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 1996  Guests say the hotel, the Hempel, is apparently hard to find because its owner, actress-turned-decorator Anouska Hempel, recently had the square around the hotel officially renamed the "Hempel Garden Square." Most taxi drivers, however, only know the area by another name. The hotel's name is also marked only in tiny letters on the outside. "You have to walk up and down, trying to guess which door is right," says London restaurant critic A.A. Gill.  A spokeswoman insists the hotel isn't so hard to find, because there's a doorman outside. But she concedes the Hempel does have one potentially difficult feature: Instead of being posted on the door, room numbers are projected as small dabs of light on the doorway. That forces guests to peer around their own shadows.  "It's an unnecessary inconvenience" to an estimated 34 million travelers a year, says Mike Spinelli, president of the American Society of Travel Agents. Recently, he sent a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration, arguing that disclosing the rules to travelers might encourage more credit-card use -- and fewer hassles. The FAA, however, has been reluctant to do so. "If there are terrorists out there, we don't want to give them a blueprint," says an FAA spokesman.
