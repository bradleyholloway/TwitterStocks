 Unforeseen Costs Of FAA's Project Put at $1.2 Billion   By By Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1993  Government officials said the announcement had no connection with an agreement yesterday by Loral Corp. to buy International Business Machines Corp.'s Federal Systems Co. unit, which has most of the $5.9 billion in contracts to build new workstations for controllers. An IBM official said both companies were aware of the latest overruns.  But the overruns could create headaches for Loral, because it's likely to spur new calls for reform. FAA Administrator David Hinson said he had ordered internal and external reviews of the modernization program that Federal Systems is leading. He also said he would direct a "reassessment of the relationship" between the FAA and the contractors that oversee the program.  Others, including a presidential commission on the airline industry, have questioned whether the FAA can complete the overhaul at all because of complex procurement rules. The commission called for parts of the air-traffic control system to be turned over to a semiprivate corporation. President Clinton is expected to give partial support for the idea in a few days. Congress in the past has spurned the idea, but members may feel compelled to consider it in light of the latest overruns.
