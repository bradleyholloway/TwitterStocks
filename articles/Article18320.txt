 U.S. Cigarette Firms Are Battling Taiwan's Bid for Marketing Curbs   By By Jeremy Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1992  The Taipei government, mirroring a response seen in many Asian countries, is increasingly worried about the efforts of foreign cigarette makers to expand their local market share through advertising and promotions. Policy-makers are trying to impose stiff restrictions on cigarette marketing in legislation that for the first time addresses public concern about the health costs of smoking.  For foreign cigarette companies, which have been able to sell their cigarettes in Taiwan only since American trade negotiators opened the market in a 1986 agreement, the issue isn't health but free trade. The cigarette companies are opposing a portion of the proposed law that would ban all cigarette advertising, point-of-sale promotions and other marketing activities. They argue that they are squeezed between the local tobacco monopoly -- which can't advertise but still has about 80% of the market -- and a flood of smuggled cigarettes from Japan that is cutting into their market.  "Some might see this as a health bill; we see it as a means to erode market access," executives of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., Philip Morris Taiwan Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (Taiwan) Inc., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., said in a joint letter to American officials earlier this year. The cigarette companies argued that without the ability to promote their products, "our market share would be frozen or even decrease."
