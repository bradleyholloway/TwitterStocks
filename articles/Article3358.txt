 The Patient Is Waiting   By McKinnell, Hank, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2004  America's businesses -- especially those of us in the health-care industry -- want to be a part of the solution. At Pfizer, we have moved to make our medications available, at affordable prices, to every uninsured American, regardless of age or income. (You can find out more about our programs by going to www.pfizerhelpfulanswers.com.)  To be truly patient-centered, health-care reform must be focused on the pursuit, achievement and sustenance of health. Today, far too much effort and attention is devoted to simply controlling costs rather than with the promotion of health. We're too focused on acute care and treating the problem only after an event has occurred.  Florida's public health agency, Pfizer and 10 partnering hospitals jointly created a new health network to help Medicaid patients with certain chronic diseases make better informed health care decisions. Patients learned how to manage their own disease, to better understand and follow their physicians' treatment recommendations, and to stay healthier.
