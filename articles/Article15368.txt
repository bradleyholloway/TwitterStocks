 Mutual funds: Quarterly review: Finding a fund for kids' college costs is a lesson in frustration on the Internet   By Schultz, Abby, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1995  A search to find the best mutual fund as an investment for a child's college education is described.

Or, one can call the toll-free phone number of any mutual fund family to request a prospectus.
