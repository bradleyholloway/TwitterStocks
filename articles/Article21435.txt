 Amdura, Failing To Get More Credit, Files for Chapter 11   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1990  After failing to obtain additional credit from its lenders, Amdura Corp. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.  CoastAmerica was acquired with a $260 million credit facility from a group of 14 banks led by Chicago-based Continental Bank. Last year, discontent over the handling of the resulting debt led to a battle between then-incumbent Amdura management and New York investor Frank J.A. Cilluffo, who succeeded in ousting Amdura's chief executive officer and board members in a consent solicitation.
