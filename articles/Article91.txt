The president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation resigned yesterday after telling city officials he was under criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney.  The president, John J. McLaughlin, in his resignation letter to Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff, did not say what the investigation involved, and he could not be reached for comment.  Thomas J. Puccio, Mr. McLaughlin's lawyer, said in a telephone interview that the investigation grew out of a civil suit involving Mr. McLaughlin, and that ''as far as I know, it did not involve Mr. McLaughlin's position in city government.''  A 'Personal Tragedy'  Mary de Bourbon, a spokesman for the District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said a grand jury was investigating Mr. McLaughlin, but she would not say what the investigation concerned.  Mayor Koch told reporters at City Hall that he regarded the circumstances of the resignation as a ''personal tragedy for Jay McLaughlin.''  Moments before, the executive committee of the corporation's board of directors met at its offices at 125 Worth Street and accepted Mr. McLaughlin's resignation from his $82,500-a-year position.  Doctor Appointed  The committee then designated Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, the corporation's executive vice president, to be acting president. The corporation is a semi-autonomous agency that operates the city's municipal health system with an annual budget of $1.8 billion.  In his letter Thursday to Mr. Brezenoff, Mr. McLaughlin said, ''Over the past few days, difficulties have arisen with respect to personal business transactions in which I was involved.''  Since these matters will undoubtedly require my undivided attention over the next several weeks,'' he wrote, ''I believe it is in my best interest and the best interest of the corporation for me to tender my resignation now rather than when originally anticipated.'' The resignation took effect yesterday. A top city official said Mr. McLaughlin had been expected to step down by Dec. 31 for other reasons.  Mr. McLaughlin, a 39-year-old lawyer who was appointed acting president on Jan. 6, 1984, and president five months later, had previously served as counsel to the corporation. He also had been Commissioner of Financial Services and head of the city's Industrial and Commercial Incentive Board.  In a statement, Mr. Brezenoff, who preceded Mr. McLaughlin as president of the Hospitals Corporation and who remains as chairman of its board of directors, said:  ''I regard the resignation as in the best interest of the corporation. We have been informed by District Attorney Morgenthau that a criminal investigation of Mr. McLaughlin is under way.  ''We asked the District Attorney for permission to disclose information about the investigation, but he has advised us that the disclosure of any information relating to the investigation of and presentation to the grand jury is prohibited under New York law.''  Mayor Informed Wednesday  Mr. Puccio said that he met with members of the District Attorney's office yesterday and that Mr. McLaughlin had been questioned by investigators on Thursday.  City officials said Mayor Koch was first told ''there was a problem'' Wednesday night, and was told on Thursday that it ''was a serious problem.'' They did not say which city officials informed the Mayor or how they came to hear of the investigation.  They said Mr. Koch then called Mr. Morgenthau, who, they said, confirmed on the telephone that Mr. McLaughlin was under investigation by a grand jury.  In its 15-year history, the Hospitals Corporation has had seven presidents. With his resignation, Mr. McLaughlin became the sixth to be either dismissed or forced to resign. He is the first to leave the post because of a criminal investigation.  Top city officials said Dr. Boufford, a 39-year-old pediatrician and an expert on health-care delivery and the training of physicians, was being groomed to succeed Mr. McLaughlin in anticipation of his expected departure by the end of the year.  Before her appointment as vice president of medical and professional affairs at the corporation in 1982, Dr. Boufford was director of physician training at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
