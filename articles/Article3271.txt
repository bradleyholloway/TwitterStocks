 A Sweet Dream: Krispy Kreme Looks to the Land of Rising Sun   By Parker, Ginny, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2004  The Japanese company last met with Krispy Kreme in February at the doughnut maker's Winston-Salem, N.C., headquarters, said Michael Nishi, Global-Dining's chief financial officer. The company is waiting for Krispy Kreme to make a decision about whether to go ahead with the partnership.  Global-Dining, which operates theme restaurants in Japan and California, says the appeal of Krispy Kreme is the chain's "entertainment factor." Some Krispy Kreme stores feature what the company calls a "doughnut theater," which allows customers to watch doughnuts as they emerge from the ovens on a conveyor belt.
