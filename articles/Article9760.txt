 World Watch   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2005  Mexico's foreign debt rating was elevated one notch by Moody's Investors Service, reflecting efforts by Finance Minister Francisco Gil Diaz to pare the country's international debt load by relying more heavily on local currency markets for financing.  Moody's raised Mexico's debt rating to B-double-A-1, or three levels above the junk rating it carried as recently as 2000. The new rating puts Mexico on par with Chile, the Andean nation increasingly viewed as the region's most stable economy. Spreads on Mexican debt tightened on the news.  Opinion on Mexico's outlook is divided. The Moody's rating is now two full notches above ratings by competitors Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which have awarded Mexico the lowest possible investment- grade rating.
