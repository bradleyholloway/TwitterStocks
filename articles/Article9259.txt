 BMG Shuffle May End Bickering at Firm   By By Martin Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2000  On Sunday, Bertelsmann said it named Rudi Gassner as chairman and CEO of BMG, succeeding current Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick and Chairman Michael Dornemann. Both resigned over strategic issues with Mr. [Thomas Middelhoff]. Mr. Gassner becomes CEO Jan. 1, when Mr. Zelnick leaves, and chairman on July 1 when Mr. Dornemann departs.  For Mr. Gassner, 57 years old, the appointment represents a triumphant comeback. Following clashes with Messrs. Zelnick and Dornemann, Mr. Gassner resigned as head of BMG's international operations in January, having served 13 years. (In late 1994, Mr. Dornemann chose Mr. Zelnick to run BMG's North American operations, passing over Mr. Gassner. Mr. Zelnick was promoted to chief executive of BMG in 1998.)  Mr. Middelhoff was unhappy with the bad publicity that ensued from the [Clive Davis] dispute, insiders said. Although Mr. Middelhoff did initially approach Mr. Zelnick to succeed Mr. Dornemann as chairman of BMG, relations between the two weren't that warm either, according to people familiar with the situation. His negotiations with Mr. Zelnick subsequently broke down over several issues, including compensation. Mr. Middelhoff also said he would reduce Mr. Zelnick's responsibilities by transferring the BMG record clubs from the record concern to Bertelsmann's electronic-commerce group as part of a broader reorganization of the company.
