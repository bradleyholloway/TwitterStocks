 Dollar Decline May Defy Prevailing Wisdom   By Peter A. McKay and Karen Richardson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2006  In such an environment, the dollar often suffers. When that happens, strategists and money managers tend to counsel clients to favor shares of large companies. The idea is that because these companies tend to be multinationals that earn large chunks of revenue from operations outside the U.S., they are better positioned to weather weakness at home. Also, increased overseas interest rates support foreign currencies, making earnings abroad worth more when the income is "repatriated" into weaker dollars.  Both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are in the midst of nudging up interest rates. After two straight years of pushing up U.S. rates, the Federal Reserve last week left them unchanged, a development stock investors had pined for that may nevertheless remove support for the dollar. The dollar tends to climb when the Fed is pushing up rates, because the central bank's tighter monetary policy effectively removes money from circulation, making the remaining dollars more valuable.  Strategist Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, on the other hand, thinks it isn't a good time to give up on U.S. companies. He thinks many investors and even central bankers may be misgauging the economy's health and therefore the direction of the dollar.
