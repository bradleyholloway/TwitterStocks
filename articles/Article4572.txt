 The Americas: Nicaragua's Concern for Justice Should Begin at Home   By By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1985  Nicaragua's World Court case against the U.S. has been heartily defended by prestigious Washington law firms and Ivy League professors. In defending Nicaragua, they invariably emphasize the U.S. government's disregard for the rule of law. Reacting to the administration's decision Monday not to automatically abide by World Court rulings in the future, Paul Reichler, a Washington lawyer representing Nicaragua at the World Court, commented: "I think it's just another example of how this administration has contempt for international law and the international judicial process."  While defending Nicaragua's legal position at the World Court few of these individuals say much about Nicaragua's domestic legal system. Those who do are in the awkward position of defending the international rights of a government that has little respect for due process within its own borders.  Finding that the regular judiciary lacks the right revolutionary spirit, the Sandinistas have transferred jurisdiction over political crimes to courts under the direct control of the executive. These so-called Popular Anti-Somocista Tribunals were introduced in 1983 as an updated version of the Special Tribunals, which were responsible for the sentencing of 4,331 "Somocistas" in the 16 months following the 1979 revolution. The newer tribunals are composed of one lawyer or law student, and two members of the Sandinista Defense Committees (CDS). The CDS are neighborhood vigilante groups that serve as the local cell structure for the Sandinista Party (FSLN).
