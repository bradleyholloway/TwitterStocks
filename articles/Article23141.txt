 Motion Picture Group Taps Dan Glickman To Succeed Valenti   By Johnson, Avery, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 2, 2004  Mr. Glickman, 59, joked that he hopes to be "half the guy" Mr. [Jack Valenti] has been. The silver-haired adman steered the association through an era in which media conglomerates gobbled up movie studios and piracy became the industry's biggest challenge as recording technology outpaced copyright controls. After 38 years promoting Hollywood's interests around the world, Mr. Valenti said he would run the association until Sept. 1, and would continue after that to oversee the movie rating system he created.  "I've told [Dan Glickman] his No. 1 priority is to make sure the American motion picture is protected," Mr. Valenti says. "That's his No. 1 job."  The "Valenti tradition" will be a tough act to follow. The dapper lobbyist came to the association in 1966 after working for President Lyndon Johnson as special assistant. The major studios' world-wide revenues were $1.26 billion, with international sales at 33%. In 2003, MPAA member companies' global revenues totaled some $41.2 billion, 40% of which came from abroad. An important part of the Valenti legacy is the rating system, created in 1968 trumping legislation that he viewed as censorship.
