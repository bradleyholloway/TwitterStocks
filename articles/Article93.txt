Pantry Pride Inc. may be waging a losing battle in its multibillion-dollar campaign to take over Revlon Inc., even though Revlon is showing considerable interest in a Pantry Pride takeover, Wall Street investment bankers said yesterday.  Michel C. Bergerac, chairman of the big cosmetics company, is known to have met yesterday with Ronald O. Perelman, head of MacAndrews & Forbes, a little-known company that controls Pantry Pride.  The merger talks were one of a series of secret meetings between the two men, and additional meetings are expected shortly - thus giving Wall Street the first serious indication in more than a year that Revlon might consider selling the company.  Another Bidder Expected  Despite these developments, Wall Street bankers are betting heavily that some other exceptionally wealthy bidder - possibly foreign -might soon approach Revlon.  Insiders said that no new bidders had yet approached Revlon and that it was still too early for a bidding battle to develop, but added that Wall Street felt the company was definitely on the block, or ''in play,'' as Wall Street puts it.  Many investment bankers are on vacation or taking a few days off during the warm weather in Manhattan. But several are expected to start sounding out clients on their interest in Revlon.  Because of the competitive nature of the business, none of the banking houses would discuss such matters. Most corporations are also routinely turning aside such inquiries with such remarks as, ''We never comment on mergers.''  Lazard Freres, longtime investment banker for Revlon, is expected to act as financial adviser in the now-developing battle. Drexel Burnham Lambert, known as Wall Street's top fund raiser through the sale of high-yield ''junk bonds,'' is representing Pantry Pride.  The list of potential bidders for Revlon seemed formidable, with analysts suggesting such possible contenders as Johnson & Johnson, makers of Tylenol and numerous other health-care products, and Philip Morris, the cigarette company that also makes Miller beer and 7-Up.  On the theory that the Revlon name means something to consumers, analysts maintained that almost any other company with a strong consumer franchise might be interested - for example, the Coca-Cola Company, Pepsico or Procter & Gamble, whose huge stable of products ranges from Crisco to Pampers.  Among the possible foreign contenders, analysts said, are Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products company, and Hoechst A. G., the West German chemical and health-care company.
