 Aznar's Spanish Conquest   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2000  The battle was the same one being fought all over Europe -- an election to decide whether a politician can attract more votes by preaching smaller government and more individual responsibility or by pushing for the familiar -- a powerful state and the socialization of costs and risks. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar won re-election this weekend in his nation of 40 million by making a convincing case for freedom and self-reliance.  It is by no means certain that Mr. Aznar's victory will generate a new wind of change that might reinvigorate right-of-center parties north of the Pyrennes. The 47-year-old Prime Minister's uphill struggle to remain in power despite four years of success unequaled in Europe could be seen as having the opposite effect. It shows how difficult it is for a leader to win when he is not feeding well-organized constituencies such as labor unions or offering succor to citizens unsettled by modern economic transformations.
