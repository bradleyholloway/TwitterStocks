TRENTON (AP) - The Chemical Control Corporation, whose plant in Elizabeth was the site of an explosion and fire of hazardous wastes last year, has been indicted on charges of polluting state waters and endangering the public.  A state grand jury also charged three of the concern's officers and the Northeast Pollution Control Corporation of Brooklyn, N.Y., which maintained offices at the site and stored hazardous solutions on a waterfront pier, Judith Yaskin, acting attorney general, announced yesterday.  The principals of Chemical Control facing charges similar to those against the concern are John Albert of North Branch and Eugene Conlon of North Brunswick, both listed as owners, and Michael Colleton of Ridgewood, a former manager.
