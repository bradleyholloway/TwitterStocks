 Pension Plans Miss Out on Much Cash By Failing to File in Class-Action Cases   By By Christiane Bird, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  Mr. [Alan Cleveland] noted that in 2000, 156 securities class actions were settled for a total of $1.28 billion, with the huge Cendant Corp. case settled for an additional $3.12 billion. In 1999, 112 settled cases produced $1.79 billion in recovery fees, and in 1998, 125 cases produced $1.17 billion, with the Nasdaq Stock Market price-fixing case settling for an additional $1.03 billion. Since public pension funds have an approximate 25% share of the securities market, and corporate funds have an approximate 35%, pension funds were theoretically entitled to about 60% of $8.39 billion over those three years.
