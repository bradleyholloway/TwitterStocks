 Sculpture: On the Lawn of the Mountain King   By By Pamela J. Macleod, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1989  Mountainville, N.Y. -- A fierce battle erupted recently on the grounds of Storm King Art Center, the country's leading outdoor sculpture park. Well, sort of. More accurately, the aftermath of a titanic mythological struggle -- between gods and giants -- is depicted in a new 20-ton tableau by French artists Anne and Patrick Poirier. It is part of "Wandering Into Memory," an enchanting exhibit of their avant-garde creations.  The Poirier show is just one reason to consider a summer jaunt to this Hudson River Valley oasis 55 miles north of New York City (the season runs through Nov. 30). About 130 monumental postwar sculptures grace Storm King's 400 acres of landscaped lawns, terraces, fields and woods. Smaller works are displayed in nine exhibition rooms in the restored Normandy-chateau-style mansion that sits atop a hill at the center of the park.  "Wandering Into Memory" is a departure from the usual at Storm King. It is the first exhibit at the center to focus solely on work of living European artists. Also, many of the Poirier sculptures are narrative, and therefore quite unlike most Storm King works, abstract pieces by such well-known artists as Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi and David Smith.
