 Mitel Sees Fiscal 2nd-Period Net Fall 47% And Lowers Future Earnings Projections   By By Joel Baglole, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2000  Mitel executives said the company's reduced earnings projections reflected poor sales of traditional circuit-based telephone systems. Paul Butcher, a Mitel vice president, said sales have stalled due to a "fundamental technology shift." He said companies are moving toward systems that allow the transmission of voice and data over the Internet, and away from systems which transmit voice and only limited data.  In contrast, Mitel said sales of its semiconductors reached a record C$194.3 million in the recent fiscal quarter, up 39% from C$139.4 million of sales revenue in the same period a year earlier. Mitel semiconductors are used by larger companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. to build Internet infrastructure, and in other areas such as digital TV. Mitel expects semiconductor sales to grow by 30% this fiscal year, but anticipates sales of its telephone-equipment systems will be 20% lower than in fiscal 2000.
