 Small-Cap, Nasdaq Stocks Continue to Rebound; 7th Level Surges 52% on Deal With Microsoft   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1997  Small-capitalization and Nasdaq stocks were moderately higher as they continued to retrace the losses from the Oct. 27 sell-off, outperforming the broad market and blue-chip stocks.  With the gains, the Russell 2000 is now 0.6% below where it stood prior to the sell-off, having fallen 6.1% on Oct. 27. The Nasdaq composite, which was knocked for a loss of 7%, stands 0.8% shy of its preplunge level.  The small-cap and Nasdaq Stock Markets managed to maintain their upward momentum even though computer-related stocks were essentially flat on the day, held in check by the weakness of larger-cap technology stocks. The Nasdaq computer index, which fell 7.6% on Oct. 27, is now 1.1% below where it stood prior to the sell-off.
