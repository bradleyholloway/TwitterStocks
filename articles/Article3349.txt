 Mexico Weaves More Ties --- No. 1 in Garments, It Might Soon Be Top Textile Source   By By Joel Millman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2000  Yet despite the boom, U.S. textile makers hardly feel secure. They are under constant pressure from low-cost producers in Asia, especially China. And although Mexico is now the U.S.'s largest source of imported garments (some 40% of the total, compared with around 33% from Asia), its position is shaky. China's decision to join the World Trade Organization clears the way for the U.S. to phase out its quotas on Chinese garments by 2005, an event that is expected to hit U.S. textile makers hard.  The idea, Ms. [Kay Norwood] says, is for Mexico to attract a critical mass of U.S.-owned textile production to support its garment industry even after China's quotas fall. Those U.S.-owned plants will also be a market for U.S. cotton, as well as the synthetic yarns and fabrics produced by U.S. mills. China may dominate at the low end, but Mexico can offer retailers both just-in-time inventory control and quick turnaround on changes in their orders.  Mr. [Gabriel Nabielsky] predicts Guilford's annual sales from Altamira will quickly top $100 million, thanks to the demand for cheap textiles that is about to explode in the region. That is because the same global trade winds that buffet U.S. textile makers with competition from China blow in their favor elsewhere. Starting Oct. 1, garment makers in the 25 nations that joined the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a Nafta precursor, will be able to export to the U.S. duty free and quota free, provided those garments contain U.S. materials.
