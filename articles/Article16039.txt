 Deutsche Bank Posts Profit of $920 Million   By By Marcus Walker, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2001  Of the bank's pretax profit of 1.48 billion euros, a large part -- 400 million euros, according to Mr. [Clemens Boersig] -- was due to an accounting change. A new international accounting standard requires banks to record in their profits the market value of the derivatives positions they use to hedge their securities investments. In Deutsche Bank's case, this accounting rule has led to a marked change in recorded profits. Without it, net profit would have been about 20% lower, at 792 million euros, well below the year-earlier period, though still better than the last two quarters of 2000.
