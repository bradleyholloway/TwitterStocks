 Univision Sues to Halt Rollout of Nielsen Meter   By Jordan, Miriam, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 11, 2004  Univision executives say the broadcaster doesn't oppose modernizing the system. Rather, Univision believes the viewer sample selected by Nielsen to use the people meter is fundamentally flawed and results in inaccurate ratings data.  "While we are fully supportive of appropriate use of the local people-meter technology, the sample on which Nielsen's ratings are based does not accurately represent the composition of the Hispanic- American population," said Ceril Shagrin, Univision's senior vice president for corporate research.
