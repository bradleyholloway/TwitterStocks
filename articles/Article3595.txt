 Theory & Practice: Sarbanes-Oxley Gains Adherents; Closely Held Companies Embrace Internal Controls As Incentives, Pressure Rise   By Jaclyne Badal and Phred Dvorak, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2006  Printing-press manufacturer Goss International Corp.'s chief financial officer, Joe Gaynor, began to look into Sarbanes-Oxley last year, because he thought the $1.1 billion Bolingbrook, Ill., company could benefit from standardizing its policies and procedures. Goss's eight business units operated independently, with varying rules. Mr. Gaynor worried about gaps in human-resource policies, such as making sure employees were paid only for hours they worked.  Mr. Gaynor says Goss has no immediate plans to go public, but MatlinPatterson pushed Goss's board to comply with the law's provisions for internal controls that are designed to prevent fraud and reduce financial-reporting errors.  Mr. Gaynor says Goss is reviewing its internal controls. It upgraded its technology department, ensuring that both the computers and software were reliable and had backups. It strengthened the board's audit committee and made its meetings more regular. At the end of 2007, Mr. Gaynor plans to hire PricewaterhouseCoopers for a "dry-run" audit to identify potential weaknesses.
