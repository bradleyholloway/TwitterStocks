 Da Silva Deflects Detractors; Brazilian President's Populist Appeal Offsets Weight of Scandals   By Samor, Geraldo, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2005  "People someday will say, 'Gosh, we've had so many professors in the presidency, but it took a metalworker to do what had to be done,' " said Mr. da [Silva], referring to a manufacturing job he held in the 1970s. "They were possibly more-learned men than me. They read many more books. They were even more intelligent. What they lacked was a sentimental, heart-to-heart connection with the problems of the people." Some among the audience of 5,000 hugged and kissed Mr. da Silva, and one woman even laid both hands upon his head, a gesture meant to bless him.  Mr. da Silva's combination of populist appeal and the country's growing economy -- along with the opposition's admitted "incompetence" in exploiting the slush-fund scandal -- so far has saved his political skin. Opposition calls for impeachment are going nowhere, and his political adversaries, who thought the scandal would bury him, are demoralized. "Lula is a myth, and myths don't die easily nor overnight, especially when they are able to produce consistent economic results," said Murillo de Aragao, a political consultant in Brasilia, the country's capital.  The Brazilian president's policies, up-from-poverty speeches and attacks on "the elites" resonate deeply among a populace with widespread suspicion of the rich. A former labor-union leader who faced hunger as a child, Mr. da Silva frequently touts his status as Brazil's first blue-collar president. "You watch the news and you see that there are lots of people annoyed," he recently told a crowd in the town of Teofilo Otoni. "Taking care of the poor is a very difficult job."
