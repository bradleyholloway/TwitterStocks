 Business and Finance [3]  The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1989  CAMPEAU DISCLOSED a severe cash crunch, sparking jitters in financial markets. The Toronto-based retail and real estate company said Olympia & York may gain control under a complex agreement in which $250 million would be injected into Campeau. Sources said Olympia & York is likely to break up Campeau and sell additional assets besides its Bloomingdale's retail chain.  Junk-bond prices plunged in reaction to Campeau's woes, helping trigger a sell-off in stocks. The Dow Jones industrials slid 27.74, to 2679.52. Bonds and the dollar also declined.  MGM/UA received a $1.4 billion takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. The surprise move comes as Qintex tries to complete a $600 million purchase of MGM/UA's United Artists studio and other assets.
