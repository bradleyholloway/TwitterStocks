 Boeing, After Initial Delay, Says 787 Is on Track   By Keeton, Ann, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2007  Boeing's efforts to deliver the hot-selling 787, which is expected to be more efficient than current aircraft, are being closely watched. Boeing in October said troubles with suppliers would delay delivery of the first aircraft by six months to the end of 2008. But the company said it could still turn out 40 aircraft by the end of next year and produce 109 total aircraft by the end of 2009 once it worked out the kinks in initial production.
