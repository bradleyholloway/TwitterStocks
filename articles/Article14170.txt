 Firms Seek Cure for Dull Memos; Find Windy Writers Hard to Curb   By By Cynthia F. Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1985  Where in a business memo should a piece of bad news be delivered?

Others bring in coaches for seminars lasting several days. And some provide private tutors for top executives who secretly suffer from dangling participles and suspended phrases.
