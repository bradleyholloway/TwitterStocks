 Bookshelf: The Glory Days at Ebbets Field   By By John Valentine, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1985  It was in 1957 that a tragedy brought lasting sadness and disbelief to those of us who lived through it. The Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants moved from New York to someplace out West.  Giant fans, such as myself, used to regard Dodger fans and their team as rabble, a horde of loud, unwashed barbarians who swarmed over the East River to defile our baseball temple, the Polo Grounds. At best, because we were tied to them by fate, we saw them as idiot relatives who lived in the back lot of the world and were too dumb to know which way was up.  Baseball raconteur Peter Golenbock brings all this back to life in "Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers" (Putnam, 464 pages, $17.95). Mr. Golenbock is widely known as a chronicler of the Yankees in such books as "Dynasty" and "The Bronx Zoo" (written with Sparky Lyle). In "Bums" he is writing about the most colorful team ever to play baseball, and again he hits a homer.
