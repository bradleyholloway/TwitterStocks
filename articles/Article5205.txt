 Southern Pacific Begins Search for CEO As Moyers Cuts Back for Health Reasons   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1995  Southern Pacific Rail Corp. said it has begun a search for a successor for its chief executive officer, Edward L. Moyers, who disclosed that he must cut back his activities for medical reasons.  Analysts who follow the San Francisco-based company said the move was unlikely to jeopardize the turnaround effort under way at Southern Pacific, which operates the nation's sixth-largest railroad. They said the 66-year-old Mr. Moyers, an aggressive cost-cutter hired by Southern Pacific in 1993, was well on his way to implementing costreduction policies and capital spending to improve productivity and profits, while starting to reverse the railroad's image of poor customer service.  The company said Mr. Moyers will continue as CEO of Southern Pacific and its railroad operating units during a transition of "some months." Philip F. Anschutz, 54, the Denver billionaire who owns about 35% of Southern Pacific, will continue as chairman of the parent company.
