 Picasso Canvas Draws Record $104.2 Million At Sotheby's Auction; 'Boy With Pipe' Establishes New Pricing Frontier For 20th-Century Art   By Peers, Alexandra, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2004  The [Pablo Picasso]'s dazzling climb was attributed to two factors: its rarity and its provenance. The portrait dates from the Spanish master's "rose period," a two-year stretch in which Picasso lightened both his palette and subject matter. Many notable works of this period are already in museum collections. It also carried an art-world celebrity provenance, having come from the collection of the late John Hay Whitney, former U.S. ambassador to Britain and editor-in-chief of the New York Herald Tribune, and his late wife Betsey Cushing Whitney. The couple amassed one of the world's most important art collections and bequeathed art to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among other institutions. The Picasso, sold by the couple's philanthropic Greentree Foundation, cost Mr. Whitney about $30,000 in 1950, according to Sotheby's David Norman, co-chairman of Impressionist and modern art. It is "one of the greatest Picassos remaining in private hands," he said.  While the van Gogh record in 1990 marked the top of a market, with prices for art crashing six months later, Christopher Burge, Christie's principal auctioneer and its U.S. chairman, predicts this time that prices will continue to trend upward because of the global explosion of wealth in the intervening years. Throwing down something of a gauntlet to competitor Sotheby's, Mr. Burge predicted the Picasso record won't stand nearly as long as the record for the van Gogh. "There are 50 to 60 people in the world who could pay $100 million for an artwork," he said, 10 who would, and a couple for whom multiples of that wouldn't be out of the question if "the right Michelangelo or Raphael" would appear.
