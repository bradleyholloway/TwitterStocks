 Leading Economic Indicators Show Rise In Sign Expansion Can Last to Year End   By By Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1998  Michael D. Boldin, director of business-cycle research at the New York business-research organization, said the economic omens point to continued strong growth in gross domestic product in the months ahead.  "It looks like above 3% is not impossible for the whole year," Mr. Boldin said. Last week, the government reported that the economy expanded in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 4.2%, but few economists believe that pace is sustainable through the rest of the year. The leading-indicators index, considered a reasonable predictor of turning points in the economy, measured 105.2, up from 105 in February.
