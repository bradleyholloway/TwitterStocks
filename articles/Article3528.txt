 Genentech Stops Trial on Concerns Over Safety of Peanut-Allergy Test   By Hamilton, David P, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  Cancellation of the Xolair trial means that an approved treatment for peanut allergy remains years away at the earliest. Dr. [Susan Desmond-Hellmann] said Genentech may explore the possibility of moving straight to a large-scale trial that wouldn't involve a peanut "challenge," as the allergic-reaction test is called. Instead, such a trial might track volunteers over an extended period of time, to determine if those receiving Xolair experienced fewer accidental peanut reactions than those taking a placebo.
