 What We Can Do About Burma   By Fireman, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2005  DEFEATING APARTHEID would have been impossible without corporations world-wide mounting economic pressure to help release South Africa from the grip of a criminal regime. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading voice in that fight for freedom, declared, "Tough sanctions, not constructive engagement, finally brought the release of Nelson Mandela and the dawn of a new era in my country." In 1993, when Archbishop Tutu looked to the brutality of the junta controlling Burma, he called it "the South Africa of the '90s." More than a decade has passed, but Western corporations are still playing key roles in boosting the Burmese economy that finances the junta's rule.  It's impossible to conduct business in Burma without supporting this regime. In fact, the junta's core funding derives from foreign investment and trade. But foreign investment and aid yield little benefit to the nearly 50 million citizens who live under the military's ruthless campaign of intimidation. Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader now under house arrest, has pleaded with the world to apply economic sanctions against Burma until democracy can free the country from the military's brutal grip.
