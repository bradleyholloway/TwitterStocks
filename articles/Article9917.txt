 Don't Count on the Fed to Boost Stocks   By Karen Talley and Mohammed Hadi, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2006  "There is a shocking focus" on the end of the Fed's rate boosts and what it might mean for the stock market, says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab in San Francisco. "It's as if as soon as the Fed is done, we know what the market's going to do." But that's pretty much impossible, she says.  "Stock and Treasury [bond] prices have shown a tendency to rise every time investors start to believe the Fed is at a point of being 'one and done'. . .a notion that has been entertained quite a few times in the last 12 months," says Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management in Burlington, Vt.  Since even the Fed doesn't know whether it has achieved its goals or gone too far, some financial advisers say investors shouldn't be lured into positioning themselves for one outcome or another. Ms. Sonders of Charles Schwab, for instance, isn't recommending that investors make portfolio changes to try and play the end of rate increases.
