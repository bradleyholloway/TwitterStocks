(AP) -- Fire broke out yesterday at a chicken processing plant, killing at least 25 people and injuring more than 45, authorities said. Witnesses said a fryer at the Imperial Food Products plant caught fire about 8:30 a.m. The company makes chicken nuggets and marinated chicken breasts sold at fast-food restaurants and grocery stores.  A woman who was in the canteen said people rushed in yelling, "Fire! Fire!" The door from the canteen to the outside was locked, and a man had to break the door open so those inside could escape.
