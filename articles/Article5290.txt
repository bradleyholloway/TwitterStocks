 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1991  The Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Angela Wright, a former employee at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to testify today concerning her allegations that the Supreme Court nominee made "unwelcome advances." The new accuser was interviewed yesterday by telephone by the staff of the committee, which is reconvening to consider Thomas's nomination. Immediately after Wright's name was disclosed last night, White House officials questioned her honesty and said they will produce a witness to rebut her charges.  Yugoslavia's federal army agreed in principle to withdraw from Croatia within a month, and Croat forces pledged to lift their blockades of army barracks in the republic. Both sides agreed to negotiate a political settlement that would address grievances of the Serb minority in Croatia.  Israeli Housing Minister Sharon said he would run for prime minister, and he accused the government of weakness in handling the Palestinian uprising. Separately, Jewish settlers who took over six homes in Arab east Jerusalem told reporters that officials knew about the operation beforehand.
