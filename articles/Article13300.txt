 Peabody to Buy Australia's Excel For $1.34 Billion   By Golden, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2006  The combination of Peabody's Australian operations and Excel "creates one of the largest coal companies in Australia," said Peabody President and Chief Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce.  Excel produced about 5.6 million tons of coal in 2005, but it is expected to produce as much as 15 million tons in 2007 and as much as 20 million tons a year in 2008, Peabody said. Excel has more than 500 million tons of coal reserves. Peabody currently produces nine million tons of mostly metallurgical coal in Queensland.
