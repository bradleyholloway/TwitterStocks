 FCC Official Wants New Review Of AT&T-MediaOne Conditions   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2001  Mr. [Harold Furchgott-Roth]'s remarks, which came just days after similar comments from FCC Chairman Michael Powell, suggest the GOP-controlled commission may be willing to adopt a softer approach toward AT&T, the nation's largest cable operator. AT&T has been trying to sell some cable assets to AOL Time Warner Inc. to comply with a pending FCC deadline, but the two companies have been unable to agree on a price. An FCC decision giving AT&T more time to sell the holdings would give the company a boost by allowing it to hold out for more money.  AT&T's first choice was to spin off Liberty Media Group, which has stakes in content providers such as USA Networks Inc., if it got a favorable tax ruling. The FCC preferred a more definitive solution and ordered the company to sell its 25.5% stake in Time Warner Entertainment, AT&T's joint venture with AOL Time Warner, by May 19.
