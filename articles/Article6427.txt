 On Investing: Not All Index Funds Get the Same Returns   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2005  While Vanguard charges just 0.18% per year for its Vanguard 500 fund (VFINX) and Fidelity last year lowered the expense ratio for its Spartan 500 fund (FSMKX) to 0.10%, there are other funds out there charging 10 times as much, and some also with an initial "load" or sales charge of around 5%.  The Bull ProFund (BLPIX), for example, has a 1.71% annual expense ratio. The Scudder S&P 500 Stock fund (KSAAX) charges 0.68% for its A shares, and 1.43% on its B-class and C-class shares. And Morgan Stanley's S&P 500 fund (SPIAX) charges 0.64% on its A shares, and 1.4% on the B and C shares.  "It's not just about getting the absolute lowest fee," says Mr. [Mark Hebner], "it's also about design, risk control and diversification."
