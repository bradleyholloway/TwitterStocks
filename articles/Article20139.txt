 After Blowup, Bear to Revamp Risk Control; Beefed-Up Oversight, New Reporting Chain To Come at Funds Unit   By Kelly, Kate, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2007  Last month, two of the division's hedge funds, the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund, imploded after bets on the market for subprime home loans -- which cater to borrowers with weak credit -- went bust.  It's been an unpleasant wake-up call for Bear executives, who pride themselves on their reputation for savvy risk management. Unlike competitors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which tend to take higher risks and can generate far higher returns as a result, Bear has tended to make more conservative bets in order to generate more consistent results.  One built-in incentive to avoid huge risk is that about a third of the firm's shares outstanding are in employees' hands, meaning that if Bear's stock takes a dive, so does that group's personal wealth. At 4 p.m. yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bear shares were up $3.16, or more than 2%, to $143.16.
