 Beecham Group And Smithkline Consider Merger --- Drug-Industry Giants' Move Provides the Latest Sign Of Market Consolidation   By This article was prepared by Joann S. Lublin in London, Richard Koenig in Philadelphia And Randall Smith in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1989  The companies declined to say which businesses would be involved in the long-rumored marriage. But analysts believe Beecham, based in London, and SmithKline, based in Philadelphia, want to combine their prescription and over-the-counter drug businesses, and shed some of their smaller non-drug operations.  The possible marriage would create a formidable drug manufacturer with significant marketing muscle in both the U.S. and Europe. SmithKline has a current market value of $7.57 billion, while Beecham is valued at about #4.5 billion ($7.6 billion). The combined company could well rank among the top three world-wide in terms of prescription and over-the-counter drug sales, sales of animal health-care products and pharmaceutical research and development spending.  But even a partial combination could prove complex and delicate to complete, especially as it involves two strong-willed corporate leaders who may have to share power -- SmithKline Chairman Henry Wendt and Beecham Chairman Robert Bauman. The concerns discussed a merger last December, but talks stalled on the issue of who would control the combined company, according to one person with knowledge of the discussions. One possibility said to be under discussion is that Mr. Wendt would be the chairman of a combined company and Mr. Bauman the chief executive officer, with SmithKline executives running some of the major businesses.
