 Strong Profits Seen for Medical Supply Firms --- Gains Averaging 12%-15% Expected to Be Posted For the Second Quarter   By By Ron Winslow, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 1990  "Calling some of the major {companies} hospital suppliers is a bit of a misnomer," says Daniel T. Lemaitre, health-care analyst at Cowen & Co. "Some of these companies have as little as 35% of sales going to hospitals." Even so, Mr. Lemaitre says, their hospital businesses are healthy in part because patients admitted to hospitals these days are sicker and require more surgical procedures, thus leading to some growth in unit sales.  Johnson & Johnson is expected to report second-quarter profit of about $1 a share, up 12% to 14% from 89 cents or $297 million a year ago. The improvement reflects double-digit increases in sales, strong results from its Ethicon wound closure business and success with erythropoietin, or EPO, a drug for dialysis patients, Hismanal, a non-sedating anti-histamine, and a new diagnostic test for hepatitis-C.  Analysts see Abbott's earnings rising about 15% to 16%, to about 55 cents a share, from $212.6 million or 47 cents a share a year ago, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split. The growth reflects stronger sales that were slowed last year by problems in its infant-formula business. One big success, says Mr. Lemaitre is IMx, an automated test used to diagnose such diseases as hepatitis, cancer and thyroid dysfunction. Sales of the product could reach $250 million this year, its second full year on the market, the analyst says. Abbott, North Chicago, Ill., said it hadn't any comment.
