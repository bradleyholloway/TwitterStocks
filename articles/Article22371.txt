 Commerzbank Expects Losses In Asia Crisis   By By Christopher Rhoads, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1998  Commerzbank AG said it set aside provisions of more than 900 million marks ($492 million) to cover potential losses from its Asian activities last year, becoming the latest European bank to acknowledge damage from the region's turmoil.  The bank, the third-largest in Germany, said about half of its two billion marks of provisions for 1997 is being used to cover Asian risks. Despite the increase in risk provisions, the bank said operating earnings for the year rose 25% to 2.3 billion marks. "We believe this covers all foreseeable problems, but what 1998 will mean we won't know until the end of 1998," a bank spokesman said.
