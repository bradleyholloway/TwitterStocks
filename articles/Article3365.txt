 Progressive's 3rd Period Beat Projections; Allstate's Results Met Analyst Forecasts   By By Christopher Oster, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 20, 2000  Progressive, a top-10 insurer based in Mayfield Village, Ohio, posted 51 cents a share of operating income, blowing past analysts' expectations of 17 cents a share. Progressive's shares jumped 21% on the news. After a series of quarters with unfavorable reserve development, the results showed the benefits of improved underwriting and cost cutting. Still, the results were well below those of the year-earlier quarter as the company's premium volume actually decreased slightly.  Analysts noted that 18 cents of Progressive's unexpected earnings boost came from the release of $20.1 million in reserves, reversing the trend of recent quarters in which reserves were boosted. "The risk of reserve strengthening appears to be receding," Ms. [Alice Schroeder] wrote in her report. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, Progressive rose $14.88 to $85.88. Allstate shares were up $2.19 to $34.88.
