 Real Bad ID   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2006  Yes, you can expect longer lines at the DMV in the future. "Real ID will reduce efficiencies and increase wait times," according to the report. "Real ID will also effectively reverse state practices designed to ease an applicant's interaction with motor vehicle agencies (e.g., Internet, mail in renewal, over-the-counter issuance)." The deadline for compliance is May 2008. After that, identification from states that don't meet the new national requirements won't be accepted at federal agencies.  Proponents claim that standardizing drivers' licenses is essential to fighting terrorism on the domestic front. Mr. [James Sensenbrenner] has said that Real ID will stop the next Mohamed Atta. But the 9/11 hijackers entered the country legally, which means they qualified for valid drivers' licenses. Nothing in the new law changes that reality, or the fact that you still don't need a driver's license to board a plane. Other forms of ID, such as a passport, will continue to suffice.
