 Leading the News: FCC Rejects EchoStar-Hughes Merger   By By Yochi J. Dreazen and Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 2002  The FCC's move reflects a newfound aggressiveness on the part of its chairman, Michael Powell. Typically, the agency waits for the Justice Department's antitrust division to complete its review of a deal before taking action. This time, however, the FCC went first even though some Justice officials appeared more receptive to a compromise.  The merger isn't completely dead. The FCC now must send its opinion on the merger to an administrative law judge for review, and EchoStar and Hughes said they plan to file an amended proposal within a 30-day window.  The FCC's harsh language stunned EchoStar and Hughes officials, who had been clinging to the hope that the agency would give them more time to make "major revisions" to the deal. In a last-ditch effort, EchoStar, the parent of the Dish Network, said it would be willing to sell enough transmission capacity to create a new rival in the satellite market, according to people familiar with the matter.
