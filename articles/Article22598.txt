 Bell Atlantic Plans Dime-a-Minute Long Distance   By By Stephanie N. Mehta, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2000  Bell Atlantic Corp. today is expected to begin selling consumer long-distance telephone services in New York for a dime a minute, according to people familiar with the company's plans.  The New York-based carrier last month won permission from the Federal Communications Commission to offer long-distance services in the state, making it the first of the local Bell telephone companies to win such authority. Rivals have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the FCC decision; they also have asked the court to stop Bell Atlantic from delivering long-distance services in New York pending the outcome of the suit.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has asked the parties to the suit to file comments early this week. Bell Atlantic, meanwhile, will begin taking orders for long-distance today, though it won't actually turn up its service until later this week.
