 Unions Attack Pentagon's Plan To Move Personnel More Freely   By Pierceall, Kimberly, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2004  "We're taking civilian tasks currently done by uniform personnel and converting them to civilian jobs, freeing military personnel for military tasks," Mr. [Donald Rumsfeld] told Congress. According to the administration's latest budget, 27,000 jobs held by military personnel will be turned over to civilians under the new personnel system.  A Pentagon official said the department isn't proposing "to 'bust' unions," but rather "wants to change the current process of protracted and fragmented debate in nearly 1,400 bargaining units to one of more constructive dialogue and problem solving at a national level."
