 Pressures on Medical Researchers Create Climate Conducive to Fraud, Study Says   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1989  Although the study, by the private Institute of Medicine, said that instances of outright laboratory fraud remain rare, its authors recommended that the medical research community overhaul the ways it polices itself to control such things as fabricated data, plagiarism and carelessness.  Arthur H. Rubenstein, chairman of the study committee and a University of Chicago professor, said that in the last decade there has been a sharpened competition for shrinking research funds and a growing need to establish reputations through publication. "All of these create new stresses," he said, that make people "more likely" to commit research misconduct "than they would have been 10 years ago."  To protect society from research flaws, he said, the science community needs to use new ways to encourage ethical research and to deal with cheaters. Past methods, including peer review and duplication of test results, are not enough now to prevent careless, sloppy or fraudulent research, he said.
