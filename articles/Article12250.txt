 Worms's Holders Consider Making A Counteroffer   By By Douglas Lavin and Sara Calian, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1997  Shareholders of Worms & Cie., the French holding company that is the target of a hostile takeover bid, may make a counteroffer that could value the company at 32 billion francs ($5.37 billion).  Investment bankers were working over the weekend on a deal that would bind together three major Worms shareholders -- Assurances Generales de France, which owns 7.6% of Worms; Ifil SpA, a holding company controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy that owns 20%; and the Worms family, which owns 22%. They were trying to cook up a counteroffer to French businessman Francois Pinault's unsolicited 28.8-billion-franc bid.
