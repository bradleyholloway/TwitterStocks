 Taking Refuge Under, Then in, a Van   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2001  Then I started to worry that the van would move, and I would get crushed. I also started to think that inside the van might be safer than under it. So I slid back out from underneath and banged on the window. Someone inside opened the door and let me in. Two other guys from the street also jumped in the van behind me, nearly crushing my leg. But in the few seconds the door was open, so much debris got inside the van that it was nearly impossible to breathe in there, too. We were afraid to drive, for fear of running over people. Plus, it was still dark (but getting lighter). Eventually, no one could breathe at all in there and we had to get out. I ran into a nearby building and was ushered into the basement. But 30 seconds later, we were told to evacuate.
