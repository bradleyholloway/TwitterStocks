 Capital Automotive REIT Agrees to Buyout Offer   By Scinta, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2005  Under the proposed deal, shareholders of McLean, Va.-based Capital Automotive will receive $38.75 a common share in cash and the purchasers will also assume the company's debt and preferred stock. The offer is a 9% premium over Capital Automotive's Friday closing price.  Ms. [Merrill Ross] downgraded Capital Automotive shares to "market perform" from "outperform," lowered her price target, and said it was unlikely another bidder would emerge for the company.  Raymond James analysts agreed, saying "the company appears to have closed the door on any competing suitors." However, analysts Ken Avalos and Paul Puryear of Raymond James said the price offered to shareholders for Capital Automotive was "attractive" and the buyout is a signal of more attractive valuations in the net leasing portion of the REIT market.
