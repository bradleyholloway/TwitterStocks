HOW TO THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST Answering Questions by the Scientific Method. By Stephen P. Kramer. Illustrated by Felicia Bond. 44 pp. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell. $11.50. (Ages 8 to 12)  ONE reason I like writing about science is that someone else does the tedious business of thinking by the scientific method, and I get to learn the results, which is what I'm after in the first place. Maybe if I'd read Stephen P. Kramer's book at an impressionable age I'd be less prone to jump to conclusions.  Three anecdotes in the first half of this breezy and amusing book for middle-grade children show the various flaws in my kind of thinking. For instance, your little brother Ralphie interrupts your reading to say some burglars are robbing the next-door neighbor's house. You look up long enough to see a television repair truck parked out front and tell Ralphie to forget it, they're just taking out the television. Later it turns out the television repairman was working in another house. So much for partial observations.  Or, the zookeeper tells your class that a bowl of what you recognize as guppies are really man-eating African gastromorphs. The only way to test this is by sticking your hand in the bowl, so you decide to trust the zookeeper - who, as it happens, is actually a bird specialist and has mixed up the fish. ''If you answer questions by depending too much on other people's answers, you probably will make mistakes.''  The third pitfall is wishful thinking, and most of us know about that.  To illustrate the proper method for arriving at the correct answer, Mr. Kramer tells us about a chicken farmer who goes on vacation, only to have his hens start laying in astonishing abundance during his absence. Why? To find out, we have to decide what the variables are, and test them one by one. Or, to use the terminology of the scientific method: Ask a question. Gather information about the question. Form a hypothesis. Test the hypothesis. Tell others what you have found (unless you're a chicken farmer and want to keep trade secrets to yourself). We never do hear whether it's the Acme Deluxe Chicken Feed, the bigger bowls of water, the newly hatched grasshoppers that invade the chicken yard, cleaner cages, or what - which is frustrating, but not the point, I guess.  Mr. Kramer suggests a few experiments a child can try, but they're so easily and intuitively answered - How does my baby brother act differently when he misses his nap? Is your older sister more likely to help you if you say please? Do dishes get cleaner in hot water than cold? - that there's not much motivation for employing the scientific method.  Felicia Bond's illustrations are charming and sometimes downright funny, and give the anecdotes a wry dimension that the text, lively as it is, can't achieve on its own. Mr. Kramer concludes with a mischievous suggestion about storing a dead snake in the freezer for use in future experiments that, if acted on, might make a parent wish he or she hadn't bought the book. But then, I'm sure the young Thomas Edison also did things in the name of science that his mother found disconcerting.
