 Steelmakers Take Risk in Expanding; High Prices, Brisk Demand Drive a Production Boom, But Capacity Woes Remain   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2004  Global crude steel production is expected to top a record one billion metric tons this year. For the first three months of the year, crude steel production was up 8.7% from a year ago, according to the International Iron and Steel Institute. James King, a steel analyst based in Newcastle, England, estimates that global capacity- utilization rates will rise to more than 85% in the next three years, up from a 10-year low of about 72% in 1999. But some observers warn that the expansion eventually could undermine the recovery. "Steel manufacturers aren't stupid," said Mark McMullen, an economist with Economy.com of West Chester, Pa. "They realize there are capacity problems in the industry and expansion is very risky." Some industry observers predict China will have millions of tons of flat-rolled steel it won't know what to do with by 2010.  In the U.S., steelmakers are reopening steel mills long shuttered for lack of demand. Nucor Corp., of Charlotte, N.C., this year expanded production at a Decatur, Ala., steel plant that it acquired in 2002 and expects to make two million tons a year there. "On a global basis, there still is plenty of global steelmaking capacity," said Nucor Chief Executive Dan DiMicco. But, citing demand and other factors, he added, "we are protected here."
