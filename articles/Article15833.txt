 SEC Is Proposing `Pay to Play' Ban In Public Funds   By By Judith Burns, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1999  The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would prohibit investment advisers from making political contributions in hopes of obtaining contracts to manage public funds, including pension funds, a practice known as "pay to play."  "This measure is a natural extension of our longstanding efforts to stamp out pay-to-play in the municipal-finance world" SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said in a statement announcing the move.  To extend the concept to investment advisers, the SEC drew on the existing municipal rule, known as G-37. As proposed, advisers who contribute to political campaigns would be subject to a two-year ban on being compensated for advisory services for public pension plans.
