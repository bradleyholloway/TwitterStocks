 Auditors File 29 Cases Of Likely Illegal Activity; CPA Group Cites Measures Taken by Executives, Board For Level of 10A Reporting   By Connor, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2003  Under a law that went into effect in 1996, auditors are required to file so-called 10A reports when they detect likely illegal acts that have a material impact on the financial statements and appropriate remedial action isn't being taken by management or the board of directors. The GAO report put at 29 the total number of 10A letters received by the SEC since the law took effect through May 15, 2003.  "Of the 29 SEC registrants named in the reports, 10 are currently subjects of active SEC enforcement investigations, eight have had actions brought against them by the SEC, and 11 of the Section 10A reports were closed without formal action being taken by the SEC," the GAO said.
