 Perry Opposes Renewing Work On Stealth Jet --- Defense Secretary's Stance Deals Blow to Northrop, B-2's Prime Contractor   By By Thomas E. Ricks and Jeff Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1994  Defense Secretary William Perry said he firmly opposes renewing production of the B-2 Stealth bomber. His comments set up a major obstacle to a months-long campaign for the bomber by Northrop Grumman Corp., some top Air Force officials and dozens of members of Congress.  Mr. Perry indicated in an interview that he is thinking more about killing and stretching major defense programs than about starting or restarting new ones. "I do expect there will be some terminations" announced later this month, he said. But he declined to say precisely where the ax would fall among the 10 aircraft, missile and ship programs known to be under review by his office.  The forcefulness of the stand by Mr. Perry -- known in the defense establishment as "father of stealth" for his work in the 1970s on radar-eluding technologies -- chalks out the difficult battle ahead for Los Angeles-based Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor on the $44.4 billion B-2 program, and its allies in the defense industry and in Washington.
