 Anheuser-Busch Wins China Brewer; SABMiller Loses Harbin, But Battle Is Just Beginning For Largest Beer Market   By Joel Baglole in Hong Kong and Dan Bilefsky in Brussels, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 4, 2004  SABMiller had bid HK$4.30 (55 U.S. cents) a share on May 5 for Hong Kong-listed [Harbin], valuing the brewery at US$550 million, while Anheuser-Busch countered Tuesday with an offer of HK$5.58 per share, putting Harbin's value at US$720 million. The remainder of Harbin's shareholders are expected to accept Anheuser-Busch's offer.  Andre Parker, SABMiller's Asia chief, said he regretted not gaining control of Harbin but was unable to justify topping Anheuser-Busch's bid, which equates to about 50 times Harbin's 2003 net profit of US$14.7 million. "There's a price or ceiling to every deal. No deal has to be done," he said.  Management at Harbin welcomed the takeover by Anheuser-Busch. Peter Lo, Harbin's chief executive, said Wednesday, "The SABMiller offer was wholly unsolicited and not welcomed by the management or employees of Harbin. I am therefore delighted that Anheuser-Busch has stepped in as a white knight with a counterbid."
