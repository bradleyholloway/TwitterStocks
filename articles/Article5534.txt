 Deathbed Epiphanies   By By Richard Selzer, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1997  Jerome Groopman is distinguished as both a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an eminent research scientist in the fields of cancer and AIDS. It follows that all his patients suffer from one or the other of these diseases. Dr. Groopman has selected eight of these patients and written accounts of their lives from the first meeting until the last. Given the nature of their ailments, the last encounter is at the deathbed.  Not the least of the pleasures of this book is Dr. Groopman's kindly pedagogy, in which he instructs the reader in the mysteries of cell biology. "Recapitulated in the history of a single cell," he writes, "is the story of the greater organism: birth, reproduction, maturation, and death. The cancer cell rebels against this order, without maturing. It . . . seeks other venues for its mad orgy of reproduction, leaving its proper niche in tissues and wildly metastasizing." AIDS, Dr. Groopman teaches, is the "mirror image" of cancer. "Instead of the cell's unregulated growth, there is untimely death. HIV . . . targets the T cell, which is central to the immune defense system," inserting viral genes into its nucleus so that the T cell becomes "a factory for producing new HIV." Thus the AIDS patient becomes vulnerable to fatal infections.
