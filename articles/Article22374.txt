 Balanced U.S. Budgets Ad Infinitum? Don't Bet On It   By By George Melloan, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1998  Professors of political science in years to come may well assign their students to read Bill Clinton's State of the Union address of last week. Seldom has political oratory been so beautifully polished -- and so divorced from realities. The magic worked. The man walked into the House chamber disgraced by one too many scandals and walked out with his highest voter approval ratings ever, if you can believe the pollsters. A truly amazing performance.  But keep in mind that, however brilliant, it was only a performance. It is true that the state of the American union is strong. It is true that inflation and unemployment are low, and that the American economy has just enjoyed a new surge of growth (an annual rate of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year). But precious little of that originated in Mr. Clinton's disordered White House. Even the president himself was more subtle than in the past with his self-congratulations. This year, he gave the American people some of the credit for good times. His speech writer must have suggested dropping the grating claim that he, personally, is "growing the economy."  No one, however, cautioned him to cut back on obfuscation and hyperbole. His brag about the U.S. having its "smallest government in 35 years" may have some basis, but not in anything that counts. Federal revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product are approaching record levels, even as GDP climbs at a good clip. The rising economy has lifted all boats and narrowed the federal deficit, but it hasn't curbed government expansionism. Indeed, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott observed in his response to Mr. Clinton's speech that taxes at all levels are now consuming 38% of the incomes of American families.
