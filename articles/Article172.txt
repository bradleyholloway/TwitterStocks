MUSCATINE, Iowa, June 17â€” Roy J. Carver, one of Iowa's leading philanthropists and wealthiest residents, died last night in Marbella, Spain, apparently of a heart attack, aides said today. He was 71 years old.  Mr. Carver was chairman and founder of Bandag Inc., which makes a tire-retreading material and has operations in 90 countries. The company has its headquarters in this city of 24,000 people in southeastern Iowa, and Mr. Carver made his home here.  In 1973, Mr. Carver's wealth was estimated to range from $200 million to $300 million. However, his wealth was also shrouded in intrigue.  He once said that he invested $17 million in the Arab emirate of Qatar in the hope of a ''960 percent'' profit. According to the Justice Department, Mr. Carver also paid a $1.5 million bribe in March 1978 to a Qatar oil minister in obtain the oil concession for his partner, R. Eugene Holley, a wealthy Georgia investor. Embroiled in a Lawsuit  The deal foundered, however, when it failed to produce any salable oil, and Mr. Carver ended up embroiled in a $42 million lawsuit against a Texas oil company also involved in the deal.  Mr. Carver, who was born on Dec. 15, 1909, in Preemption, Ill., rapidly expanded his fortune after he founded Bandag in 1957. His success was assured when, in a visit to West Germany, he met a man who had developed a method of making a sturdier recapped tire.  Mr. Carver bought the North American rights to the process and later improved it. As a result, Bandag's sales grew rapidly in the 1970's, to $350 million in 1978 from $70 million in 1973.  He received a degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1934 and worked for the State Highway Department for four years before he went into business as a pump manufacturer. Gave Millions to University  Mr. Carver was active in Republican Party politics for a number of years, and was a member of civic groups and alumni groups in Iowa and Illinois.  He reportedly gave more than $8 million to the University of Iowa, including $3.5 million in Bandag stock in 1971. He later gave $2 million to help complete a $34 million hospital pavillion.  ''Iowa has been good to me,'' Mr. Carver once said. ''My roots are here.'' He had a flamboyant life style, shuttling between Iowa and homes in Miami and Cannes, France, where he had two yachts. He also was an avid pilot, and in 1954 made a one-stop solo flight across the Atlantic from Newfoundland to Paris in a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza.  ''Roy is a high flier,'' an acquaintance once said. ''For him, it's nothing but the best.''
