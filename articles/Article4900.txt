 Milken to Testify in Bribery Trial Of Ex-Fidelity Portfolio Manager   By By Jonathan M. Moses and Helene Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1992  Harry Manion, Ms. Ostrander's Boston attorney, said U.S. marshals would escort Mr. Milken from his Pleasanton, Calif., prison cell to the federal courthouse in Manhattan, where the trial is scheduled to start Tuesday. Judge Robert Owen approved the defense's petition to have Mr. Milken testify last month. Mr. Milken has no choice in the matter.  But it is to Mr. Milken's advantage to try to please federal prosecutors. Mr. Milken, who pleaded guilty to six securities fraud-related felonies, has asked for a reduction of his 10-year prison sentence. Judge Kimba Wood has said she will consider Mr. Milken's cooperation with the government when making her decision on that request.  Ms. Ostrander, who left Fidelity in 1987 to start up Ostrander Capital Management in Boston, faces two counts of bribery, and one securities law reporting violation. The charges stem from an investment she made in the MacPherson Investment Partnership, which Mr. Milken allegedly controlled. The partnership held warrants for the stock of SCI Holding Inc., a company created by Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts Inc. to acquire in 1985 Storer Communications Inc., a cable company. The deal, the largest leveraged buy-out at the time, was financed in part by $1.4 billion of junk bonds underwritten by Drexel.
