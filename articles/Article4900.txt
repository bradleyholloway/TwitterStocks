 States -- Making Government Work: South Carolina's Broad School Reform Includes Incentives or Punishment Based on Performance   By By Gary Putka, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1988  Young Miss Gadson and the six other children in her class need reading help. Under South Carolina's 1984 Education Improvement Act, one of the broadest of a five-year spate of state school reforms around the country, they get it. The program pays for remedial classes and gifted-children programs during the summer and regular school year, higher teacher salaries, and a tough new testing regime -- including a new high school graduation test. It also provides cash incentives to award high-performing schools, and punishments for lagging school districts.  While the federal government bemoans the deteriorating quality of U.S. education, states such as South Carolina have been acting to turn the situation around. New Jersey, for instance, has launched alternative certification for teachers, opening up the field to many talented people with no formal education training. Minnesota allows students to attend any public school in the state that will have them, taking money away from schools that lose kids. Massachusetts is piloting a "school based management" program that takes power away from central district offices and gives teachers more authority in staffing and instructional methods.  South Carolina's program, though controversial in some respects, has produced results. Since the law took effect, average scores for South Carolina students on the Scholastic Aptitude Test have risen 29 points, to 832 on a 1600 scale -- one of the biggest gains in the country. Attendance among the state's 620,000 students is up, as is the rate at which high-school graduates are going on to state colleges. And a higher proportion of South Carolina teachers report morale gains over the last five years than in any other state.
