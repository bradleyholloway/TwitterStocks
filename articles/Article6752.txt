 Canada-U.S. Lumber Talks Set Back; British Columbia Producer Opposes a Proposed Deal To Settle Trade Dispute   By Lynne Olver and Christopher J. Chipello, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2003  Rick Doman, president of Doman Industries Ltd., said the British Columbia company isn't supporting the U.S. proposal because the Canadian government can't distribute quotas fairly. Bill Legrow, vice president of transportation and energy at West Fraser Timber, said the proposed settlement "looks too much like perpetual quota" for Canadian companies shipping into the U.S. market. But in the softwood-lumber- trade file, one can't describe any particular proposal as dead or alive, he said. "Things just seem to evolve."
