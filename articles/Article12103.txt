 Business Brief: ValuJet Submits Plan to FAA Covering First Part of Program to Return to Skies   By By Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 1996  In its first step down what may be a long and hard road, ValuJet Airlines submitted a plan to the Federal Aviation Administration covering the first of a three-stage process in its bid to return to flying.  The low-cost carrier said its filing, made late Wednesday to the FAA's Atlanta regional office, includes a proposed timetable for resuming operations, as well as details of how the company will audit maintenance contractors. The plan also shows how the company has standardized its operating manuals and lists the qualifications of its management. Among other things, ValuJet has said it expects to name a senior vice president of maintenance and engineering who will report to the president.
