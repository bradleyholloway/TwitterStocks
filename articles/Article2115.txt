 The outlook: Few economists expect deflation in the U.S.   By Wysocki, Bernard Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1996  Although inflation rates took a surprising drop in much of the industrialized world in 1995, few economists foresee deflation in the US. In fact, most forecasters worried about rising inflation--and were dead wrong. Just where this trend is heading is stirring lively debate. This debate is at the heart of the split between what might be termed the mainstreamers, who argue that disinflation is alive and well, and some mavericks of the economics fraternity, who cite historic parallels with the deflationary 1880s and 1890s.
