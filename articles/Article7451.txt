 Gorbachev Proves to Be a Savvy Salesman Of Soviet Union's Views, the French Find   By By Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 1985  With boyish enthusiasm, Mr. Gorbachev told how in 1966 he and his wife drove "for several weeks" and 3,500 miles across France. The trip was made when Mr. Gorbachev was only a 35-year-old "apparatchik" from the Stavropol region.  The small talk gave French journalist and Soviet expert Michel Tatu of Le Monde a bit of color to make Mr. Gorbachev more attractive to the French and also some insight into the education of the first Soviet leader able to perform well in public.  "At last the Soviet Union has a leader who is able to talk, to walk, who is able to listen and to answer," Mr. Tatu says. "The U.S. had it too good up to now, but now they have to deal with a real human being, and that is more difficult." Mr. Tatu and others say what made last week's Gorbachev trip to Paris most notable is that he used this human flexibility not only for style but also for substance. He proved to be a capable salesman and a savvy chess player who maneuvered enough arms-proposal pieces to put the U.S. on the defensive ahead of the Nov. 19 Geneva summit.
