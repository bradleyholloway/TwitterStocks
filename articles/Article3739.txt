 Energy: Gas Gives Oil Giants a Foot in Middle East's Door; Some Places Offer Relative Stability, Surging Economies   By Gold, Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  Last month, the massive Dolphin pipeline started moving gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates, where it will be used to generate electricity and feed a growing industrial base. Occidental Petroleum Corp., based in Los Angeles, and France's Total SA own a quarter of the project each and booked substantial reserves. The rest is owned by the U.A.E.'s national oil company.  Meanwhile, companies ranging from Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Russia's OAO Lukoil Holdings, Italy's Eni SpA and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, are involved in consortia drilling for gas in Saudi Arabia's Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, in the kingdom's vast interior. Earlier this year, Britain's BP PLC signed a gas-exploration deal in Oman for two large fields that have sat undeveloped because of their complexity since their discovery a decade ago.  Exxon Mobil, the world's largest non-state-controlled oil company by market value, has benefited from its links with Qatar. Earlier this year, Exxon reported that more than one-third of its total reserves -- or the equivalent of 8.1 billion barrels of oil that is economically and technically feasible to extract from the ground -- were in the Middle East and Asia. Five years ago, the company had less than one- sixth of its global reserves in the region. Outside of the Middle East and Asia, Exxon's reserves have fallen significantly. While the company doesn't break out its reserves locations more specifically, it has acknowledged that a large chunk of the growth has come in Qatar.
