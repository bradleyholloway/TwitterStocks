 Big Board Will Ring Its Own Bell; Public NYSE Group Must Focus On Profits, Wider Investor Range; Shifting Balance With Wall Street   By Lucchetti, Aaron, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2006  "If it makes sense, I'll do it," Mr. [John Thain] replied, according to Mr. [Gerald D. Putnam]. (Mr. Thain doesn't dispute the account, the NYSE says.)  Dissident seat holders launched a campaign to undo the deal, arguing Mr. Thain had short-changed NYSE members. But Mr. Thain got a vote of confidence from an unexpected source -- former NYSE Chairman Dick Grasso, who complimented the Archipelago deal in a television interview. The exchange settled the dissident members' lawsuit in November, and the next month, 95% of NYSE members approved the deal.  -- Find his successor: Mr. Thain said his plan was to stay at the exchange for three to five years. He hits three years in early 2007. Mr. Thain has put several key Archipelago people around him in top NYSE Group positions. Archipelago's chief executive, Mr. Putnam, succeeds the retiring Robert G. Britz as the NYSE's president and co- chief operating officer. Nelson Chai, Archipelago's chief financial officer, is succeeding Amy Butte, the former chief financial officer, who is leaving the exchange. Archipelago's general counsel is also in line to succeed his departing NYSE counterpart.
