 Clear Message: MCI-BT Tie Is Seen Setting Off a Battle In Communications --- It Will Increase Competition, Trim Prices and Expand Services Around World --- A New Challenge for AT&T   By By John J. Keller and Mary Lu Carnevale, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1993  And the new BT-MCI alliance is a direct assault on American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s plans to offer global services to multinational corporations. "This is AT&T's worst nightmare," says Berge Ayvazian, telecommunications analyst at Yankee Group, a Boston research firm. "BT's now intimately partnered with AT&T's main U.S. competitor."  Already, the industry has been slowly moving toward alliances. France Telecom last year reached a more-limited cooperation pact with Deutsche Telekom of Germany, and Canada's BCE Inc. took a minority stake in Mercury Communications Ltd., a Cable & Wireless PLC unit that competes with BT for long-distance telephone customers in the U.K. A France Telecom spokesman said his company is continuing its long-simmering talks with AT&T about a possible alliance. The French and German governments are preparing to sell their state-owned monopolies to the public. And their new global joint venture, Eunetcom, has been trying to get AT&T or MCI to become its U.S. partner.  Under the agreement, BT will pay $4.3 billion in cash for a 20% stake in Washington-based MCI. BT will receive newly issued MCI shares at an average price of $64 a share. It will begin its investment tomorrow by purchasing approximately $830 million of preferred stock convertible into 4.9% of MCI's common, and it will acquire the remaining 15.1% for an estimated $3.4 billion when the transaction is closed by early 1994.
