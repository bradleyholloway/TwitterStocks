 Defining Events: World War II, Vietnam, AIDS   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1997  Thus it's not surprising that when asked in the Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey which major event has had the biggest impact on their generation, senior citizens choose World War II, while both baby boomers and the silent generation -- covering ages 30 to 64 -- cite the Vietnam War. These collective experiences were central to their generations.  But younger Americans in the 18-to-29 age group overwhelmingly specify the spread of AIDS as the major or defining issue of their times. Over half of these Generation Xers listed AIDS as having the biggest impact, far outdistancing more-collective experiences including the Reagan presidency, the Persian Gulf War, the collapse of communism or the global economy.  "Members of Generation X define themselves as the AIDS generation," observes Peter Hart, who, with Robert Teeter, conducts the poll. "This generation would label itself not with a collective experience but with a collective fear."
