 The Economy: Upbeat Fed Sees U.S. Economy Improving and Inflation Tame; Interest Rates Are Likely To Be Kept Low for Now; Producer Prices Inch Up   By Hilsenrsath, Jon E, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2004  The Fed report, known as the "beige book," also said that prices charged by retailers and manufacturers were "generally steady," despite increases in raw-materials costs. The point seemed to suggest that Fed officials believe inflation remains tame enough to keep interest rates low for now. The Fed's next policy meeting is Jan. 27 and 28.  Underscoring that point, the Fed's beige-book report noted that "wage pressures remained generally subdued."
