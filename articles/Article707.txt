 Semiconductor Concerns Report Gains In Orders and Shipments for December   By By Patricia Bellew Gray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1986  SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Microchip makers reported steady gains in orders and shipments in December, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, which said 1986 will be "a significantly better year" for the battered industry.  The industry trade group said average monthly orders for semiconductors for the three months ended Dec. 31 were $581.2 million, up 9% from $535.1 million from the three months ended Nov. 30. Microchip shipments rose 14% to $623.9 million in December from $547.2 million in November, the trade group said.  December's book-to-bill ratio, a closely watched indicator of the strength of the microchip industry, hit its highest point in 16 months, the association said. The ratio compares the volume of orders to the volume of shipments and is based on reports by U.S., European and Japanese semiconductor concerns.
