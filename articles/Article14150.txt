 Phillips Petroleum Offers 6% of Its Staff Plan to Retire Early   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1985  The company said the cost-cutting move affects 1,200 employees who are 55 to 57 years old. A spokesman said Phillips hopes the move will help reduce its work force to an "acceptable" level. But he added, "If we don't reach the desired level we're hoping for, layoffs may be required sometime in the future." He didn't elaborate.  Phillips is trying to reduce its payroll costs in an effort to reduce its heavy debt load, the bulk of which was assumed in a recapitalization earlier this year that turned back takeover attempts led by Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens Jr. and New York financier Carl Icahn. Under terms of the restructuring, Phillips exchanged $4.5 billion of debt securities for about half its shares outstanding, boosting its debt to about $7.3 billion.
