 Intel's Net Handily Beats Expectations --- But the Chip Giant Says Margins Will Be Lower In the Current Quarter   By By Dean Takahashi, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  Intel reported net income for the quarter of $1.74 billion, down 8.7% from $1.91 billion a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share were 98 cents, compared with $1.06 a year earlier and analysts' consensus of about 90 cents a share. Basic earnings per share, an additional measure required under a change in accounting standards, were $1.07 a share, down from $1.16 a year earlier. Revenue was $6.51 billion, up 1% from $6.44 billion a year earlier.  Investors have pounded Intel's stock since October, when fears arose over Intel's exposure to falling PC prices, particularly a new generation of computers priced at less than $1,000, and a possible meltdown in PC sales in Asian markets because of currency and economic crises. Intel shares hit a high of $100.50 in August, before falling to the $70 range by year's end.  To deal with the pressures, Intel resorted to time-tested methods. It accelerated the introduction of a manufacturing technology that makes its chips faster, smaller and cheaper to produce, allowing it to increase volumes and cut prices with relatively minor impact on profit margins. Intel spent heavily on advertising to encourage the use of Pentium II chips that haven't yet been copied by competitors, and realigned product development to create chips designed for specific market segments.
