 West German Economists Play Down Post-Reunification Inflation Threat   By By Erik Kirschbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1990  FRANKFURT, West Germany (APDJ) -- Threats to West German price stability due to reunification with East Germany are being exaggerated, a growing number of West German economists assert.  A week after the two German governments agreed to terms of monetary union, set to take effect July 2, and amid signals that the two states could merge politically perhaps by the end of the year, analysts are forecasting that inflation in West Germany won't spurt to intolerable levels. Most expect the cost of living to rise about 3%, little changed from last year, and considerably below some pessimistic estimates of 4% or more.  -- East Germans, who after July 2 will be able to convert their approximately 170 billion East German marks in cash and savings into about 120 billion West German marks ($72.44 billion), will be wary of depleting their savings in a buying binge of consumer goods because of uncertainty about employment.
