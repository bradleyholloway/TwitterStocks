 Storied Lawyer, In His Twilight, Sues His Firms   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2000  Four years ago, the celebrated former attorney for Richard Nixon was hired by a Philadelphia law firm looking to raise its profile in Washington. Mr. Garment settled into the $300,000-a-year job, drummed up some business, and finished up his memoirs, called "Crazy Rhythm." His book, whose title is based on an old jazz tune, won critical acclaim.  Adds Stanley Brand, one of Mr. Garment's lawyers in the Dechert suit, "Law firms don't know how to value" people like Mr. Garment. "It isn't a learned profession any more that values sagacity and experience," he says.  Mr. Garment says Mudge reneged on a $1.5 million retirement package, and he is seeking to hold his ex-colleagues personally liable, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. He is essentially "looking to get money from his closest professional colleagues," says one exasperated former partner. In court papers, the former Mudge lawyers said Mr. Garment wasn't entitled to any money because the firm was insolvent.
