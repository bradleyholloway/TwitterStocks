 Ask David Wessel   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2006  An additional $430 billion in U.S. government debt is held by state and local governments. And there is more than $200 billion in old- fashioned savings bonds. The rest of the money is held by various investors, largely Americans although sometimes foreigners hold U.S. Treasury bonds in U.S. accounts.  Not included in any of these figures is the amount of U.S. currency held outside the country, often by foreigners who trust the dollar more than their own currencies. According to the Federal Reserve, recent estimates show that between one-half and two-thirds of the $780 billion worth of U.S. currency in circulation is held abroad.
