 Building Bust: After 10-Year Feast, Realty Syndications Encounter a Famine --- Investors' Wariness Is Blamed On Tax-Revision Jitters; Initial Chapter 11 Filings --- Drought in Denver, Houston   By By Joanne Lipman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1985  Daseke says it will reimburse the syndication's investors. But the troubles aren't over for Daseke or the industry. The syndication industry, in fact, is in serious trouble for the first time. Syndications -- partnerships that raise money from investors to buy properties -- have pumped billions of dollars into real estate over the past 10 years, fueling a construction boom and lining the pockets of syndicators and investors alike. Many also have offered tax write-offs of $2 or more for every $1 invested.  But now a real-estate bust has pummeled some of the favorite markets, such as Houston and Denver. Investors are especially wary of syndications because proposed federal tax-law changes would kill the tax advantages they offer. Although tax revisions aren't expected to become law this year, real-estate experts still fear a bill may pass next year, dealing tax-shelter syndications a final blow.  "There is a shakeout going on," says Graham King, Daseke's president. The survivors, experts say, will be syndicators who turn their backs on tax shelters and diversify into other real-estate or financial-services products. Some have already started, including Integrated Resources Inc. in New York, VMS Realty Inc. in Chicago, and Equitec Financial Group Inc. in Oakland, Calif. Traditional tax-shelter syndication, says VMS Realty's chairman, Peter Morris, "is on the way out."
