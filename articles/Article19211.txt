 Palm's Hand-Held Wireless Computer To Offer Trading, Auctions, Shopping   By By Lisa Bransten, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1999  Consumers will be able to buy books, bid on auctions and make stock trades with the new Palm VII hand-held computer that 3Com Corp.'s Palm Computing unit is rolling out nationwide today.  Palm has struck deals to offer three new electronic-commerce services with the device. A program from Fidelity Investments will allow investors to trade stocks, a program from eBay Inc. will let consumers monitor auctions and enter new bids, and a program from Amazon.com Inc. will allow consumers to buy merchandise such as books, CDs and videos.  The Palm VII, the first in the popular series of hand-held computers to offer wireless capabilities, first hit the market in May in the New York area. Palm, Santa Clara, Calif., is also cutting the price of the device, which is about the size of a deck of cards, by $100, to $499.
