 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front: House of the Week / Putt In / Putt Out   By Casselman, Ben, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2006  Due Diligence: Located about 50 yards from the 12th fairway of the Pebble Beach Golf Links, this house has changed little since it was built in 1921, just two years after the course opened. The current owner, 89-year-old former Securities and Exchange Commission member Andrew Downey Orrick, acquired the house from his father, the first owner, in 1966. Designed in an English country style, the two-story house has views of both Carmel Bay and the golf course, which has been home to four U.S. Open Championships.
