 Merlot by Mail: Ordering Wine Online Gets Easier --- Courts Attack Quirky Rules That Make Buying a Hassle; Special License in Montana   By By Katy McLaughlin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2002  Winetasting.com, whose average bottle costs $37, promotes $60 and $75 bottles on its home page. On Winebid.com -- a sort of eBay for wine, where the average bottle costs $86 -- users can log on and not only bid on bottles of wine, but also bid on wine "futures," a particularly elite arena. TasteNtalk.com, a service launched in July to sell wine via Web-enabled cellphones, isn't for bargain hunters: The average bottles costs $85 to $125.  The recent court rulings have brought some hope to the ailing online wine business. After a string of dot-com flameouts, investors are starting to put money back into wine Web sites. Wine Tasting Network, which owns AmbrosiaWine.com and WineTasting.com, received $5 million in new funding less than a year ago and says sales are up 37% from a year ago. In July, one of the largest online wine retailers, Wine.com, raised $9 million.  That is remarkable considering the industry's reputation as an investment. Just a few years ago, at the height of the dot-com bubble, two of the biggest players, WineShopper.com and Wine.com (then under different ownership), together burned through $200 million of cash in just over two years, then went bankrupt. "Nobody is trying to say that online wine wasn't a complete mess," says Peter Ekman, chief executive of Wine.com.
