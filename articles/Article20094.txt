 Family Finances: Financing the Care of a Disabled Child   By Hadi, Mohammed, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2007  Mr. [Chris Sullivan]'s program works with clients whose children are in "very severe situations," such as severe cerebral palsy and severe autism. Such families need considerable savings, he says, because "it is now very common for a disabled child to live another 40 or 50, or sometimes 60 years."  "We asked for charity because when you have a child with a disability, you do things for them that you would not do for yourself," he says. "And that's what these groups are there for. They want to help."  Ms. [Alison Singer], whose 9-year-old daughter is autistic, notes that therapy for autism, which can cost thousands of dollars a week, isn't typically covered by insurance. "When parents have a child that is diagnosed with autism, it's a double whammy," she says. "First, they are hit with all of the emotional issues associated with having a child with disabilities and then they are told that they have to pay for the treatment themselves."
