 Pendulum Swings Back to 'Growth' Funds   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 7, 2007  "It's an inevitable cycle turn," says Howard Sontag, founder and principal of Sontag Advisory in New York. Mr. Sontag expects growth will shine for several quarters more, particularly since value stocks are coming off an unusually long run.  Tech stocks "have been a haven this year," says Morningstar stock strategist Toan Tran. "You're going to see a lot of money continue to flow into technology."  Foreign large growth funds, for instance, returned a solid 5.2% in the third quarter, according to Morningstar, but they didn't eclipse U.S. large-growth funds. That's a reversal from the first and second quarters.
