 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Theater: Mark Twain Forever!   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2005  To attempt so demanding a full-evening tour de force is risky business at any age, and I confess to having wondered how well Mr. [Hal Holbrook], who is 79, would hold up under the strain. Though he now relies on a wireless microphone, I rejoice to report that he is otherwise better than ever, and best of all in the second, darker half of "Mark Twain Tonight!" in which he gives voice to the peculiarly rigid pessimism of [Samuel Clemens]'s later years. One felt at times as though he were unaware of the presence of an audience, especially when he "read" the scene from "Huckleberry Finn" in which Jim's plight first awakens Huck's moral imagination ("I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right"). This is acting of the first order, blazingly inward, as real as a drop of blood and an honor to behold.  The problem, as so often with O'[Neill], is one of language. His characters are constantly required to utter with perfectly straight faces such stock phrases as "Is it giving me orders ye are, me bucko?" and "Py yingo!" (that's "By jingo!" to you). Of course he knew far more than I do about the way seamen talked a century ago, but even if they really did express themselves in stage Irish and Swedish, it is no longer possible for contemporary audiences to believe in that kind of dialect, no matter how correctly it is pronounced. Even more troublesome is the relentless obviousness with which O'Neill hammers home his points: "It was all men's fault . . . I hate 'em all, every mother's son of 'em. Don't you?"
