 Blueprint / Jacksonville, Fla.   By Maura Webber Sadovi, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2006  "Jacksonville is an underappreciated market," says Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley and president of Rosen Consulting Group LLC in Berkeley. Some larger national investors bypass Jacksonville because of its smaller size, he adds. "Of all the cities in Florida, it may be the most opportunistic place to be."  Part of the problem may be traced to Jacksonville's size -- at more than 800 square miles, it's the largest city in terms of land in the contiguous U.S. Paul M. Mason, chairman of the University of North Florida's Department of Economics and Geography, says that tends to encourage pockets of commercial development on its fringes that sometimes outpace demand. But, he adds, "as long as the economy continues to grow, that space is going to continue to be used up."  Kuhn Cos. of Orlando, which has been instrumental in the revitalization of Orlando's downtown, has snapped up three office buildings in downtown Jacksonville since September. The company paid $37.5 million for the former SunTrust tower, or $98.25 a square foot, and purchased the former Barnett Bank building for $4.95 million, or about $33 a square foot, says Cameron Kuhn, chief executive of Kuhn Cos. Now, he says, "you can't touch anything in the central business district for under $80 a foot."
