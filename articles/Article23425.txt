 Coke, Nestle Narrow Drink Venture; Move Frees Firms to Pursue Thier Own Coffees and Teas For Rapidly Growing Sector   By McKay, Betsy, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 2006  Coke, Atlanta, insisted the changes don't represent a substantial scaling back of the Beverage Partners Worldwide partnership, formed in 2001 and owned equally by the two companies. The move will have no effect on Enviga, a highly anticipated sparkling green-tea-based drink developed through the joint venture. Touted as a calorie burner, Enviga is being introduced in parts of the Northeast this month.  The moves announced yesterday underscore the changes roiling the global beverage industry as new categories of noncarbonated drinks emerge, often with growth rates far exceeding those of sodas. In a memorandum to Coke employees, Neville Isdell, the company's chairman and chief executive, said Coke and Nestle now "need the flexibility to mix and match from their independent soft drink, coffee, tea, water and juice platforms in creating innovative beverages."
