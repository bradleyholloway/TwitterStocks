 Citigroup, Merrill, General Motors Fall; IAC Rises on News Of Breakup Plan; Google Hits Record   By Talley, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  "The market quickly traveled down, but then came back quite a bit," said Linda Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors. "The hope is that this is a sign investors are starting to say this is a tale of two markets, the financials and home builders on one side and latter-economic-cycle sectors such as technology, industrials and materials on the other."  Merrill Lynch fell 1.40, or 2.4%, to 55.88, extending its 7.9% loss from Friday. The giant brokerage's co-president, Greg Fleming, late Friday told retail brokers that "risk remains" in the bank's deteriorating inventory of subprime-mortgage-related securities.  Dow industrial General Motors lost 99 cents, or 2.7%, to 36. The bankruptcy-reorganization plan for Delphi, the auto maker's largest parts supplier, appears headed for a fight after Delphi last week changed the plan's terms to account for trouble obtaining debt financing.
