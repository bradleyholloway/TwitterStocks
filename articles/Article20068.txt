 Chinese Doublespeak   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2006  On Friday, the Beijing High Court upheld a trumped-up fraud conviction against New York Times researcher Zhao Yan. The decision wasn't a surprise. Mr. Zhao had long been a thorn in Beijing's side for his reporting on the plight of poor farmers. His current legal troubles began in September 2004, when a Times report hinted at a conflict between President Hu Jintao and former President Jiang Zemin over military personnel. A subsequent article predicted that Mr. Jiang would resign his post as head of the military. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Zhao was arrested on charges of leaking state secrets. The Times maintains that Mr. Zhao was not the source for the latter story.
