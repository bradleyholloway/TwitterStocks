 Getting Going: Ten Ways to Watch Your Financial Weight   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 2006  3) U.S. vs. Foreign. Take your stock portfolio and calculate the percentage in U.S. shares and the percentage in foreign markets. A decent helping of foreign stocks is critical to a well-diversified portfolio, so I would aim to have 25% or 30% abroad.  Consider 2005. Sure, both U.S. and foreign stocks climbed. But there was a huge disparity in performance, with the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index up just 4.9%, while Morgan Stanley Capital International's Europe, Australasia and Far East index leapt 13.5%.  4) Large vs. Small. Just as you want to own both U.S. and foreign stocks, so you should invest in large and small companies. Three- quarters of the U.S. market is accounted for by the big blue-chip stocks in the S&P 500, with smaller companies accounting for the other quarter. Check that your portfolio has a healthy allocation to both market segments.
