 Pucker Up! Pepsi's Latest Weapon Is Lemon-Lime --- With Colas Getting Squeezed, Soda Wars Hit a Sour Note; It's Sierra Mist vs. Sprite   By By Betsy McKay, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 2000  This time, Pepsi thinks it has hit on the right formula. In a business where developing a new soft drink can take years, the company developed Sierra Mist in just a year. Developing a lemon-lime drink was high on the list of priorities Pepsi laid out for the beverage business last October. A six-member group, including Deepak Masand, Pepsi's director of marketing for flavored soft drink brands and executives from its two largest bottlers, worked on creating the brand.  Sierra Mist represents an opportunity for Pepsi to narrow the gap between it and Coke, which has a 44.5% share of the U.S. soft-drink market, compared with Pepsi's 31.4%. But competition from Sprite and 7UP, both popular with teens, will be stiff. Coke's Sprite has 6.8% of the soft-drink market, while Cadbury's 7UP has 2.1%, according to Beverage Digest. Both are planning countermoves. "We're going to defend our brand, and Sprite will defend, too," predicts Doug Tough, chief executive of Cadbury's U.S. business.  Some Pepsi bottlers worry Pepsi won't give Sierra Mist the marketing support they think it needs. In their view, the company hasn't put enough muscle behind Pepsi One, a diet drink it introduced in October 1998. For its part, Pepsi says the standard for success in soda has changed. It counts Pepsi One a success with just 0.8% market share. Ms. [Dawn Hudson] says, "New products take many years to grow."
