 Zenith Electronics To Post a Loss, Freezes Salaries   By By Robert L. Rose, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1989  Zenith Electronics Corp., backpedaling on its earnings outlook for the second time in six weeks, said it expects to report a third-quarter loss and temporarily froze salaries of about 6,000 employees.  At the company's annual meeting in April, Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said he expected an improvement this year from last year's earnings of $11.7 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $2.69 billion. But the company backtracked in late July, saying it was less confident it would see improved profit for the year.
