 Sailing to His Heart's Content   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1987  Aboard British Heart III -- Englishman James Hatfield sailed into New York harbor late last month on the final leg of a solo voyage around the world. Suntanned and trim, he overflowed with tales of storms, sharks, a vessel that sank beneath him -- and the "feeling of being born again after heart surgery."  The intense Mr. Hatfield has stopped in many countries on his three-year, 40,000-mile voyage to talk to heart patients, especially children, and to raise money for heart research. He's visited heart surgeons and watched heart surgery performed. In the cabin of British Heart III, his 29-foot sailboat, he keeps a log of his travels titled "Letter from the Heart."  Though Mr. Hatfield's reaction may be extreme, heart surgery triggers strong emotions. Reflecting the heart's symbolic status as the seat of human feelings, "heart surgery is associated with much more intense emotions than any other form of surgery," says Arthur Freeman, a psychiatry professor at the University of Alabama Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala. "When you operate on someone's heart, you're operating on more than a pump."
