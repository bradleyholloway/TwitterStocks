 Hoaxes on eBay Raise Questions on Safeguards   By By Ann Grimes, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2000  Online auctioneer eBay Inc. is no stranger to hoaxes. There was the couple who said they wanted to sell an unborn baby; the bidding for donated organs. And this week, the Web site discovered a fraudulent $10 million offer for the Internet name "Year2000.com." Had it been real, the bid would have set a record for the sale of a domain name.  And now Mr. De Jager is questioning the way eBay runs its system, at least when it comes to high-priced, high-profile auctions. "Not all bids warrant it, but for some of the larger items, they should require a secure deposit, just like a regular auction where they take a credit-card imprint," he says. "If you make a bid, you're going to be paying for that bid. If it's a hoax, and they've got someone else's credit card, it's fraud. You've upped the consequences."  He isn't alone in that view. Canadian accountant Andre Choquette put a domain name up for sale on eBay Monday. "Within two hours, we had an $8 million bid," he says. But hearing about Mr. De Jager's experience, he quickly e-mailed the bidder that a law firm would follow up to close the deal. "Within five minutes, a retraction occurred," he says. "We are now authenticating every bid that comes in."
