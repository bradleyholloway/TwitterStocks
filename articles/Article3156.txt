 Money-Market Funds Face Expense Crunch --- As Interest Rates Continue to Fall, Charges May Cut Into Yields; Many Fear a Loss of Investments   By By Karen Damato and Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 2003  Even without another round of rate-cutting by the Fed, a number of multibillion-dollar funds are scraping bottom in terms of the returns they pay investors. As of Tuesday, for instance, Reserve Primary Fund has a yield of just 0.29%. As of that same date, the average retail money fund tracked by iMoneyNet yielded 0.51% and giant low-cost funds offered by Vanguard and Fidelity Investments were yielding above 0.90%.  Fed officials are studying the impact on money funds, as part of a broad exploration of how to stimulate spending, if the federal funds rate, a short-term rate at 1.25%, were to be cut significantly further and if the current low inflation were to turn into deflation, or generally declining prices. If driving the fed funds rate to zero seems too disruptive to the financial system, the Fed may choose to leave it higher and try different ways to stimulate the economy, like coaxing down long-term bond yields.  Given today's tiny money-fund yields, investors should be reviewing the role these accounts play in their financial affairs. For most investors, "yield isn't the most important reason to be in money funds. It may be a distant third to safety and liquidity," says Peter Crane, a vice president and managing editor at iMoneyNet in Westborough, Mass. Money funds are a logical parking place for a family's emergency reserves and any additional money that will be spent within the next year or so, many financial advisers say.
