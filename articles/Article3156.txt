 Brazil Passes Pension Bill Crucial to Recovery --- Tax-Reform Plan Reflects First Step in Reviving Credibility in Markets   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Peter Fritsch in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Pamela Druckerman in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  Brazil's often-unpredictable Congress passed a long-stalled reform to the nation's insolvent pension system, a first crucial step in what is sure to be a long, slow climb back to credibility with world markets.  The legislature's lower house voted convincingly to tax the social security checks of retirees and increase the pension contributions of active civil servants. That represented the last step for approval. The controversial measure had been voted down four times by Congress in as many years, most recently in December, touching off a wave of market tremors that led to the massive loss of dollar reserves which culminated in last week's currency devaluation.  The vote's outcome, which most analysts had anticipated, is likely to cheer markets. Before the vote, Sao Paulo's stock exchange index rose 4% to 7,674 in light trading as a positive result appeared likely. Brazil's currency, the real, settled a quiet session at 1.58 to the dollar down from 1.56 reals per dollar on Tuesday. Dollars continue to flee Brazil at a worrying rate; $357 million left Tuesday, bringing losses so far this month to over $6 billion.
