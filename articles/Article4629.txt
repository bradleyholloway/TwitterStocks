 Lure of Lower Rates Leads To Broken Loan Agreements   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1986  SOMETIMES A DEAL isn't a deal, as some chagrined lenders are learning. With interest rates in a free fall lately, some builders and owners of income-producing properties are comparing their payments under the terms of mortgage commitments secured months ago with what they would be at today's rates. And the temptation of today's lower rates seems to be getting the best of them.  These borrowers are refusing to close on mortgage commitments in order to seek mortgages at current rates. Of course, borrowers usually don't want it known that they have walked away from commitments, so incidents are hard to verify.  But in this case, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association got its dander up when a Sacramento, Calif., partnership, One City Centre Associates, objected to some language in the final loan papers on a $20 million mortgage for a 35-year term at a 14.25% interest rate. In the 19 months between the commitment letter and the closing date, interest rates had dropped to about 11.9%.
