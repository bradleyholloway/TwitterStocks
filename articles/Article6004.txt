 Messy Canadian-U.S. Tomato Fight Alleges Dumping by State-of-the-Art Greenhouses North of the Border   By By Mark Heinzl, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2001  In this small town, long known as the "tomato capital of Canada," trucks spilling over with tomatoes trundle from farm fields to the local H.J. Heinz Co. factory in early fall. But many growers in this southern tip of Ontario, near Detroit, have gone indoors in recent years, where controlled conditions enable them to harvest plump, red tomatoes for U.S. and Canadian supermarkets much of the year.  The surge hasn't gone unnoticed by the handful of large U.S. greenhouse tomato growers, a few of whom have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in recent years. Canadian production soars in the spring and summer, when light is plentiful. The ensuing avalanche of tomatoes on the U.S. market often pushes down prices paid by distributors by more than half, says Fried de Schouwer, marketing director for Eurofresh Inc., a closely held Willcox, Ariz., tomato producer with 120 acres of greenhouses.  Eurofresh and other U.S. greenhouse operators filed a complaint in March with the U.S. Department of Commerce alleging that Canadian growers sell their U.S.-bound tomatoes below cost. The group asked for a duty on greenhouse tomato imports from Canada.
