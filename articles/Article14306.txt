 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Sewer Politics   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1986  The first contest of wills between the president and the 100th Congress will likely be a water fight. The president caused quite a stink last month when he vetoed the Clean Water Act, passed unanimously on election eve by the 99th Congress, on grounds that the price tag was three times the amount he had requested in his 1987 budget. The chairman of the House Public Works Committee, Rep. James Howard (D., N.J.), vows to reintroduce the water bill "word for word" on the first day of the new session.  The new Senate Environment and Public Works Committee chairman, Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, intends to do the same thing in the upper chamber. If Mr. Reagan vetoes the water bill this time around, observers say Congress will override it.
