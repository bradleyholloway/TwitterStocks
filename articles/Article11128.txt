 Turkey Establishes Hazelnut Union That Includes U.S. --- Top Producer-Exporter Seeks Role in Market Rules, Led by German Group   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1988  ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- In an attempt to live up to its reputation as the world's largest hazelnut producer and exporter, Turkey has established an international union in a joint effort with some other exporter and importer countries.  "Turkey is the leading country in the global hazelnut market, producing 75% of the world's hazelnut crop and having 70% of the world's import market," said Ertugrul Onen, general director of the exports department at the treasury and foreign trade undersecretary. But he said Turkey also wanted to play an active role in organizing the global hazelnut market.  Mr. Onen said a powerful importers' organization in Hamburg, West Germany, Waren Verein, had set all the rules in the global hazelnut market until now. "But this has got to be changed," he added.
