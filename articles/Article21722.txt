 Child Cancers Found to Rise Near Chernobyl --- Study Shows Radioactivity May Have Worse Effects Than Many Expected   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1992  Western health researchers found a substantial increase in the number of rare childhood cancers near the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, from which a catastrophic release of radioactivity occurred in 1986, suggesting that the accident's health effects may be worse than many experts expected.  In the first systematic Western study to be published on the subject, pathologists and epidemiologists organized by the World Health Organization confirmed 102 cases of thyroid cancer among young children in Belarus, a former Soviet republic just to the north of the accident site. Such cancers are normally rare in children; the number of cases in the Belarus region closest to the plant is about 80 times the normal rate.  The report, to be published in today's issue of Nature, a leading British scientific journal, is grimmer than many Western radiation-health specialists had expected. Reports of a surge in cancers and birth defects in Belarus and Ukraine, now also independent, have circulated widely since the Chernobyl disaster but had been dismissed by many Western specialists as exaggerated and inadequately documented.
