 Best on the Street (A Special Report): 2003 Analysts Review --- Health Care   By By Barbara Martinez, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  Yet Mr. [William McKeever] also scored with a company that does focus on the Medicaid market. Amerigroup Corp., which provides managed-care services to state Medicaid plans for the poor, had a 40% return for the four months of 2002 that Mr. McKeever recommended it. Though the Medicaid market, which relies on state funds to pay for health care, can be risky, Mr. McKeever says Amerigroup's management has been expert at keeping its costs below what the states pay.  In third place was John Rex at Bear Stearns Cos. In addition to WellPoint, Anthem and Trigon, Mr. Rex, 41, also did well with Coventry, which returned 24% during the short period he recommended it. UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest health insurer, returned 18% while Mr. Rex rated it a "buy" all year. Messrs. McKeever and [Joshua Raskin] also recommended UnitedHealth during 2002, and all three analysts continue to recommend the stock for 2003.
