WERTHEIM--Denise Pauline, passed away after a year long courageous battle with esophageal cancer at Mt. Sinai Hospital, Manhattan on Thursday, May 10, 2012, at age 53. Denise was born in New York City on Independence Day, 1958, the beloved daughter of Jack and Elise Wertheim, who predeceased her. Denise is survived by her father, his wife Jill, sister Alison, brother Mark, Uncle Mickey, niece Sarah and cousin Jason, all of whom gave Denise devoted love and comfort during her final months. After attending Edgemont High School, Scarsdale, Denise graduated from Ithaca College with a BA degree in journalism. She worked in the financial industry for 20 years, ten of them as a trader on Wall Street. September 11, 2001, hit her hard, and after losing close friends she decided to make a change and relocated to Santa Monica, CA. There, she devoted many years to teaching drama, music and dance to teens, touching the lives of many young people and serving on the board of Kids on Stage. Denise was devoted to animals, including her cats Rory and Mysti and Tibetan Terriers, Topaz and Ruby, who were with her during her last days. We will never forget Denise's brave fight against her devastating illness nor the pain she endured. Now that her suffering has ended, may Denise rest in peace.
