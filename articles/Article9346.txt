 Hedge Funds' Size, Tactics Should Affect Amount of Disclosure, Committee Finds   By By Allison Bisbey Colter, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2001  In its latest report, which was posted on IAFE's Web site (www.iafe.org), the committee concluded that the amount of information hedge-fund managers can safely disclose about net asset value, risk factors and investment return by region, asset class and duration depends to a large degree upon the size of their portfolios. Since smaller funds are unlikely to move markets, there is little chance that disclosing detailed information about their holdings will hurt performance. But larger funds can't disclose too much without inviting "predatory trading" that could move markets against them.  The committee concluded that a hedge fund's investment strategy also dictates how much it can safely disclose, since some managers deal in securities that are more liquid than others or trade in and out of positions more frequently. For managers who don't want to place investors' interests at risk by providing detailed information about their holdings, the committee said it would be useful to report their top 10 single exposures and concentrated sector exposures on a net basis.  Big institutions such as pension funds and university endowments are increasingly investing in hedge-fund strategies through separate accounts that allow them to see all of a manager's trades. But the IAFE's Investor Risk Committee concluded early on that full transparency isn't necessary to monitor the risk in a portfolio and that summary information about risk, return and positions can be sufficient, and that the appropriate level of detail, frequency and delay varies by type of strategy.
