 Tweaking the Standard-Issue PC; Retailers Expand Lineup Of 'Exclusive' Machines; Can You Comparison Shop?   By Lawton, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2007  That's because there is a movement afoot by PC makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell Inc. and Toshiba Corp. to build exclusive PCs for certain retailers. The exclusives range from PCs designed specifically for one retailer, to special component configurations, to PC vendors selling their wares just in one store, if only for a limited time. Choosing an exclusively designed PC can end up costing consumers more money, but the products are generally of higher quality.  Meanwhile, H-P in April introduced a $599 Spanish-language desktop PC sold only at CompUSA Inc. stores. H-P is also working with Wal-Mart on an exclusive laptop that comes with an extended battery, laser mouse and high-quality speakers. And the company is launching a notebook computer, dubbed the Verve, designed for college-age consumers and young professionals and available just in Best Buy in mid-July. Last year, H-P worked with Best Buy Co. to produce a limited-edition silver-and-white notebook that was one of the retailer's top-selling PCs above $1,000 over the Christmas shopping season.  These PC designs for stores are growing as retailers and PC vendors seek to differentiate themselves amid a cutthroat and maturing U.S. PC market. Over the first three months of the year, U.S. PC sales rose only 3.6%, down from 5.3% a year earlier, according to market-research firm IDC. That was the lowest first-quarter growth rate for PCs since 2003, when the tech world was mired in a slump. As a result, PC makers are increasingly being forced to use savvy marketing, new technologies and fresh designs to draw the attention of customers.
