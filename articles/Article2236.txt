 Letters to the Editor: Voters Reject `Open Borders'   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 13, 1996  Mr. Gigot's use of the apparent razor-thin victory of Loretta Sanchez to bootstrap his argument is just as groundless. Numerous factors, including his failed presidential bid, weakened Rep. Robert Dornan -- a strong proponent of legal immigration, by the way -- in this race. Mr. Gigot dismisses the potential negative impact of the California Civil Rights Initiative on Republicans by noting that one-third of Hispanics supported CCRI. He fails to mention that the same percentage supported Proposition 187 in 1994, which allegedly started the GOP troubles in the first place. And he also fails to mention the support among Hispanics for immigration reform in the 104th Congress, as evidenced by the Hispanic Business Roundtable's endorsement of the House bill to reform legal as well as illegal immigration.
