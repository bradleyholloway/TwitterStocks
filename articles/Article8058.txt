 Ford Scales Back Marine Midland Finance Purchase   By By Bradley A. Stertz, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 1990  DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it signed an agreement to buy part of Marine Midland Banks Inc.'s auto-finance operations much later and on a far reduced scale than originally contemplated.  Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed by either Ford or Marine Midland. The companies first announced they were negotiating the sale of Marine Midland's auto financing operations in April. The Buffalo, N.Y.-based banking company had been at the forefront of a rush by commercial banks to set up financing for car dealers and buyers. Marine Midland eventually built the nation's fourth-largest auto financing operations behind the credit arms of the Big Three U.S. auto makers.
