 Major Oil and Gas Discovery Is Made By Amoco, Exxon in the Gulf of Mexico   By By Caleb Solomon and Patricia Ann McKanic, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1988  Amoco Corp. and Exxon Corp. said they made a major oil and gas discovery in the Gulf of Mexico -- but in water so deep that development will involve big economic and technological hurdles.  The discovery, in an area called Viosca Knoll about 55 miles east of the Mississippi River Delta, "could be one of the larger deep-water finds to date in the gulf," said L. Richard Flury, a vice president of Amoco, the operator of the well.  In Block 956 of Viosca Knoll, Amoco drilled an exploratory well at a water depth of 3,560 feet -- deeper than any other discovery in the Gulf, said a spokeswoman for the Minerals Management Service in New Orleans. Amoco said, though, that it believes oil and gas have already been discovered in deeper waters but that the finds haven't yet been announced.
