 Leading the News: BP Focuses on Six New Areas for Future Growth --- Oil Producer Invests $6.75 Billion for Stake In Russian Venture   By By Chip Cummins in London and Jeanne Whalen in Moscow, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2003  BP's new strategy comes after the company lowered its production-growth forecasts three times in 2002. BP Chief Executive John Browne, speaking in London yesterday, made it clear he will in the future focus on improving BP's profitability, even if that means production remains flat. The company said its output of oil and natural gas grew 2.9% last year, just under an already-reduced 3% target for the year.  Under terms of the deal, BP would pay Russia's Alfa Group and Access-Renova about $3 billion in cash and three annual installments of BP shares, each valued at $1.25 billion at market prices at the time of the payments. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, including European Union and Russian antimonopoly review. BP said it expects to complete the deal this summer.  The new Russian company will give the partners a platform from which to target the energy-hungry markets of the Far East, including emerging economic giant China. The company holds a majority stake in a giant Siberian gas field near the Chinese border and stakes in several exploration blocks off the coast of Sakhalin Island. BP has tried without much success in recent years to get projects off the ground in the Far East. Analysts said it would have more luck tackling them as part of a large Russian company rather than as an outsider. It will also give BP a stake in a proposed $4.5 billion Arctic port and pipeline that Russian producers want to build to ship oil to the U.S.
