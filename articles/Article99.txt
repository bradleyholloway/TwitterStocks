Birgit Nilsson, who's in New York from her home in Sweden to prepare for a couple of concerts next weekend at the Metropolitan Opera House, went there the other night to see ''La Traviata.''  At the beginning of the first act, she later told friends, ''just before the Drinking Song, I turned to a friend and whispered, 'Who is that young idiot from the chorus who holds his champagne glass so high that the soprano has trouble filling it from the bottle?' ''  Moments later, she said, the ''young idiot'' opened his mouth to sing and Miss Nilsson almost cried out in surprise.  It was the voice of her old friend, Placido Domingo. Later she went to see him backstage.  ''Placido,'' she said, ''we haven't seen one another for six months and in that time you must have lost 40 pounds, grown two inches taller, and shed at least 15 years. How do you do it?''  ''Willpower,'' Mr. Domingo replied. Albin Krebs Robert McG. Thomas Jr.
