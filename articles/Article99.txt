 Gold Producers LAC, American Barrick Plan Seperate Equity Issues   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 1989  Two of Canada's major gold producers said they plan to take advantage of the strong market for gold bullion and gold stocks to raise a total of 404.3 million Canadian dollars (US$345.6 million) through equity issues. LAC Minerals Ltd. said it plans to raise C$294 million by selling 21 million units, each consisting of one common share and one-half of a warrant, to the underwriters RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Gordon Capital Corp. It said one warrant would entitle the holder to buy one common share for C$14.25 before Dec. 15, 1991.
