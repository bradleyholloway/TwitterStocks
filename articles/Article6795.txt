 After Poor Opening, 'The Alamo' Looks Like a Loser for Disney   By Orwall, Bruce, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2004  The failure is noteworthy and ill-timed because Disney and its chief executive officer, Michael Eisner, are under heavy pressure to meet or exceed the company's financial targets in the wake of a shareholder revolt. At Disney's recent annual meeting, 43% of the shares voted opposed Mr. Eisner's re-election to the board. The board stripped Mr. Eisner of his chairman title as a result, and his ability to hang on as CEO is now tied closely to Disney's performance in coming months.  Now the question is what impact the nose dive of "The Alamo" will have on Disney's ability to achieve the 30% earnings growth Disney has promised in 2004. Disney's film projections for this period were conservative and didn't bank on any of the films in question becoming a major hit. The company signaled as much to Wall Street earlier this year, prompting some analysts to lower their projections for the performance of the studio. Disney's fiscal year began Oct. 1, and so far the studio's performance has been propelled by strong DVD releases of films like "Finding Nemo" and "Pirates of the Caribbean." The company has just begun its fiscal third quarter, and is hoping that the improving fortunes of its theme parks will propel it during this period.
