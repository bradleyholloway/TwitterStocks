 Mercedes Raises ML320 Base Price, To Unveil ML430   By By Gregory L. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. is raising the base price of its ML320 sport-utility vehicle by $1,000, to $34,950, for the 1999 model, and will introduce the ML430, equipped with a V-8 engine, at $43,750, company officials said this week.  "With these two, we can cover basically the whole premium (sports utility vehicle) segment," Roland Utenwoldt, product specialist for the M-Class, said. Both models will be built at Mercedes's plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The premium part of the market, defined as vehicles costing more than $29,000, has doubled in size during the past several years and Mr. Utenwoldt said it is expected to continue growing.
