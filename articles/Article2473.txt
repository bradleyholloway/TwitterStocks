 Stocks Slide With Bonds And Dollar --- Bank, Utility Shares Are Hit by Concern Over the Economy   By By Anita Raghavan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1993  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.50 points to 3443.49 after plunging more than 40 points earlier in the day. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index skidded 2.36 to 445.10 and the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.06 to 661.97.  Two other specialized stock indexes, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which barreled to record highs last week, sustained sharp setbacks. The utility index lost 2.07 points to 243.30 and the transportation index dived 22.16 to 1645.01.  Analysts said a steady drumbeat of bad news sent stock prices reeling from the opening bell. First, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 4.6% in March. Later, a report from Johnson Redbook showed that retail sales in the two weeks ended April 17 slipped a seasonally adjusted 0.1% from March. The report was particularly worrisome because it seemed to contradict the view that bad weather alone contributed to the recent spate of grim economic statistics.
