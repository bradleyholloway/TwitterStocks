 Lionel, Two Units Cleared to Emerge From Chapter 11   By By Michael Siconolfi, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 1985  A federal bankruptcy court judge approved Lionel Corp.'s amended reorganization plan, allowing the toy retailer and two units to emerge from bankruptcy-law proceedings.  The approval by Judge Burton R. Lifland effectively concludes Lionel's 3 1/2-year-old operations under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and provides the company's creditors with cash and stock representing between 80 cents and 90 cents on each dollar of claims.  Michael J. Vastola, Lionel's chief executive officer, testified in court that the company will generate funds to complete the plan through, among other things, a $20 million revolving bank credit agreement with New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Corp. scheduled to be signed today, and the sale of Lionel's 82% interest in Dale Electronics Inc., a Columbus, Neb.-based maker of precision electronic parts that isn't part of the bankruptcy-law proceeding. Dynamics Corp. of America, based in Greenwich, Conn., has agreed to pay $67.5 million for the stake, but Lionel said it will solicit higher bids next Wednesday.
