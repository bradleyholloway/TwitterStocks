 TI Sets Pact to Sell Sensors Unit To Bain Capital for $3 Billion   By McWilliams, Gary, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2006  Dallas-based TI expects to report a pretax gain of about $2.5 billion when the deal closes sometime before June. The move by Boston- based Bain Capital, one of the world's largest buyout funds, further highlights the interest in high-tech investments among private-equity groups.  Kevin P. March, TI's chief financial officer, said the company expects a "sizeable tax bill" from the sale, but hasn't otherwise designated what will be done with proceeds from the sale.
