 Patients Give New Insurance Mixed Reviews; Consumer-Directed Health Plans Can Cut Costs, but Early Users Cite Problems Comparing Prices   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  At Logan Aluminum, which switched to a consumer-driven plan two years ago, human relations chief Howard Leach says the Russellville, Ky., company's health-care spending declined 6% in the first year on the plan and another 1.5% the second. While emergency-room visits are down -- largely because consumers are more likely to opt for a less expensive urgent-care clinic -- doctor's office visits have increased slightly, he says. "To me, that says employees aren't skimping on necessary health care," Mr. Leach says.  Logan employee Linda Foster says that since switching to the consumer-driven plan, she has been cost-conscious, being more consistent about using a less-expensive mail-order prescription service, for instance. When the 42-year-old mother recently called a couple of urgent-care centers to ask about the cost of a visit, none would tell her the price upfront. "That's where I see the limitations," Ms. Foster says. "You really have to do some digging to get the information you need."  For instance, Whirlpool built enough financial incentives into its consumer-directed offering that 40% of its U.S. employees opted to join it when it first began in January 2004. The company covers physicals, immunizations and other preventive care upfront, then contributes a certain amount to the employee's personal care account before the deductible kicks in. By January of this year, the percentage of employees who joined the consumer-directed plan was 55%, says Janice Pushaw, director of Whirlpool's global benefits strategy. Logan also fully covers preventive care before patients begin to pay money out of their account.
