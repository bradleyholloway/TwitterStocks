 Ahead of the Tape   By Ip, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2007  Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, says that's the case with the popular ABX indexes, which track subprime mortgages. Using J.P. Morgan's model to calculate the scenarios for home prices and defaults implied by the current level of ABX indexes, he found the current price of the AA portion, or tranche, is predicting a 27% decline in home prices over the next five years -- a drop he says has occurred nationally only in the Great Depression.  Stock derivatives seldom wander far from fair value, because it's easy for arbitragers to trade the underlying stocks and bring the price of the derivatives and the underlying stock into alignment. By contrast, the assets underlying credit derivatives are relatively illiquid. The ABX indexes are derived from credit derivatives that are themselves derived from subprime-backed collateralized debt obligations that hold the actual mortgages. So, the index is several steps removed from the underlying assets.
