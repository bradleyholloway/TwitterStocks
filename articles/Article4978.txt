 Saks Fifth Avenue Will Peddle Wares On QVC Network --- Accord Could Spawn Others And Be Medium's Diamond, Instead of Cubic Zirconium   By By Mark Robichaux, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1993  Saks Fifth Avenue, a New York retailing chain, agreed to become the first major specialty store to sell its merchandise through QVC, the television shopping network.  The agreement is likely to spawn similar deals with other specialty retailers and fashion designers. Already QVC has had talks with Calvin Klein, Bloomingdales, Revlon and a host of others about selling their wares on TV.  In recent months, new developments have swayed skeptics. Entertainment mogul Barry Diller stepped in as chairman in December, investing $25 million for a stake in QVC. Mr. Diller was initially inspired by the home shopping medium when he saw designer Diane Von Furstenberg sell some $2 million of her line of silk blouses in a matter of hours.
