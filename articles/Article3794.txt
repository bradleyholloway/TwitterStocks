 A Fund Mogul's Costly Apology; Strong Agrees to Pay $60 Million And to a Lifetime Industry Ban As Part of Rapid-Trading Deal   By Oster, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2004  As part of the settlement, the SEC barred Thomas A. Hooker, Strong's former compliance chief who allegedly discovered Mr. Strong's improper trades in 2000 but failed to ensure that the trading stopped, from the mutual-fund industry. Anthony J. D'Amato, a former [RICHARD S. STRONG] executive vice president who allegedly arranged for Canary's improper trades, was also barred from the industry and from being associated with broker-dealers.  Mr. Hooker's attorney, Richard J. Morvillo, said that Mr. Hooker neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, and that he "wanted to put this behind him and move on with his life." Mr. Hooker, who was placed on administrative leave in February, resigned from Strong yesterday. Mr. D'Amato's attorney, Steven Molo, couldn't be reached to comment.  The documents show that Mr. D'Amato established the relationship with Canary. A subordinate of Mr. D'Amato tried to turn away the hedge fund's timing business, saying that "we don't want to encourage things like that here at Strong," both complaints said. Mr. D'Amato accepted the business anyway. The New York attorney general's complaint points out that Mr. D'Amato, who owned a 1.55% stake in Strong Financial, "profits personally ... when any part of the business makes money."
