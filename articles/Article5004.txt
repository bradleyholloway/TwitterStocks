 CMS Energy Corp. Sets Up New Unit For Nuclear Plants   By By Gregory Witcher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1989  DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. is establishing a new subsidiary to complete abandoned nuclear power plants or convert them into conventional fuel-powered facilities.  The subsidiary, which is scheduled to begin operating here Monday, is a new business venture for CMS and is believed to be the first one of its kind in the U.S. set up exclusively to complete, convert or rebuild nuclear plants.  CMS's new venture stems from its experience in converting its mothballed $4.2 billion Midland nuclear facility in Michigan into a gas-fired cogeneration facility. The conversion, which is 60% complete, cost about $650 million. The plant, abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs, is scheduled to begin producing steam and electricity for sale in early 1990.
