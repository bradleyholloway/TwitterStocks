 Business Brief -- Fleetwood Enterprises Inc.: Cash-Flow Shortfall In Quarter May Lead To Default on Loan   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  Since Fleetwood's cash flow -- defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- for its fiscal first-quarter was a negative $2.7 million, the company would be required to generate cash flow of $17.7 million in the second quarter to comply with the terms of the loan. If Fleetwood were to default on its loans, the company said it would make "every effort" to negotiate a "satisfactory solution" with its lenders, but couldn't be certain such a remedy could be reached.
