 Gore Wins Endorsement of AFL-CIO; Teamsters and UAW Withhold Support   By By Glenn Burkins and Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1999  JOHN J. SWEENEY is president of the AFL-CIO. His name was incorrectly given as James Sweeney in an article Thursday on the AFL-CIO's endorsement of Vice President Al Gore. (WSJ Oct. 20, 1999)  LOS ANGELES -- Vice President Al Gore captured the endorsement of the AFL-CIO and secured for his presidential campaign the machinery and muscle of one of the Democratic Party's most powerful organizations -- and one of its most liberal.  "I pledge to you today that, as president of the United States, I will be a voice for working families in everything I do and say," an ebullient Mr. Gore said. The Teamsters and United Auto Workers opposed the resolution approved here yesterday, denying Mr. Gore a unanimous endorsement.
