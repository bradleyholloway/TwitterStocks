 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus: A Gesture With A Point   By Varadarajan, Tunku, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2005  No explanations were needed and no anthropologists required to intone -- The shoe, you see, is unclean in Islam -- what the precise meaning of a raised, ink-stained digit was. It was a voters' badge of courage, a voters' stamp of honor, a spontaneous giving of the Baghdad bird to those who would stop them from exercising a democratic right -- a violet-blue "up yours" (how else to put it?) to Abu Musab al Zarqawi, the unabashed and murderous enemy of democracy who had just declared that to vote, for a Muslim, is to commit heresy, and not merely heresy but apostasy.  Islam's injunction against democracy -- in Zarqawi's words -- "is non-negotiable, and there can be no concession regarding it whatsoever." Yet there they were, Iraq's heretical voters, their fingers up, as if for Zarqawi himself to observe.  If they were sending him a message, they chose a stirring way to do it. The hand gesture has a peculiar potency in the human condition. Elias Canetti, in his "Crowds and Power," wrote that words and artifacts -- in effect, the sum of all human expression -- are the "products of a single unified experience: representation by means of the hands." Everything that modern man can feel, everything that moves his spirit, continues to "retain its pristine force in gesticulation."
