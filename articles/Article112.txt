The industrious little city of Bourges, which lies at the geographical heart of France, could never be characterized as a sleepy cathedral town. It is, to the contrary, very much awake, as was recently demonstrated when its citizens rose to protest the construction of a convention hall that would have obstructed the view of their beloved cathedral. Gathering 17,000 signatures from among the town's 80,000 inhabitants, they forced the city to scrap its plans and, as a result, a public garden and underground parking lot now occupy the site.  The new garden will be welcomed by the thousands of tourists who annually visit Bourges, a key gateway to the chateau country of the Loire Valley. But Bourges is a prime destination in itself. Because of the vital role the city has played in the country's past, it is regarded by many visitors as a living history museum. At one time or another, the city was the birthplace and home of kings and for one brief moment it was virtually the capital of all France.  Joan of Arc spent the winter of 1429 in Bourges, John Calvin was converted to the ideas of Luther while studying at the local university and in 1443 Jacques Coeur, a merchant-prince, built a sumptuous palace in the city that still stands.  It is upon entering the Palace of Jacques Coeur, the man who financed the armies of Joan's Dauphin, King Charles VII, that the visitor senses Bourges's past glory. At every turn sculptured hearts play upon the owner's name, and inscribed in stone on a balustrade is the Coeur motto - ''A vaillans coeurs, riens impossible'' (to the valiant heart, nothing is impossible).  Bourges stands at the junction of the Yevre and Auron rivers. Although Stendhal wrote of its marshy environs that it was a city ''surrounded by plains of bitter ugliness,'' its location has made Bourges the capital of a rich agricultural district, producing corn, sheep, beef and wines in abundance. This, combined with the city's role as a manufacturing center for arms, aircraft, tires, liquor and clothing, has further enhanced its position as prefecture of the Department of Cher.  For the visitor, many vestiges of the past remain. Part of the Roman ramparts, built from materials that were already old, can still be traced in the medieval houses, many of which can be seen on a stroll along the winding, cobbled streets.  There are other mansions open to the public besides the Palais Jacques Coeur. One of the finest is the Hotel Cujas at 6 Rue des Arenes, which was built by a Florentine merchant in 1515. It now houses the Musee de Berry, which has a rich collection of Roman artifacts. The museum is open from 10 to 11:30 A.M. and from 2 to 5:30 P.M., daily except Tuesday, and the admission is 40 cents.  Another mansion, the Hotel Lallemant, at 6 rue Bourbonnoux, was built in the 1500's and is a remarkable example of a Renaissance dwelling. It was built by a merchant named Jean Lallemant, and its rich furnishings have transformed it into a museum of decorative arts. The mansion is open daily, except Tuesday, from 10 to 11:30 A.M. and from 2 to 4:30 P.M.; admission is 40 cents.  Even the City Hall in Bourges is a former palace, the residence of a 17th century archbishop. Its expansive garden, designed by Le Notre, has a fine view of the eastern end of the cathedral.  There are about 30 moderately priced hotels in Bourges, among them the Angleterre, at 1 Place des 4 Piliers, where double rooms cost about $30 a day, and Les Tilleuls, 7 Place de la Pyrotechnie, where doubles rent for $20.  It is generally agreed that the best restaurant in Bourges is the Jacques Coeur, 3 Place Jacques Coeur, where the specialty is coquilles St.-Jacques, and the price of entrees ranges from $18 to $24. Another fine restaurant is the Ile d'Or, 39 Boulevard Juranville, with prices of entrees ranging from $13 up.  To get to Bourges by car from Paris, follow Route N-20 south to Vierzon, where N-76 takes one directly into the city. There is a direct train that leaves Austerlitz Station in Paris every day at 9:07 A.M. and arrives in Bourges at 11:23 A.M. The one-way fare is $26.90 first class and $18 second class. - ROBERT J.
