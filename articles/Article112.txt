 Multibillion-Dollar Pyramid Scam Leads to Taiwan Executives' Arrest   By Mark, Jeremy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 1990  In the past two days, almost all top Hung Yuan officials have been arrested on suspicion of violating the country's banking law. In Taipei, the prosecutor's office confirmed the arrest of eight officials, including the group's head, Shen Changsheng. Three other officials were reported under arrest in other cities.  Taiwan's Bureau of Investigation said it had summoned 42 people for questioning and that its agents searched 33 offices and residences. But Taiwan newspapers reported that several Hung Yuan officials couldn't be located, including Yu Yungming, Hung Yuan's former president.  The government also froze what little remains of Hung Yuan's assets, which officials and analysts say were amassed primarily through a pyramid deposit-taking scheme that offered very high returns, and through real estate speculation and stock market manipulation. Late last year, the Bureau of Investigation said it believed the group's deposits totaled $6 billion. One Taiwan newspaper reported that Mr. Shen had told investigators Hung Yuan owed $3.5 billion to depositors and still has about $1.1 billion in assets.
