Elmer Horton Ripley, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, died yesterday in Doctor's Hospital on Staten Island. He was 90 years old. Mr. Ripley was born in Staten Island in 1891, a few months before basketball was invented.  Mr. Ripley was an outstanding professional player in the game's barnstorming years and played for 11 teams in 17 years, including the Original Celtics. After he graduated from high school, he began his professional career in 1908 and played in his last pro game in 1930. A 5-foot-8-inch guard, Mr. Ripley played on an all-star team at the San Francisco World's Fair in 1914.  Mr. Ripley began 28 years of college coaching in 1922 at Wagner and remained there for three seasons. He went to Georgetown in 1927 and coached the Hoyas for 10 seasons in three different periods, ending with the 1948-49 season. His Georgetown team of 1942-43 lost to Wyoming in the final of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  He coached at Yale from the 1929-30 season through the 1934-35 season, winning the Ivy League championship in the 1932-33 season. He also coached at Columbia during the 1943-44 and 1944-45 seasons, at Notre Dame for the 1945-46 season, and at Army during the 1951-52 and 1952-53 seasons. His teams won 298 games and lost 228.  Among the players he coached in college were Don Shula, the coach of the Miami Dolphins; William A. Shea, the lawyer for whom Shea Stadium was named; and John McHale, the president of the Montreal Expos.  After three years as coach of the Harlem Globetrotters, Mr. Ripley coached the Israeli Olympic Team in 1956 and the 1960 Canadian Olympic Team. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., in 1972.  Mr. Ripley retired in 1973 after having coached at Englewood (N.J.) School for Boys since 1962. Mr. Ripley is survived by two nieces, Mrs. Elizabeth Garnett of Staten Island and Virginia Fieldman of Jonesboro, Me.  Illustrations: Photo of Elmer Ripley
