 Wine Country Status: Silicon Valley Rich Have Home Vineyards --- Keeping Up With the Joneses Requires It; Bill Murphy Will Put Your Crop in Bottles   By By Ann Grimes, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2000  Inktomi Inc. CEO David C. Peterschmidt took "baby pictures" of his burgeoning cabernet crop last year, Mr. [Bill Murphy] reports. His grapes are young -- just four years old. His first crop -- enough for about 50 cases of wine -- will go into Mr. Murphy's neighborhood blend, which retails for about $28 a bottle.  Mr. Murphy has made a postretirement career out of planting and maintaining home vineyards. His own back yard is neatly lined with a quarter-acre of vines. Nearly 400 of them turned a bright wave of yellow this fall, rising up behind a hedge of roses around his swimming pool. Down the street, a quarter acre of newly picked cabernet vines cascade down a neighbor's front yard, a blanket of mottled orange. And across town, a friend has buffered his back deck with dozens of rows of cabernet grapes that are now losing their leaves.  At CordeValle, a new development in the San Martin foothills south of San Jose, and not far from a planned Cisco Systems Inc. campus, which is to employ 20,000 people, three-acre "vineyard estates" are going up next to a golf resort and a winery Mr. Murphy is going to run. Each house is surrounded by vines. "They're serene, upscale and romantic," developer Steve Zales, says of the vineyard plots.
