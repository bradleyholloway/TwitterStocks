 Business and Finance [1]  The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 1986  RETAIL SALES FELL 0.1% in May, suggesting consumers remain cautious due to the sluggish economy. The drop surprised economists, who had expected lower energy prices to boost consumer spending. U.S. businesses, meanwhile, plan to reduce capital spending 1.3% this year, the first drop since 1983.  Treasury bond prices climbed, partly in reaction to the retail sales report. Blue chip stocks ended lower, but the broader market posted a small gain in light trading.  The Senate continued to block changes in the tax-overhaul bill by defeating a move to keep the sales-tax deduction. Meanwhile, House Speaker O'Neill doubted the IRA tax break will be restored when the bill reaches a House-Senate committee. ---
