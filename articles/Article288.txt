A 64-year-old priest was knocked unconscious in the rectory of an East Harlem church and robbed of $1,500, the receipts of a church bingo game, the police said.  The priest, the Rev. John Soraci of St. Lucy's Roman Catholic Church, was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital with a concussion and injuries to the abdomen after the attack on Saturday night. The hospital reported that he was in stable condition.  Stanley Davis, the sexton of St. Lucy's, at 344 East 104th Street, said Father Soraci had entered the rectory with receipts from the evening's bingo game, an event held every Friday and Saturday at the church. ''They were waiting for him,'' Mr. Davis said.
