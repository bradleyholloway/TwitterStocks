 Sunday Investment Dartboard: Readers' New Choices: From Media and Technology to Retail   By Ransom, Diana, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 2007  Darts thrown by Sunday Journal staffers hit networking company Avocent (AVCT, $33.85) of Huntsville, Ala.; Exco Resources (XCO, $16.91) an oil-and-natural-gas company in Dallas; biopharmaceuticals company Gilead Sciences (GILD, $64.93) of Foster City, Calif.; Herbalife, a nutritional-supplement company (HLF, $40.16) in Los Angeles; Sears Holdings (SHLD, $167.93) in Hoffman Estates, Ill., and the U.S. shares of Japan's Toyota Motor (TM, $134.31).
