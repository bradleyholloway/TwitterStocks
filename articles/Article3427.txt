 Interpublic Recruits a Media Chief   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 2005  Universal McCann had previously been reporting to John J. Dooner Jr., the former Interpublic chairman and chief executive who now heads McCann Worldgroup, Interpublic's largest operation.  "If you look at any of the significant clients that we lost, it was generally on the media side," says Michael I. Roth, Interpublic's chairman and chief executive. "We don't like to lose."  Mr. [Mark Rosenthal], one of the original employees at MTV Networks, Viacom's cable arm, left last July after he was passed over to succeed Tom Freston as chairman and chief executive of the unit when Mr. Freston was named president and co-chief operating officer of the parent company. The job went instead to Judy McGrath. While Mr. Rosenthal could have stayed at the company, he opted to resign. "At the end of the day, I wanted to run something," he says.
