 Pacific Century Emerges as Rival Suitor In Merger With Hong Kong Telecom   By By Thom Beal and Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2000  HONG KONG -- Richard Li's Internet flagship Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd. has proposed a merger with Hong Kong Telecom Ltd., a unit of Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain, the latest twist in the race to dominate Asia's telecom markets and Mr. Li's boldest move yet in his bid to expand his Internet empire throughout the continent.  Cable & Wireless, which owns 54.5% of HKT, said late Friday that its talks with Singtel were continuing. A PCCW executive declined to say whether the bid would rival or complement the proposed SingTel merger.
