 Allianz to Buy Rest of Italian Unit As Part of Streamlining Initiative   By Fleming, Charles, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2005  Michael Diekmann, who took over as Allianz chief executive in May 2003, said in a statement yesterday that the moves would allow Allianz to reduce the complexity of its operations within Europe and allow the group to take better advantage of growth opportunities across borders.  In addition to offering cash to the holders of the 45% stake in RAS it didn't currently own, Allianz said it would convert from a conventional German-registered company to a new form of Europe-wide company known as a "Societas Europaea," or SE. Allianz said it will be the first among the region's largest 50 listed corporations to adopt the new Europe-wide corporate statutes, which were introduced last year.
