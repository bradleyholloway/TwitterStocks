 Bookshelf: The Fall of the Pahlavis   By By Shaul Bakhash, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1985  In this literary, impressionistic history of the fall of the shah of Iran, Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski aims to capture the mood of the final days of the Pahlavi monarchy and the rage that moved millions of Iranians to follow their ayatollahs in making a fundamentalist Islamic revolution.  Mr. Kapuscinski works through sharply etched vignettes, much as he did with an earlier and much praised book about Ethiopia's Haile Selassie. "Shah of Shahs" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 152 pages, $12.95) is a rich mixture of portraits of the shah and ordinary Iranians caught up in the revolution; of historical moments captured, as if by camera, and plumbed for their wider significance; of interviews that mirror individuals' perceptions of the shah's regime. In his commentary on a series of old photographs, Mr. Kapuscinski elaborates on the character of a monarch who grew from a timid child into an autocrat like his father. By contrast, he describes a little boy slaving at odd jobs in Tehran to support his village family as an emblem of the poverty of the shah's Great Civilization.  Underlying the sheer stylistic energy of the book, there is political analysis, a certain view of the nature of regimes and revolutions. Although he dwells at perhaps excessive length on the shortcomings of the shah's rule, Mr. Kapuscinski writes that the Iranian revolution, like revolutions elsewhere, was not primarily a product of poverty and oppression alone, which can exist without causing revolution, but of a fresh awareness, "the consciousness that poverty and oppression are not the natural order of this world."
