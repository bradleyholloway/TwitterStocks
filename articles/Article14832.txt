 Agency Restructuring Eastern Germany Confronts Often Contradictory Goals   By By Timothy Aeppel, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1991  Even before the upheaval caused by this week's murder of Treuhandanstalt chief Detlev Rohwedder, German officials were having second thoughts about how the agency was doing its job of privatizing former East Germany's crumbling industries.  In the wake of Monday's attack, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel vowed the agency wouldn't break its stride in restructuring eastern Germany. Indeed, Mr. Rohwedder's likely successor is Birgit Breuel, a member of the Treuhand board and an insider familiar with the initiatives launched by Mr. Rohwedder, who was assassinated Monday night, apparently by the radical leftist Red Army Faction.  But instead of putting its overwhelming emphasis on selling or closing factories, the Treuhand has begun looking for more ways to salvage struggling eastern concerns -- or at least keep them running until new plants are created to soak up surplus labor. Eastern German state governments are also pressuring Bonn into buttressing key industries.
