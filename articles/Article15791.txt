 Duke Energy Scrambles to Get Proxies In Its Bid for Control of Chilean Utility   By By Kathryn Kranhold, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1999  Duke, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., made a $2.1 billion bid in February for a 51% controlling stake in Latin America's second-biggest generating company, Endesa Chile. The proposed transaction is key to Duke's strategy to become a major player in the energy market throughout South America and would be the biggest since Duke acquired Pan Energy for $7.7 billion in 1997.  But before Duke's bid is considered, the company has to convince Endesa shareholders to vote to amend a decade-old bylaw that increases the amount of shares an investor can hold to 65% from 26%.  There are eight billion Endesa Chile shares outstanding in Chile, the U.S. and elsewhere, and Duke needs 75% of those votes. By comparison, Duke has about 363 million shares outstanding, mostly institutions in major U.S. cities. And in the U.S., companies usually need only a majority or two-thirds vote to approve a proposal.
