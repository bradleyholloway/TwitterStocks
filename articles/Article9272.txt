 Home Depot's New CEO Vows to Keep Company's Entrepreneurial Style Alive   By By Chad Terhune, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2000  Some analysts and company observers say the new CEO, Robert L. Nardelli, runs the risk of alienating some managers and front-line employees who have grown accustomed to Home Depot's decentralized approach in its 1,087 do-it-yourself stores. But many analysts believe Mr. Nardelli's experience at wringing efficiencies from internal operations and centralizing decision-making could boost company profits as new-store growth approaches its limits.  Mr. Nardelli, 52 years old, was a runner-up in the race to succeed GE Chairman and CEO John F. Welch Jr. Mr. Nardelli spent 26 years at GE, the last five as president and CEO of GE Power Systems, a maker of power generators and related equipment. He succeeds Arthur Blank, who joins co-founder Bernard Marcus as Home Depot's co-chairman.  Mr. Nardelli noted he had experience with GE's lighting and appliance products, sold in Home Depot stores. And he said he wouldn't hesitate to draw on the experience of his predecessors, Messrs. Marcus and Blank. "Those two are icons in the retailing business," Mr. Nardelli said.
