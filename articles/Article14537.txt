 No One Ever Called Sen. Burdick, 80, A Retiring Fellow --- Age of the North Dakotan Is Both a Plus and a Minus In His Re-Election Bid   By By Dennis Farney, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1988  The Democratic lawmaker learned that countermove in a Jhoon Rhee martial-arts school when he was a mere 65 or so. Later he appeared on the cover of Parade magazine wearing karate pajamas. The move is a way of breaking an opponent's grip. And that is exactly what Sen. Burdick seems close to doing in his curious Senate re-election race: breaking the grip of time.  Now the gym is North Dakota and the opponent is Republican Earl Strinden. Abrasive but effective, Mr. Strinden is a fighter to be reckoned with. Kent Conrad, North Dakota's other Democratic senator in Washington, calls him "Ayatollah Earl." State colleagues have at times referred to him as "Earl Strident."  Strinden aides produce a letter to the editor of the Fargo Forum from a visitor back from Washington. It describes Sen. Burdick as "fast asleep" amid Senate debate. Campaigning for Mr. Strinden, Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson portrays a lethargic Mr. Burdick whose actions as Environment Committee chairman are carefully scripted, who hews to prepared statements typed in half-inch-high letters and who takes directions from a committee aide whispering in his ear.
