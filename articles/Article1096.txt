 Winners, Losers in Post-Midterm Market   By Ip, Greg, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2006  Still, Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist for London-based Capital Economics, says the shift in control won't make a big difference. "It might prevent the president from negotiating more bilateral trade deals with smaller trading partners. But those deals wouldn't have done much to boost overall U.S. trade anyway." And there was little prospect of a larger global trade deal.  "The company is likely to get the kind of treatment the tobacco companies received at the hands of Democratic committee chairmen in the early 1990s," predicts Andy Laperriere, policy analyst at ISI Group. This could "cost Wal-Mart customers and scare off investors."  Retailers are also anxious about Democrats' promise to raise the federal minimum wage, now $5.15. But the impact on their bottom line might be muted, predicts Charles Grom, retailing analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase. States with 70% of the U.S. population already have higher minimum wages, and "most large retailers pay starting wages in the range of $7.50-$9.00 per hour and would not face sharply higher labor costs." For those that do pay lower starting wages, their customers are also often low-paid and would benefit from a higher minimum wage, he says.
