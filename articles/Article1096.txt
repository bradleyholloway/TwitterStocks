 On Sports: Read Their Lips: Dodgers Dun It   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1988  Los Angeles -- In his edifying presidential campaign, George Bush, the candidate of the Republican team, has on occasion invited us to read his lips when he wanted to emphasize a point. Always eager to oblige, I turned off the sound on my TV set and attempted the feat. I found that Bush is easier to understand with the sound on, but the silence was soothing nonetheless.  The subject of lip reading arose again during the National League baseball playoff series between the amazin' and ultimately victorious Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets. At a press conference following his team's pivotal 5-4 win in Game 4 Sunday night in New York, Dodger manager Tom Lasorda was asked what he said when he came to the mound to address his pitcher, Jesse Orosco, after Orosco had walked a batter in the 12th (and final) inning.  Tommy, indeed, did not say "heck," but a naughtier "h" word. He said other naughty words that one needn't have been a skilled lip reader to have deciphered. So, too, at various times, did players he manages. So did lads managed by Davey Johnson, skipper of the Mets. So did Johnson. So did the Oakland A's, winners of the American League gonfalon, and their Boston Red Sox foes. The baseball bunch also expectorated great, gooey globs of tobacco juice and other substances, and scratched where they itched.
