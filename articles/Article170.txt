Despite its name, the New York City Housing Authority Symphony Orchestra is not composed of superintendents and housing inspectors who enforce various chapters of the city's building code while playing musical instruments. But the Housing Authority has been the main regulator of the orchestra, whose players are ''rooted in the public housing community'' and give free concerts around the city.  Judging from the benefit concert at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon, the orchestra has a firm musical foundation.  In fact, under the direction of Tali Makell, who was making his New York conducting debut, the orchestra had a nearly professional polish. Mr. Makell, who has studied at the Peabody Conservatory and Oberlin College, executed a graceful and spirited Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony, faithful to the rhythmic verve and melodic charm of the score's blueprint.  The soprano Janice Hutson also made an impressive debut, in arias by Debussy and Boito, and in Mozart's ''Laudate Dominum,'' aided by the Housing Authority Chorus. Her intonation was sometimes overwhelmed by vibrato, but her clear, dark-timbred voice was sensitive to the varied repertory. And Alvin McCall's cello playing as soloist in Faure's ''Elegie'' (Op. 24), was suffused with Gallic refinement. The concert, then, created a tasteful and comfortable musical domicile.
