 Just Like Film Stars, Wall Streeters Battle To Get Top Billing --- Changed Advertising Format Riles Some Underwriters; 'Haves' and 'Have-Nots'   By By Ann Monroe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1986  In the heat of the latest bracket battle, underwriters have threatened each other, complained to corporate securities issuers and even pulled out of deals. And the struggle has cast some firms in odd roles. Kidder, Peabody & Co., a respected retail broker but not by anybody's standards a Wall Street powerhouse, turned on its former peers and tried -- some would say presumed -- to join the big guys. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley & Co., once the most powerful and arrogant underwriter on the Street, is currently playing defender of the oppressed.  In more civilized times, bracketing followed a strict pattern. The top spot, right under the co-managers' names, was called the major bracket. Then came the mezzanine bracket, followed by the sub-major bracket and the regional brackets for the small fry. The higher the bracket, the bigger the underwriter's role in the offering. The managing underwriter decided who was listed where, but surprises were few. Everybody knew his place.  All that started to come unglued in the early 1970s. In the "Battle of the Bulge," a handful of major firms set themselves up as a special, or "bulge," bracket above the major bracket on debt offerings. The bulge firms are -- in alphabetical order -- First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers Inc., and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
