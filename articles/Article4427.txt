 Rogers Agrees to Sell U.S. Cable Systems --- Houston Industries Unit Will Pay $1.27 Billion, Expensive for Such Deals   By This article was prepared by Gary Lamphier in Toronto, Laura Landro in New York And Dianna Solis in Houston, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1988  Rogers Communications Inc. said it agreed to sell its U.S. cable-television systems to a unit of Houston-based Houston Industries Inc. for about $1.27 billion.  The planned sale to Houston Industries' KBL Cable Inc. unit follows an auction begun several months ago by Rogers and its financial adviser, Morgan Stanley & Co.  The purchase of the Rogers systems increases Houston Industries' clout in the cable industry, while giving it additional cable subscribers in Texas. Houston Industries currently has significant cable-TV interests through 50%-owned Paragon Communications, which serves more than 670,000 subscribers in several states, including California and Texas.
