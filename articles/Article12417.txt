 Decline in Workers' Compensation Rates Leaves Insurers With Billion-Dollar Tab   By By Deborah Lohse, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1999  A sharp decline in workers' compensation rates is roiling the insurance industry, which now faces at least $1 billion of losses from the coverage, analysts and industry executives said.  The charge is related to coverage that was arranged through Unicover Managers Inc., a unit of Delphi Financial Group Inc., Wilmington, Del. Unicover acts as a middleman between primary insurers that sell workers' compensation coverage to the nation's employers, and reinsurers that take on some of the risk from actual workers' injuries and other claims in exchange for a slice of the premiums.  Rates have fallen so far over the past few years that the pools of workers' compensation coverage organized by Unicover, involving many insurers and reinsurers, contain possibly large amounts of unprofitable business, analysts said. Some analysts estimated that the business written through the pools will generate losses and expenses that are as much as $1.25 billion to $2.5 billion greater than the premiums collected in recent years. It isn't immediately clear which insurers and reinsurers beyond the Berkshire Hathaway unit will be affected.
