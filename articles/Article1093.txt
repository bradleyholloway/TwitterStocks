 Rising Son: For Chinese Tycoon, Solar Power Fuels Overnight Wealth; Shi Zhengrong Studied Abroad, Then Founded Suntech In Partnership With State; Debuting at No. 1 on Rich List   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2006  In April 2000, Dr. [Shi Zhengrong] went to China to see for himself. He came back to Australia afire with ideas for a China-based solar-power company, and sat down and put together a 200-page business plan. It was the first thing he had written in Chinese for years. "That conversation was at the right time," Dr. Shi says. "If that conversation had occurred two years or three years earlier, I don't think it would have happened."  By 2004, Suntech's government owners had also taken note of Suntech's improving fortunes, and wanted a more active role in the company. That put chairman Li Yanren, the government's representative, into conflict with Dr. Shi. The internal strife consumed several months, but eventually the board threw its backing to Dr. Shi, making him chairman as well as chief executive. Mr. Li, who received a compensation package upon leaving, declined to comment.  Dr. Shi argued that getting the state shareholders out of the company would allow Suntech to grow faster, hire more people and pay more taxes. That swayed city government officials, who helped Dr. Shi work on convincing the corporate shareholders. Here, Dr. Shi's willingness to offer generous terms helped. Mr. Zhang says his old fund made a return of 20 times its initial investment.
