 Meeting of G-7 Is Unlikely to Act To Bolster Dollar   By By Tim Carrington, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1990  When deputies from the Group of Seven gathered in Paris this week, they reportedly expressed little dismay about the falling U.S. dollar.  Economists predict that the mood of acceptance will extend to the official G-7 meeting in Washington a week from tomorrow. Specifically, forecasters expect financial leaders to stand by rather than intervene in the currency markets, even though the U.S. currency recently slumped to 1.53 German marks, a postwar low. "We're not looking for the G-7 to do anything at this stage," said Julian Callow, international economist with Chase Investment Bank Ltd.  Mr. Callow and other Chase economists take the position that the G-7, officially the world's most powerful economic club, is in "demise," with each of the big economies going its own way for a time. The Chase team also predicts that the dollar will test new lows of 1.50 marks and 125 yen in the next three to six months.
