 Moving the Market: Germany's Biggest Banks to Cut Jobs   By Taylor, Edward, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2004  At the same time, U.S. and other European banks such as Citigroup Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC have become more active in Germany, looking to do more business with large multinational companies there while Germany's traditional lenders try to shore up their own finances.  HVB Group, Germany's second-largest bank by sales, said the scale of the job cuts wouldn't be clear until the strategic review is complete, but will likely focus on Germany. HVB, which hasn't paid a dividend for the past two years, abandoned its full-year target of an operating profit of at least 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) earlier this month.  Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has made cost savings of around 6.5 billion euros and slashed its staff to 65,000 from about 90,000 employees in 2001. The bank sees additional savings potential by combining the back-office operations of its debt and equity departments.
