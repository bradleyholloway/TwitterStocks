 Spotlight Shifts to Human Rights, Straining Saudi Ties With West   By By James M. Dorsey, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  Riyadh has been on the march in the U.S. and Europe to demonstrate that Saudi Arabia is not a stronghold of Muslim extremists that breeds terrorists and scoffs at human rights. In one of several such efforts, Saudi delegations -- for the first time including women -- fanned out across the U.S. this month to renew ties from the 1970s and '80s, when senior Saudi officials and businessmen attended American universities to salvage relations between the two nations.  Despite the tough talk out of Riyadh, however, the government is beginning to signal a certain resignation to the change in emphasis in Western quarters. The Saudis have invited international human-rights group Amnesty International to visit Saudi prisons. Saudi officials say the government will soon authorize the establishment of two human-rights groups in the kingdom, one under Riyadh and one nongovernmental. Saudi Arabia also recently enacted laws to ensure due process and guarantee defendants the right to legal counsel.
