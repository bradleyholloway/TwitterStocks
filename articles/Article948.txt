 Kongsberg Directors Are Seen Approving Sale of Two Units   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1987  The board of Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS, Norway's troubled state-owned arms maker, is expected to approve measures today that will all but shut the company down and enable it to begin repaying creditors.  However, sources familiar with the company's finances said they expect the final payout to Kongsberg's creditors to reach only around 40% of the 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($407.7 million) the concern owes. That would be significantly less than the 70% recovery that Kongsberg's bankers earlier had said they expected, and suggests that the company's financial position is considerably weaker than previous assessments have indicated. Last year, the company lost 718 million kroner on operating revenue of 2.15 billion kroner.
