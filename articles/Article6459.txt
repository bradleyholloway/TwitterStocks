 Regulators Lift Moratorium on Railroad Mergers   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2001  Federal regulators lifted a 15-month moratorium on railroad mergers while handing down new, tougher railroad merger rules intended to prevent a repeat of the widespread service breakdowns and shipping delays that followed past rail mergers.  The new rules come after a wave of big rail mergers in the past six years that have left six large railroads in North America, two in the Western U.S., two in the Eastern U.S. and two in Canada. Some of the mergers caused major shipping disruptions, railroad congestion and customer delays as well as fears that consolidation will diminish rail competition.  The moratorium on rail mergers, which was imposed in March 2000, was occasioned by a proposal to combine Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and Canadian National Railway Co. to create North America's largest rail system. The Surface Transportation Board said its existing merger rules weren't adequate to address the issues that would come up in what could be the final round of consolidation in the rail industry and result in two transcontinental rail systems. Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Fort Worth, Texas, and Canadian National, Montreal, later called off their merger plans.
