 Love & Money: 10%? 15%? 20%? We Are What We Tip   By Opdyke, Jeff D, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2005  Tipping, of course, isn't just about restaurants. It's about how much -- and whether -- to tip the doorman, the maitre d', the kid who bags your groceries and schleps them to your car. But it's easiest to talk about restaurants, because that's where the disagreements play out most frequently.  "Nobody docks my pay if I'm particularly grumpy at work or if I make a mistake," she says. "I just find it a little unseemly to lower a person's pay by $5 because they didn't bring me my meal fast enough. I'd rather focus on the good service, and reward it with 20% or more, than short-change some poor waitress who has been on her feet for eight hours anyway and was moving kind of slow."  A small argument, but it often leaves both of them hurt. To his wife, his tip is proof he doesn't want to spend money. To him, his wife's position is a sign that she doesn't understand money. So she leaves feeling like a spendthrift and he leaves feeling cheap -- and they're both mad about the way the other makes them feel.
