 MarketWatch: Don't Waste Your Money Rebalancing   By Farrell, Paul B, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2005  Recently, Vanguard's consulting and research group did a similar study using market data from 1960 to 2003. It said if you don't add any new money, market swings alone will knock your portfolio way out of whack. The gist of the Vanguard & Schwab studies is that rebalancing makes sense on an annual basis, but you don't have to do it monthly or quarterly as many commissioned brokers suggest.  Should you worry about increased risk? Not if you have a portfolio that already minimizes it. That's what Bill Schultheis, a former Smith Barney insider turned independent adviser, does with his Coffeehouse Portfolio. It's so simple, boring and effective that commissioned brokers hate it. Just seven funds: 40% in a total bond index fund, and 10% each in six diversified stock funds. Ten-year average annual returns are near the market's and in the 2000-2002 bear maul, this mix beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by roughly 15 percentage points each year, with no rebalancing.
