 Not the Best of Days for AC&R: First Chereskin, and Then Lauder   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 1994  For years, Madison Avenue has speculated how long AC&R Advertising would be able to hold onto the $75 million Estee Lauder account once the agency's chairman, Alvin Chereskin, announces his retirement plans.  Yesterday, the floundering agency found out with dizzying speed. Minutes after AC&R announced that 66-year-old Mr. Chereskin would retire at the end of the year, Estee Lauder put its desirable account up for review. If AC&R loses the account in a creative shoot-out, half its billings would instantly vanish.  Thus a creative skirmish could ensue over the Lauder account among many major U.S. agencies eligible because of lack of conflicts. Certainly, Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco will try, after having won in February an assignment to create a TV campaign for Estee Lauder's Clinique. And another Saatchi & Saatchi unit, Backer Spielvogel Bates, will attempt to keep the account within the so-called family. Backer Spielvogel's world-wide chairman, Michael Bungey, has made no secret of that fact that he is on an aggressive prowl for new business.
