 On-Line: The Two Grown-Ups Behind Yahoo!'s Surge   By By Kara Swisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1998  They are, respectively, Timothy Koogle, Yahoo's chief executive, and Jeffrey Mallett, its chief operating officer. Since they arrived in 1995, the duo has engineered a relentlessly hip campaign to make Yahoo the most famous brand in cyberspace, while cutting several crucial deals that allow it to offer users specialized content, free electronic mail, community offerings and commerce.  Under Messrs. Koogle and Mallett, Yahoo has transformed itself from a simple directory into a major Internet hub. In fact, it is now the Internet's most trafficked site -- a gateway to the entire Web from which it does what few other pure Internet companies have managed to do -- make money. Yahoo does it by charging fees to advertisers avid to reach the hordes of consumers who start their Web sessions by clicking on Yahoo's page, and taking a piece of the commercial transactions conducted through the site.  Last year, Yahoo's stock price soared 507%, making it the fourth-best performing stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yesterday, Yahoo shares surged another $17.25 a share, or 18%, to close at $114.50, an all-time high. The frenzied trading, which helped lift the entire stock market on a roaring day, followed Yahoo's announcement Wednesday that earnings were twice as high as analysts' consensus estimates. . At that share price, Yahoo has a stunning market value of $6.09 billion, compared with a valuation of $334 million when it went public two years ago.
