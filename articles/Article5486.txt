 Tokyo Prices Finish Mixed While Nikkei Sags; London Stocks Firm After Late-Session Rebound ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1993  Share prices ended mixed Tuesday in Tokyo after a tug of war between profit-taking and fresh buying, and the market's main index fell. In London, stocks firmed in the last hour of trading.  In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which rallied 243.35 points Monday, dropped 114.34 to 20940.37.  The Nikkei, which jumped at the opening on strength in the futures market, ended near its trading low of 20932.34, losing footing from above 21000 in the last 15 minutes of activity. After recent hefty gains for the market, buying Tuesday focused on issues with small and medium capitalizations, especially high-technology exporters, given the weakening of the yen in foreign-exchange markets, and on shares that benefit from Japanese domestic demand, such as department stores. Buyers included overseas investors and Japanese financial institutions.
