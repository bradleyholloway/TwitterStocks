 Treasury Debt Sale Is Likely to Increase Pressure on Rates, Many Analysts Say   By By Tom Herman and Edward P. Foldessy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1985  The government's borrowing needs probably will continue to weigh heavily on the credit markets at least through next year despite last week's congressional compromise on the budget, according to numerous bankers and analysts. They fear that the compromise won't produce the amount of savings the package envisions and that the government's estimates are based on overly optimistic economic forecasts.  Investors will get a fresh reminder of the government's deficit problems this week when the Treasury undertakes a record $21.75 billion financing. The package includes $8.5 billion of new three-year Treasury notes to be sold tomorrow, $6.75 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $6.5 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday. That will be in addition to the Treasury's regular weekly auction today of $14.4 billion of short-term bills.  Moreover, many analysts predict the economy will pick up steam in coming months, generating increased borrowing by businesses and individuals on top of the government's financing needs. "The pressure is for higher interest rates," said Alan Greenspan, president of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., an economic consulting firm.
