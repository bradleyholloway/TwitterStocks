 Leadership (A Special Report); A Radical Prescription: While most companies look to slash health costs by shifting more expenses to employees, Pitney Bowes took a different tack; The results were suprising   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2004  "My guess is a lot of employers have been so concerned about the increases they've been seeing, they've been willing to try anything," says Haiden Huskamp, assistant professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School in Boston. "It's only now we're starting to see some research on what the effects have been."  Dr. [John Mahoney] says he's doesn't think the company's prescription-drug co-pay system has discouraged other patients from taking necessary medications. Nor does the company have plans to lower co-pays of drugs for other diseases or conditions. A big reason, he adds, is that the predictive modeling analysis didn't suggest that doing the same with other drugs would have such an impact. Diabetes and asthma may be different since people's conditions can change so rapidly, depending on how regularly they take their medication.  "The basic three-tier co-pay structure is a kind of blunt instrument," says Geoffrey Joyce, a Rand health economist who led the group's study on co-pays and prescription-drug spending. "You have a lot of employers out there scratching their heads, asking 'How do we do this a little more intelligently?'"
