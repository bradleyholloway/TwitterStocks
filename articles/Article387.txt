Researchers say that the discovery of a stranded adult female pilot whale in a Rhode Island cove Dec. 10 may help them save the lives of other whales found in similar predicaments.  Volunteers tried for more than four hours to rescue the 13-foot whale when it lost direction and entered Greenwich Cove in Warwick, 15 miles up Narragansett Bay. But the attempts failed, and the animal died of blood poisoning, according to veterinarians at the Mystic (Conn.) Aquarium who performed an autopsy.  The same week, an unweaned baby pilot whale , which had beached itself off Nantucket Island, Mass., died as i t was being treated in aspecial pool at the aquarium. Researchers say that milk from the adult whale might have saved the baby's life.  ''We were able to take milk from her, and it's now being analyzed at the University of Connecticut,'' said Julie Quinn, a spokesman for Mystic Aquarium. ''We're going to be able to do a lot more with formulas with other babies now that we have some actual pilot whale milk.''  Miss Quinn said that baby whale was fed a formula consisting of heavy cream, enzymes, milk and vitamins devised by a nutritionist at the University of Connecticut.  ''It was nourishing - she didn't die because the formula wasn't good enough,'' Miss Quinn said. ''But, it wasn't being digested the way we would have liked to have seen it digested.''  Upon examination of the adult pilot whale milk, the researchers found that it was of far more value than they had imagined, according to Miss Quinn.  The autopsy and subsequent work on the body of the whale found off Warwick was performed by Dr. J. Lawrence Dunn, a veterinarian from Charlestown, R.I., who is on the aquarium's staff.  Dr. Dunn was one of those who spent several hours in the water trying to save the female's life when she was stuck in Greenwich Cove. He said that researchers still did not know why the whale got stranded.
