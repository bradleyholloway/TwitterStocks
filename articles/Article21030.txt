 Guinness Probe Is Said to Include U.S. Investors --- Share Price Manipulation, Sources Say, Is Likely Focus of Investigation   By By Gary Putka and Peter Truell, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1986  The investigation by Britain's Department of Trade and Industry stems from Guinness's $3.6 billion takeover of Distillers Co. earlier this year. The British brewer won control of Distillers after a bitter battle with Argyll Group PLC, a British supermarket chain.  In a debate on Britain's widening insider-trading investigations, the Parliament member, Robin Cook, alleged that Mr. Boesky used selective selling in the London market to depress Argyll's share price at a crucial stage in the two companies' competition for Distillers. At the same time, Mr. Cook said, an ally of Guinness in the U.S. bought a large number of Guinness shares, increasing their price. A sharp increase in Guinness's share price last April helped the company prevail over Argyll because both bids were priced in a fixed number of the rivals' shares.  During the takeover fight, Argyll had alleged that Guinness's share price was being manipulated to boost its value and, thus, its offer for Distillers, a Scottish maker of spirits. Argyll had named the Schenley Industries unit of Rapid-American Corp. as one of the U.S. investors whose buying drove up Guinness's share price. Guinness has identified Schenley as a major shareholder, but yesterday declined to comment on Argyll's allegations that it acted in concert with Guinness.
