 Hitting the Breaks: Detroit's Challenge: Weaning Buyers From Years of Deals; Big Incentives Boosted Sales, But They Cut Profits; Betting on New Models; Mr. Sarrat's $3,000 Rebate   By Karen Lundegaard and Sholnn Freeman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2004  That's why, for many customers, cash rebates are the only way to get into a new car. Darrin Chrisman, general manager of Bradenton, Fla.'s AutoWay Ford, part of AutoNation Inc., the country's largest dealership chain, says at his dealership rebates are now almost always used to pay off debt on a previous car. He doesn't think the Big Three will be able to pull back on incentives.  Mike Jackson, AutoNation's chief executive, says the average age of vehicles was 4.5 years just a few years ago, meaning that some had gone eight years or more without a redesign. "You can't sell it. It's just too old," he says. Within two years though, that figure will be cut to 2.2 years. In five years, he says, the industry will have gone from 900 models with an average life cycle of eight years to 1,500 models with an average life cycle of four years. "That's a revolution."  Kyle Avery is shopping for a Ford Taurus. He isn't crazy about the aging midsize car, which Ford is starting to phase out. But it comes with a $3,000 cash rebate. The vehicle he really wants, a Honda Accord, has a 2.9% low-interest loan, but the 25-year-old Salt Lake City resident says the Taurus deal "is almost too good to pass up." How will he decide which car to buy? "It's going to come down to what's got the best incentive," he says.
