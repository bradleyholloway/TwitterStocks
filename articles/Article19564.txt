 Delicate Transition: As China Prepares to Change Leaders, Ferment Is Growing --- Some Suggest Jiang May Keep Party Post as Nation Faces Host of Critical Challenges --- Issues of Experience, Authority   By By Susan V. Lawrence and Charles Hutzler, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2002  For Mr. [Jiang Zemin] to continue to hang onto the party job would guarantee continuity in the U.S.-China relationship. Mr. Jiang has prided himself on keeping relations with Washington on an even keel, even amid such incidents as 1999's accidental bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade by NATO planes acting on information provided by the CIA, and last year's collision above the South China Sea between a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet.  Though Mr. Jiang is widely considered a pro-American centrist, U.S. officials aren't keen to be seen as backing any attempt to keep him in power. For one thing, even though Mr. [Hu]'s views on U.S.-China ties are largely unknown, U.S. officials don't expect China's U.S. policy to change if Mr. Jiang retires as president and party chief. In any case, they figure that over the long term, U.S. interests are best served by a China run by laws and institutions, not by outsize personalities.  The possibility of Mr. Jiang's staying on as party leader has triggered a spate of unusual public and semipublic sniping at Mr. Jiang from disparate parts of the political spectrum. Coming under fire is everything from his apparent reluctance to retire, to his recruitment of capitalists into the party, to rising social inequality during his tenure, to his record on political reform. These isolated attacks may be just a small taste of what is to come for Mr. Jiang, from foreign critics as well as domestic ones, if he does indeed refuse to give up power in November.
