 World-Wide [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1995  The president sought to outflank the Republican leadership on veterans' issues by singling out proposed spending cuts for military veterans as "unwise and unnecessary." He vowed to "go to the mat" to protect health benefits for veterans, and he named a panel to study Gulf War-related illnesses. Separately, the administration criticized a GOP proposal to overhaul the legal system by limiting monetary awards to injured people and establishing a uniform set of laws on product liability.  House Republicans want to add another business tax break to the mix of costly tax cuts promised in their "Contract With America." But they haven't yet agreed on the spending cuts to pay for the package, which is being put together by some members of the Ways and Means Committee.  Top Russian leaders declared that organized crime had become so serious it was threatening state security. President Yeltsin and his Security Council issued a statement saying no progress had been made in the fight against crime. The renewed concern about crime comes after the gangster-style slaying of a TV journalist last week.
