 Leading the News: Unions Weigh Options at American --- Flight Attendants Plan New Vote on Concessions Despite Bonus Cancellation   By By Scott McCartney, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2003  On Friday, Mr. [Donald J. Carty], who also is American's chairman, said the company was canceling retention bonuses that would have paid him and six other executives as much as twice their base salaries if they stayed until January 2005. But Mr. Carty said creation of a trust that protects supplemental pension benefits for 45 executives in the event of a bankruptcy will remain.  Some workers are calling for both overturning contract concessions and pressing for Mr. Carty's resignation. Even Mr. Carty's former boss, Robert L. Crandall, has publicly said he would return to American, a move that union leaders who used to vilify Mr. Crandall are now, in some circles at least, embracing.  American said it believed retention bonuses were necessary because the severe industry downturn after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks prompted several key executives to retire or leave for other companies. Other carriers, including Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines, have offered similar retention pay plans. American also contends the trust funding for the supplemental pension plan was necessary to retain executives.
