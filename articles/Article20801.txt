 Italy Plans Ban in '91 On Non-Degradable Plastic Shopping Bags --- Range of Products Included, And Impact of Decision On U.S. Makers Unclear   By By Barry Meier, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1985  Italy plans to ban non-degradable plastic shopping bags, although it isn't clear how broad the ban will be or how it will affect U.S. producers.  The Italian Industry Ministry said that starting in 1991 the use of non-degradable plastic shopping bags in supermarkets and other stores will be banned. Packaging materials and bags produced from materials that aren't degradable or can't be recycled also will be banned, the ministry said.  Eight states in the U.S. have bans against the use of non-degradable plastic connectors for beer and soft drink containers, according to the Society of the Plastics Industry Inc., a New York-based trade group. And South Dakota has barred the sale of non-degradable or non-recyclable containers, a trade group spokesman said.
