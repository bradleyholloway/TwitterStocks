 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2007  AXA SA said it is selling its Dutch insurance operations to Netherlands-based bank and insurer SNS Reaal NV for 1.75 billion euros ($2.35 billion) because its growth was limited by tight competition in the Dutch insurance market, which is dominated by large local players. The French company also said an established Dutch business stood more chance of maximizing the business's value. The Dutch company said it expects the deal to generate 50 million euros in annual pretax savings by 2011, when the integration should be complete.
