 Quarterly Mutual Funds Review; Hunting for Returns   By Pollock, Michael A, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  People who own stocks, real estate, private equity or other "highflying stuff" may be better off using munis as the anchor of a portfolio, not to increase returns, says Timothy McGregor, who manages muni funds at Northern Trust Global Investments, of Chicago. "Most clients I talk to aren't looking to take risk in municipal securities."  Still, anyone who wants to buy high-yield munis would be much better off in a fund rather than buying individual bonds, says Ronald Fielding, who manages OppenheimerFunds Inc.'s Rochester National Muni fund, a category-leading high-yield muni offering. With the possibility of losses from some junk bonds, "the need for broad diversification is much greater," he says. The Rochester fund holds more than 900 individual bonds.  "Higher-yielding securities have had a pretty strong run," says Richard Taormina, who helps to manage muni funds at the J.P. Morgan Funds unit of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Whether that run continues will depend in part on how much the economy slows, he adds. A sharp contraction could crimp the revenues backing high-yield munis, causing such issues to lose value.
