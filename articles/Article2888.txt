 World Wire [13]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1996  UniChem PLC of Britain, a pharmaceutical retailer, said it renewed its #657.6 million ($1.04 billion) takeover bid for Lloyds Chemists PLC, a drug wholesaling and pharmacy concern. UniChem and Gehe AG of Germany, a big drug wholesaler 50.3%-owned by Franz Haniel & Cie, both were forced to let bids for Lloyds lapse after Britain cited antitrust factors. But the government on Friday dropped that bar if a deal included shedding some lines. Gehe said it hadn't decided whether to renew its #649.9 million bid for Lloyds.  Daiwa Securities Co. of Japan, responding to a report by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial daily that the big brokerage firm will provide 100 billion yen ($891.2 million) to rescue Daiwa Finance Co., said it was still considering how to deal with its affiliate's bad-loan problem. Daiwa Securities did say that the nonbank affiliate has 100 billion yen in bad debts. It had said in May that it soon would consider giving help, including financial support, to Daiwa Finance.  Japan and the European Union increased their 1996 target for Japanese auto exports to the trade bloc to 1,079,000 vehicles from 1,066,000 set in March. They also boosted their forecast of EU auto demand to 13.55 million vehicles from 13.29 mil lion. The target is part of a Japan-EU system to monitor the auto trade. Japanese shipments haven't met targets. But European auto makers, saying demand was overstated, criticized the target increase as coddling the Japanese.
