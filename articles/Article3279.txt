 Union Pacific Corp. Swings to a Profit On Gains in Freight Traffic, Efficiency   By By Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 2000  Excluding the unusual item, Union Pacific earnings in the year-earlier period were $96 million, or 39 cents a diluted share. The latest fourth-quarter net income of 95 cents a diluted share exceeded a First Call/Thomson Financial analysts' consensus estimate by seven cents. Analysts said Union Pacific benefited from a lower tax rate as state tax credits became available as the company made more profit.  Union Pacific officials said revenue rose in all six of the company's major commodity groups, led by gains in "intermodal" (freight carried in containers or highway trailers on rail cars) and industrial products. The company said it has restored service levels after its extensive freight congestion and bottlenecks in 1997 and 1998. The problems began after Union Pacific acquired Southern Pacific Rail Corp. and led to many freight tie-ups, additional expenses to customers and losses for Union Pacific.
