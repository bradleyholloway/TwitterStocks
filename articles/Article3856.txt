 Why Pay Retail for Retailing Stocks?   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2004  Nonetheless, on Friday, Goldman Sachs analyst George Strachan reiterated his "underperform" rating on the stock, while reducing his earnings estimates for Dillard's fourth quarter and for the full-year 2004, in part due to "poor operating momentum" at the company.  "The quarter was a typical one for Dillard's, with sales declining 3.7%," he says. "Having said this, we have recognized for some years that an eventual sale of the company could result in a windfall stock gain."  Goldman Sachs is more upbeat on Dick's Sporting Goods as the holidays roll around and parents start looking for presents for kids, not to mention themselves. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler says the company has an "open-ended expansion opportunity" and rates the stock "outperform."
