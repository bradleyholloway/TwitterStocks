 Families: A Couple With Online Connections   By By Kara Swisher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 1999  "It's hard to imagine a pair of people in Silicon Valley who are more connected," says Quincy Smith, director of investor relations at Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet software company that is about to be merged into AOL. Mr. Siminoff periodically invests in and advises Netscape, sometimes about ways it might compete with his wife's company. "They rule," Mr. Smith says of the couple.  If the Siminoffs are far less glamorous than most other industries' power couples, they also are probably much richer. Most of their wealth is in stock investments of various kinds. The Siminoffs decline to discuss their wealth and exactly how much of it there is, but many of Ms. Siminoff's Yahoo peers hold stock and options valued at more than $100 million. Mr. Siminoff has been richly rewarded for his ability to pick hot Internet stocks. He can't trade personally in the stocks he recommends for his employer, but he can invest in Capital Group funds -- a way to "eat your own cooking," he says.  Having each made fortunes astonishingly early in life, the Siminoffs take pride in relatively modest tastes and inconspicuous consumption. Mr. Siminoff has a nice set of golf clubs. Both drive the least-expensive models of luxury cars -- a Lexus for her, a Mercedes for him. They recently moved out of a "bungalow" in Menlo Park and into a French Normandy-style home in Los Altos, where they are closer to his parents' home. "It's decent finally, but not incredible," Mr. Siminoff says.
