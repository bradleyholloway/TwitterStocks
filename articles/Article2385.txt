 Kimco Poised to Announce Pact to Buy Price REIT for $535 Million in Stock   By By David D. Kirkpatrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  Price REIT, of La Jolla, Calif., was spun off from discount retail giant Price Co. in 1991. It is headed by Joseph Kornwasser, a developer who built shopping centers for Price Co. in partnership with its founder, Sol Price. Warehouse retailer Costco Cos. subsequently acquired Price Co. and remains the REIT's second-largest tenant, after Home Depot Inc. Many of Price REIT's properties are such free-standing, large-format stores that could be hard to re-lease if retail trends change, says J.P. Morgan analyst Lee Schalop.
