 Westinghouse Electric Plans Dismissals, Big Budget Cuts at Nuclear-Power Unit   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1986  Westinghouse Electric Corp., in the wake of a world-wide construction slowdown and the Chernobyl disaster, plans "drastic budget cuts" and a reduction in the work force of its nuclear power business in 1987, according to an internal company memo.  J.S. "Jim" Moore, vice president and general manager of Westinghouse's power-systems unit, told employees in a memo last month: "Every member of my staff has implemented drastic budget cuts for 1987. . . . Unfortunately, even with these actions, we're still a long way from where we need to be to remain a profitable business in the years ahead."  In the memo, Mr. Moore said the company had not yet set a target number for the dismissals, but that it expected to announce by early 1987 the number of employees that will be affected. The unit has a total work force of about 12,000 employees.
