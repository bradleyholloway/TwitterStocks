 On Sports: It's a Game of Inches   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 1988  Upon reflection, though, I concluded that the questions were better than any conceivable answers, so I let the matter drop. And after Wednesday night's match here, won by the Los Angeles Dodgers, 4-3, to put the A's in a possibly (probably) unfixable fix, I decided that some dark intelligence had planted the thing to presage the A's plight.  There, in the first inning, was A's catcher Terry Steinbach, sprawled after a Dave Stewart pitch as Steve Sax scampered home with the Dodgers' first run. There, in the same frame, was A's second baseman Glenn Hubbard booting Mike Davis's drive to set up Dodger run two. And there, in inning seven, was a Sax grounder just skidding past poor Hubbard into center field as Alfredo Griffin raced to third with what would be the run that put L.A. up, three games to one, in the best-of-seven go. Pinch me if it ain't a game of inches.  Certainly, it has been a most unusual Series. "Not the one we'd planned to play," A's manager Tony La Russa observed after Wednesday's fray. What he'd planned, I guess, was for his East Bay Bashers, baseball's Gargoyles of the Golden Gate, to do to the Dodgers what they'd done to their American League West sparring partners in winning 104 regular-season games, and to the Boston Red Sox in their four-zip playoff sweep.
