 UAW, Chrysler Come to Terms Quickly; GM Workers Still Out at Pontiac Plant   By By Gabriella Stern and Nichole M. Christian, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 1995  The GM plant in Pontiac makes one-third of the auto maker's hot-selling, highly profitable C/K pickups. Unlike other recent strikes at GM parts-making factories, this strike isn't expected to close other GM plants because it is confined to an assembly operation.  The Chrysler strike, at a plant in Kokomo, Ind., ended just nine hours after 5,700 United Auto Workers members walked off their jobs Friday. The UAW was demanding that Chrysler reverse plans to move some production jobs out of the transmission-making factory. Workers will vote on the tentative agreement early this week.
