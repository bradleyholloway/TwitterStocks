 Swaps Gauge the Risk of Emerging-Market Debt   By Sharma, Shumita, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2005  For example, Mr. [Jeffrey J. Grills] noted that market watchers love to compare Russia's credit with that of neighboring Ukraine. But the countries' subindexes on J.P. Morgan's EMBI Global, which tracks dollar- denominated debt from 32 sovereigns, aren't a completely correct indicator for comparing the two.  So, Russia's average risk premium, which was trading at 1.17 percentage points over Treasurys on Friday, includes a bond that matures in 2030. But Ukraine, whose risk premium was at 1.78 percentage points over Treasurys, doesn't have such long-dated paper in the index. Its yield curve extends only to 2013.  "If someone tells me Russia and Ukraine both widened 20 basis points [0.20 percentage point] on the EMBI Global index, it does not allow me to make an accurate apples-to-apples comparison due to different durations of the subindexes," said Gunter J. Heiland, who co-manages emerging market debt with Mr. Grills at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
