 The Week Ahead / Our Take on Coming Events   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2006  A negative vote wouldn't immediately kill the pill but would put its future in the hands of a Delaware court. Still, in the short term, a vote against the pill would weaken Mr. [Rupert Murdoch]'s bargaining leverage with Mr. [John Malone]. The two have been negotiating on various ways News Corp. can buy Liberty out, including by swapping News Corp.'s stake in DirecTV for Liberty's stake in News Corp.  Ultimately, the vote is a test of whether shareholders view the company's future as inextricably tied to Mr. Murdoch's family. While there is little doubt investors would prefer Mr. Murdoch over Mr. Malone as chairman -- Liberty's track record in recent years has disappointed many, while News Corp. shares have performed strongly -- Mr. Murdoch is 75, and the question of his succession is an issue for some investors. He has said he would like one of his children to succeed him. Voting to uphold the pill could help protect the Murdoch family from any threat to their long-term control.  To counter those trends, Mr. Prince is concentrating on expanding Citigroup's presence overseas. Some 60% of the bank's profits now come from U.S. operations. Mr. Prince is trying to shift that mix so that the bulk of earnings comes from international businesses. Among other overseas projects, Citigroup is bidding for a stake in China's Guangdong Development Bank.
