 Slouching Toward Ramallah   By By Jon B. Alterman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  A funny thing happened on the way to the Arab media bazaar. Rather than contribute to a public debate on the ills of the Arab world, Arab media have concentrated much more on the ills of the non-Arab world. Rather than help Arab publics articulate their grievances toward their governments, they have nurtured Arab grievances against other governments. Arab media have gone a long way toward building solidarity among Arabs, but, to an extraordinary degree, that solidarity is treated as an end in itself rather than as a means to achieve some other goals.  Five years ago, the Arab media played a constructive role, bridging the gap between Arabs and Israelis. In 1998, the same documentary on their conflict aired on an Arab satellite station, Israeli TV, the BBC and PBS in the U.S. Benjamin Netanyahu even appeared on an Arab satellite station's call-in show while in office, taking questions from Arab viewers. Now, Arab reporters and commentators compete to see who can most cleverly skewer Israeli views -- only the views, because Israelis themselves rarely appear any more. Israeli military reprisals get massive coverage, while the acts that provoked them are described as "commando operations."
