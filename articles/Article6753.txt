 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- de gustibus -- To Coin a Prez, Reagan Was Ahead of His Dime   By Taranto, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2003  The FDR dime, first minted in 1946, was the first U.S. coin to bear the image of a contemporary leader. "The American public in 1945 was clamoring for some memorial to their fallen leader," explains CoinSite.com. "This humble coin was symbolic of the struggle to end polio through the 'March of Dimes' fundraising campaign," which [Theodore Roosevelt], himself a polio sufferer, had championed.  It's understandable that Mr. Reagan's admirers would be eager for their man to join the numismatic pantheon. At the same time, one can't blame Democrats for resisting the effort to get their man off the dime. Last week they won an endorsement from an unlikely quarter. "I do not support this proposal and I am certain Ronnie would not," Nancy Reagan said in a statement. "When our country chooses to honor a great President such as Franklin Roosevelt by placing his likeness on our currency, it would be wrong to remove him and replace him with another."
