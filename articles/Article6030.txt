 Provinces Want Share of Canadian Surplus   By By Rosanna Tamburri, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1997  The Canadian government, nearing its first budget surplus in 27 years, is resisting growing pressure from the provinces to hand over the spoils.  The 10 provincial leaders are expected to promote their demands at a meeting here today with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. The provinces argue they are entitled to a federal payback to make up, in part, for reductions they suffered in the transfer payments they receive from the federal government.  Now that Canada's deficit battle has been won, pressure is mounting from many quarters to spend expected future surpluses rather than use them to reduce the country's high debt. Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, for instance, wants the federal government to renew its commitment to health care.
