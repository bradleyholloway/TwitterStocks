 Oil Demand Buoys Import Hub   By Baskin, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 2007  In one building in the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port's, or Loop, central command complex, cameras fixate on three buoys bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico 40 miles away. The buoys demarcate where supertankers deliver crude to the only points on the U.S. coastline capable of receiving such large oil vessels. Computers in a second building track Loop's pipeline as it comes onshore, terminating just north of Galliano. Some of the crude will be stockpiled at Loop; for the rest, the process will end days later at refineries from Texas to Illinois.  As the oil industry spends billions to add global production capacity, other trends suggest the timing is wrong for the first expansion in Loop's 26-year history. The conventional wisdom holds that even though imports will keep rising, much of the foreign oil will come not from supertankers from the Middle East, but via pipeline from Canada. "We continue to do studies around [expansion]," said Gary Heminger, executive vice president at Marathon Oil Co., which owns a majority stake in LOOP. "We do not have enough demand yet."  soon after taking its first shipment, Loop's president sounded a different note. "A year ago we were trying to get support to double our capacity, but we couldn't get the oil companies to provide the guarantees we needed to finance the expansion. I'm glad we didn't get it," William Read, then-president of Loop, told the New York Times in 1981.
