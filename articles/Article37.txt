Mischa Mischakoff, who was concertmaster of the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini, orchestras, died of heart failure Sunday evening in Little Traverse Hospital in Petoskey, Mich. He was 85 years old.  The violinist had also been concertmaster of the Chicago Symphony under Frederick Stock, the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski and the New York Symphony Orchestra, which was merged with the New York Philharmonic Society in 1928, under Walter Damrosch.  Mr. Mischakoff, whose original family name was Fischberg, was born in 1895 at Proskurov, in Russia. In 1913, he won a gold medal at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, and in 1917 he became concertmaster of the Petrograd Orchestra. Later he was concertmaster of the Warsaw Philharmonic and the Bolshoi Opera. After emigrating to the United States in 1921, he changed his name to Mischakoff, because of the many violinists at the time named Fischberg.  Mr. Mischakoff became concertmaster of the New York Symphony in 1924. From 1940 to 1952, he was on the faculty of the Juilliard School of Music.  In 1951, he left the NBC Symphony to become concertmaster of the Detroit Symphony. He retired in 1968, but the following year was coaxed out of retirement by Sergiu Comissiona to become concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony.  Surviving are his wife, Hortense; two sons, Paul and Matthew; a daughter, Anne; a granddaughter and three sisters. Burial will be in Southfield, Mich., today.
