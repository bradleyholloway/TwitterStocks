The Federal appeals court in Manhattan has upheld a ruling that favors a community group on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens in its battle with the city, state and Federal governments over ownership of beach rights.  The issue was taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit after a Federal district judge in June dismissed the various government claims.  In an order signed Monday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled for the group, the Breezy Point Cooperative Community, and said that ''there is no merit'' to the state's arguments. The state had contended that the boundary of the cooperative of 2,800 homes extended only as far as the low-water mark in 1948, when an agreement between the state and the cooperative was signed.  Nathan Riley, a spokesman for State Attorney General Robert Abrams, said the state had not yet decided on whether to appeal further.  The low-water mark on the roughly mile-wide strip of beach in front of the cooperative community has extended farther and farther into the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the accumulation of millions of tons of sand eroded from elsewhere along the shore.  The court case began with the Federal Government taking steps to gain access to the new land, which now totals 285 acres, to link two parcels of the Gateway National Recreation Area on either side of the cooperative.
