 Pearl BlackBerry Offers Video, Camera, Music, As Well as Great Email   By Mossberg, Walter S, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2006  That image will change radically next week when the BlackBerry's maker, Research in Motion, introduces a sleek but powerful model called simply the Pearl. It's not only the smallest BlackBerry ever made. It's also the smallest smart phone from any maker with a keyboard for typing emails and other text.  then there's the keyboard, where the slim new design has required a major compromise. As on the older and bulkier BlackBerry 7100 series, the full keyboard has been replaced by a smaller version that squeezes two letters onto most keys. To avoid repetition and error, the Pearl uses smart software called SureType that has the uncanny ability to guess the word you meant to type in almost all cases. But it doesn't work if you're entering a new Web address or a person's name that the phone hasn't memorized.  To find out if RIM can actually be cool, I've been toting around a Pearl, testing all its functions. In general, I like it, and can recommend it to anyone who wants real BlackBerry email capabilities in a great-looking multimedia phone. Voice quality was excellent and the interface for making phone calls, once a big problem on BlackBerrys, is now decent. There's even a Treo-like universal silencer button, and the speaker phone function turns on and off with a single key press.
