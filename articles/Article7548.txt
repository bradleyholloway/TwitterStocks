 Britain Vetoes GEC Takeover Of Rival Plessey --- U.K. Says $1.75 Billion Bid Would Create Monopoly In Electronics Industry   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1986  The British government barred General Electric Co. from buying a smaller rival, Plessey Co., in a hostile bid equivalent to $1.75 billion, saying a merger would give the companies a near-monopoly in important sectors of the British electronics industry.  The government veto, which followed nearly seven months of study, ends one of the longest and most acrimonious of British takeover battles. GEC, unrelated to General Electric Co. of the U.S., launched its bid last December, arguing that a merger would create a stronger force for Britain in the world electronics industry. Plessey countered that the bid would be anti-competitive, and the battle quickly degenerated into mudslinging about the quality of each company's management.  In the end, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and British Trade Secretary Paul Channon sided with Plessey, ruling that a merged GEC-Plessey would dominate the United Kingdom market for telecommunications equipment and defense electronics.
