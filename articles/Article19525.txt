 The Finicky Traveler: Harried With Children --- Busy Bahamas Ocean Club Can't Cope with Kids, Yet; Staff Squabbles at the Door   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 2002  When my husband and I first visited the Ocean Club on Paradise Island in the Bahamas a year and a half ago, we were so charmed that we decided to book it again this year for a family trip. We figured the small children would be highly entertained at the sister Atlantis resort next door, with its aquariums, water slides and kiddie pools, while we grownups enjoyed the Ocean Club's more civilized and serene setting.  As at many luxury hotels we've visited in recent years, gone are the days when it was rare to see children here. Resorts like the Four Seasons Nevis and Sandy Lane in Barbados now actively court families with special programs and baby-sitting. Our fellow Ocean Club guests brought kids of all ages; even Dustin Hoffman, the resident celebrity our week, had a passel of teenagers with him. Most surprising, there were many couples with infants. "We're seeing a lot more families with younger children," says Howard Karawan, executive vice president of Sun International, the resort's owner. The Ocean Club is building several villas with three or four bedrooms, and is adding a children's pool.  There are a couple of important rules to follow if you want to enjoy a vacation here with kids. First of all, don't accept a room in the wing that houses the Courtyard Terrace restaurant. For my husband's son, daughter-in-law and two children, we booked adjoining rooms in the Courtyard wing -- having no idea what we were letting them in for. The first rooms they stayed in were right underneath the balcony where the band plays, and next to a marble-topped busboy station for the restaurant. Besides the noise, tobacco smoke permeated the room. Just when they thought it couldn't get any worse, a huge fireworks display went off in celebration of someone's birthday.
