 Futures Markets: Stock-Index Prices Soar in Market Rally; Traders Decline to Predict a Ceiling Level   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1987  Stock-index futures prices soared in frenzied trading that left traders and analysts unwilling to predict how high the market will go.  A daylong flood of buy orders, combined with waves of short covering by futures traders and arbitrage-related trading between stocks and futures, drove the market higher.  Arbitrage trading between stocks and futures added to the market's momentum. Throughout much of the day, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index contract for March delivery traded at nearly a 1.50-point premium to the underlying index of stocks, or about twice its theoretical premium. Arbitrage traders, who treat the futures and underlying stocks as equal investments, sold the overvalued futures and bought the stocks to lock in a profit.
