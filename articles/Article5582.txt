 Saatchi Struggles to Halt Its Fall From Grace as Revenue Declines   By By Judith Valente, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1994  In its heyday, Saatchi & Saatchi Co.'s advertising campaigns propelled Margaret Thatcher's political career, gave a fresh image to British Airways PLC and made Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus a household name.  Saatchi's worst problems are in the U.S., which accounts for 45% of its business. Earlier this month, the company dispatched William Muirhead, formerly chief executive of its London advertising unit, to New York to inject new life into its crucial, unprofitable North American operations. Mr. Muirhead's creative team in London dreamed up British Air's "World's Favorite Airline" slogan. Under Mr. Muirhead, Saatchi won more new business than any other U.K. agency between 1987 and 1993.  Here in London, uncertainly shrouds the future of the men who founded Saatchi 24 years ago, brothers Charles and Maurice Saatchi. Charles Saatchi, 50 year old, left the board in December. Mr. Saatchi masterminded Saatchi's push to become a global concern and played a part in devising some of its most famous ad campaigns, including the British Air ads.
