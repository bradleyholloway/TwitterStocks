 Gesturing as You Talk Can Help You Take A Load Off Your Mind   By Begley, Sharon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2003  Prof. [Goldin-Meadow], professor of psychology at Chicago, says she herself "gestures a ton," but that isn't why she made it the subject of her research. While studying in Geneva under the eminent child psychologist Jean Piaget, she learned "how important it is to watch children as they learn," she writes. "I chose to watch their hands."  It's as if the hands reveal even "information you may not know you have," says Prof. Goldin-Meadow. "Gesturing is a way to take your thoughts and put them out there for you and others to see. It may help you examine your thoughts, even if not consciously."  The adults who gestured at will while explaining their factoring remembered more of the letters than did volunteers who were not permitted to gesture. Gesturing, then, seems to off-load some of the mental effort needed to explain math, freeing up more cognitive resources for recall. How it does so is an open question. "But at the very least," says Prof. Goldin-Meadow, "we ought to stop telling people not to move their hands when they talk."
