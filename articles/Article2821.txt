 Southwest Airlines' Big Fuel-Hedging Call Is Paying Off --- Carrier Was Able to Protect Itself Against Soaring Energy Prices in Second Half   By By Melanie Trottman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2001  Early in the year, Gary Kelly, the carrier's chief financial officer, made the call to hedge 100% of Southwest's jet-fuel needs for the third and fourth quarters. Although there is no futures market for jet fuel, Southwest bought contracts that locked in prearranged prices of crude and heating oil, whose price moves most closely in line with that of jet fuel. To protect itself in case the cost of jet fuel fell below Southwest's locked-in price, the carrier also bought call options that would allow it to buy crude at lower fixed prices.  As a result, Southwest was able to cover its needs for the second half of last year at a level equivalent to $23 a barrel for crude oil. As oil prices soared above $30 a barrel, Southwest saved $43.1 million in the third quarter, reporting a 45% year-over-year increase in net income in a period that hammered some of its competitors. For the fourth quarter, Southwest is expected to report today that it earned about $140 million, or about 28 cents a share, helped by hedging-related fuel savings of between $60 million and $65 million.  That Southwest even made such an aggressive call underscores a strategic shift in the way airlines are choosing to protect themselves against soaring jet-fuel prices, their second-largest expense after labor. Hedging positions are growing larger, and airlines are devoting greater resources to hedging activities. Carriers also are increasingly using hedging as a tool to manage earnings in an ultracompetitive environment. By isolating the assumed cost of jet fuel well in advance, airlines can build budgets around that cost and better determine what their earnings will be.
