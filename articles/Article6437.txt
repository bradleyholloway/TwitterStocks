 In Cuba, It's Back to `Yanqui, Go Home' --- Graying Regime Sets Off A Defiant Drumbeat On the Dirt-Poor Island   By By Peter Fritsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2001  Cuba's aging leadership has cultivated a renaissance of the mass protests, bombastic rhetoric and incendiary diplomacy that characterized the island for as long as it stood behind its big brother, the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Iron Curtain, that defiant stance softened, and Cuba opened itself gingerly to dollars and even to the pope.  In such an environment, those in the U.S. chomping at the bit for a chance to sell their wares to Cuba aren't likely to make much progress, though they are eager to keep a foot in the door. "Companies are focusing not necessarily on today or what people say, but what they do -- and often there is a great divide between the two," says John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a New York-based business group.  For that matter, Cuba's international payment problems suggest it isn't the most reliable credit risk. France, Italy and South Africa have all recently shut down credit programs for the purchase of everything from wheat to engine parts based on Cuban payment defaults. Chile is owed some $20 million for fish exports. With Mexico, Cuba is in arrears on about $400 million of commercial credits. Cuba's foreign debt is estimated at $11 billion, excluding its Soviet debt.
