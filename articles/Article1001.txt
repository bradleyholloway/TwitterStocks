 BellSouth Unit Files to Cut Bills, Change Profit Cap   By By Julie Amparano, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1988  BellSouth Corp.'s Southern Bell unit filed a petition with the Florida Public Service Commission to lower bills of its 3.2 million Florida customers as much as $178 million through 1990.  In 1986, Southern Bell, which also provides phone service in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, reported an average rate of return of 15.95%.  "When you have an earnings cap, and you're at your ceiling, there's not much incentive to earn above that level," said Larry E. Mixon, a Southern Bell official in Florida. "The plan will motivate us to stimulate new revenue and cut costs." The unit is already streamlining operations in Florida, he said, and looking to offer new services, especially information products.
