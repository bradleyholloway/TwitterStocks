 SmithKline Claims It's Made Compounds To Hinder Reproduction of AIDS Virus   By By Richard Koenig, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1989  SmithKline Beckman Corp. said it has developed compounds that hinder the reproduction of the virus that causes AIDS in laboratory tests.  The strategy behind the work is to block the action of an enzyme, called a protease, that plays an essential role in viral reproduction. Although researchers know of various compounds that can inhibit activity of the bare protease in a test tube, a big question has been whether such compounds can get into the AIDS virus and into the cells that the virus infects.  He said the SmithKline compounds were tested in cultures of infected white blood cells of the type that are favorite targets of the virus. Although the compounds didn't prevent the production of new viruses, the compounds sharply reduced -- and eventually stopped -- the production of certain proteins important to both the structure and continuing reproductive capacity of new viruses, he said. Because those proteins are known to be produced by the action of the protease, he said, the researchers infer that the compounds are protease inhibitors.
