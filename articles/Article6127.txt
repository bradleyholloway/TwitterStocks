 Sorry State of Affairs: Clinton Apologizes To Nearly Everyone --- Even if Contrition Offensive Wins Forgiveness, Trust Won't Come as Quickly   By By June Kronholz and John Harwood, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 11, 1998  Polls suggest that the public, at least, might lean that way. Mr. Clinton also has going for him the contours of the nation's culture and religious traditions. Many Americans give great weight "to the idea of redemption, of casting aside one's sins, of making a new start," says William Galston, a former Clinton aide and now a public-affairs professor at the University of Maryland. Forgiving is part of the American ethos, he says.  Then, too, most people outside Washington, unlike the president's allies within the Beltway, don't feel the president's actions directly affected them, and so forgiving him may require little effort, says Robert Enright, professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and founder of the International Forgiveness Institute. But forgiveness takes time, he adds. "The one who apologizes must wait until the other is ready to forgive," he says, and that may be what the American public is doing now -- working out whatever anger it feels and going through a period of confusion before sorting out its feelings.  Those feelings will, in part, be decided by how sincere the public thinks the president is. "I'm torn between two scenarios," says Alan Wolfe, a Boston University sociologist. Mr. Wolfe's recent work has chronicled the sometimes awkward coexistence of high moral standards with Americans' increasing reluctance to pass judgment on others. "If indeed people just want this behind them, they're looking to him to make a ritualistic apology even if they know it's calculated," he says. "The other is that a plea for forgiveness without sincerity isn't a plea for forgiveness at all. Americans are deeply forgiving, but it has to be from the heart."
