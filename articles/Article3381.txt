 SmartMoney: Job Hunting Gets Easier   By Bradford, Stacey L, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2005  In today's market, some companies are finding that it is taking them longer to fill positions, says Michael Parbs, a recruiter with Ajilon, a Saddle Brook, N.J., recruiting firm. "Employees for the first time [in a while] have options," he says. Some candidates are fielding two or three offers.  Hiring managers are looking for what the recruiting industry calls "investment positions," says Ajilon's Mr. Parbs. These are the people who are not absolutely necessary to run the business, but will help the corporation add to its revenue stream. The key for job seekers is to sell themselves to hiring managers as being able to boost the bottom line.  No matter what industry you are pursuing don't be discouraged by layoff announcements. Like it or not, layoffs are a natural part of an economy that adapts to changes quickly. Often, the same companies that are letting people go are hiring simultaneously. "So the message to workers is, ratchet up your courage and make that exciting move when it makes sense," Mr. [Marc Lewis] says.
