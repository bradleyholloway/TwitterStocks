 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Review / Books: More Than Infamous   By Herman, Arthur, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2006  Arnold's bold plan came within an ace of succeeding. In the autumn of 1775, [George Washington] was stalled in front of Boston. But an American army under Gen. Richard Montgomery, following Arnold's plan, headed north from [Lake Champlain, Arnold], which Arnold had secured by seizing the fortress at Ticonderoga at the very start of the revolution. Montgomery easily captured Montreal. Another 1,100 men under Arnold set out through the forests of Maine to reach Quebec.  In "Through a Howling Wilderness," Mr. [Thomas A. Desjardin] gives us a vivid picture of this march into hell. The first frost descended only days after Arnold's army left, along with rain. "Men awoke, if they slept at all, with their wet clothing frozen 'a plate of glass thick.'" The icy rains soon gave way to snow. Arnold and his men had to portage their ungainly boats through the snow from one set of rapids to the next on the Kennebec River.  Arnold offered to turn over the strategic fortress at West Point (the site of today's military academy) in exchange for a princely sum and a British field command of his own. Instead three American militiamen caught Maj. [John Andre] with plans for taking West Point, all in Arnold's handwriting. "Arnold has betrayed us!" Washington is supposed to have exclaimed. "Whom else can we trust?" He was unaware of the future irony of his words. Andre died nobly on the scaffold. [BENEDICT ARNOLD] escaped to safety -- and eternal ignominy.
