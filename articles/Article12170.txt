 The Morgan Stanley / Dean Witter Merger --- Teaming Up Could Form New Fund Giant   By By Karen Damato, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1997  Each company brings to the planned marriage a large fund operation with a "fairly mediocre" performance record, says Don Phillips, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago fund-research firm. Both Dean Witter, Discover & Co. and Morgan Stanley Group's recently acquired Van Kampen American Capital unit have delivered below-average returns to fund investors over the past three years, according to an analysis using Morningstar's category ratings of fund performance.  But the new Wall Street colossus can tap expertise at two smaller fund operations with better records -- Morgan Stanley's in-house fund group, and the Miller Anderson & Sherrerd unit that Morgan Stanley acquired last year. The combined company is expected to aggressively prune the laggards out of its sprawling and overlapping fund lineup. And that could be good news for investors in Dean Witter and Van Kampen funds.  Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter have a total of $93.9 billion in stock-fund and bond-fund assets between them. That would be enough to make the combined entity the sixth-biggest fund group, according to Financial Research Corp. of Chicago. The combined company will bump Merrill Lynch from that No. 6 slot, just as it will pass Merrill as the largest U.S. securities firm.
