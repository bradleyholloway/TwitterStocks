 U.K. Consumer Group Wants Conditions for Cruise Merger   By By Brandon Mitchener, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2002  The U.K. consumer group argued against blocking the combination.

By forcing Carnival, also of Miami and the world's largest cruise company, to sell a P&O brand, possibly along with one or more ships in service or in the pipeline, the commission would avoid strengthening P&O's already substantial market position in the U.K. cruise market, the group added.
