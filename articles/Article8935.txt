 ConAgra to Launch Advantage Line Of Vegetarian, Low-Fat Food Products   By By Rekha Balu, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1998  ConAgra Inc. plans to unveil a line of vegetarian, nearly fat-free products for sale in natural-food stores, one of the first such entree lines from a major food company.  The line, called Advantage 10, is ConAgra's long-awaited response to increasing demand for food with health benefits. The Omaha, Neb., food company introduced the Healthy Choice line of reducedfat products in the late 1980s. Healthy Choice products include luncheon meats, ice cream, bread and cereals.  Advantage was developed with physician and author Dean Ornish, who promotes the idea that food can significantly alter health conditions. Dr. Ornish, part of the volunteer faculty at the University of California at San Francisco, has served as a paid consultant to ConAgra.
