 NASA Slates Launches on Rockets, Signs $180 Million Accord for Shuttle   By By Arlen J. Large, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1986  NASA is still in the launch business, although its remaining space shuttle fleet is grounded following the Jan. 28 loss of the shuttle Challenger. The weather satellites will be lifted into space on old-fashioned Atlas and Delta rockets, the kind that were to have been replaced by the more glamorous shuttle.  The launches are a reminder that the shuttle isn't the only way into space, either now or in the foreseeable future. The problem for now is that there isn't a way to accelerate the pace in rocket launches to fill the immediate gap in NASA's shuttle missions.  Nevertheless, much of the commercial launch activity this year will rely on "expendable" rockets. NASA is working on a backlog of launches using Atlas, Atlas-Centaur and Delta rockets, while the European-made Ariane rocket is scheduled next Friday to resume launches at the rate of six or seven a year from its twin pads at Kourou, French Guiana.
