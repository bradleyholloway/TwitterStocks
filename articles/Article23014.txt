 Cable & Wireless to Pare Global Unit   By By David Pringle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2003  Deep cutbacks in the U.S., in particular, could be messy and time-consuming as Mr. [Francesco Caio] tries to keep burgeoning restructuring costs in check, while preserving relationships with multinational customers that use C&W's U.S. facilities. Although Mr. Caio, a 45-year-old Italian, would like to sell U.S. assets rather than close them down, experts say the market is racked by overcapacity and potential buyers want to purchase customers rather than infrastructure. For that reason, the money raised by any disposals in the U.S. is unlikely to significantly curb the cost of withdrawal. Even after a restructuring program announced in November is completed, the company estimated it will still have GBP 400 million ($654.3 million) in property-lease commitments in the U.S. market.
