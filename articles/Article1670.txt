 Legal Beat: Plaintiffs' Asbestos Awards Are Delayed   By Lambert, Wade; Moses, Jonathan M, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1992  Maryland State Judge Marshall Levin, the judge overseeing the nation's largest asbestos case, ruled that victims cannot collect any punitive damages until all compensatory claims are paid. The unprecedented decision is an acknowledgement that the courts are concerned that victims' rightful claims may far exceed the money available to pay them. The ruling affects some 8,500 claims. The four asbestos makers involved are GAF Corp, Keene Corp, Pittsburgh Corning Corp and Porter Hayden Co.
