 China Grows 9.4% Despite Curbs On Investment; Continued Expansion Seen, But Price Data May Signal The Potential for Deflation   By Browne, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 21, 2005  The last time Beijing hit the brakes on investment a decade ago, the economy plunged into deep recession. Goldman Sachs economist Hong Liang attributed China's success this time to a fresh group of savvy technocrats with access to better-quality data that has enabled them to fine-tune economic management. Just as important, Ms. Liang said, "they got lucky."  China is in a race to spur greater personal consumption before the U.S. consumer starts to wobble. At the start of the year, the question that gripped economists was whether China's soaring economy would crash-land. Now, Ms. Liang said, "the question is whether the U.S. will have a hard or soft landing."  U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow stressed the importance of encouraging domestic consumption on his recent visit to China. In a research report this week, UBS economist Jonathan Anderson accused Mr. Snow of "grasping at straws." Consumption, he said, already is robust and will be hard to stimulate further. The Statistics Bureau said retail sales in September rose 12.7% from a year earlier.
