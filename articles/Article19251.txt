 Hollywood Journal: Mars Wars --- Two Films About Fourth Planet Make Rival Studios See Red; Whose Favorite Martian?   By By Tom King, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2000  Hollywood is seeing double again, as two major studios race to complete mega-budget films based on virtually the same subject. Disney is scrambling to get "Mission to Mars" to theaters next month, racking up overtime bills and cost overruns in the process. But the real mission is to trounce "Red Planet," a similar Warner Bros. movie coming out in the fall that's already getting better buzz.  In fact, about two years ago, while both films were in still in the early stages, Mr. [Joe] Roth took the extraordinary step of calling the rival studio's then co-chairman, Bob Daly, to beg him to shelve its project. He even offered to sell the rights to half the profits of Disney's movie. Mr. Daly says he politely declined, but did agree to change the name of his movie -- from "Mars" to "Red Planet."  Disney, at least, can claim it started the countdown first. That was back in 1995, when a producer who had formerly been Mr. Roth's deputy at Twentieth Century Fox pitched him the "Mission to Mars" idea (which coincidentally shared the name of a long-ridiculed former attraction at Disneyland). The studio quietly commissioned several scripts. Two years later, after NASA's 1997 Sojourner mission to Mars captured the public's attention, Warner Bros. surprised Disney by announcing that it had bought a Mars script of its own. Executives at Warner Bros. insist they had no idea Disney had a similar project in the works.
