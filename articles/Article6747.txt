 Fund-Firm Leakage Could Drain Market; Selling to Offset Withdrawals May Take Toll   By Ken Brown and Gregory Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2003  "This is more of a Putnam-specific situation rather than an issue for the overall market right now," says Richard Block, director of global equity trading at Putnam, who declined to discuss the firm's individual holdings. "We have not found any problems executing our strategy." For now, Putnam has sold some shares and put the money it has raised in stock futures because they are easier to sell on short notice if Putnam needs to raise cash to meet investor withdrawals.  Some investors already are moving to bet against the stocks or simply are trying to avoid stepping into the path of a big seller. Stocks in Putnam's portfolios have seen an increase in trading volume in the 10 days since the fund investigation has picked up steam, activity that is more than twice that of the overall market. And in recent days, hedge-fund managers have been swapping lists of big Putnam holdings, debating which shares could be hit hardest if the mutual-fund company continues to lose investments and is forced to trim its holdings. "People are definitely trying to game Putnam's portfolio," says Paul Hickey, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, a Westport, Conn., investment firm.  For some stocks, the worries about Putnam add to other growing concerns. Putnam, for example, owned 10 million shares of AutoZone Inc., a Memphis-based auto-parts retailer, as of June 30, or 11% of the company's shares outstanding. Some investors worry that if Putnam starts selling AutoZone shares, it likely will hit the stock because it would follow after AutoZone's largest investor sold shares. On Nov. 5, ESL Investments Inc., the hedge-fund company run by investor Edward Lampert, sold 5.6 million shares of AutoZone.
