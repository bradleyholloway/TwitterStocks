 Business Technology: Groups Oppose Telecom Immunity   By Corey Boles and John Godfrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  Civil-liberties groups urged lawmakers not to pursue a compromise solution that would offer phone companies immunity from their alleged participation in the U.S. government's warrantless-wiretapping program.  The compromise was raised last week by Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the panel that is considering the immunity issue. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) also mentioned the compromise, known as indemnification, when speaking to reporters last week.  "Whatever is done on the questions of damages, it has to serve as a deterrent," said Harvey Grossman, legal director of the ACLU of Illinois. "A 'get-out-of-jail' card would only increase the likelihood of this type of behavior in the future."
