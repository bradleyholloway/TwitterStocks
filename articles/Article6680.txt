 Choosing Sides: Videogame Giant Links With Sony, Snubbing Microsoft --- Electronic Arts Shows Its Clout And Wariness of Allowing Xbox to Dominate Market --- John Madden on Play-by-Play   By By Robert A. Guth, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2003  The exclusive deal shuts out rival game-machine makers from access to the popular EA Sports line in its new online form. It's a particular rebuke to Microsoft, whose Xbox competes with Sony's PlayStation 2. In its drive for a dominant role in online games, Microsoft tried again and again during the past 18 months to persuade Electronic Arts to add its games to Microsoft's own online game service. But Electronic Arts executives decided Microsoft was demanding too much control over Electronic Arts' games and wasn't willing to pay the company for their use.  Microsoft wanted Electronic Arts games on its network, but Electronic Arts executives say Microsoft wouldn't agree to share portions of the Xbox Live subscription fees with publishers of the games that are played. Electronic Arts and other publishers argue that could give Microsoft unfair control over pricing and influence over customers. Microsoft's strategy "is very simple," says Mr. [Larry Probst], the Electronic Arts chairman. "They collect all the money; they keep all the money."  When Microsoft decided, in the summer of 1999, to build the Xbox, one of its first stops was Electronic Arts' headquarters. Electronic Arts announced in December 2000 that it would produce eight games for the Xbox. Both Mr. Probst and Microsoft's Mr. [Robbie Bach] emphasize that this side of the companies' relationship is still strong. Electronic Arts has some 15 to 20 Xbox games under development.
