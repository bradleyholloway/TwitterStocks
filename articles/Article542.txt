T his was on the 50th floor of the McGraw-Hill Building, at high noon. One grown man said to another, ''Pumpsie Green?'' The other grown man replied, ''Elston Howard.'' We both wore ties, as if we needed an extra tongue or our heads were on a leash.  The occasion was the annual Spring Spree of the Blohards Club. ''Blohards'' stands for Benevolent Loyal Order of the Honorable Ancient Red Sox Die Hard Sufferers of New York. The Blohards meet twice a year, when the Red Sox come to town. There are buses to Yankee Stadium; there is also a very serious bar, a slide show and a baseball player who answers questions.  At high noon, the baseball player, who didn't wear a tie, was Dennis Eckersley, the Boston pitcher whom I had maledicted in this space just last week for throwing a slider where Dave Collins wanted it and so seldom gets it. Mr. Eckersley is a gentleman, and very funny. What he had to say about his two catchers will have to remain our secret.  On the elevator going down in the American League standing of the McGraw-Hill Building, a Blohard told Eckersley, ''This is the only time I've ever seen you when your hair isn't stringy.'' Too true. We are always looking at the back of Eckersley's head on a Manhattan Cable television screen. By the bottom of the second inning, there seems to be spinach growing on his neck.  Eckersley left New York for Cleveland in time to give up six runs in three innings. Very funny. Fortunately, Detroit has ceased to be serious. But I am getting behind myself.  T he Blohards had invited me to be profound. This was easy. I told them all about religion, politics, sex and other sports. Red Sox fans were, of course, peculiarly equipped to appreciate my thinking on St. Sebastian, the patron saint of fans. (Remember that St. Sebastian was full of arrows, as though he should have lived in Boston or Chicago.) Everybody in the McGraw-Hill Building agreed that professional football in June and July is both kinky and fascistic.  You are wondering about Pumpsie Green. I mentioned Pumpsie Green because, when the lily-white Red Sox finally decided to integrate their baseball team, they integrated with Pumpsie Green. It was as if, as H.L. Mencken said of a country that elected Calvin Coolidge president, ''A hungry man, set before a banquet prepared by master cooks and covering a table an acre in area, should turn his back upon the feast and stay his stomach by catching and eating flies.''  The Yankees of that time were equally lily-white. They integrated with Elston Howard. Fans remember these things. And fandom is story-telling. That grown men should gather at high noon to talk about Pumpsie Green and Elston Howard may seem a little ridiculous. Would you prefer that we talk about tax shelters and kill-ratios? Somewhat after the very serious bar and a lowering noon, the Blohards conducted a raffle. A number was drawn from a hat - I don't recall which number; at the time I was trying to remember how many home runs Steve Bilko, the great white whale, hit for the Los Angeles Angels in the old Pacific Coast League the summer that I discovered sex - and a member of the audience cackled: ''Don Buddin!''  Don Buddin? He wasn't being raffled; he was being remembered by a number on his back. I have memorized the number on the uniform of Willie Mays, but surely only St. Sebastian would have bothered to remember the number of Don Buddin. It was as if, at a meeting of the Modern Languages Association, during a heated discussion of Icelandic sagas, someone shouted ''Fergus McIvor'' or ''Hinton Rowan Helper.'' I loved it. Why should everything we know be important?  O ne of the ways in which I choose not to think about my first marriage or dead penguins off the coast of Argentina is to wonder what life will be like next season without Willie Stargell. Willie Stargell -Pumpsie Green? - once described trying to hit Koufax as ''like trying to drink coffee with a fork.'' Until I met Dennis Eckersley, I thought that sportswriters invented everything witty that has been attributed to Stargell and Yogi Berra and Alexander Haig.  Anyhow, after I was profound in the McGraw-Hill Building, a Blohard asked me whether, in my expert opinion, John Cheever was a Red Sox fan. I said that I thought so; the last time I had talked to Mr. Cheever, among too many poets in southern New Hampshire, our conversation was about Ted Williams. Then Mr. Cheever went off to climb Monadnock.  Was it also true that Cheever was dying? That, too. Red Smith, said my new friend. Grown men, as Mr. Cheever once observed, cry ''at the death of a cat, a broken shoelace, a wild pitch.'' So there we are going down. On Friday Mr. Cheever died. With him gone, and Red Smith, most of the poetry has gone out of our prose.
