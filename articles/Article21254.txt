 Japanese Investors Are Taking Wary Approach To Stock-Index Futures, Focusing on Short Term   By By Marcus W. Brauchli, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1988  Nearly a month after trading began in a pair of competing, cash-settled index futures, volume is overwhelmingly concentrated in contracts with the earliest delivery date. Relatively few contracts are left unsettled at the close of each trading day, and on only one thin day in the stock market did futures trading appear to affect share prices.  Although Japan long has had agricultural futures markets, financial futures are new. On Sept. 3, the Tokyo Stock Exchange began offering contracts based on an index, called Topix, of 1,100 first-section stocks. The same day, the rival Osaka Securities Exchange started trading in futures based on the Nikkei index, an average of 225 major stocks compiled by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading business newspaper. A similar Nikkei contract already was traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange.  For one thing, trading in Osaka of futures derived from the better-known but more narrowly based Nikkei index has outshone trading of the broad-based Topix index on the much bigger Tokyo exchange. Average daily turnover recently in the Nikkei contract was 27,019 contracts with an underlying value of about 750 billion yen ($5.58 billion), against an average of 18,988 Topix contracts a day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with a value of 407 billion yen.
