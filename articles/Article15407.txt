 Judge Rejects Claim Of Patent Violation Against Calgene Inc.   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1996  U.S. District Court Judge Joseph J. Farnan, in a ruling in Delaware, rejected Enzo's patent-infringement claim against Calgene. He also invalidated Enzo's genetic antisense technology patents, saying they didn't allow others to practice the claimed invention. Antisense technology employs the reverse sequences of a specific gene to repress the expression of that gene.
