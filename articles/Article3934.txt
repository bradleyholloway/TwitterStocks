 CEO School: Flung Into Top Job, Sullivan of AIG Learns on the Fly; He Must Both Handle Probes And Shift a Culture Shaped By Legendary Predecessor; Rehearsing a Conference Call   By Langley, Monica, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2005  Mr. [Martin Sullivan] is trying to distinguish himself from his mentor. Mr. Greenberg issued orders from his corner suite; Mr. Sullivan asks managers for opinions as he visits their offices. Mr. [Maurice "Hank" Greenberg] insisted on coats and ties; Mr. Sullivan has instituted casual Fridays. Mr. Greenberg resisted regulatory intervention; Mr. Sullivan early on told New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer: "We get it. We're changing."  AIG's stock hit a two-year low. Mr. Sullivan brainstormed with Frank Zarb, who had been named interim chairman, about the cloud over the company. They decided now was time for Mr. Sullivan to make personal visits to the regulators, who had reacted angrily to Mr. Greenberg's resistance to their probes. "The regulators need to get a sense of who you are," Mr. Zarb told him, "and see that the contrast with Hank is dramatic."  In his meeting with Mr. Spitzer and his investigators, Mr. Sullivan, who is of Irish descent, joked about a trip the New York attorney general had made to Ireland, asking, "Were you visiting the O'Spitzer clan?" After the pleasantries, the AIG chief got serious. "Here I am. You don't ever need to subpoena AIG again," he said, according to one attendee. "Just telephone me and I'll personally respond."
