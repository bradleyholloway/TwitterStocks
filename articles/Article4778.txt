 Power Requests For Shoreham, Seabrook Fail   By By Edward Sussman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1987  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected requests to operate the Seabrook nuclear plant at low power and to boost power at Shoreham nuclear plant to 25% from 5%.  The commission rejected the Seabrook request from Public Service Co. of New Hampshire by a vote of 3-2 because its emergency plan isn't "bona fide" since it didn't compensate for the failure of the state of Massachusetts to cooperate. The panel also said the plan contained obsolete and inaccurate information.  The panel also voted 5-0 to deny Long Island Lighting Co.'s request to increase its Shoreham plant to 25% power. The commission said neither the NRC staff nor the utility had suggested ways of resolving "new material and new factual issues" in time for action this summer, when the power increase was sought, an NRC spokesman said.
