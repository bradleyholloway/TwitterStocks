 Politicians Turn to Special Groups to Raise Funds While Avoiding Presidential Campaigning Laws   By By Brooks Jackson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1986  Rep. Jack Kemp's Fund for the American Renaissance is raising secret contributions from corporations while publishing a book on foreign policy by the New York Republican and producing a half-hour television documentary narrated by him.  Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush's Fund for America's Future has hired 13 staff members in Michigan, the GOP's earliest testing ground for its 1988 presidential candidates, plus full-time workers in Iowa and New Hampshire, two other key presidential battlegrounds.  Actually, Mr. Bush's PAC has so far given only about 10% of its money to party groups and GOP candidates, which looks good only in contrast to the 3% squeezed out by Rep. Kemp's PAC last year. Most of the Bush PAC money pays for such things as Mr. Bush's political travels, consultants, a national staff of 24 people plus the Michigan, Iowa and New Hampshire operations. The PAC also has begun investing heavily to develop a list of mail-order donors: It sent pleas for money last week to about 250,000 people.
