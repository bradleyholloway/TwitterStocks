 IBM, Microsoft Battle Again, This Time Over `Web Services'   By By Rebecca Buckman and William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2002  The IBM/Microsoft rivalry is especially noteworthy in light of the previous, bruising battles between the two companies. They had a famous falling-out after years of joint work on the OS/2 operating system in the late 1980s. Later, Microsoft wound up crushing that product after IBM took control of it, and dominating the PC desktop market with Windows. More recently, preliminary data show that Microsoft's Exchange e-mail server software appears to have "nudged ahead" of IBM's Lotus Notes server software in total number of corporate e-mail users, says Mark Levitt, an analyst with International Data Corp.  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer ranked those rivals last summer at the company's annual employee meeting. Mr. Ballmer cited Linux as Microsoft's biggest single threat, and described IBM and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. as the two companies Microsoft most needs to beat. Mr. Ballmer's emphasis on IBM instead of Sun -- Microsoft's longtime rival in the corporate market -- was notable. Sun, despite creating Java, has been hard hit by the collapse of the Internet bubble and its own battles with Microsoft and IBM.  Mr. [Steven Mills] also notes that Microsoft products such as its SQL Server database, which Mr. [Paul Flessner] oversees, are still "not used for any heavyweight transaction processing." Microsoft, however, says SQL is starting to show up in data-heavy institutions. For instance, SouthTrust Bank, part of SouthTrust Corp. in Birmingham, Ala., is installing more Microsoft databases, and discarding IBM's Lotus Notes e-mail product in favor of Microsoft's Exchange. "Microsoft just seemed more hungry" for SouthTrust's business, says Jeffrey Baker, a bank group vice president, though he said the bank is happy with other IBM products.
