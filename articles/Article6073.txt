 World-Wide   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2002  After the clash in a Jenin refugee camp handed the army its worst one-day loss of life in 18 months of fighting, Sharon declared Israel is in a struggle for survival. The incident threatened to undo any progress resulting from Israel's earlier pullout from two West Bank towns, which the U.S. indicated was inadequate.

The U.S. charged an activist lawyer with aiding a terrorist group by passing messages to followers of a client, Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind sheik convicted in 1995 of plotting to bomb New York landmarks. She faces 40 years in prison. Three others also were charged. The case pits the right to counsel against U.S. tactics in fighting terror.
