 Darwin's Tree Branches Out --- Biologists' Effort to Diagram How All Species Are Related Grows More Precise, Complex   By By Sharon Begley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 2003  Charles Darwin hardly suspected that figuring out who's descended from whom would be this hard, but he knew it was important: The only drawing in his 1859 opus, "The Origin of Species," shows a tree of life. Ever since his rudimentary attempt at showing the family tree of species living and extinct, evolutionary biologists have been ardent arborists. Working first with anatomical and fossil evidence and lately with genetic clues, they have moved from the original division of life into plants and animals (a tree with two main trunks) to a scheme with three, then five, then back to three major trunks.  Presentations at a conference last year and five papers in today's issue of the journal Science show that the tree of life is undergoing major overhauls. There are even new ideas about "which end is up," says Prof. [Sandra Baldauf]. Scientists used to think that single-celled protozoa and bacteria were the most ancient living things, and therefore formed the roots of the tree. Animals and fungi were sitting pretty in the crown, having branched off from other species fairly late in the game. But new genetic evidence hints that the first ancestors of animals split off from the rest of the tree at least 1.5 billion years ago.  Molecular biology scored its first major tree-of-life shake-up in 1977, when biologists Carl Woese and George Fox used DNA sequences to infer that the tree has three main trunks. Bacteria constitute one trunk. Eukaryotes (everything whose cells have a nucleus, which means plants, animals, fungi and even lowly pond scum) make up a second. And the newly named Archaea, ancient microbes, are the third.
