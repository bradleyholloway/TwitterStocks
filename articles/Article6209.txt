 Welfare Programs Benefit When Incentives Are Added   By By Kelly K. Spors, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 10, 2003  The results, released today by the New York-based social-policy group MDRC, come as financially strapped states face increasing pressure to cut incentives for people on welfare, such as Medicaid health insurance. Supporters say the findings contradict most states' welfare-to-work policies that make dollar-for-dollar reductions to benefits as recipients earn more money, which they say often discourage work. "As states think about what to cut under the current budget crises, . . . this gives them something to think about." says Gordon Berlin, MDRC's senior vice president.  Researchers aren't sure if the program's benefits will persist into the future, years after the incentives stopped. A study of the program's effects two years into the project showed recipients enjoying more beneficial impact than they did after the benefits ended. MDRC plans follow-up studies to gauge if the program's effects linger.
