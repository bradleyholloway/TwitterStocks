 Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 13, 1999  This is as good an explanation as I've heard to explain Stalin: A bad mood equals a really bad day for old Bolsheviks. That it comes in a novel matters not. Biography can tell us a lot about Stalin's life and how a twisted dwarf who spoke Russian with an accent was able to best brilliant, charismatic speakers like Trotsky and Bukharin, shoot most of his old comrades as spies and get more than a few intellectuals in the West to support him. Everything, that is, except for the big question: why?  This Richard Lourie does very well in his dark and fascinating new novel, "The Autobiography of Joseph Stalin." Mr. Lourie, an author and translator, starts the book in 1937 as Hitler is positioning Germany to swallow Europe and maybe the Soviet Union too. But Stalin has bigger things to worry about, like shooting the generals of his own army because they might be loyal to his exiled arch enemy, Leon Trotsky. When Stalin finds out that Trotsky is writing a biography of him, the dictator decides to write his own -- in the moments when he is not obsessing over the details of how to kill Trotsky.  Virginia Woolf's wondrous, lambent "Mrs. Dalloway" recently inspired Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Hours" (1998), and now it serves as a starting point for Robin Lippincott's first novel, "Mr. Dalloway." Where "The Hours" refracted Woolf's own reflections on memory, mortality and desire with three separate but linked tales, Mr. Lippincott more straightforwardly examines her themes by exploring the characters "Mrs. Dalloway" introduced.
