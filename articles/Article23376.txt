 Stock Market Quarterly Review: Mixed Bag of Results for IPOs; Vonage Falls 13% in Debut, While MasterCard Shines; A Strong Pipeline of Deals   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2006  "Volatility has increased, and investors are concerned about inflation. All these things contribute to some uncertainty in the IPO market," said Daniel P. Cummings, Merrill Lynch & Co.'s co-head of equity-capital markets in the Americas. "Investors often judge their holdings based on a quarterly snapshot, and in situations like this, some may say to themselves, 'The market is all over the place -- should I really be changing my portfolio?'"  The amount raised in the U.S. through initial public offerings in the second quarter reached $11.15 billion, up from $6.7 billion a year ago, according to data tracker Dealogic. There were 46 deals in the latest period, compared with 43 in the second quarter of 2005. Dealogic's data don't include real-estate investment trusts or IPOs for companies that don't own an actual operating business.  "The market hasn't shut down. We have seen periods in the last 10 years where markets absolutely go away," said Jeff Rosichan, head of U.S. equity-capital markets at Banc of America Securities. "Deals are still getting done; it's just a little harder for both the buy and sell side to peg the valuation," he said.
