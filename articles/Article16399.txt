 The Prisoner of Massachusetts Is Finally Free   The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2004  Congratulations to Dorothy Rabinowitz and the Journal for their bulldog vigilance to free [Gerald Amirault]. Gov. Jane Swift, the prosecutors and the phony "experts" ought to spend some jail time as penance for persecuting this innocent man.  It is my sincere hope that Gerald Amirault will now be allowed to rebuild his shattered life, with only one small detour taken to sue the state of Massachusetts for violating his constitutional rights. Welcome home, Gerald.  Ms. Rabinowitz and the Journal continued to pursue this story when the rest of the media were willing to continue with slogans like "Believe the children!" It took 18 years away from him, but Gerald Amirault never had to say he was sorry for something he didn't do.
