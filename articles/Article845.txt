 Costly Neglect: British Industry Suffers From Failure to Heed Basics of Marketing --- Traditional Disdain for Selling Is Boon for Competitors, But Some Firms Wake Up --- Admiration for a Local Hero   By By John Marcom Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1987  Britain's audio industry was founded by skilled engineers who designed some of the world's best loudspeakers. But while the British engineers were adding refinements that impressed discerning colleagues, the Japanese ran away with the mass market.  A dearth of commercial types also plagues Britain's auto industry, which has surrendered more than 80% of its home market to foreigners. State-owned Rover Group PLC -- the heir to great names like MG, Austin, Morris and Triumph -- continues to lose money and market share despite leaps in productivity and quality in recent years. "We just haven't been as effective commercially as we should be," says Rover's chairman, Graham Day. Even the paint schemes on foreign cars exude more flash and performance than Rover's do, he adds.  The audio and automobile industries aren't the only ones that have let early advantages in technology or design slip away. British appliance makers have lost ground to Continental Europeans who have established a reputation for design and quality standards. Television-set makers -- regularly scheduled TV programming began here -- have lost out to the Japanese and the Europeans. British computer brands like Sinclair and Acorn have bloomed but quickly faded.
