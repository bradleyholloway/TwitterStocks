 Futures Markets: Stock-Index Prices Reach Highs On Strong U.S., Foreign Demand   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1987  Stock-index futures prices charged to record highs, fueled by waves of buy orders from U.S. and foreign investors. Successive rounds of arbitrage-related program trading also drove prices higher, traders said.  "We're getting into the area of the greater fool theory," said Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York. He said many investors are buying stocks and stock-index futures in the belief that, without any negative economic news on the horizon, there will always be a "greater fool" around to buy their holdings at a still higher price.  The expanded premium induced traders to sell the relatively overpriced futures and buy the stocks in the index. Traders treat the futures and underlying stocks as equivalent investments, because every three months stock-index futures expire at the same price as the index on which they are based.
