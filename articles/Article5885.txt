 U.S. Investors' Retreat From Technology Sector Begins to Take Toll on European, Asian Markets   By By Wall Street Journal reporters Sara Calian in London, Vanessa Fuhrmans in Frankfurt and Kevin J. Delaney in Paris, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2000  The damage was in many ways worse in Asia as blue-chip indexes in Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea each plunged more than 3% on concerns about the U.S. market. Tokyo was closed for a holiday. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.8%, or 1.76 points, to 222.49. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 1.3%, or 2.19 points, to 162.59.  Eager earlier this year to cash in on the dot-com rush sweeping the U.S., investors in Europe poured their money into the few Internet-service providers on the market, pushing their prices even higher than many of their U.S. counterparts. Now, they may have to pay.  Take EM.TV & Merchandising, the German producer and distributor of children's television shows, which recently acquired Jim Henson Co., the U.S. creator of the Muppets characters. After discovering an accounting error by the Henson unit, the company said 31.6 million marks ($14 milion) of revenue originally booked during the first half of the year would have to be moved to the second half. The company restated its first-half revenue as 191 million marks, instead of 223 million, and said it still would hit its revenue target for the full year. Nevertheless, its stock was hammered, falling 27% to a new 52-week low of 40 euros.
