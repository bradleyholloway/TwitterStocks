 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Aiming That Arrow   By By Dave Shifflet, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2003  Michael J. McManus, who runs Marriage Savers from Potomac, Md., says community marriage policies -- which include prenuptial classes on listening, family finances and how to argue properly -- are in effect in 170 cities and are putting a big hurt on divorce lawyers. Modesto, Calif., and seven other participating cities have experienced a 48% decline in divorce, at least according to organization figures. To celebrate Valentine's Day, Mr. McManus and his wife, Harriet, have been spreading the pro-marriage gospel in the Bahamas. "Rough duty in February," he notes, "but somebody has to do it."  Naked clerics may represent the ultimate in contemporary worship, though the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel offers some competition: "Imagine repeating your vows after Elvis in a lush tropical setting, complete with palm trees, swaying hula girls and theatrical lighting and fog." There are also weddings performed by "Merlin in a Camelot wedding package, or by King Tut in an Egyptian wedding ceremony -- Vegas style! Austin Powers can even perform your rites in our popular 60's wedding." One imagines the photos will be good for a few chuckles once sobriety is regained.
