 Life Without Sam: What Does Wal-Mart Do if Stock Drop Cuts Into Workers' Morale? --- Employee Grumbling Spurs Union Talk and Laments That Founder Has Gone --- Chain Still Is Growing Fast   By By Bob Ortega, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1995  WORKER PAYMENTS for health-care coverage at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. increased last year, but their share of health-care costs remained the same. A page-one article Jan. 4 incorrectly stated that Wal-Mart increased workers' share of health-care costs to bolster profits. (WSJ Jan. 24, 1995)  The world's largest retailer also is discovering the risks in a profit-sharing plan heavily invested in its own stock. For a long time, the risks were easily ignored: Someone who paid $1,650 for 100 Wal-Mart shares in the original public offering in 1970 would have had stock worth $3.5 million after the 1993 split. But early last year, Wal-Mart shares accounted for 89% of the plan's assets of $2.1 billion -- and they were worth at least $350 million less than in January 1993.  Still, how Wal-Mart copes with a stock that no longer is steadily climbing could be instructive to other fast-growing companies that reward workers partly with shares instead of cash. MCI Telecommunications Corp., Home Depot Inc. and Federal Express Corp., among others, all use stock as a major part of employee compensation. And pilots at Southwest Airlines recently agreed to take stock options instead of pay raises for the next five years, helping the high-flying airline hold down costs. If the stock price climbs, they will do very well. Or, as at Wal-Mart, they could find stock incentives a losing proposition.
