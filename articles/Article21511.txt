 Kohl, Profiting From Role As Unifier, Wins Elections --- Demands at Home, Abroad Pose Large Challenges For the German Leader   By By Timothy Aeppel and Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 1990  Mr. Kohl attracted voters through a campaign that focused on his role as "Chancellor of Unity," but he also profited from a weak opponent, the Social Democratic candidate Oscar Lafontaine. Projections showed Mr. Kohl's party would win with some 43.8% of the vote, a healthy margin over the Social Democrats' 33.8%. However, a second clear winner was Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher and the Free Democrats, whose showing of 11% solidified its role within the ruling coalition.  In local Berlin elections, the Christian Democrats profited from growing public fears of disorder, a trend that cost the left much of its support. Still, the party, led by former West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, lacks a working majority in the city's parliament, even with their Free Democrat partners. Projections showed that the conservatives won 37.5% of the vote, compared with 32.9% for the Social Democrats. The Party of Democratic Socialism had its biggest success in Berlin, where it attracted 9% of the vote.  Mr. Kohl has forged unusually close relations with the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the past year, but he will face new challenges on both fronts. The U.S. will expect more help from the chancellor for its confrontation with Iraq. It will also seek compromises on agricultural policy to avoid a breakdown of global trade negotiations. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, will expect Germany to repay Soviet support for unification with increased economic assistance, and struggling East European nations are also looking toward Germany for badly needed support.
