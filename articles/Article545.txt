Patriarch Pimen of Moscow, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, took part in an ecumenical prayer service in New York yesterday. He is the first Russian Patriarch of Moscow to visit the United States.  Patriarch Pimen addressed the United Nations special session on disarmament Thursday. Flanked by representatives of several American denominations, the 71-year-old Patriarch spoke primarily of a need for Christian unity before about 200 people in the chapel of the Interchurch Center at 475 Riverside Drive.  In the one-hour worship service, Patriarch Pimen did not mention the recent Moscow conference on disarmament attended by religious leaders from around the world. But at a private luncheon for about 60 church leaders after the service he said he was pleased with the results of that conference and praised the participation of American church leaders and the preaching of the evangelist Billy Graham, an observor at the Moscow meeting. The Russian Orthodox Church was host for the conference.  A choir from St. Valdimir's Theological Seminary in Tuckahoe, N.Y., sang in Russian and English as the Patriarch entered the chapel in the building, which houses the National Council of Churches and dozens of churches and religious organizations.
