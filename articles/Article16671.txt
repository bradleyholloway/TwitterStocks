 Ask Encore / Focus on Retirement   By Greene, Kelly, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2006  YOU ARE RIGHT to be wary about dropping the policy. If you do drop it, but later change your mind and decide you want it after all, the premiums for a new, comparable policy almost undoubtedly will be higher than what you're paying now.
