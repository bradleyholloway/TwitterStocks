 Use of Polygraph Tests as Evidence Gets Boost From Court Ruling   By Lambert, Wade, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1995  "Judges are saying that there is an appropriate place for lie-detector evidence in the courts. `Not admissible, period,' is no longer right," said Joel Cohen, a criminal-defense lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan in New York. "The polygraph is no more fallible than other fact-finding tools."  Under Daubert, a trial judge must determine that the science involved is legitimate and that the results are significant to a case before allowing scientific evidence. Lie-detector tests were barred by many courts under the old rule, which required judges to determine that evidence was based on science or technology that was "generally accepted." That standard, known as the Frye test, was based on a 1923 Supreme Court ruling preventing a murder defendant from using what the high court has since called a "crude predecessor" to the polygraph to demonstrate his innocence.  "There can be no doubt that tremendous advances have been made in polygraph instrumentation and technique in the years since Frye," the Fifth Circuit said. The three-judge panel stressed, however, "It is with a high degree of caution that we have today opened the door to the possibility of polygraph evidence in certain circumstances. We may indeed be opening a legal Pandora's box."
