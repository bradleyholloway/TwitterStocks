 Beyond.com, Dynex Capital Soar, As Techs Lift Nasdaq, Small Caps   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2000  After pushing lower in early trading, technology stocks rebounded to lead the Nasdaq and small-cap markets higher, with Nasdaq's large-cap technology components outpacing the overall group.  Beyond.com surged 47 cents, or 44%, to $1.53. The Sunnyvale, Calif., e-commerce-services provider was told by the Nasdaq National Market that it regained compliance with requirements following a debt exchange and will remain listed. Beyond.com said the notification came after a successful note exchange allowed it to remove debt from its balance sheet, raising its net tangible assets to $30.2 million. The Nasdaq National Market requires companies whose stocks trade below $5 to have at least $4 million in net tangible assets.  Dynex Capital (NYSE), a Glen Allen, Va., mortgage and consumer-finance company, leapt 44 cents, or 30%, to 1.88. California Investment Fund, a closely held real-estate investment company, offered to buy the remaining stake in Dynex Capital it doesn't already own for $90 million. California Investment, which owns almost 5%, offered to acquire the remaining shares for about $2.46 each, or $28 million, and Dynex's preferred shares for $62 million.
