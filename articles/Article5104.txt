 Letters to the Editor: Welfare System Without a Saving Grace   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1990  I applaud Grace Capetillo's efforts on behalf of her child and herself. She is guilty only of being thrifty, something this country has valued until recent generations. Even by the judgment against her, we see that the real problem is that she has unknowingly broken a regulation regarding saving money. But to charge her with fraud and to demand repayment of $15,545 is ridiculous; to force her to spend the money she has saved, presumably for her child, is the real crime.  The plight of the thrifty welfare mother brought to mind many of the frustrating paradoxes in other government-aid programs. As an undergraduate student, I lived at home to save on the cost of room and boarding fees. I would have preferred to enjoy the independence of dormitory life. I also found it necessary to work long hours at a number of menial jobs to pay my tuition. Fashionable clothes and fancy tennis shoes were far beyond my reach. My reward for being such a hard-working individual: failure to qualify for any student aid. The "system" claimed that I made too much money ($3.75 an hour as a busboy) and that my parents lavished me with wealth (a bedroom and two meals a day).
