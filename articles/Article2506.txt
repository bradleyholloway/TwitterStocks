 Texaco Plans Restructuring, Job Cuts As Depressed Oil Prices Hurt Industry   By By Steve Liesman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 13, 1998  Despite the cuts, the White Plains, N.Y., integrated oil concern indicated that it may make acquisitions while other oil companies' stock prices are depressed. The company also said even though exploration spending would be reduced next year, it expects to continue to boost oil and natural-gas production.  U.S. exploration and production workers will bear the brunt of the layoffs, accounting for about 750 of the jobs. The remaining 250 will come from the United Kingdom. Texaco senior vice president John J. O'Connor said the company will take charges for the downsizing either in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 1999.  Texaco and other oil companies have seen their profits decline sharply this year as oil prices hit 10-year lows. Many now believe that prices won't rebound soon and are paring work forces. The U.S. oil industry has shed more than 30,000 jobs this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a number that almost is certain to grow. "There will be others," says Frank P. Knuettel, an oil analyst at PaineWebber.
