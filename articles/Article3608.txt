 Heelys Is Hoping Investors Roll With Planned Public Offering; Maker of Sneaker Skates Is Relying on Fast Growth To Attract Market Interest   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2006  Unlike its predecessors, Heelys doesn't offer a variety of products; it focuses almost entirely on wheeled shoes, which made up 95% of its net sales in 2005. (It also sells helmets, protective gear and replacement wheels.) The company sold 1.4 million pairs in the first six months, the same amount as in all of 2005, and began using additional manufacturers in May when demand outstripped its regular manufacturer's capacity.  "Wall Street likes pure plays, but they do get concerned if it's too much of a one-trick pony," says Tom Taulli, a professor at the University of Southern California and the author of "Investing in IPOs." "Heelys is in the youth market and activewear market, so it can grow for at least a couple of years," Prof. Taulli said.
