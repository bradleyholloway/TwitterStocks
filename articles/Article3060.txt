 Qualcomm Wins Entree in Western Europe   By By David Pringle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2002  In any case, Qualcomm has another avenue into the European market. At an exhibition in Madrid, Vodafone recently demonstrated a handset, containing a Qualcomm chip, downloading pictures, games and other data at high speeds. The handset, made by Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea, is compatible with the third-generation, or 3G, cellphone technology chosen by Europe. Vodafone doesn't plan to launch 3G services in Europe until next year and a spokeswoman for Vodafone in Spain declined to comment on if and when it might begin selling the Samsung handset.  Of course, Qualcomm will face strong competition in the nascent European 3G market. Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill., and NEC Corp. of Japan all have developed 3G phones containing baseband chips they designed themselves. Some of these chips are available to other handset makers and Germany's Siemens AG has chosen to use Motorola's chips in its first 3G phones. Mr. [Donald E. Schrock] acknowledges that it is going to be very difficult for Qualcomm chips to dominate the 3G market to the same degree as they do the CDMA market.  Qualcomm's business prospects elsewhere, particularly in China, have faced some questions. China recently said it would adopt its own standard, called TD-SCDMA, for its 3G networks, rather than adopt the CDMA standard that Qualcomm primarily developed. But Qualcomm, in response, noted that it owns the underlying patents for CDMA, on which TD-SCDMA is based. As a result, Qualcomm said it will continue to gain licensing fees from the Chinese wireless standard.
