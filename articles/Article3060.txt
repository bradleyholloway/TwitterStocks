 Feminism: What NOW?   By By Barbara Amiel, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 20, 1998  NOW's Women-Friendly Workplace certainly does not match the West Wing of the White House as described by a number of women workers of late. That building seems short on power salutes and long on short skirts. But what's a good feminist to do? Bill Clinton promised to be the strongest advocate of NOW's programs, from affirmative action to sexual harassment policies. It would have been unnatural not to give him the benefit of every doubt, especially when his accusers were not respected members of what I call the "new matriarchy."  In the new matriarchy, when a man is charged with a "gender" crime, any attempt to defend himself against the allegation is itself a crime. What feminists never anticipated was catching one of their own. Their rules were designed to trap a Wilbur Mills or a Clarence Thomas, not a Bill Clinton. In the legal landscape feminists have created, the accused is deprived of most normal safeguards. Mens rea (guilty intent) is of reduced relevance. The accused is guilty until proven innocent -- and feminists proudly announce this reversed onus. As evidentiary rules are whittled away to protect accusers, one can't help feeling that we might as well dispense with trials and send men postcards telling them where to serve their sentences.  As it is, women tend to believe Mr. Clinton, men to believe Ms. Willey. This is attributed to political affiliation (more women are Democrats, men Republicans), but I cleave to a simpler interpretation: Men know they sometimes grope; women know they sometimes lie. Even the warm letters Ms. Willey wrote to the president after the alleged grope don't exculpate Mr. Clinton from the standpoint of feminist ideology, which holds that victims of sexual manipulation may be trapped in a sort of Stockholm syndrome with an attachment to their tormentor. Besides, what the hell, she needed a job.
