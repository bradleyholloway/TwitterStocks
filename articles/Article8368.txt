 Restaurant Review   By By Eleena de Lisser, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1993  Taking a cue from the airline industry, some fast-food chains -- including a few franchisees of McDonald's, Hardees and Burger King -- are developing frequent-customer clubs. With each purchase, a customer earns credits that can be redeemed for free food or merchandise.  Perhaps the most ambitious program can be found at Arby's, which has a frequent-customer club in 40 restaurants in Nashville, Tenn., Portland, Ore., Sacramento, Calif., and Salt Lake City. More than 30,000 people are members in the Portland and Sacramento markets alone, where the test began last fall, says Dave Shannon, director of corporate marketing. Arby's, Miami Beach, Fla., plans to expand the program nationwide to its 264 company-owned restaurants by year's end.  While customers are rewarded for their repeat patronage, Arby's benefits by learning more about its clientele. Consumers complete membership applications, telling Arby's their age, sex, and menu preferences. Individual membership cards are passed through magnetic readers at each purchase, giving the company information about customer spending habits and frequency of visits. Bonuses can then be tailored to customers' tastes; regular buyers of a salad might receive a coupon toward a future salad purchase, as opposed to a roast-beef sandwich.
