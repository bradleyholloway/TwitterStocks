 Companies Wanting to Go Public Wrestle With Pricing Issues in an Unsettled Climate   By By Linda Sandler, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 2, 1998  Indeed, New York real-estate developer Harry Macklowe, in response to an inquiry this week, said through a spokesman that his company's initial public offering would be "postponed, pending more favorable market conditions."  Companies now grappling with stock-pricing issues include brokerage boutique Keefe Bruyette & Woods, which is seeking to raise about $100 million in coming weeks, along with the little local banks whose shares Keefe underwrites. With many mutual funds performing badly, they also include well-known money-management concerns such as Neuberger & Berman and Mario Gabelli's Gabelli Funds. The latter are seeking roughly $250 million and $115 million, respectively.  The IPO market isn't defunct. Internet auctioneer eBay raised $63 million on Sept. 24. Barnes & Noble's online bookseller is expected to find buyers. Despite some analysts' skepticism, DuPont plans to raise more than $3 billion by taking its Conoco energy unit public in October.
