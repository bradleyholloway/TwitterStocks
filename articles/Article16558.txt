 For Stocks, Two Paths After the Storm   By Mohammed Hadi and Karen Talley, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2005  Exhibiting Wall Street's legendary reverse logic, the stock market largely shrugged off last week's catastrophic news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% last week, recovering some the losses posted in August, in which the blue-chip benchmark fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, also coming off a 1.5% loss in August, gained 1% for the week.  For a view of longer-term beneficiaries, Subodh Kumar, chief U.S. investment strategist at CIBC World Markets, points back to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the last storm to cause such devastation. Mr. Kumar's investment list is dominated by companies in the reconstruction field, but also contains some less-obvious examples.  Not all companies will see a boost in business, and some caution is in order. Investors should review their portfolios to see if they hold shares of companies that are based in the affected areas or do a lot of business there. Companies, especially smaller ones, "stand to go out of business if they can't get financing or disaster relief," Mr. Kumar says.
