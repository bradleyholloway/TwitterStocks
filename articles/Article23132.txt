 A 14-Year Trek to U.S. Market; Determined Filipino Overcomes Complex Food-Safety Rules   By Cohen, Margot, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2004  It's all part of Filipino scientist Hernani Golez's crusade to increase Philippine mango exports to the U.S. It took Mr. Golez 14 years to persuade the U.S. in 2001 to certify that the central Philippines island of Guimaras is free of a winged brown pest called the mango-pulp weevil and to permit mangoes from Guimaras to enter the U.S.  The Philippines produced one million tons of mangoes last year, but exported only about 10%. Last year the U.S. imported just $162,000 worth of Philippine mangoes. By comparison, the U.S. imported $90 million worth of mangoes from Mexico and $28 million from Brazil, where the mango-pulp weevil has never been detected. A U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman notes that even mangoes from Hawaii have to be irradiated for fruit flies before they can be sold in the continental U.S.  Mr. Golez's efforts to meet U.S. standards have been drawn out. The first big hurdle came in 1987, when a survey of 33 mango-producing provinces discovered evidence of mango-pulp weevils on Palawan, 300 miles southwest of Manila. Mr. Golez agreed to U.S. demands for a quarantine there while seeking alternate sources of mangoes. Guimaras, surrounded by water, was a natural place to start. It took until 1993 for the U.S. to declare Guimaras weevil-free after a series of fruit samples turned up negative.
