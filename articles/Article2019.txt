 Manufacturers' Optimism Waning, D&B Survey Finds   By By Jacqueline Simmons, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1995  U.S. manufacturers are less optimistic about the coming three months than they were in February, according to an index of business expectations that weakened for the first time since November.  In contrast, D&B found executives in the construction industry sharply more optimistic about the coming three months, even though new orders and production schedules slumped in the first quarter.  "Although overall expectations remain strong, manufacturing executives indicate they plan to scale back production levels during the quarter in anticipation of a gradual reduction in new orders," Mr. Handler added. Indeed, the steepest slide in D&B's industrial sentiment index for the coming three months was production orders, which slipped eight points from February.
