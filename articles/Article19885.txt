 Phone Consolidation May Cost Corporate Clients Clout   By Jesse Drucker and Christopher Rhoads, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  "I think the pricing for the consumer is going to continue to be very competitive," says Richard Notebaert, chief executive of Qwest, which on Monday gave up its fight to acquire MCI. "The situation where there ought to be some concern is in the business and government market. There, you just don't have a whole bunch of us, and you're going down to a creation of concentration between SBC and Verizon."  "The big corporate customer has become used to an annual decrease in rates," says Nick Wray, a Control Point Solutions vice president. "They should not expect this anymore." Mr. Wray suggests the impact on rates will vary by industry and location. Oil companies in parts of Texas, where Cingular Wireless, SBC and AT&T are the dominant companies -- and are now about to be joined under one roof -- could be adversely affected.  Verizon, for its part, has said higher prices are unlikely in an environment where local phone business is eroding as a result of competition and a slew of new technologies like Internet calling. "The battle didn't go away because we're buying" the long-distance companies, says Verizon spokesman Peter Thonis. "The battle went away because technology made stand-alone long-distance business much less relevant."
