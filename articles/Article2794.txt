 Pressed by the U.S., GE Offers Repairs For Faulty Dishwashers, Not Just Rebates   By By Matt Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2000  Under the new plan, consumers can call GE at 1-800-599-2929 to get more information or arrange for a technician, or log on to a Web site, www.geappliancerecall.com. GE plans a nationwide advertising campaign in newspapers to reach owners. It also will send direct mail to consumers in parts of the country where many of the machines were sold, and call consumers who contacted GE to inquire about the rebate plan but didn't take advantage of it.  In unveiling the original rebate program, GE had argued that the machines essentially couldn't be repaired, since a technician must disable the switch, thus denying consumers a choice of drying methods. GE also cited the cost and age of the dishwashers, noting that the average dishwasher lasts nine to 11 years. On its Web site, it had warned customers: "If you choose to repair it independent of GE, you do so at your own cost and risk."  GE did offer repairs to big-volume customers who had "a financial hardship" and qualified service technicians on site, and about 540,000 dishwashers have been rewired in managed properties. But to consumers, GE had offered owners' rebates of $75 to $125 toward a new GE dishwasher or $25 toward a non-GE dishwasher. That rebate option will continue.
