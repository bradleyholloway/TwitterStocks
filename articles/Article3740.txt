 Gulf Refining Capacity Likely to Be Limited   By Resnick-Ault, Jessica, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2007  Taken together, the plants process about 842,000 barrels a day. Preliminary assessments indicate minimal wind and flood damage to the facilities themselves. Yet, refineries rely upon power provided by the city's grid, and can't restart until it's restored. None of the companies have offered restart estimates thus far.  The surprise fallout from the hurricane underscores the continued vulnerability of the U.S. refining sector, which earlier this year experienced a cascade of operational disruptions. [Humberto] made landfall in the same place that Hurricane Rita did in the catastrophic 2005 hurricane season, although Humberto cut a much narrower swathe.  As of Wednesday night, none of the region's refineries had planned to shut units ahead of Humberto, although they were monitoring the storm watch from Port O'Connor, Texas, to Western Louisiana.
