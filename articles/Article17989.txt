 Top American Express Official to Quit, Takes Responsibility for Safra Campaign   By By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1989  Harry L. Freeman, executive vice president of corporate affairs and communications, accepted "executive responsibility" for the campaign in a letter to American Express Chairman James Robinson III made public by the company. In the letter, Mr. Freeman said he will retire from the company at Mr. Robinson's pleasure but no later than the end of the year.  Mr. Freeman, 57 years old, is a top aide of Mr. Robinson's and a close personal friend. Although his primary responsibilities involved government and public relations, Mr. Freeman consulted regularly with Mr. Robinson about many aspects of American Express's business, according to company insiders.  It wasn't immediately clear whether Mr. Freeman was directly involved in the company's effort to discredit Mr. Safra. American Express previously declined to say whether any senior officials were aware of the campaign, although Mr. Robinson has denied having prior knowledge of it.
