 Investment Dartboard: Stock-Picker Repeats as Pros Whip Darts   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 1989  Once again, Mr. Morgan, who is director of investment policy at Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C., has won this column's stock-picking contest.  Last month, Mr. Morgan suggested Phoenix Medical Technology Inc., which makes disposable gloves. Ms. Marshall recommended Micron Technology Inc., which has been in the news lately because of potato baron J.R. Simplot's unusual plan to guarantee the employees of his family-owned firm against losses when they purchase Micron shares. (Mr. Simplot owns or controls about 17% of Micron.)  Shares in Fedders Corp., the air conditioner maker, rose 21.6% from the beginning of December, when Mr. Morgan recommended them, through Feb. 28. With Fedders shares now approaching $14, Mr. Morgan thinks they're pretty fairly valued. Traders should consider reducing their Fedders holdings, he says, but long-term investors should still do well in the stock.
