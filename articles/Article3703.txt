 EU Pushes for Competition in Energy Market; Antitrust Regulators Target RWE and Eni Over Pricing Power   By Kiviniemi, Peppi, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2007  A spokesman for RWE's sales and network unit RWE Energy Friday said the EU probe was "incomprehensible," adding that RWE is playing by the rules in regards to access to its grids. He said RWE installed a transparent grid-access system in April 2005 and has since then undertaken several measures to improve competition in the gas market. He also said RWE isn't the market leader in the German gas market, but instead aims to close the gap on market leader E.On Ruhrgas, a unit of E.On AG. Eni declined to comment on the antitrust investigation.  EU Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes has said energy utilities controlling both the supply and distribution channels should be separated to boost competition and lower prices, a process known as "unbundling." Ms. Kroes has so far stopped short of ordering a general unbundling of Europe's largest utilities, but has threatened to break up individual companies if antitrust violations are discovered.
