 High-Tech Hits the Highway --- As `Smart Cars' Finally Debut, We Rate the New Gizmos; Autopilot, Talking Dashboards   By By Gregory L. White and Jonathan Welsh, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2000  Then -- suddenly, and entirely on its own -- the car began straightening out. Mr. [Russell] Ollie could feel the car gently apply the brakes and pivot back onto its original course. "I did nothing," says Mr. Ollie, an electronic-commerce consultant. "The car just recovered."  After years of promises from manufacturers, those high-tech gizmos that are supposed to revolutionize the automobile are finally hitting the showrooms. In the coming months, new vehicles will come equipped with everything from night vision to Internet access to radars that regulate distance from other cars. Unlike the gadgets of the past, which focused on less-glamorous functions such as exhaust systems and odometer readings, these are designed to ease the hassles and risks of driving itself. In short, they are the first real step toward the "smart car," which the industry has long touted as the vehicle of the future.  In general, we found some of the sexiest gadgets to be the least useful, such as GM's and Lincoln's relatively primitive Web access and Jaguar's voice-control system, which lets you bark commands at your radio and air conditioning. Less exotic features, such as the stability-control system in Mr. Ollie's Volvo, typically seemed more helpful.
