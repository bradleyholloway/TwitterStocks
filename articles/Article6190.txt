 The Economy: Oil Prices Are Likely to Stabilize Around $25 for the Rest of '03   By By Bhushan Bahree in Paris and Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  OPEC's balancing act is expected to be tricky. Inventories of crude oil and refined products are still near historical lows in the U.S., the world's largest market. After building a bit, crude stocks last week fell slightly to 277.1 million barrels, 16% below the year-earlier level. Imports were down 14% from the week before.  Still, prices have fallen significantly from prewar levels, when they spiked to $39.99 for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude. Yesterday, U.S. benchmark crude for May delivery settled in New York at $28.85 a barrel, up 85 cents a barrel. Prices rose late in the day after U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters it was likely that Iraq's northern oil fields were wired for destruction.  The U.S. is expected to consume more than nine million barrels a day of gasoline during the summer, relying on imports and inventories to meet the 9% of demand that domestic refiners can't meet. But high crude-oil prices and tight supplies caused by Venezuela's recent two-month strike, and a cold winter that had refiners turning out more heating oil, have left only a thin cushion of inventories.
