 Citicorp Has Delaware Unit Issue Securities --- Circumventing Court Order, Firm Offers Certificates Backed by Its Mortgages   By By Robert Guenther, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1989  Blocked by a court order from underwriting securities through its big New York bank, Citicorp last week went outside the court's jurisdiction and used its Delaware bank to issue $47 million of securities backed by residential mortgages.  While the size of the new issue of mortgage pass-through certificates is small, the move is important because it signals an escalation in the fight between securities firms and banks over securities powers.  A Citicorp spokeswoman said the nation's largest bank this year plans to issue $15 billion in securities backed by loans that it has made to consumers, if necessary underwriting them through its small Delaware bank. A Citicorp spokeswoman said, "This is a very significant business to Citicorp and one that we intend to stay in."
