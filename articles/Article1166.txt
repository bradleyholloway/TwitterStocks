 Health Savings Plans Start to Falter; Despite Employer Enthusiasm for Consumer-Directed Approach, Patients Express Dissatisfaction With How the Accounts Work   By Fuhrmans, Vanessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2007  "If I were a product manager in any other industry and saw scores this low in customer satisfaction and understanding, I'd be thinking of pulling that product from the shelves or retooling it," says David Guilmette, managing director of Towers Perrin's health-care consulting practice.  "We'd heard concerns from employees that they weren't going to get the right care," says Julie Thibodeau, co-director of human resources at Osram Sylvania. This year enrollment between the two consumer- directed plans rose to 15%.  Aon has offered its own employees two consumer-directed options since 2002, with deductibles between $2,500 and $6,250. Nearly 20% of employees are enrolled in one, and the majority of them have money left to roll over from the $500 to $2,500 that Aon contributes to their account each year. Employee premiums are about 30% lower than in the more-traditional plans Aon offers, says John Reschke, Aon Corp.'s vice president of benefits. Considering that the coverage is at least as rich for most employees as in the traditional plans, "we should have a lot more people enrolled," he says. "But this is a different kind of insurance, and it can be scary at first until people understand."
