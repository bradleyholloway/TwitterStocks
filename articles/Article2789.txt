 Manager's Journal: Dot-Coms Won't Die Alone   By By Paul Kedrosky, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2000  Dot-coms aren't the only ones to be tarnished. The best and the brightest at venture capital firms around the country are having to suck up some major losses for their ill-advised forays. While many were simply opportunists grabbing onto a passing financial train, others supposedly knew better. It is now apparent that they didn't. Recent restructurings at dot-com financier CMGI, and the withdrawal of the troubled Idealab public offering, prove that incubators, far from adding value, are arguably dangerous.  The pinnacle of venture capital is occupied by firms like Hicks, Muse, Tate & First and Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. The former's dot-com troubles apparently forced it to do the unthinkable: Skeptical investors have made the firm guarantee returns of 20% or better in a new venture fund that it's currently flogging. The latter firm has done no better, with, for example, its high-profile investment in MVP.com, an online sporting-goods retailer. One investor in the company recently wrote off its stake, and there are persistent rumors that MVP.com is searching in vain for desperately needed capital.  Next up, and most troubling, will be the infrastructure providers. Companies like Sun and Dell are dangerously exposed to the dot-com capital expenditure crunch. And so is Oracle, whose database sales (and share price) were juiced in recent years by dot-coms frantically setting up sites to (unsuccessfully) flog their wares. Even hosting companies like Exodus won't escape unscathed. Its business has benefited immensely from the VC-driven munificence of buy-first, think-later dot-coms spending their sugar-daddies' capital.
