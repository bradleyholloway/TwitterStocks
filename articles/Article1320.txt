 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Entertainment & Culture -- Review / Theater: Into the Woods Once Again   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2008  Lisa Peterson, a well-established director whose work is new to me, has put a winningly new spin on the timeless tale of two troubled young couples who wander into an enchanted wood, run into a gaggle of mischief-making fairies, and emerge unscathed and happy. Now Mr. Reiner is an elder statesman of comedy, and the York Theatre Company, which usually specializes in small-scale Off-Broadway mountings of new musicals, has revived "Enter Laughing," the 1976 musical version of his semi- autobiographical 1958 novel about David Kolowitz (Josh Grisetti), a geeky, star-struck kid from the Bronx who longs to become an actor.
