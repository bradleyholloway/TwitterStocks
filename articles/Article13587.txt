 Leisure & Arts -- Masterpiece: A 'Testament to Bach' --- Paul Tortelier broke Pablo Casals's lock on the Cello Suites   By Ivry, Benjamin, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2008  Casals practiced the Suites for a dozen years before playing them in public, and he waited until he was 60 before he began to record them, with granitic, Old Testament-style sternness, veracity and authority; transfers of his late 1930s recordings are still available from diverse CD labels like EMI, Naxos, Opus Kura and Pearl. For the Cello Suites, there was silence before Casals, but now their very identity seems threatened by the sheer decibel level of competing performances on CD, as well as by sometimes ill-advised transcriptions for double bass, marimba, classical guitar, saxophone and even tuba.
