 Capital Chronicle: 'The Africans': Public TV Caught Napping   By By Suzanne Garment, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1986  This establishment gives birth to a nine-hour TV show whose narrator keeps saying things like: Moammar Gadhafi "used oil as an opportunity, for the glory of Africa as well as Islam." "American bombs dropped from the air kill children as surely as terrorist bombs left at airports." Africans "expose themselves to Western Shylocks in search of a pound of flesh."  The program in question is, of course, the PBS series "The Africans," which began its run this week. The idea for the show began at the BBC. The show's writer and sole narrator, Ali Mazrui, from Kenya, teaches political science at the University of Michigan. His schooling, like the origin of his TV series, was mainly British. His B.A. is from the University of Manchester and his Ph.D. from Oxford.  The BBC asked Washington's WETA-TV to co-produce the series featuring Mr. Mazrui. Charles Hobson, WETA's executive producer for the series, recalled in an interview that he did not think much about Mr. Mazrui's politics. "Ali's critics in Africa," Mr. Hobson said, "come from the left," because Mr. Mazrui is no Marxist.
