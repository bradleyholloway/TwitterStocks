 Seeking Heft, State Street To Add Investors Financial   By Levitz, Jennifer, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2007  "We are very determined to remain independent, because we think that's the best strategy for our shareholders," Jay Hooley, vice chairman of State Street, of Boston, said in an interview. State Street's "plan and our strategy is to be a growth company -- acquiring companies and building business."  Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RCB Capital Markets in Portland, Maine, said State Street's stock declined sharply because "the deal is expensive for State Street -- they paid Neiman Marcus prices rather than Filene's Basement prices." The company said it had other bidders.
