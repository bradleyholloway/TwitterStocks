 GE Earnings Show Weakness As Orders Drop   By By Kathryn Kranhold, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2003  Net income rose 20% to $3 billion, or 30 cents a share, from $2.5 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the first quarter last year, after the company took charges required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., booked a charge of $215 million for a change in accounting for costs related to the eventual retirement of certain operating facilities in the first quarter of this year. A year earlier, GE recorded an FASB-mandated charge of $1.02 billion for impairment of goodwill related to certain acquisitions.  GE said it would deliver 22 turbines in the second quarter, compared with 86 turbines in the second quarter of last year. GE delivered 33 in the first quarter of this year, down from 69 turbines in the year-earlier quarter.  Mr. [Jeffrey Immelt] is pushing to reshape GE into a company that earns money not only by manufacturing equipment, but also by servicing products. GE said its revenue from services rose 20% in the first quarter. Bank of America analyst Nicole Parent said services contributed "to strong profit results."
