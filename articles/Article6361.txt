 Malaysia Gets Another Look; Foreign Funds Might Consider Returning Amid Signs of Change   By Lopez, Leslie, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2004  On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Federal Court overturned Mr. Anwar's 2000 sodomy conviction, freeing him from prison. The ruling, says Christopher Woods, managing director of CLSA Ltd. in Hong Kong, brought "Malaysia back to the ranks of the civilized world."  Mr. Anwar was dismissed from Malaysia's government on Sept. 2, 1998, a day after Dr. Mahathir -- railing at foreign-currency speculators -- imposed capital controls that effectively eliminated international trading in the country's currency and pegged the ringgit at a fixed rate against the dollar. Malaysia's Composite Index immediately plummeted more than 13%.  Mr. Anwar's subsequent convictions and long jail sentences on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct prompted many investors to question the independence of Malaysia's judiciary and other public institutions. "All the goodwill Malaysia enjoyed was thrown out of the window by what happened in 1997 and 1998," says CLSA's Mr. Woods.
