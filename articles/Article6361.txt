 Euro Hits New Lows Against the Dollar and Yen   By By Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2000  At its nadir for the day, the euro fell to a record low 85.66 U.S. cents, which compares with a value of $1.17 when the euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999. The euro also fell to lifetime lows of 90.83 yen and 1.5225 Swiss francs. Meanwhile, the pound fell to $1.4055 in intraday trading, its lowest since 1986.  To a large extent, the euro continued to be a victim of the same forces that have plagued the currency since its birth: a lack of leadership by either European finance ministers or the ECB; the superior growth of the American economy; and a continuous outflow of capital from the euro-zone, particularly to the U.S.  Many analysts also believe that to succeed, intervention would require the participation of the Federal Reserve. But the U.S. has "no great appetite for this and is keen to maintain the strong-dollar ethos," said Mr. [Mark Cliffe]. A strong dollar helps dampen U.S. inflation and attracts foreign investment to fund the U.S.'s bulging current account deficit.
