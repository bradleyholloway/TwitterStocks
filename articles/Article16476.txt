 New Test Detects a Pregnancy Risk; Screening for Preeclampsia Could Boost Preparedness For Blood-Pressure Condition   By Burton, Thomas M, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2005  "The biggest implication of this work is that it will help patients and doctors better prepare for preeclampsia," Dr. [Ananth Karumanchi] said in an interview. In many cases today, he said, "by the time women get to the doctor, they've had a seizure." Seizures, along with kidney and liver failure and coma, often occur when the condition advances toward a more severe state called eclampsia. This happens in roughly 1 in 200 women with preeclampsia.  "This probably won't have a significant impact," said Stephen P. Emery, director of obstetrical ultrasound at the Cleveland Clinic. "Having a test early in the pregnancy may not change outcomes." His point is that, while bed rest and blood-pressure medicines can help patients, there is no cure for preeclampsia today except delivering the baby and placenta, and that can best be done only when the pregnancy is far enough along.  In recent years, Dr. Karumanchi and colleagues have found that blood vessels of women with preeclampsia were what he terms "grossly abnormal." Moreover, their work found that placentas of such women secrete a protein inhibiting the development of blood-vessel growth proteins such as placental growth factor. The work raises the possibility that drugs can be developed that will prove far more successful than current therapy, which essentially is bed rest, blood- pressure drugs and, in some cases, aspirin.
