 Syrian Offer To Aid U.S. Has Caveats --- For Its Intelligence, Damascus Seeks Help Reviving Mideast Talks   By By James M. Dorsey, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2001  People close to Syrian intelligence said Syria, despite its criticism of the U.S.'s Mideast policy, is willing to share intelligence and expertise with the U.S. The people said Syria could make a major contribution given its knowledge of Muslim groups willing to engage in suicide attacks. The Syrian capital, Damascus, is home to militant Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Syria has close ties to the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, which opposes Israel and is accused by the U.S. of attacking its embassies and military facilities in the 1980s.  Still, Syria's apparent willingness to cooperate is another sign of a U.S.-Arab rapprochement in the Mideast, where Israeli-Palestinian violence over the past year had worsened U.S.-Arab relations. Many Arab leaders are sympathetic with Washington's quest to retaliate against Osama bin Laden, whom the U.S. blames for last month's terrorist attacks in the U.S. However, they generally share three caveats, listed by Mr. [Sharaa] to a European Union delegation: no attack on an Arab country, no Israeli participation in any retaliation and more-vigorous U.S. involvement in restarting the Mideast peace process.  Mr. [Rafik Hariri] said Arab leaders are "skeptical" about the U.S. pledge because of consistent U.S. support for Israel in the past. "So far, the United States says `we agree, but we must first concentrate on bin Laden,'" he said.
