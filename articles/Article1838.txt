 Yugo Planning Major Effort To Boost Image   By By Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1988  Yugo America Inc., which imports the Yugoslavian-made minicars, will launch a $48 million marketing and advertising campaign tonight on national television that is part of a business plan the company hopes will establish an identity for the Yugo beyond its image as simply a cheap car.  The business plan, which Yugo America will unveil early next month to its dealers, includes a new warranty covering everything from engines to windshield-wiper blades, programs to improve production quality and requirements that dealers devote more space and attention to Yugo in showrooms and service departments. Fewer than 10 of the company's 324 dealers sell Yugos exclusively.  But plagued by poor quality, delays in new-model introductions and increasing competition from other, more established, low-priced models, the Yugo has struggled. Last fall, sales began to tumble from levels that were already far below company targets. Caught in a cyclical industry downturn, Yugo sales nose-dived to only 2,840 cars in December, the lowest monthly total since June 1986. For 1987 Yugo America sold about 49,000 of its boxy little minicars and 36,000 in 1986. Those sales were due largely to its reputation as the cheapest new car in the U.S., a distinction Yugo retains despite an increase last fall that boosted base prices 5.2% to $4,199.
