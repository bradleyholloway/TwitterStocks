 Study on Coffee and Cholesterol Shows Good News for Drip-Filtered Method   By By Jerry E. Bishop, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 1989  That's the implication of a Dutch experiment that found coffee made by steeping the grounds in boiling water tended to raise blood cholesterol levels. In contrast, coffee brewed by dripping hot water on the grounds and then through a paper filter had almost no effect on blood cholesterol levels.  The Dutch experiment is the second reported in the last 10 days linking an increase in blood cholesterol levels to specific kinds of coffee. Last week, researchers at Stanford University reported an experiment in which decaffeinated coffee raised cholesterol levels in volunteers whereas ordinary coffee containing caffeine left cholesterol levels unchanged. (Both types of coffee were brewed using the drip-filtered method.)
