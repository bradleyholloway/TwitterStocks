ALBANY, April 4â€” The New York State Democratic Committee prayed for President Reagan's quick recovery, then assailed his economic program and ended its meeting with a resolution of sympathy for the President, his press secretary, James S. Brady, and the two lawenforcement officers shot Monday.  The state chairman, Dominic J. Baranello, asked the 200 or so committee members gathered at the Convention Center near the State Capitol on Tuesday to join in a moment of silent prayer.  Then, Mr. Baranello assailed Mr. Reagan's budget proposals for, he said, making ''the American dream unattainable'' for ''tens of millions of Americans.''
