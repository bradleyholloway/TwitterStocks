 Airports to Check More Bags by Hand   By By Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2002  A law passed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks requires the TSA to deploy bomb-detection equipment at all 429 U.S. commercial airports by year's end. But the size of the automated machines the TSA is using -- some as big as sport-utility vehicles and weighing several tons -- have led some airports to ask Congress for an extension, citing potential flight delays and long lines during the holiday travel season.  TSA officials said they are developing advice for passengers who plan to fly during the holiday season. The percentage of bags that will need to be searched by hand isn't clear because the TSA hasn't publicly specified what methods it will use to inspect luggage at each airport, which will vary according to facility layout. In addition to ordering 1,100 automated machines, which look for bombs by analyzing the density of objects inside luggage, the TSA also plans to employ hand-held devices that are used to detect explosive residue on the inside and outside of luggage.
