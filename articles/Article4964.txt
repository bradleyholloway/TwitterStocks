 U.K. Boeing Crash Prompts Inspection For Planes in U.S.   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1989  The action is in response to the Sunday crash of a British Midland Boeing 737-400, which killed 44 people. Accident investigators are focusing on the possibility that the pilot, who was severely injured in the accident, erroneously shut down the right engine on the twin-engine plane on the flight from London to Belfast, Northern Ireland. Evidence suggests it was the left engine that malfunctioned. Investigators say, however, they haven't determined definitively that the right engine was working properly when it was shut down.
