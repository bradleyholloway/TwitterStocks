 Investors' Group to Build Steel Mill   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2005  "It's an ideal location from a customer standpoint," said John Correnti, former CEO of Charlotte, N.C., Nucor Corp., who will be the president and CEO of the new company, SteelCorr Inc.  Russian steelmaker OAO Severstal Group is investing about $200 million in the project along with other large investors such as General Electric Co.'s GE Capital, said Mr. Correnti, who hoped to close financing for the deal on Friday. Severstal, in 2003, purchased a steel plant in Dearborn, Mich., from Rouge Industries Inc. and has continued to expand its presence in the U.S. with joint ventures for steelmaking and raw-materials assets. Severstal executives could not be reached for comment.  Some analysts also caution that it is not an easy time to build a new steel mill in an industry given to volatile swings in supply and demand as well as prices. Mr. Correnti points out, however, that the U.S. consumes roughly 130 million tons of steel a year and produces about only 100 million tons.
