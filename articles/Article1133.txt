 Forex View: Carry-Trade Warnings From G-7 May Lift Yen   By Hannon, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2007  The G-7's final communique noted Japan's recovery is "on track and is expected to continue." G-7 members said they "are confident that the implications of these developments will be recognized by market participants and will be incorporated in their assessments of risks."  "We want to strictly stick to one language," German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck said. "It's the common view of finance ministers and central bankers that markets should be aware of risks stemming from one-sided bets, particularly on foreign-exchange markets. This addresses the problem linked in particular to carry trades."  Japanese Minister of Finance Koji Omi added his voice to the chorus. "Market participants ought to be aware that acting in one direction could bring a risk," he said, referring to some traders' view that yen weakness is a sure bet.
