 Don't Split the Ninth Circuit!   By Alex Kozinski and Sidney R. Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2004  In a surprise move before the Nov. 2 election, a closely divided House approved a floor amendment offered by Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho that would split the Ninth Circuit into three smaller circuits. The new Ninth would consist of California and Hawaii, plus Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. A new Twelfth Circuit would comprise Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and Montana, and a new Thirteenth Circuit would consist of Washington, Oregon and Alaska. All these states and territories make up the current Ninth Circuit. We are reliably informed that the Senate may take up the bill in its rump session, scheduled to start on Nov. 16.  Splitting the circuit would hurt the public in other ways. People and businesses make decisions with an eye toward legal consequences, so they need a clearly established body of law. Today, a Ninth Circuit decision is binding in nine Western states. After the split, a decision of the new Ninth Circuit will leave the law unclear in the seven states of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Circuits. To get the law settled for all these states, the same issue would have to be decided by the two new circuits, which could take years. More circuits also means more conflicts in the law, increasing the burden on the Supreme Court to set matters straight.  The argument that the Ninth Circuit should nonetheless be split relies almost entirely on its size -- and, indeed, the Ninth is the largest of the federal circuits, as it has been for almost a century. But big doesn't mean inefficient, as we know from the performance of giant corporations such as Microsoft and Wal-Mart. Indeed, size brings into play economies of scale, so the Ninth offers innovative and valuable services to the public that smaller circuits cannot afford.
