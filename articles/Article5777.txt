 Rural Areas Are Offered Fiber Cable   By By Rob Eure, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1999  The Bonneville Power Administration is offering to provide rural communities in Washington with ultra-cheap fiber-optic cable -- a move that is being embraced by the communities but criticized by telephone companies.  The Portland-based federal agency, which is laying thousands of miles of lines in the state as it upgrades its communications system, is offering to lease extra capacity to public utility districts in sparsely populated areas for $5 a mile. While the price is a bargain, business and civic leaders say what's more important is that the fiber will be available at all, as the private sector is years away from even starting to wire rural Washington with high-speed lines.  "It appears that Bonneville and the local public utilities are getting ready to build a second phone system in rural Washington," says Richard Potter, manager of state affairs for Everett-based GTE Northwest Inc., a unit of the Dallas company. "We welcome competition, but if the PUDs are going to build this system using electric-ratepayer money, we have an issue with whether this is a level playing field."
