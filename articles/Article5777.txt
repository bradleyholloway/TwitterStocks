 ADM director Ross Johnson spouts off on FBI inquiry, Whitacre and forgery   By Burton, Thomas M; Gibson, Richard, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1995  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co's board, already under fire from some big shareholders, is being criticized again because of flippant remarks by board member F. Ross Johnson about a federal investigation of the giant grain processor. Johnson, in an informal session with students of Emory University's business school, was critical of the FBI and Mark Whitacre, former ADM executive, who was used by the FBI as an undercover operative.
