 Outlook Is Dreary as Apartment Owners Gather   By By Ray A. Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2003  So-called absorption of apartments, or new rentals, fell to 3,341 units in the fourth quarter from 20,612 in the third quarter. For the year, absorption was negative, with 10,349 fewer units occupied. That followed negative absorption of 15,865 units in 2001. It was the first time absorption was negative for two consecutive years since Reis began tracking occupancy in 1980.  As a result, Reis expects to lower its 2003 forecast for absorption to 72,000 units from its earlier estimate of 78,000, says Lloyd Lynford, chief executive of Reis. The firm now expects the vacancy rate will rise to 6.7% by the end of this year, up from Reis's previous forecast of 6.5%, and rents will rise 0.9%, compared with the previous estimate of 1.5%.
