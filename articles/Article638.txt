 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Injustice at Justice   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1985  Last week William Bradford Reynolds, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and now the Reagan administration's nominee for the higher post of associate attorney general, underwent his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Early press reports of the hearings said that Mr. Reynolds had escaped the usual Washington-style attacks on his integrity and fitness for office. "How nice," we thought. How wrong we were. Now it turns out that the Reynolds hearings will be reopened next week, because some critics are saying that he has not been telling the committee the truth.  In last week's hearings, some senators asked Mr. Reynolds about two voting-rights matters of some two to three years ago in which his staff lawyers initially recommended government intervention but he decided against it. When presidential appointees exercise this sort of discretion, congressional scandal-hunters salivate. Mr. Reynolds said that one factor in his decisions was information he had gathered through discussions with attorneys for or other representatives of minority interests seeking government intervention.  Sen. Charles Mathias, a liberal Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote to the committee chairman to get the hearings reopened. Mr. Mathias cited "significant questions" that had been raised about Mr. Reynolds's record. In preparing his letter, the senator did not think it necessary to call Mr. Reynolds or anyone else at the Justice Department to get a full sense of just how significant those questions were.
