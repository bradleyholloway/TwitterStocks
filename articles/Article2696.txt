 Keep a firm grip on the language   By Kerwick, Donald P, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1995  Donald P. Kerwick responds to Mark Yost's Feb 21, 1995 story "Revving and Racing on a Frozen Lake," saying the editor who approved the term "vice grip" should have his head squeezed in a vise until he admits that, in editing, carelessness is the worst vice.
