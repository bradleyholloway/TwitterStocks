 Many Would Pay to Better Environment   By By Mitchel Benson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2000  The Californians and the Environment survey, conducted by the independent Public Policy Institute of California and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a private philanthropic foundation in Los Altos, also reports that Californians -- by a 58% to 37% margin -- would support local initiatives to slow the pace of development in their city or community, "even if this meant having less economic growth."  To be sure, the survey offers indications that Californians aren't committed to the environment at any cost. Asked to choose between two values -- individuals' rights to do what they want with their land and government's right to regulate residential and commercial development for "the common good" -- Californians favor individual property rights by 54% to 42%.  "For Californians to [agree to] make such sacrifices tells us a lot about the degree to which they are concerned -- that what's going on in the environment today directly affects their health and well-being," says Mark Baldassare, survey director and senior fellow at the San Francisco-based think tank. "This concern goes beyond just sort of an interest. It goes beyond preference."
