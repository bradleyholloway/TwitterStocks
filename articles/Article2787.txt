 Angst and Abundance   By By Daniel J. Silver, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2000  To the first question -- concerning income inequality and the knowledge gap -- Mr. [Dinesh D'Souza] gives a qualified "no." He may be characterized as a compassionate libertarian: He feels the pain of the less fortunate, but he is a firm believer in the "trickle down" theory of social welfare. In fact, his title gives away the punch line: Prosperity is the greatest social virtue mankind has known, for it makes possible the alleviation of suffering and want, which is a precondition of moral advancement. Mr. D'Souza observes, rightly, that technological capitalism has in fact met even the redistributive stricture of the liberal philosopher John Rawls. It has bettered the lives of the least well off in improving the lot of those at the top.  When he comes to questions about growing materialism and the implications of biotechnology, Mr. D'Souza acknowledges that libertarian arguments are less satisfying. Nonetheless, his heart is still with the "party of yeah." In his history of Western values, Mr. D'Souza describes the origins of the "party of nah" in ancient philosophy, which treasured moral excellence and disdained commerce and technology -- prejudices picked up and amplified by the Judeo-Christian tradition.  Even so, in his final and best chapter, Mr. D'Souza assails what he sees as the antihumanism of the most extreme exponents of biotechnology. While Mr. D'Souza countenances cloning in some circumstances, he regards as profoundly immoral and un-American the desire to alter one's children's genes to make them "better." This eugenic enthusiasm, for him, smacks of an undoing of the basic American creed, a denial of autonomy for the sake of designer kids who flesh out fantasies of power over life itself.
