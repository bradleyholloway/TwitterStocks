 Letters to the Editor: Tax Nightmare on Dream Street   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 1993  Your June 1 editorial "A Tax on Dreams" hit the nail squarely. I am one of the "rich" that Bill Clinton's tax proposal is going to "soak."  Let me tell you how I got "rich." Twenty-three years ago I left a job in New York and reduced my income of $16,000 a year in order to start my own business in Stamford, Conn. I had a mortgage and three children, but I believed in America, the land of opportunity.  I spent a week in Washington at an industry conference in May and was told that Mr. Clinton's new tax bill would bump my taxes to 35%. Since Edson is a Sub "S" Corporation, if the company's profit plus my salary equals $250,000 or more I will be hit with a millionaire's surtax of 10%, plus a 1.5% Medicare surcharge. This equals a 46.5% tax rate and an increase of 13.5%. Who are they kidding? If Edson shows a profit of 3%-4%, I will get hit with a millionaire's surtax? Along with many small businessmen, I am a millionaire on the liability side of the balance sheet only, but Mr. Clinton doesn't seem to grasp this.
