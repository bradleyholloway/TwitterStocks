 Brazil's Economy Shrank Just 1% in Quarter; Benchmark Interest Rates Are Cut Yet Again   By By Peter Fritsch, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1999  SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Continuing to pleasantly surprise market bulls, Brazil reported a smaller-than-expected contraction in its economy in the first three months of the year and implemented yet another cut in benchmark interest rates.  The government said the economy shrank by 1% in the first quarter compared with the same period a year earlier and actually grew 1.02% from last year's fourth quarter. The build-up in preparation for the record Brazilian agricultural harvest now under way appears to have been reponsible for tempering the economic shrinkage. The agricultural sector grew 9.2% in the quarter, while industrial production slipped 4.55% and services fell 0.2%, according to the government.  Brazil's economic performance was "stronger than I thought it would be and I'm one of the more bullish guys on Wall Street," said Ernest W. Brown, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.'s chief economist for Latin America. Mr. Brown had predicted a first quarter economic contraction of 2.5%, while others had predicted an economic slide of as much as 4%. He said government spending to stimulate the economy in spite of Brazil's large budget deficit probably played a role in keeping the economy from sliding further.
