 White House Gets Behind Effort to Shift Oversight of Bell System Breakup to FCC   By By Mary Lu Carnevale and Peter Truell, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 1989  Top policy makers in the Bush administration have agreed to push legislation to shift jurisdiction over the Bell System breakup decree from a federal court to the Federal Communications Commission.  A move to the FCC could eventually allow the regional Bell companies to enter such lucrative information services businesses as electronic yellow pages, stock quotes and sports information. It also could also free the seven Bell companies to engage in manufacturing telephone equipment. But the Bells, which provide monopoly local phone service, aren't likely to get permission anytime soon to enter the long-distance market.  Since the court-supervised breakup of the Bell System Jan. 1, 1984, the seven companies have been lobbying hard for legislation to lift the restrictions on their businesses. The decree bars them from entering the long-distance and manufacturing businesses and from providing the content of information services. The Bells have argued that Judge Harold Greene, who oversees the decree, has been too restrictive and that the process of obtaining waivers moves much more slowly than the rapidly changing telecommunications marketplace.
