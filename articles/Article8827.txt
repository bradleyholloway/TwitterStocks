 Microsoft to Buy WebTV for $425 Million --- Start-Up's Internet Devices Are to Be Used to Speed Advent of Digital TV   By By David Bank, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1997  The slim black boxes based on WebTV's technology and produced under license by Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV, allow users to retrieve electronic mail and surf the World Wide Web on their current television sets using a remote-control device. Because most users are able to get the product, which retails for about $300, connected and working in about 15 minutes, WebTV is considered one way to bring the Internet to the majority of Americans who don't own a personal computer.  The cost of the components in WebTV will fall to below $50 by the end of next year, said Steve Perlman, WebTV's president and chief executive. At that point, he expects the capabilities to be built directly into television sets and said Microsoft's marketing clout would aid that effort.  WebTV doesn't currently utilize Microsoft's Windows operating system, or Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, but will integrate the technologies next year, according to Craig Mundie, Microsoft's senior vice president for consumer platforms. The devices will use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, which was introduced last year for use in hand-held computers. Microsoft plans to use the operating system in a range of non-PC devices, from cellular telephones to pagers.
