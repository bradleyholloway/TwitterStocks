 Random Drug Test For Rail Workers Clears House Unit   By By Lauren Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 9, 1989  The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted to require random and pre-employment drug testing of railroad workers.  The measure immediately plunged into controversy, as Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said the bill wasn't tough enough and told the panel he would recommend that President Bush veto it.  Unions, on the other hand, have opposed random testing on constitutional grounds. George Lietz, president of the Transportation Workers Union, wouldn't comment directly on the bill, but said he is against random testing unless there is "probable or reasonable" cause.
