 Denver Airport Buys Insurance For Offering --- Interested Fund Managers Play Down SEC Probe, Focus on Enhancement   By By Lynn K. Adler, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1995  The bonds will be rated Triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, thanks to MBIA Insurance Corp.'s backing. Underlying ratings aren't as sweet: Baa by Moody's and triple-B by S&P, raised from junk level double-B in late October.  At least five Franklin funds will consider buying the new Denver airport bonds, says Andy Jennings, vice president and portfolio manager at Franklin Advisers, a unit of Franklin Resources Inc. in San Mateo, Calif.  "We were early investors in Denver airport issues," he says. That meant deep price erosion during a 16-month opening delay and rapid rally when the opening became real. "Once insurance became available" after the airport opened about eight months ago, that "reconfirmed to early investors their feelings that everything was going to be fine."
