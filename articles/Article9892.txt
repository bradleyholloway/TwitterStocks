 Outside Audit: Oil Firms Want SEC to Loosen Reserves Rules   By Levine, Steve, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2006  Securities analysts don't necessarily agree with the SEC's conservative guidance on how to account for oil and gas in the ground, but they also tend to doubt the companies' optimistic forecasts of their stores. Matthew Simmons, a Houston-based energy investment banker and among a crowd of forecasters who believe the world is running short on oil, says the SEC rules should be even stricter.  An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the agency's rules, but the oil industry shouldn't expect large changes soon: John Heine, the spokesman, said the issue isn't on the SEC's current agenda.  For example, Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's biggest oil company, last year said that its own calculations showed it had succeeded in adding 1.8 billion "oil-equivalent" barrels to replace the 1.6 billion barrels it had pumped in 2004. In other words, by Exxon's calculation, it had replaced more than 112% of the oil and gas it had pumped out of the ground the year before. But using the SEC rules, the oil giant actually fell behind, replacing only 1.3 billion barrels, or 83%.
