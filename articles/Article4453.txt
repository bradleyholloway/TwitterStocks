 When Prices Fell, Was It a 'Cascade'?   By By G. J. Santoni, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1988  One year after the stock-market crash, the rules of the New York trading game will return to pretty much what they were on that Oct. 19. Due to expire on the anniversary date is the Big Board's "collar" on computerized trading, one of the primary recommendations of the Brady Commission that investigated the event.  The commission suggested the stock-market panic is best explained by the "cascade theory," which argues that the source of the crash was "mechanical, price-insensitive selling" by institutions using portfolio-insurance strategies. In an effort to liquidate the equity exposure of their portfolios quickly, these institutions sold stock index futures contracts in the Chicago market. Such sales lowered the price of futures contracts relative to the price of an equivalent basket of stocks in the New York cash market. This induced arbitragers to purchase futures contracts in the Chicago market (which, in their view, were undervalued) and sell the underlying stocks in the New York cash market (which, in their view, were overvalued relative to futures). Cash prices in New York declined as a result.  According to the commission, the fall in cash prices triggered a further selling wave in the Chicago futures market by portfolio insurers that index arbitragers, again, transmitted to the New York cash market. The process repeated itself time after time, with the declines in cash and futures prices becoming ever larger as they tumbled over each other.
