 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2007  Mobile-phone operator 3, owned by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., and Internet-calling company [Skype], owned by eBay Inc., are developing a handset that will let customers make free Internet calls outside the home, a Skype spokeswoman said. Until now, most Skype calls have been made from computers attached to fixed-line Internet connections tied to a home or office. On Monday, eBay said it will take a $1.4 billion third-quarter charge related to Skype. For the new device, 3 is working with an unnamed handset manufacturer.
