OAKLAND, Calif.â€” Damaso Garcia sparked a two-run 12th inning with his fifth straight single and Garth Iorg and Lloyd Moseby doubled in runs as Toronto dealt Oakland its fifth straight loss.  With one out in the 12th, Garcia beat out an infield hit and went to second on Dave McKay's throwing error at second base.  Iorg, batting for Rance Mulliniks, doubled down the left-field line to drive in Garcia. Moseby followed with a double to right to score Iorg.  Joey McLaughlin (5-3) earned the victory in relief of Jim Clancy, who allowed only three hits while striking out 10 in 10 innings. Toronto tied the score, 1-1, in the seventh when Ernie Whitt singled, went to second on Alfredo Griffin's grounder and scored when Garcia singled.  Oakland took a 1-0 lead in the fourth. Dwayne Murphy, given a life when Mulliniks dropped his foul pop, walked. He advanced to third on a wild pitch and a flyball and scored when Wayne Gross blooped a double that fell 10 feet onto the outfield grass behind third base.
