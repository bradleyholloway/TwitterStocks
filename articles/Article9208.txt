 AOL and Time Warner Move to Cut Short EU Merger Review   By By Philip Shishkin, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2000  Antitrust scrutiny of the AOL-Time Warner deal is further complicated by Time Warner's tie-up with EMI Group PLC, which would reduce the world's Big Five music companies to the Big Four. The commission is investigating the deals separately and is expected to open a detailed, four-month inquiry into the $20 billion Time Warner-EMI deal a week from today.  AOL declined to comment on the ongoing inquiries other than to reiterate its intention to provide nondiscriminatory access to AOL-Time Warner networks. Time Warner officials were unavailable to comment.
