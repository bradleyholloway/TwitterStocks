 Conferees Agree on the Renewal Of Nuclear-Plant Liability Limits   By By John J. Fialka, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  The conferees appeared to be headed toward a minimal improvement in automobile and truck-fleet efficiency standards, a House provision that would raise it by about one mile per gallon. Noting that at the same time President Bush was making his case before the U.N. for attacking Iraq, Alys Campaigne, legislative director for the National Resources Defense Council, complained of a "disconnect between what's happening with our foreign policy and what's not happening with regard to reducing our dependence on oil."  On less controversial fronts, the conferees adopted a compromise that would require natural-gas pipeline operators to inspect pipelines for safety defects every 10 years. The legislation, drawn up after a series of pipeline explosions, requires older and more problematic pipelines to be inspected within the first five years, with inspections for other pipelines following that. Pipeline owners are then required to report the results to the Department of Transportation.
