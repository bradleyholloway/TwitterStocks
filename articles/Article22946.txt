 Miracle in Mississippi   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2002  The state legislature in Jackson voted to tighten rules on where cases can be tried, cap punitive damage awards, limit the state's joint-and-several liability rule so that companies with little blame can't be soaked as deep pockets, bar advertising by attorneys who aren't licensed to practice in Mississippi and slap a fine on the filing of frivolous lawsuits. That's not bad for government work, especially in a state renowned as the home of "jackpot justice."  Pressure for reform had been building for years, as the state became a haven for class-action suits from all over America. In Jefferson County, the number of litigants in asbestos-related cases alone exceeded the county's population. At least seven jury awards have topped $100 million in recent years, including one in which $150 million was awarded to six plaintiffs who claimed that asbestos exposure might someday make them ill. Doctors began fleeing Mississippi as 71 companies stopped writing insurance in the state.
