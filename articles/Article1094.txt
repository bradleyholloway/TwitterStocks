 Stocks Gain 7.12 Points to 2133.36 Despite Size of August Trade Gap   By By David Wilson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1988  While the trade deficit of $12.18 billion reported for August was larger than expected, traders said the market's sharp decline ahead of the report had prepared it for that possibility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 30.23 points Wednesday, with concern about the data and resulting weakness in bonds and the dollar cited as major factors in the decline.  Stocks dipped slightly at the opening in response to the trade data before rebounding to higher levels amid bargain-hunting and ongoing takeover speculation. The Dow Jones industrials ended the day with a gain of 7.12 at 2133.36  The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report called for an August deficit of $11.3 billion, but rumors about a possible $12 billion gap had circulated in the market. Traders said the fact that the actual figure exceeded that estimate only slightly sparked some buying interest.
