 Labor: Leery of Strikes, More Workers Stage Sickouts   By By Emily Nelson and J.C. Conklin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1999  Such job actions, while not yet widespread, have been occurring more frequently in recent years. It's a tactic particularly favored by public employees, who face stiff legal barriers against strikes. For example, municipal police departments have had outbreaks of "blue flu" over the years. And last winter, the 21,000-student Racine, Wis., school district was closed for several days when hundreds of teachers called in sick after contract negotiations collapsed.  But sickouts are also increasingly a resort of private-sector workers who fear a full-scale walkout could cost them their jobs. "There's a general trend now for workers to try to win back what they lost in the early 1980s and 1990s, but they don't want to strike," says Greg Tarpinian, executive director of Labor Research Association, a New York union consulting concern. "Sickouts are becoming more common."  Prof. (Marina) Angel notes that sickouts are prohibited in most circumstances by the Railway Labor Act, which covers airlines. But the American pilots' sickout that is disrupting travel plans for so many over the long Presidents' Day weekend isn't all that unusual. In December, Trans World Airlines was forced to cancel more than 240 flights after flight attendants engaged in what the company described as a Christmas-week sickout during contract negotiations, although the attendants union denied the accusation.
