 Leading the News: UAL Workers Lose Majority Rights As Stake Declines   By By Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2003  UAL subsequently told State Street it could sell an additional 13 million shares without shifting ownership of the company away from the employees. Last week United received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that State Street could sell an additional 3.9 million UAL shares in the ESOP without jeopardizing those tax benefits. The additional selling last week lowered employees' overall holdings -- in the ESOP and in some other plans -- to less than 20% of UAL's 116 million shares outstanding.  The ESOP trustee, State Street Bank & Trust Co., began selling shares in the plan last fall, when it appeared that UAL was headed for Chapter 11. State Street unloaded 24 million UAL shares and wanted to sell the remaining 33 million. But when UAL filed for bankruptcy-court protection in December, the judge issued an order preventing large shareholders from buying or selling UAL stock in order to avoid a change in control, a move that would have restricted UAL's eligibility to make future use of tax credits from prior years.
