 Dollar Gains on Yen, Euro on Strong U.S. Report   By Norman, Laurence, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2005  The dollar lifted to a 16-month high versus the yen and came close to its 2005 high versus the euro, as the U.S. currency gained from strong U.S. data, Japan's weaker-than-expected tankan business survey and a climb in Treasury yields.  That beat market expectations of 52.0 and suggested the U.S. economy had weathered the impact of Hurricane Katrina better than some had feared. The ISM number follows an above-expectation reading on the September Chicago Purchasing Management Index on Friday. The data sent Treasury yields sharply higher, further increasing the interest-rate advantage of U.S. assets over their European and Japanese counterparts.  "The pressure seems to be building up" on the euro. "You can see that the [euro] bounces off $1.19 aren't very convincing at all," he said, "while the yen has been unable to get back below 114 yen."
