 KKR's Seaman Misses Debt Payment; Auditor Questions Retailer's Survival   By By Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1989  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said Seaman Furniture Co., which KKR bought in a $360 million leveraged buy-out in 1987, didn't pay its August interest bill and needs to restructure its debt.  The disclosure by KKR and Seaman Chairman Morton Seaman represents a black eye for KKR, the largest LBO firm, as it prepares to decide whether to make a bid for UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, the nation's second-largest airline.  In a letter dated Aug. 11, Mr. Seaman notified holders of Seaman's 15% subordinated debentures, issued to holders of Seaman common stock in the buy-out Nov. 16, 1987, that Seaman has begun talks with its banks to restructure its debt. KKR wants to offer holders of those bonds "some other type of security." Seaman didn't make a $3.1 million interest payment in August.
