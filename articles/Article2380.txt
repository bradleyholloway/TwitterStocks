 Suharto Vows To Cooperate With the IMF   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  The 76-year-old Indonesian leader's assurances Wednesday morning to Defense Secretary William Cohen and Tuesday to visiting Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers were welcomed by the officials. "It is very clear President Suharto recognizes the need to take strong steps of the kind that are under discussion with the IMF," Mr. Summers said. It wasn't clear that a new deal would be substantially stronger than one struck in October that the Indonesian government hasn't kept.
