 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  For 2008, the basic standard deduction for married couples filing jointly is expected to rise to $10,900. That's a $200 increase from $10,700 for 2007. For most people who are single, the standard deduction will increase to $5,450 from $5,350.  Many other tax numbers will change, thanks to inflation. But others won't, even though they're indexed for inflation, because inflation wasn't high enough to affect them.
