 Britain's Ruling Conservatives Confront Their Iron Lady's Flagging Popularity   By By James M. Perry, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1985  Reelected in a landslide two years ago, she talks about becoming the nation's grandmother and serving for another decade or more. So these should be balmy days for Mrs. Thatcher, who is surely Britain's best-known leader since Winston Churchill.  "We have to recognize that the policies don't seem to have dealt with our problems," says Edward Heath, the former Tory prime minister and no friend of Mrs. Thatcher. "People just seem to be growing tired of her," says Peter Riddell, political editor of the Financial Times and author of a careful and often sympathetic analysis of Mrs. Thatcher's first six years in office. "They believe she has failed to deliver the goods."  A faltering Conservative government, led by an increasingly unpopular prime minister, is bad news for the United States. Britain is the U.S.'s loyal partner and Mrs. Thatcher and President Reagan maintain a high regard for one another. The alternative to this woman and this government is Neil Kinnock and the Labor Party, who vow they will remove all nuclear weapons from Britain and send home the Americans who operate them, or David Steel and David Owen, leaders of the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance, who are still struggling to put together a cohesive program.
