 Family Finance: The Nation's Least-Affordable Housing Markets   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2005  As home prices rise, many first-time buyers are finding they don't have enough cash for a down payment. Some turn to relatives for help. Many others are opting for 100% financing. In Jersey City, N.J., roughly three-quarters of first-time buyers put down 5% or less of the purchase price, says Laura Skolar, manager of Century 21 Plaza Realty Corp. "If we get someone coming in with 10% or 20% down, we feel like we've hit pay dirt," she says.  Len Filippoff opted for 100% financing when he purchased a $509,000 three-bedroom home in Salinas last summer. "When prices started going up, we started to panic," says Mr. Filippoff, a manager for Costco Wholesale. "We thought we were going to be priced out of the market. We had some money saved, but we didn't have the 10% most lenders were looking for." To help keep his monthly payments in check, Mr. Filippoff also chose an interest-only mortgage.  In some high-cost markets, buyers trading up are also feeling the pinch. "We're seeing an awful lot of well-qualified move-up buyers who are stretching," says John Karevoll, a housing analyst for DataQuick Information Systems in La Jolla, Calif. "Instead of putting 20% down, they are putting 10% down. Instead of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, they're taking a seven-year adjustable."
