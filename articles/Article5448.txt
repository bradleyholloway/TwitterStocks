 Computer Security Becomes Biometric With Print Matching --- Oracle Is Launching System, Designed by Indentix Inc., That Can Finger Hackers   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1997  Fingerprinting is the latest technology to be marketed as a means of keeping hackers out of sensitive corporate databases. Oracle Corp., the Redwood Shores, Calif., database software company, today is announcing that for about $500, its customers will be able to buy a new palm-sized device that will compare users' prints to sets stored in a central file before letting them log on to the machine.  The unit is made by Identix Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., and represents yet another escalation in the battle aimed at keeping computer trespassers at bay. Passwords, the first line of defense, can be stolen or cracked. And while many companies currently use credit-card sized "smart cards" that must be inserted into a scanner along with a password, those cards, too, can be stolen.  Actually, companies in the security field don't use the term "fingerprinting," with all its police lineup connotations. The preferred term is "biometric authentication." And it's a booming field, said Bob Frank, an analyst at SRI Consulting, a subsidiary of SRI International, a Menlo Park, Calif., research organization.
