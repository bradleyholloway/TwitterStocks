 Biotechnology: New Calgene tomato might have tasted just as good without genetic alteration   By McMurray, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1993  Calgene Inc expects final FDA approval for its Flavr Savr tomatoes in the spring of 1993. The tomatoes are the product of genetic engineering which reverses the softening effect of one of the fruit's genes, allowing it to ripen longer on the vine. However, a number of biotech experts claim that genetics has little to do with the Flavr Savr, instead attributing garden variety breeding, marketing and special handling to its premium quality. A table lists a sampling of genetically altered foods and when they are expected to hit the market.
