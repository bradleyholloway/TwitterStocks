 Coca-Cola to Expand Its Entertainment Line --- Firm to Bolster TV Programming After a Few Films Flop   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1985  Columbia and Embassy combined are second only to MCA Inc.'s powerful Universal Studios in total television production and syndication market share. This fall, Columbia will have 5 1/2 hours of network prime time, including a new series on each of the three networks and a new mid-season half-hour show, while Embassy will have three shows renewed by the networks, one new series and a miniseries.  But the purchase of Embassy and Tandem is just "a good first step," says Francis T. Vincent, Columbia chairman and head of Coke's entertainment sector. The soft-drink giant is prepared again to use its stock for more entertainment acquisitions. And while Coke is considering such businesses as music publishing and broadcasting, "television is where we want to put most of our capital," says Richard Gallop, Columbia's president and chief operating officer. He won't identify potential candidates, but Coke is said by industry executives to be talking with -- among others -- Aaron Spelling Productions, producer of such television hits as "Dynasty" and "Hotel."  Because Columbia movies are financed mostly by pay-television and home-video agreements that guarantee certain payments, box-office flops can actually wind up breaking even or making a profit. As a result of these arrangements and television profit -- television alone contributed over half of Columbia's operating profit last year -- Columbia executives predict the studio will meet or exceed its target of 15% to 20% growth from last year's $121 million operating profit. For the first half, "we're on course, notwithstanding disappointments in our picture business," Mr. Gallop says.
