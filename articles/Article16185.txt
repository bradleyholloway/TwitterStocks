 Bookmarks   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2002  Although these family members have benefited richly from the firm's success, they force a merger that [Gary Kimball] opposes because they dislike his labor practices in the developing world. Ironically -- and one can see Mr. [Louis Auchincloss] smiling slyly -- the company's new owners realize that they can't fix the firm's problems by themselves and hire Gary back for his "expertise in labor management."  Slavishly following the dictates of Ezra Pound, John worships at the altar of modernism; his gods, a motley crew, are T.S. Eliot, Flaubert and Henry Miller. One might, indeed, describe him as a beneficiary -- or victim -- of trickle-down aestheticism. For by the time these notions have reached his oversimplifying mind, they've been rendered mildly ludicrous: "He may not believe in God, but he does believe in love," Mr. [Coetzee] writes of his protagonist. "The beloved, the destined one, will see at once through the odd and even dull exterior he presents to the fire that burns within him."  Since Enron, following the money trail has become a national pastime, but none of the alleged capers of corporate malfeasance can compare to the daring on display in [James Zagel]'s thriller. Judge Paulie Devine hatches a plot to rob the Federal Reserve, in cahoots with a fireman-cum-arsonist; a tough chick-cum-security guard; and her husband, an electrician who looks like a Calvin Klein model.
