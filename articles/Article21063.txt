 Two Rival Suitors for Viacom Sweeten Bids Again; Fight Expected to Continue   By By Peter W. Barnes, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 1987  A special committee of directors was meeting late last night to consider both revised bids, and an announcement from the committee was expected as early as this morning. A management group increased its offer to about $3.23 billion from an earlier $3.1 billion. Arsenal Holdings Inc., a unit of National Amusements Inc., a Dedham, Mass.-based theater chain operator, increased its bid to about $3.35 billion from $3.2 billion.  Wall Street executives said they expect the fight for the entertainment, broadcasting and cable concern to continue. Several executives speculate that Sumner Redstone, president and owner of National Amusements, which already owns 19.6% of Viacom shares, could increase National's bid again or launch a tender offer for shares National doesn't own if the committee of directors rejects his offer.  The latest round of bidding marks the fourth revised offer from management and the third revised bid from National Amusements since the seesaw battle for Viacom began with management's first proposal in September. The special committee of directors already accepted an earlier management bid and previously rejected a National Amusements offer.
