 Media & Marketing -- Advertising: Faster, Higher Ad Sales for Olympics; NBC Says Pace of Spending Beats 2002, 2000 Games; Network Aims for $1 Billion   By White, Erin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2004  "It's not the ideal time for any advertiser," says Dominic Fawcett, managing partner at WPP Group's MindShare Worldwide in London.

"The tone has to be more discreet," says Petros Karachalios, Coke's general manager for the Olympics project team for the Athens games. "The heritage of Greece is the heritage of Greece and not a marketing tool."
