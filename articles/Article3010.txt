 Letters to the Editor: Face-Off on the `Long, Wild' Line of Control   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2002  Gen. [Musharraf] has been, as your editorial admits, intimitely involved in Pakistan's decade-long proxy war, sending jihadis to attack civilians and others, not just in Kashmir but throughout India. India, thus far, has not retaliated but asked Pakistan to stop exporting terrorism before the two countries can talk.  India knows Kashmir is sine qua non for a stable relationship with Pakistan, as the "long and wild" Line of Control cannot be hermetically sealed. Rather, India has cynically exploited the rhetoric of George Bush's war against terrorism to rouse nationalistic indignation against Kashmiri separatists with assertions such as India's "moral and legal" right to attack Pakistan over "terrorism."
