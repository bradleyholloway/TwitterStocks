 Wendy's Cites Progress as Investors Press for Change   By Gibson, Richard, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 2005  Questioning the size of the stake in [Wendy]'s disclosed by owners of the Arby's fast-food chain earlier in the day, Wendy's seemingly sought to brush aside their various suggestions to enhance shareholder value. Among those suggestions was an immediate total spinoff of Wendy's Canadian coffee-and-doughnut shop chain, Tim Hortons. Wendy's recently filed documents preparing for a public offering of 15% to 18% of the chain.  While the investors' entity, Trian Fund Management L.P., said it held about a 5.5% stake in Wendy's, the hamburger company noted that Trian's filing showed it owned about 950,000 common shares, or less than 1% of Wendy's stock outstanding. The difference between the numbers apparently reflects options that the Trian group holds.
