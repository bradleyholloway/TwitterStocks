 Procter & Gamble Casts for Hair Dye, but May Hit Snags --- As an Acquisition of Clairol Is Weighed, Observers Say Big Buy Might Be Bad Timing   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2001  P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley is in the midst of cutting 17,400 jobs, shedding big food brands, and playing catch-up to rivals in paper goods. Yet the company is bidding about $4 billion to $4.5 billion to buy Clairol from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. in what would be P&G's largest-ever acquisition. P&G would get a hefty management challenge: integrating Clairol's five factories and marketing the brands, which have been on the auction block since last fall and face tough hair-color competition from rivals L'Oreal SA and Revlon Inc.  Several major investors say they are on the fence about a Clairol acquisition, and P&G would have to sell Wall Street on the strategy. When it contemplated -- but walked away from -- a major pharmaceutical deal in January 2000, P&G's stock was pummeled. A drop in stock price would carry a particular sting now, because it would make cutting jobs harder. Most P&G employees have a large chunk of their retirement savings in P&G stock, and would be less likely to take voluntary early retirement if their nest eggs shrink.  Some see signs P&G is starting to prep the market for an acquisition. In a conference call to discuss P&G's quarterly results last week, Mr. Lafley spoke at length about hair care and beauty care, citing those businesses as successful and further along in a turnaround than other parts of the portfolio. While there has been talk of it swapping health-care brands for Clairol, P&G disclosed in a November Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it isn't considering trading those assets for Clairol. Mr. Lafley also praised the health-care operation last week.
