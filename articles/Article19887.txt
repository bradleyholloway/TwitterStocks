 Havas, Bollore Tension Nears Head; Shareholders' June 9 Vote On Raider's Bid for Seats Could Set Agency's Future   By Steinberg, Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 2005  Mr. [Bollore] has nominated four people to join Havas's board, which now has 13 directors. Three existing directors are up for re-election, while Havas has nominated three more people for election to the board. French law limits the board's size to 18, making it possible that at least two of Mr. Bollore's nominees could be elected along with the company's nominees. To be elected, nominees need at least a majority of votes. Mr. Bollore's spokesman didn't return phone calls.  Havas has struggled to cope with sluggish advertising conditions in recent years. The company's first-quarter revenue fell 7.5%, with sales hurt by the weak U.S. dollar, the effects of an earlier restructuring and a falloff in ad spending in the United Kingdom, one of Havas's main markets. Aggravating its performance has been the loss of Intel's advertising account and media business from Volkswagen. Havas's stock price has suffered in the past couple of years, although it has risen since Mr. Bollore emerged as a major shareholder last fall.  Still, uncertainty about Havas's future isn't good for business, one executive says. "Clients want to know what's going on and new-business prospects are a little cautious, wondering what's happening. It isn't helpful for us," says Ed Eskandarian, Arnold's chairman and CEO.
