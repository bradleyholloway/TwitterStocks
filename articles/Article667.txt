 Intelsat Sets Sales, Long-Term Leases On Satellite System   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 1985  Intelsat, the international telecommunications organization, said it will sell space and offer long-term leases on its international satellite system.  So far, Intelsat mainly has limited its satellite communications service to short-term leases, primarily for seven years, and the service can be preempted in an emergency. The new service that the organization will sell or make available for long-term leases won't be subject to preemption, said Jose Alegrett, an Intelsat deputy director general.
