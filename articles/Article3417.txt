 Samsung to Report Whether Counterintuitive Move Paid Off   By Ramstad, Evan, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  Though the tactic didn't help profit in the first quarter of 2003 compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, it appeared to be quite effective in last year's first quarter. For that period, Samsung, the world's third biggest seller of mobile phones, reported a strong jump in operating profit for its telecommunications unit compared with the fourth quarter of 2003.  The effect of Samsung's first-quarter production jolt on the industry won't be clear until more companies report their results. Indeed, the tactic will have failed if Samsung is forced to throttle back on phone shipments in the second quarter because distributors weren't able to sell the higher volume.  An exception to Samsung's tactic is the U.S., where shipments grew in the fourth quarter and again in the first, says Peter Skarzynski, senior vice president of Samsung's U.S. cellphone division.
