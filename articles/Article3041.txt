 Folks Over 50 Miss Chance to Catch Up in Retirement Plans   By By Bridget O'Brian, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  The regular contribution levels will continue to grow through 2008 when the annual limits will be $5,000 for younger workers and $6,000 for those 50 and older. The catch-up provisions also apply to Simple IRAs, which are retirement plans for small businesses and their employees. (There's no change under the new law as to who is eligible to make tax-deductible contributions to IRAs, which excludes many investors. These investors might use the higher contributions limits to put money into a Roth IRA or, if not eligible for that, a nondeductible IRA.)  Older investors participating in employer-sponsored retirement programs such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s can contribute an extra $1,000 this year, raising the maximum dollar amount to $12,000, under the new tax law. Any investor who is at least 50 in 2002 can make the catch-up contribution. The catch-up amount rises gradually every year until reaching an extra $5,000 deduction a year, for a total contribution of $20,000, in 2006. After that, the amounts go up in increments of $500, indexed to inflation.  That's no small feat for large companies. Changes also have to be made to software, record-keeping systems and Web sites as well. Where you live may also affect whether or not you are able to make catch-up contributions, or more particularly, whether your contributions will be considered tax-deductible on your state taxes. When the U.S. tax law was changed, 10 states had state deduction limits that didn't match the new federal limits for retirement-plan contributions. Eight of them have since changed their laws to get in sync with the feds, according to Milliman USA, a consulting and actuarial firm, leaving Arkansas and North Carolina as the exceptions. Many companies, especially those with employees in multiple states, were waiting for such "conformity" issues to get cleared up before they made any changes in their retirement plans.
