 Buffett Makes The Trains Run; Berkshire's BNSF Stake Gives an Extra Boost To Already Burly Sector   By Karen Richardson and Daniel Machalaba, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2007  The disclosure by Mr. [Warren Buffett]'s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. of its 10.9% stake in BNSF boosted the share price yesterday of the nation's largest railway operator, which has a market value of more than $29 billion. The price of BNSF's stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, rose by $5.36, or 6.5%, to end the session at $88.08. It is up 19.7% since the start of the year and 26.3% since the start of 2006. Berkshire, in its regulatory filing made late Friday, said it bought about 1.65 million shares on April 4 and 5 at prices ranging from about $81.18 to $81.80. It has accumulated a total of about 39 million shares.  Ken Hoexter, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, says that despite the near-term earnings risks, he remains bullish on the group. "Long term, the secular story of pricing and improved returns will drive improved share performance," says Mr. Hoexter, who has a "buy" rating on BNSF's stock and whose firm provides investment-banking services to BNSF and other railroads.  For Berkshire shareholders, the investment was good news, helping to nudge the company's Class A shares up $151 to $109,000 on the Big Board. Shareholders have been waiting for Mr. Buffett to invest more of the $40 billion in cash on Berkshire's balance sheet, most of which has been collecting single-digit interest for the past couple of years.
