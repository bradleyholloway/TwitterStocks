 Burroughs Sees Chip-Plant Cuts Following Merger   By By Richard L. Hudson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 1986  Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp. are considering scaling back their semiconductor operations as part of their plan to merge, Burroughs chairman W. Michael Blumenthal said.  At a news conference here, Mr. Blumenthal said merging the two computer companies would give the new concern excess semiconductor-making capacity. He said a restructuring of one company's operations is a possibility but didn't specify how it might be carried out.  "Loading one semiconductor facility more fully, rather than having two, will allow us to reduce our costs," Mr. Blumenthal said.
