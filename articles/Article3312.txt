 Review / Film: Undersea Drama `U-571' Doesn't Hold Water; Even the Plot is Subpar --- But as Captain of a Disabled U-Boat, McConaughey Rises to Surface; Unexplained `Virgin Suicides'   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 2000  The story doesn't hold water for long. "U-571" soon becomes a succession of tall tales flowing from a secret mission to board a disabled Nazi U-boat and seize an Enigma code machine. (Until the Enigma code was broken -- by the British mathematician Alan Turing -- the German navy sank Allied freighters almost at will.) When the mission goes disastrously wrong -- how could it not, since there's no evidence of any planning -- the Americans must figure out how to repair the Nazi sub and sail it themselves. Some of the undersea action is spectacular and the pounding from depth charges is merciless, but the movie eventually induces numbness, not to mention temporary deafness.  "U-571" was directed and co-written by Jonathan Mostow, whose previous feature was the elegantly spare, quasi-existential thriller "Breakdown." The cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, Jake Weber, Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith and Jack Noseworthy. This time spareness has no place on Mr. Mostow's agenda. "U-571" aspires to be an extravagant action fantasy, and plausibility or historical accuracy be damned. Never mind that the events, as set forth, are fictitious. (It was the British who captured an Enigma machine from a Nazi sub in 1941, before the U.S. entered the war.) Never mind that the Allies in the movie, desperate to crack the refractory code, locate the disabled U-boat by intercepting one of its radio messages to Berlin. (Did I miss something, or did the U-boat captain simply forget to switch his Enigma gizmo on?)
