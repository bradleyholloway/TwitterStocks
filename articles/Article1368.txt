 Ford Motor's Canadian Unit Is Facing Walkout at Midnight in Contract Talks   By By Larry M. Greenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1990  Officials of the Canadian Auto Workers union were continuing to meet with Ford officials last night, but union insiders asserted that there wasn't any chance a new contract could be put together before the strike deadline. A Ford spokesman was more upbeat, but said reaching any agreement at this point would require "damn hard work."  A walkout by Ford's Canadian employees would idle nine of the company's plants in Canada. It also could hurt important Ford operations in the U.S., which depend on parts manufactured in Canada. Ford officials predict a shortage of engines and auto glass from Canada would result in several U.S. operations closing within two weeks of a strike.
