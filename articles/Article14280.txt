 Iran Is Readying Major Offensive On Iraq's Border --- Arab and Western Analysts Cite Buildup by Tehran In Predicting New Strike   By By Youssef M. Ibrahim, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 1986  A major Iranian assault is being readied along several points of the border with Iraq, according to Arab and Western military experts.  Although the sources differ in their estimates of the size, timing and goal of an Iranian offensive, they agree that enough evidence has accumulated to suggest the inevitability of a new Iranian military move against Iraq in their six-year-old war.  While some believe the attack will be timed with the holy day of Ashura, which honors Iran's most celebrated religious martyr, Imam Hussein, on Sept. 15, Iranian leaders have said it could come as late as next March, at the end of the Persian calendar year. Most sources, however, lean to the view that the assault is imminent.
