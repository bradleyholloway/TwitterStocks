 GE Names 3 Executives to Key Positions --- Appointments Seen as Part Of Its Plan to Choose The Successor to Welch   By By Matt Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2000  John G. Rice, also 43, who succeeded Mr. [David L. Calhoun] at GE Transportation in 1997, will take the No. 2 job at GE Power Systems, based in Schenectady, N.Y. Mr. Rice was never considered more than a long shot to succeed Mr. [John F. Welch Jr.], but he is well-liked and considered a rising star within the company. Though GE Transportation is the first unit he has headed, he is now in line to run the company's largest single business.  Fairfield, Conn.-based GE, a giant, sprawling conglomerate with $30 billion in first-quarter revenue and the nation's highest stock-market capitalization, has never publicly said who is in the running for Mr. Welch's job. But insiders and analysts have focused on three contenders since the fall: Jeffrey R. Immelt, 44 years old, head of GE Medical Systems and the favorite; W. James McNerney Jr., 50, who runs GE Aircraft Engines; and Robert L. Nardelli, 52, head of GE Power Systems, who has come on strong recently with stellar financial results.
