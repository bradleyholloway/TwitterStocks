 New Class of Mutual Funds Aims to Limit Taxes   By By David Franecki, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1998  Tax-friendly mutual funds are emerging, giving investors another way besides variable annuities to guard their gains against the tax man.  "Tax-efficient" or "tax-managed" mutual funds invest in ways that minimize the tax bite. Managers use such methods as "harvesting losses," that is, offsetting the fund's capital gains by selling some stocks at a loss. The stocks that are sold are in many cases repurchased after a mandatory 30-day waiting period.  Randy Oldenburg, a fee-only financial adviser and owner of Camden Financial Management, Scottsdale, Ariz., said he has been pulling clients out of variable annuities and directing them into tax-managed mutual funds. He recommends Vanguard Tax-Managed Growth and Income Fund, Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation Fund and, for small-cap exposure, Nationsbank's Nations Managed Small-Cap Index Fund and Nations Managed Small-Cap Value Index Fund.
