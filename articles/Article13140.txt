 Ask David Wessel; By David Wessel   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2005  The interest rate credited to the trust funds on the new, non- marketable Treasury bonds issued each month is calculated by a formula crafted in 1960. It's the average yield on all outstanding, marketable U.S. government securities due or callable more than four years in the future. That rate currently is about 4.125%. The average rate paid on the trust fund's entire portfolio of these special Treasury bonds is higher -- 5.478% at the end of January 2005 -- because the trust funds acquired bonds in the past when long-term rates were higher.
