 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Taste -- Houses of Worship: Some Additions to the Menu   By Miller, John J, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2006  Capybaras are hardly the only creatures that have been subjected to cafeteria-style Catholicism: At various times and places, Lenten exceptions have reportedly been made for beavers, geese, puffins and other marine animals. There's a persistent rumor in Michigan, for example, that muskrats are an approved dish. When a bishop was asked about it, he supposedly replied that anybody bold enough to eat muskrat already is "doing penance worthy of the greatest saints."  Back in those days, the demand for fish wouldn't have been as great if Europeans had followed the habits of today's American Catholics, who tend to replace meat with fish only on Fridays during Lent. That's because in 1966 they gained a special dispensation from their bishops to eat meat on non-Lenten Fridays if they performed some other devotion or work of charity instead. This requirement is probably most honored in the breach. Fish on Fridays was once a year-round tradition; for lots of Catholics in the U.S., it's now just an Easter- season peculiarity.
