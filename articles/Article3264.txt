 SmartMoney: A Fund Alternative: ETFs   By Rivituso, Monica, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2004  ETFs are baskets of securities that track indexes, but trade like stocks. Whether folks are looking to squeeze a bit more performance out of their portfolios or revamp them entirely, ETFs can be helpful tools. They're tax efficient, and inexpensive because they aren't actively managed. Since ETFs have to be purchased through a broker, however, they carry transaction costs.  Mr. [John Kvale] often uses ETFs to diversify portfolios that are too focused on one area, perhaps a single stock. He also uses them with new investors beginning to build portfolios. Not only is the tax efficiency nice, he says, but beginners also find ETFs easy to understand since they simply track indexes.  The pros caution investors to do two things before jumping into ETFs. First, understand what the underlying holdings are. There are more than 130 of them on the market right now -- and, just as with mutual funds, competing ETFs could lead to unnecessary overlap if investors aren't careful. Second, remember that the more narrowly defined an ETF is, the riskier it is, says Mr. [Brian Orol]. "Sector ETFs and country ETFs are by their nature high-risk and aggressive investments," he notes.
