'The poster is a play's coming-attraction trailer -- but you don't want imagery that tells you what happens in the play,'' says Drew Hodges, the creative director of the Manhattan-based graphic-design and advertising company SpotCo. Hodges and his company usually design posters in-house, but for Edward Albee's new play, ''The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?'' -- which just began previews and opens March 10 -- they also enlisted outside artists and then passed along ideas to the three lead producers. The play, about an architect with a secret that threatens to wreck his life, was difficult to capture in one image. Here's what some of those involved had to say about the making of the poster.  Drew Hodges: ''We wound up with 20 concepts. Some are successful designs but don't say what we want to say, but I like to show a range of things to producers, because people love to kill things. We don't, however, include things that are bad, because they will often be picked.''  To see the full article, subscribe here.
