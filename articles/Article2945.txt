 Drug Pitches Resonate With Edgy Public   By By Vanessa O'Connell and Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  Zoloft, Paxil and depression-medication Wellbutrin, another GlaxoSmithKline drug, are a few that have been particularly visible in recent months. Glaxo spent more than $16.5 million to promote Paxil in October -- nearly twice as much as it spent in October 2000, according to Nielsen. The company had prepared an advertising blitz to begin Sept. 17 -- after Glaxo won Food and Drug Administration approval to market the drug for generalized anxiety disorder -- but waited until the first week of October before launching the anxiety campaign in TV Guide, Reader's Digest, Time, Glamour, Better Homes and Gardens, and elsewhere. "The idea was a broad exposure, to make as many sufferers as possible aware of a new option in treatment," says Nancy Pekarek, a spokeswoman for the company. "With the ads, they might see one and say, `Maybe this is me' and call a doctor."  The days when the anxiety and depression pitches were aimed mostly at medical professionals are long over. Some marketers of mood-altering medications now even plug their drugs in glitzy ads on Internet sites offering consumer medical advice, including information about anthrax and coping with anxiety. "One Month Free Trial Offer!" beckons an online ad for Prozac Weekly, the new Pfizer anxiety drug that is taken only once a week. The ad, which appears during a Web search for the word depression, enables viewers to download a coupon for the drug, which is available only by prescription. Viewers also are urged to e-mail the free trial offer "to someone you care about."
