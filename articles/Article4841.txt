 Sterling Sues Hoffmann-La Roche Units, Alleging Shares Were Traded Illegally   By By Elliott D. Lee, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1988  Sterling Drug Inc. charged that two finance companies owned by F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. traded illegally in Sterling Drug stock and options in advance of the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant's $72-a-share tender offer for the New York drug concern.  In a lawsuit filed yesterday in a Delaware federal court, Sterling said the two Bermuda-based units -- Atlantis Finance Ltd. and Canadian Pharmholding Ltd. -- violated insider-trading laws by trading ahead of the tender offer announcement while in possession of "material, nonpublic information" that the offer was coming.  Sterling Drug said it filed the suit to force Hoffmann-La Roche to disclose pertinent information to Sterling Drug directors and shareholders about its $4.2 billion hostile offer.
