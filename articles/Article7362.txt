 Occidental Sets Merger Talks With Oil Firm --- Buying Diamond Shamrock For $3 Billion May Create Problems for 2 Concerns   By By Michael Cieply and Charles F. McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1985  The two companies said Friday that their boards will meet today to discuss "a possible business combination" and plan an announcement. Sources close to Occidental said the companies' management teams last week "substantially agreed" to a merger plan, under which Los Angeles-based Occidental is expected to offer one share of newly issued common stock for each of the roughly 130 million Diamond Shamrock common shares. Occidental currently has 101.7 million common shares outstanding.  That much new equity would help Occidental's capital structure. Occidental has been heavily burdened by debt since its 1982 acquisition of Cities Service Co. The purchase of Diamond Shamrock could also make Occidental a less likely takeover target. For Diamond Shamrock, a combination could give its shareholders a premium over the company's recently depressed stock price. Allying with the much larger Occidental could also put some added financial muscle behind some of Diamond Shamrock's expensive energy development projects.  But a merger also has some potential major drawbacks, particularly for Occidental. With a current dividend of $2.50 a share annually, Occidental faces spending some $325 million a year in extra dividend payments if the merger is made through a common-stock swap. Recently, Occidental's earnings haven't matched current dividend payments. In 1983, Diamond Shamrock had a $56.2 million loss; for the first nine months of this year its profit was $185.4 million, or $1.36 a share.
