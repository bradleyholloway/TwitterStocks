 Some Traders Wager on More Bank Pain   By Ball, Yvonne, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2007  Among factors driving activity were the departure of Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Charles Prince and more write-downs at the banking company. "There are concerns about more problems in the short term" in the financial sector, said Frederic Ruffy, Optionetics analyst. "It seems like there is a new announcement every day."  As the XLF fell 1.8% to $31.27, many traders zeroed in on December $27 put options. Mr. Ruffy said it was likely some traders were closing out higher positions, such as the December $34 puts, taking profits and buying some of the lower strikes.
