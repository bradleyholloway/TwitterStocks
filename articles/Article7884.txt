 Letters to the Editor: Peer Review Started With Small CPA Firms   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1989  While Mr. Carmichael is entitled to his opinion, he is not entitled to misstate the facts.

The leading associations were the driving force behind the concept of independent, outside review of quality standards for CPA firms.
