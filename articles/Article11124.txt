 Canada Waters Down Planned Curbs On Film Distribution by U.S. Concerns   By By Peggy Berkowitz, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1988  The Canadian government, responding to pressure from the U.S. movie industry, watered down its planned restrictions on the distribution of movies in Canada by U.S. companies.  The restrictions were designed to foster a strong domestic film-distribution industry that would invest in Canadian movie production. But the new proposed legislation is so weak that this is unlikely to occur, analysts said.  Under the new proposal, announced yesterday, U.S. movie companies will keep the right to distribute in Canada movies and videos made by independent producers, although now they will have to negotiate separate contracts for Canadian distribution. Until now, U.S. distributors have typically contracted with producers to buy North American rights to films.
