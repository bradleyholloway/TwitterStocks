LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 26â€” Two employees of the Nebraska State Penitentiary were attacked today by a convicted killer who then escaped and was later captured, prison officials said.  John Dahm, assistant corrections director, said the inmate, Paul L. Kennedy, 32 years old, of Crete, was arrested last night by a state trooper on a state highway west of Wilber.  Mr. Kennedy, who was serving a life sentence for the 1973 shotgun murder of a 67-year-old Crete man, somehow got to Crete from Lincoln, stole a car at knifepoint there and was later spotted by Wilber police, Mr. Dahm said.  Donald Rosenbloom, one of the engineers attacked with a crowbar in the powerhouse where Mr. Kennedy was assigned to work, was in critical condition last night after surgery for a skull fracture, prison officials said. The second employee, Richard Pribyl, was hospitalized in fair condition.
