 View / The Gallery: Shards of Reality   By By David Littlejohn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 2001  The resultant paste-ups can wander all over the boards to which they are glued, depending on where his instincts and his eye led him during the shoot. One begins examining his fixed-point study of the famous raked gravel and rock meditation garden of the Ryoanji Temple in Kyoto, for example, in the lower left corner, which contains a few close-ups Mr. [David Hockney] took of his own knees and feet. The collage then curves off in several directions, the changing perspective line of each creating a compelling record of his eye's journey about this magical place. This exhibition contains 25 large overlapping photocollages, including an ice skater twirling in place; a family game of Scrabble (hands move, expressions change; Mr. Hockney has the Q); the artist photographing himself being photographed by Annie Liebowitz, sitting in a dentist's chair, and sharing a posh lunch at the British Embassy in Tokyo. Each patchwork of images reaches out to peripheral visions caught in places and times we can feel.
