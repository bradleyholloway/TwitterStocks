 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2006  MONEY MANAGER Bill Miller's mutual fund, Legg Mason Value Trust, outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, including dividends reinvested, for the 15th straight year in 2005. An article in Saturday's Money & Investing section didn't specify that the fund compares itself with a version of the S&P 500 index that includes dividends reinvested.  (See: "Miller's Legg Mason Fund Beats S&P 500 for 15th Year in a Row" -- WSJ Dec. 31, 2005)  IN THE FILM "Junebug," Ashley, played by Amy Adams, is the sister- in-law of the character George. An article in Friday's Weekend Journal that looked back on the best films of 2005 incorrectly identified Ashley as George's sister.
