 Claiming political privilege   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1996  An editorial criticizes the Clinton administration for claiming that executive privilege protected some 2,000 documents related to the Travel Office from being released, and contends that the picture emerging from the papers given to Rep William Clinger's House Oversight Committee suggests that the White House's claims have mainly to do with political privilege, specifically the political vulnerability of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
