 On Investing: Look at Municipals to Trim Tax   By Pollock, Michael A, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2006  There's a further reason to be thinking about bonds in general right now: After an extended period when yields on longer-term bonds didn't rise much in response to the Federal Reserve's campaign of boosting short-term rates, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note last week rose to the highest levels in almost two years. Those higher yields mean lower prices for most existing bonds -- because prices move in the opposite direction of yields -- but potentially higher returns for people investing now.  The yield on top-quality five-year munis is currently around 3.55%, or about 74% of the yield on U.S. Treasurys of the same maturity, says Gary Pollack, a portfolio manager at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York. At a 10-year maturity, muni yields are even closer to Treasurys, with munis around 3.89% and Treasurys around 4.77%. The question for bond buyers is whether the tax-free income exceeds what they would have if they bought taxable bonds and then paid tax on the higher interest.  A rough way to compare after-tax returns of munis and other bonds is to calculate a muni's "taxable-equivalent" yield: take your federal tax rate and subtract that number from one. Then divide the yield of a muni by the resulting figure.
