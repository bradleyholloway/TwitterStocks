 ImClone Directors Meet on Bristol Bid To Revamp Deal   By By Geeta Anand and Vanessa Fuhrmans, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2002  Bristol-Myers has proposed, among other things, eliminating the remaining $800 million payment to ImClone upon achieving certain milestones, including marketing approval for Erbitux, according to someone close to ImClone. Bristol-Myers has already paid $1 billion to buy 19.9% of ImClone shares and $200 million to ImClone for co-marketing rights to the drug.  ImClone is scheduled to meet with the FDA on Feb. 26, a person close to the company said. Even if the FDA requires additional clinical trials, ImClone may be able to use data from clinical trials that another partner, Germany's Merck KGaA, is conducting in Europe. Merck KGaA owns the rights to Erbitux outside of North America and is co-developing the drug with ImClone in Japan.
