 Texaco Moves to Give Employees Stock As Icahn Indicates He Resumes Buying   By By Allanna Sullivan and Randall Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1988  Wall Street sources said that Mr. Icahn is evaluating whether he can recapture the vote of institutions that he lost to Texaco management during a bitter proxy fight last spring. On Thursday, for instance, Mr. Icahn spoke for the first time since that battle with representatives of the huge California Public Retirement System. Their support of management during the proxy contest was a major blow to him.  Meanwhile, as Texaco rushed to complete an asset-shedding program, four lawmakers Friday moved to throw another roadblock in the company's way. In a letter to Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, the congressmen asked the Treasury Department to investigate and possibly reverse Texaco's agreement last month to sell a 50% interest in its eastern U.S. gasoline refining and retailing network to Saudi Arabia.  Texaco is also taking the rumors of Mr. Icahn's stepped-up interest seriously. His intentions were speculated about during a board meeting Friday, at which directors approved creating an employee stock ownership plan that will hold a new issue of preferred stock convertible into eight million shares of Texaco common.
