 Taste -- Houses of Worship: From Abigail to Zipporah   By By Cullen Murphy, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2000  In the coming weeks, Jews and Christians will once again call to mind some of the epochal stories from their scriptures. If the past is any guide, the women in those stories will receive relatively scant attention. Miriam, the sister of Moses, who leads the celebration after the Israelites cross the Red Sea, figures only briefly in the traditional seder. And although women are depicted in the Gospels as remaining with the crucified Jesus to the end, and as being the first to visit the empty tomb, their presence rarely receives more than an incidental nod.  I bring this up not to be a scold -- the season's holy days are not, after all, about "gender relations" -- but simply to point out how much of the rich literary and historical background we tend to overlook. Miriam, for instance, once loomed far larger in the Passover story than she does now; scholars believe that in the earliest biblical traditions the 18 verses of the Song of Moses, celebrating the destruction of pharaoh's army, were sung not by Moses but by Miriam. She is also the first woman in the Bible to be called a "prophet," receiving the title even before Moses does. The popular memory of Miriam probably explains why so many people with essentially the same name (Mary [Magdalene]) are in the New Testament.
