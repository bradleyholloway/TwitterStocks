 Gazprom And ENI Set to Build Gas Pipeline   By By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1999  Italy's ENI SpA and Russia's RAO Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, have agreed to jointly build a controversial natural-gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey at a cost of nearly $3 billion.  The line is very costly because it would run at great depth under the sea-some $2 billion for the line alone, or about double the cost of building a similar line in shallow waters. Onshore facilities will cost another $1 billion. ENI said Saipem, an Italian engineering company in which ENI has a 40% stake, has been chosen to build the line. If built, it would tie U.S. ally Turkey closer to Russia through energy dependency. It also could deny export opportunities to others in the region such as Turkmenistan, which is having problems finding export routes and outlets for its gas.
