 VW Seeks More Work for Less Pay As Jobs Figure in German Election   By Power, Stephen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2005  VW's warnings and problems at peers including DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes division are further evidence that cost cutting and job losses in German manufacturing have a long way to run, despite the government's pressure on industry to start hiring again after five years of rising unemployment. General Motors Corp.'s German unit, Opel, for example, has been restructuring and shedding jobs. GM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner said in Frankfurt on Monday that "there's still work to be done. I don't think we're in the clear."  The company has declined to specify how much less Wolfsburg workers would have to earn to eliminate an 850 euro ($1,043) a vehicle gap between VW's cost target for the SUV and the cost of building in Wolfsburg under prevailing wages and work rules, which include a five- minute break every hour. "If we could produce the compact SUV on the same terms as we produce the Touran in Wolfsburg, we could save" 850 euros a car, Mr. [Pischetsrieder] said, referring to a program for the production of its Touran minivan. The program pays workers about 2,600 euros a month in wages, or 20% less than the normal rates earned by the rest of the factory's workers. The program is also unusual because workers assigned to it are required to work extra hours without overtime pay if they make a mistake that can be traced back to the assembly line, rather than simply draw lucrative overtime work for making repairs.
