 GM Revs Up to Help Revive Detroit Waterfront --- Retail Spaces and Eateries Planned for Auto Firm's RenCen Office Complex   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2002  When GM first moved some 6,000 employees to the RenCen -- originally built for Ford Motor Co. in 1977 -- it was seen as a bold commitment to downtown Detroit when many residents and companies were still moving out of the city. Now, as it seeks to turn its headquarters into a public amenity, GM is hopeful because local leaders say downtown Detroit in general is undergoing a rebirth. Starting in the mid-1990s, renovations of early 20th century theaters revived the city's entertainment district. Three casino operators opened gambling halls downtown. A new baseball stadium for the Detroit Tigers opened in 2000 and the Detroit Lions will kick off in a new football stadium this fall.  In the immediate term, a depressed retail market will make it difficult for GM to persuade vendors to set up shop in the RenCen's atrium, which it opened in December and dubbed the Wintergarden. The company is hoping to draw boutique shops and "Banana Republic-type clothing stores," says Mr. [MATTHEW CULLEN], as well as full-service sit-down eateries. GM is in negotiations with restaurateurs including chef Wolfgang Puck, according to people familiar with the situation.  Some observers say GM is moving in the right direction. Whereas the original RenCen was just a huge office complex plopped down in a blighted city, the GM renovations open the building to the public. That "reflects a more sophisticated and mature understanding of what it takes to trigger a revitalization," says Paul S. Grogan, president of the Boston Foundation, a community group, and co-author of "Comeback Cities," a book about urban renewal.
