 New Computer Break-Ins Suggest 'Virus' May Have Spurred Hackers   By By David Stipp and Bob Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 2, 1988  One or more computer hackers recently have broken into computers on the same U.S. electronic mail network that last month was attacked by a self-replicating "virus" program, raising concerns that publicity about the virus is sparking a rash of the break-ins.  One of the intrusions occurred earlier this week at Mitre Corp., a Bedford, Mass., research laboratory that does defense-related computer work. That break-in prompted Department of Defense officials to cut links temporarily between Milnet, a military electronic mail system, and Arpanet, a related system used by academic and corporate researchers that was attacked by last month's virus. The disconnection caused researchers some inconvenience, but computer experts said it wasn't a major problem. Defense officials asserted hackers can't break into computers storing classified information through Milnet or Arpanet.  The intruder who broke into Mitre's computers used a hole -- or programming error that allowed unauthorized entry -- in programs that are used on computers in the network, a Mitre spokesman said. In another case, a hacker calling himself "Shatter" recently broke into computers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Glenn Adams, a manager at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
