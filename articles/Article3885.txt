 Family Finances: Introductory Mortgage Rates Have Pitfalls   By Simon, Ruth, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 20, 2005  In addition, borrowers who make the minimum payment regularly can suffer "negative amortization," meaning their loan balance swells. That's because, as rates rise, the minimum payment isn't enough to cover even the interest that is due. They could also be hit with sharply higher monthly payments several years down the road.  A new minimum payment is calculated at the end of each year based on current interest rates and other factors. To reduce the potential pain, lenders typically set a 7.5% cap on how much the minimum payment can rise in most years. The cap is typically waived once every five years so that the borrower is put back on track to pay off the loan over the original 30-year period. The minimum-payment option is suspended if the loan balance reaches a preset level -- typically between 110% and 125% of the original loan amount.
