 Argentine Oil Firms Scramble to Avert Tax --- Levy Would Bail Out Banks; Profitable Industry Offers Loan to Country Instead   By By Marc Lifsher, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 11, 2002  The plan will only add to the unhappiness of many depositors, however. According to the schedule, dollar-denominated certificates of deposit, which account for about one-third of the $67 billion in total deposits, will remain frozen until January 2003. At that time, banks will begin paying out CDs in monthly installments, depending on the size of the deposit. In a move that will further tie up deposits, the government issued a decree that automatically converts into CDs all checking accounts with balances of more than $10,000 and all savings accounts with balances above $3,000.  The Argentine oil industry, dominated by Spain's Repsol YPF SA and Buenos Aires-based Perez Companc SA, doesn't want to be burdened by new levies now that prices have recovered from the lows of the 1998 financial crisis in Asia. Since then, Repsol, Perez Companc and other firms such as Royal Dutch/Shell, BP PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. have substantially increased investments here and boosted the value of their exported oil, gas and refined products to about $6 billion a year. A 20% tax "can wipe out [profit] margins," says Roger Diwan, an analyst with Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington-based consulting firm.
