 FCC Chief Doesn't Plan to End, Radically Alter Ownership Rules   By By Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2003  Mr. [Michael Powell] said the FCC must act. "The court will vacate our rules if we don't justify them," Mr. Powell said, noting that in four recent cases, the federal appeals court with jurisdiction over the agency has sided with companies challenging the rules.  Mr. Powell also faced sharp questioning from lawmakers upset over an expected FCC move to stop making the regional Bell companies lease their local phone lines and equipment to rivals offering competing services at cheaper rates.
