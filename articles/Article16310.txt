 On the Continent, Truffles Aren't Trifles, but a Signpost of Troubles   By Vara, Vauhini, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2003  France's famed truffle industry offers a window on this latest challenge to the Continent. Michel Tournayre, a third-generation truffle man, calls the drought a "catastrophe" for his farm in the Gard region of southeastern France. Last winter, Mr. Tournayre produced 110 pounds of Perigord truffles, nicknamed black diamonds for their rarity. His prediction for this year's crop?  In [LA BROUSSE], 590 miles to the northwest, Mr. Doublet is only slightly more optimistic. He stops at the foot of an oak tree and motions at an ant wandering down the trunk. "It's a sign that the ecosystem is healthy," he explains. "That means the tree will produce." So this season's harvest will be OK?  The threat to the truffle harvest could soon affect the world's gourmands. The average wholesale price of truffles last winter was about 130 euros a pound (roughly $150 a pound, at the current rate of conversion), down from a record of 230 euros a pound amid bad weather in the winter of 2001-02, according to the French Federation of Truffle Cultivators. The federation expects this winter's prices to top the high because of the drought but doesn't forecast prices. Mr. Tournayre, the president of his region's truffle-farmers union, thinks the price could skyrocket to 450 euros a pound.
