 Cambodia Enjoys a Precarious Growth --- U.N. Drives the Economy But Will Soon Depart   By By Raphael Pura, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1993  The ubiquitous construction and renovation reflects Phnom Penh's transformation from a run-down backwater into a bustling town of one million people since a 1991 peace accord brought a measure of stability to Cambodia.  The revival in building and trade has been so rapid that economists with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, or Untac, reckon that inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product reached 8% in 1992 and could match that pace this year. (GDP measures the value of a nation's output of goods and services, less foreign income.)  "The current growth remains unbalanced and uneven and doesn't go very deep," U.N. economists concluded in a recent report. The report said expansion was narrowly focused on urban areas -- mainly Phnom Penh -- and was driven overwhelmingly by foreign and local investors seeking a quick return from property or service industries.
