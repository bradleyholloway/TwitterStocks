 Dubai Plans to Broaden China, India Investment   By Batson, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2007  "We feel right now we've done the first stage," Mr. [Soud Ba]'alawy said in an interview here, where he was attending a World Economic Forum meeting. "We will continue to grow our business and become a meaningful investor in this region," he said. Dubai Group has offices in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and is planning a new office in Mumbai, India.  Dubai Group is ultimately backed by the royal family of Dubai, as part of the Dubai Holdings conglomerate owned by the ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. Mr. Ba'alawy, who had a long career at Citigroup Inc. before arriving at his current post, wouldn't discuss the size of the funds Dubai Group has available to invest.  One of Dubai Group's largest, and most public, investments in Asia was its acquisition last year of a 40% stake in Malaysia's Bank Islam for about $225 million. Bank Islam was struggling financially at the time but has turned around, Mr. Ba'alawy said.
