 Wonder Land: Make Permanent The Stark Ruin Of September 11   By Henninger, Daniel, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2003  Men who one might call the Democratic Party's statesmen say the election was "stolen" and that the President of the U.S. is a "liar." Members of Congress say they have never seen the institution so polarized. Iraq, North Korea and global terror may be worthy of discussion and disagreement, but Democratic politics now mandates total opposition. If a Miguel Estrada needs to be defeated, everyone needs to be defeated. This is new, and it's not going away soon.  If you work in Ground Zero's neighborhood, you get used to the look of the place, which means you don't look at it very much. There is a prevailing school of thought that we have to rebuild on this site or else "the terrorists will have won." Two years out, I find myself more and more disagreeing with that.  No such erasure is possible right now. Every day, every day, if you go to the edge of Ground Zero and stand back far enough to watch the people who have come to this place for the first time from some other city, or nation, you can't help but notice the air of gravity. They stare through the fence and into the ruin as if looking into a cathedral. If you ask them what they think, many say, "It's so big. I had no idea. It's so big."
