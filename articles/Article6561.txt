 Why the Elgin Marbles Belong to British Museum   The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2006  Their original owner was the Athenian city-state, which lost its charter to Phillip II of Macedon 2,300 years ago. In other words, the original city, which would otherwise have a valid right to reclaim the Marbles, no longer exists. The city changed hands a number of times, and it was the Ottoman overlord who, in 1816, licensed Lord [Elgin] to remove the Marbles from their corrosive Athenian smog-bath.
