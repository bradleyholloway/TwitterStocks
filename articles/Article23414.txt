 An Honest Democrat   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2006  Mr. [Charlie Rangel] has also been clear in saying he wants to "stop this war" in Iraq, and last week he was asked by The Hill newspaper how he might accomplish that. He responded: "You've got to be able to pay for the war, don't you?" That sounds like a vow to cut off funding for the war, a la 1975 in Vietnam, a point that California Democrat Lynn Woolsey reinforced by telling the same paper, "Personally, I wouldn't spend another dime [on the war]."
