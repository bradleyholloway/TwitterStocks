 Leftists Diverge in Argentina, Brazil   By Moffett, Matt, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2004  From a political standpoint, Mr. da Silva came into office with some distinct advantages over his Argentine counterpart. Mr. da Silva is a founder and undisputed leader of the Workers' Party, a relatively youthful political machine that has proven more flexible and transparent than Mr. Kirchner's Peronist party. When left-wing dissidents protested Mr. da Silva's shift toward the center, he and his coterie of founding members drummed the critics out. In addition, Mr. da Silva's compelling personal story -- rising from impoverished childhood to the presidency -- gave him a deep reservoir of public sympathy to draw upon during his difficult first year in office.  Yet, for all of Argentina's harsh treatment of investors, the government is more austere in fiscal matters than Argentina's conservative government of the 1990s, says economist Orlando Ferreres. "It's difficult to put a label on the Kirchner economic policy," Mr. Ferreres says.  For Mr. da Silva and Mr. Kirchner, their economies' futures depend upon many factors beyond their control. Brazil, which continues to honor its heavy debt load, is vulnerable to rising interest rates. And with a dependence on agribusiness, both Brazil and Argentina are affected by commodity prices and China's ability to engineer a soft economic landing so it can still afford to buy the pair's exports.
