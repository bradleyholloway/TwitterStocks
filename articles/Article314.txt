 Sweden's Market Is Smiling on Securitas AB, But Some Wonder if Buying Spree Is a Bit Much   By By Jesse Eisinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2000  In TOKYO, the Nikkei 225-stock index rose 1.4%, or 234.17 points to 16670.82, encouraged by a rally in U.S. stocks. Technology stocks benefited in particular. Sony closed up 260 yen to 10,800 yen and Fujitsu rose 80 yen to 3,280 yen. Bargain hunting helped Softbank surge 1,000 yen to end at 12,000 yen. Bank stocks were generally higher on buying by foreign investors, with Fuji Bank up 10 yen to 863 yen and Sumitomo Bank up 24 yen to 1,381 yen.  In LONDON, the FTSE 100-share index closed down 0.5%, or 9.2 points, to 6557, as declines in oil and banking stocks outweighed technology and telecommunications gains. A modest rally on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the U.S. spurred technology and telecom stocks across Europe, helping recently hit shares to rebound. ARM Holdings gained 30 pence to 759 pence, and Bookham Technology was 89 pence higher at 3,814 pence. On the flip side, oil stocks suffered on news that oil production might increase if prices continue at their current levels. BP Amoco was down 10.5 pence at 636 pence, and Shell fell 19 pence to 591 pence.  In PARIS, the CAC 40 index declined 0.6%, or 39.77 points, to 6461.93 in a broad-based sell-off that hit Old Economy stocks harder than others. Oil company Total Fina Elf was one of the day's biggest losers, falling 2.8% to 72 euros, in line with other oil stocks across Europe. Pen, razor and lighter-maker Societe Bic fell 2.8% to 56 euros after its U.S. rival Newell-Rubbermaid purchased the pens division of Gillette. Bic had its eyes on that acquisition as well. Consumer-foods group Danone was another big decliner, down 2.3% to 153.40 euros, after an investment-rating downgrade on Danone and rival Nestle. France Telecom was the day's biggest gainer, up 2.5% to 127 euros. The company is considered to be well-positioned for the Italian third-generation mobile-telephone license auction.
