 Bausch Asks Retailers Not to Sell Contact Solution   By Suzanne Sataline and Sylvia Westphal, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2006  In "exhaustive tests on the product" and an inspection of its manufacturing plant, "nothing has yet been found to show that ReNu with MoistureLoc contributed to these infections in any way," Mr. [Ron Zarrella] says in the letter. "However, in the cases of infections reviewed to date, the majority of patients reported using ReNu with MoistureLoc manufactured at our U.S. factory," which is in Greenville, S.C.  The FDA found that eye-care products were being filled in rooms that were later found to have "paint flaking from the ceiling grids." The plant "failed to adequately investigate the cause of this nonconformity," the agency said, "which directly related to product quality."  Ms. [Meg Graham] says the company "reviewed the findings with the FDA inspectors and initiated immediate corrective action. There was never any evidence that product sterility was in any way compromised." Ms. Graham added that the South Carolina plant "has an outstanding compliance history" and that the 2002 letter "was the first and only such letter it has ever received." Ms. Graham said MoistureLoc was launched in the U.S. in late 2004, after the FDA inspection and the company's actions in response.
