 Letters to the Editor: The Presidency and Criminal Liability   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1998  Robert Bork's recent defense of the theory he fashioned a quarter of a century ago, that the president cannot be indicted prior to impeachment, is no more constitutionally compelling than the original version ("Indict Clinton? How I Wish it Were Possible," editorial page, March 18). Indeed, his reasoning by analogy in comparing presidential immunity from criminal indictment with the idea that "executive privilege" inheres in and derives from the enumerated powers of the presidency is fatally flawed. When it comes to the doctrine of executive privilege to shield confidential communications and documents within the executive branch, a doctrine some still insist is a "constitutional myth," there is at least a plausible parallel with the doctrine of judicial review, itself a power nowhere mentioned in the Constitution but long assumed to be implied by the enumerated powers of the federal judiciary. And in both cases one can find evidence that the Founders had something like executive privilege and judicial review in mind.  Judge Bork is right, however, about the fact that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution is a recognition of the "uniqueness of the presidency." That amendment provides for the mechanisms whereby the vice president can be elevated temporarily to the office of acting president should there be evidence that the president is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office" for whatever reason. Those mechanisms would provide the means whereby the important work of the presidency could be carried out should a full-blown criminal trial render the incumbent unable to fulfill his constitutional obligations. And they would have far greater constitutional integrity than an extra-textual theory of presidential immunity.
