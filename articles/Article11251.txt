 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Selwyn Feinstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1989  Barnett Banks Inc. brings aboard new executives even as it cuts back lower grades; the banking industry is giving up quantity for quality, a spokesman explains. Quaker Oats Co. boosts its executive ranks 5%. But that's at the lower end of its recent expansion range of 5% to 10%. Kemper Group does "a little" hiring. Household International Inc. replaces departing executives and adds a few new ones to handle growth. Ball Corp. keeps its executive count "very stable," as it has in recent years.  General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft unit, though, will pare its employment 8% by year's end, with cuts coming at all levels. Many will leave through normal attrition, but the company hasn't ruled out layoffs. Upjohn Co. reduces its global employment 1.4%. Teco Energy Inc. has cut its management staff 6% since last fall, and it continues to run a gimlet eye over every vacancy to see if it has to be filled.  General Electric Co. teamed 50 to 60 salespeople from nine different businesses to sell equipment to GM's Saturn car project. They "work together to leverage their market power," GE says. Hewlett-Packard Co., which has been using teams since the early 1970s, says there's no way a solo salesman can handle the company's 11,000 products. Apple Computer Inc. became a convert last year. "This is a very efficient way of meeting the needs of Fortune 500 companies," it says. Stanley Works' tool unit switched to the team approach this year.
