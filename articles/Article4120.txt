 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Good News Bears?   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 1986  When the stock market plunged Wednesday, the Wall-streetwise were quick to attribute it to the good news in the December unemployment statistics. The economy was stronger than predicted, the logic went, so interest rates would not continue to decline, so bond prices fell, so stock prices had to fall 39 points. This was the biggest number of points ever, though 39 points with the Dow at 1565 is one thing, while 38 points when the Dow was at 300 in 1929 was quite another indeed.  Yesterday the bears tried to continue the stampede, forcing the average down another 20 points in intraday trading, but the bulls recouped late in the afternoon and the day finished down only 8. The closing figure of 1518 put the average back to about where it was three weeks ago, and some 200 points above its September levels. Still, in its volatility and volume the market clearly is trying to tell us something.
