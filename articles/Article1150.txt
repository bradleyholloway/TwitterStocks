 In California Valley, Costs Too Are Low --- Firms Tired of Big-City Hassles Flock to the Region   By By William Celis III, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1989  That's what Florestone Products Inc. was thinking when it announced over a luncheon of homegrown steak and California wine that it would build a plant in Madera, Calif., located in the state's Central Valley, 150 miles from the company's headquarters and existing factory.  "Our problem is the cost of land in the (San Francisco) Bay Area. . . . The land was too expensive," said Ronald R. Flores, chief executive officer of the Union City, Calif., maker of molded bath and shower products. In Madera, Florestone was able to buy 15 acres for $150,000 for its $4.2 million plant. The same amount of acreage in the San Francisco area would have cost $1.5 million.  Like Florestone, scores of companies weary of the expense of doing business in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego are finding refuge in relatively cheap Madera, Stockton, Fresno and other Central Valley communities, long considered the poor country cousins to the states' more glamorous coastal cities.
