 Threat of inflation to EMU is low as Europe recovers   By Bray, Nicholas, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1997  The economies of the 11 countries expected to form part of the European monetary union, dubbed Euroland, are finally recovering thanks to the competitive edge brought by a stronger dollar, but the upturn is still so weak that it is unlikely to pose an inflationary threat to Europe's planned single currency, according to economists at the WestLB Research GmbH in Germany. In the first quarter of 1997, Euroland's GDP grew only 0.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis from the fourth quarter. Consumer-price inflation, however, dropped from 2.5% in May 1996 to 1.5% in Jun 1997.
