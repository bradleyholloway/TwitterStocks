 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Singapore's Trouble   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1987  Naturally we're saddened by the Singapore government's decision to suppress The Asian Wall Street Journal, a banana-republic action beneath Singapore's stature in the world. The real losers are the city-state's 2.6 million citizens, who have worked hard to build up their country since independence. Now they find that Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's government does not even trust them to read a newspaper. Sadder still, this is in no way unique among the government's recent actions.  The government has declared the Asian Journal guilty of "engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore," and will restrict its present circulation of 5,000 to 400 copies an issue. The immediate offense is refusal to publish a letter to the editor from a Singapore official, which editors of the paper felt was inaccurate and unfair to its reporter. The paper has already published a series of letters from officials, but in the end editors bear some responsibility for the accuracy and fairness of even letters to the editor. Singapore officials seem to be using their new press law to claim unlimited access for whatever they choose to allege, and self-respecting editors must somewhere draw a line. All the more so if they expect that in Singapore's present mood they will sooner or later be banned anyway.  At 63, Lee Kuan Yew has been prime minister for some 28 years. He has compiled a truly remarkable record. Given Singapore's accomplishments, it grows hard to remember that Prime Minister Lee's career took form against a backdrop of riots, hunger and communist threat. He led his country through these perils and into a free-trade regime that engendered an economic miracle. Singapore enjoys a per capita GNP of almost $7,000 a year, one of the highest in Asia.
