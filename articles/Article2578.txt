 Capital Markets: Down Period for Offerings   By By Jonathan Weil, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1999  After 1998's record year, the number of Texas companies tapping the public debt and equities markets dropped substantially during the first quarter of 1999, as did the amount of money they combined to raise. During the three months, 56 deals were completed statewide, 36% fewer than the 88 deals in the year-earlier period. Dollar volume dropped 13% to $10.8 billion.  In part, the figures reflect the narrowness of the current bull market for stocks. Demand for a select few big-name stocks is driving market indexes to records at the same time that most stocks, particularly small issues, are struggling. And Texas-based companies, as a group, are trailing national benchmarks. Additionally, demand for initial public offerings remains soft -- except for companies with "dot.com" in their names, of course.
