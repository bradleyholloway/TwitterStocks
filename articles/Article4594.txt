 Hot Spots: How Some U.S. Areas Cope With Anomaly: Surging Economies --- Example Is Portland, Maine, Where Labor Shortages Lead to Rising Wages --- The Risk of Higher Inflation   By By Laurie McGinley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1985  Maybe too hot. Steamy economic growth has driven down the unemployment rate to 2.5%, the second lowest in the country, just behind 2.2% in Manchester, N.H. As a result, local employers are being pinched by labor shortages. Because there aren't enough construction workers to go around, Mr. Boulos is delaying a major project -- a 100,000-square-foot shopping center -- until spring. "If we had enough people," he says, "we'd be digging right now."  For employers, forced to compete aggressively for low-skilled workers and highly trained professionals, the tight labor markets create new problems and challenges. In many areas, wages are rising sharply. Turnover rates at small companies are climbing, as bigger businesses lure workers away. George Rufo Sr., the president and chairman of Poly-Matrix Inc., a Pittsfield, Mass., manufacturer of plastic cassette-tape boxes, says he regularly loses employees to nearby General Electric Co. For similar jobs, GE pays workers 25% to 70% more than smaller companies.  Nevertheless, low jobless rates do carry some risks -- chief among them higher inflation. For the nation as a whole, the 7% unemployment rate has been a powerful force in restraining inflation; workers have had little leverage to demand higher pay, and wage increases have been small. But in areas with very low jobless rates, many employers have raised wages -- sometimes sharply. Sooner or later, economists say, those wage increases will result in higher prices. In that sense, some of these areas suggest the U.S. of the 1970s, when strong growth pushed wages and prices up rapidly.
