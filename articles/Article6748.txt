 Ghosts of Meals Past Haunt the Interior Of Office Microwaves   By Sandberg, Jared, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2003  The appliance, a camouflaging black, has a sign that reads, "Please cover your food." At first, the sign seemed aimed at preventing splatter. Now, its meaning confers to him more of a run-for-your-life urgency lest "the scary growing things," he says, "fall into your food and poison you."  "The heating of that spilled portion will cause that aroma to be stronger," says Lona Sandon, an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at University of Texas Southwestern, who has actually given this issue some thought. But because the air remains at room temperature in a microwave and only the food is cooked, those stray food molecules are "still being broken down and destroyed, but at a much slower pace than in a conduction oven. The spilled food gets grosser and grosser and stickier."  "Cooties are a lot more complicated," Mr. [James Weltz] says. Unlike refrigerators, microwaves can sterilize microbes, but only if the temperature equals 160 degrees or more. And aflatoxins, which aren't living things, could remain, he says. "To depend on the microwaves to kill microorganisms doesn't seem very prudent."
