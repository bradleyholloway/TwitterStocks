ST. THOMAS, V.I., Nov. 16â€” Voicing determination to ''recapture the middle'' in American politics, Democrats from around the country searched today for explanations of their losses in last week's elections and groped for a successful path toward the future.  ''Unlike the Republicans, we will conduct our introspection in public,'' Kathy Vick, president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, asserted as reporters looked on.  Rumors about who might or might not run for the post of chairman of the Democratic National Committee in late January flew as fast as the hummingbirds that dart among the yellow hibiscus blossoms on this tropical island. John Cavanaugh, a former Congressman from Nebraska, added his name to a growing list of candidates.  In Washington, the names of powerful people who might be chosen general chairman of the party, if such a post is indeed created, were heard.  But here, where gentler breezes now blow, some Democrats were more concerned with looking back and understanding the nature of the political storm that has just passed. While some at the Democratic meeting here seemed to view President Reagan's landslide victory and the modest Republican gain in the House of Representatives as a relatively ordinary, if painful, election, others reacted with anger and alarm. Some saw the almost forgotten hand of the Christian right hard at work. 'We've Got to Face It'  ''We must pay attention to what they're doing,'' Sam Goddard, the former Governor of Arizona, said of the Republican opposition. ''This is scary and we've got to face it.''  While Democrats sitting in their chairs moaned, ''Oh, no,'' Mr. Goddard, a lawyer and long-time Democratic Party regular, displayed a magazine called ''Presidential Biblical Scorecard.'' The attractive, 39-page publication reads much like an ordinary factual presentation, but, Mr. Goddard said, the magazine contains ''the strangest interpretations'' of law.  ''This is for real, fellas and ladies, and we've got to do something about it; this is the future,'' he predicted. ''This is either an attempt to form a new political party or an attempt by a group to take over an existing political party.''  In 1964 Mr. Goddard defeated Richard G. Kleindienst to become Governor of Arizona. Mr. Kleindienst later became United States Attorney General and resigned amid the Watergate scandal.  Mr. Goddard said his son now serves as Mayor of Phoenix and won despite a Republican edge of 100,000 voters in that western city, but he himself seemed frustrated. After making his statements with microphone in hand, he all but withdrew from a race to become the new president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs.  Saying it would take him a full day to travel between his home and the nation's capital, where he would have to spend much of his time, Mr. Goddard explained, ''I haven't got the money, I haven't got the time and I don't think I could take that much Washington anyway.'' 'Old Coalition Was Fractured'  A Democratic poll taker, William Hamilton, conceded that in the last election, ''our old coalition was fractured.'' Republicans made inroads at the local level, he said, where Democrats have long felt dominant. According to the Texas Democratic chairman, Bob Slagle, the Republican Party spent ''a sea of greenbacks '' even on the lowest county office, that of constable, in his state.  Mr. Hamilton said he agreed with Mr. Goddard and noted that in contested races for Congress, Republicans had made gains in all parts of the country except the Northeast, where there are more Jewish voters, who traditionally ally themselves with the Democratic Party, and fewer born-again Christians than in the rest of the nation.  For years born-again Christians and fundamentalist Christians voted Democratic, particularly in the South, he said. But that began changing even before the 1980 election, when Mr. Reagan wooed Christian ministers who use television as their pulpit.  ''This year they went almost three to one for Reagan, and two and a half to one for the Republican candidate for Congress,'' Mr. Hamilton said.  ''They are something to be worried about,'' he added. ''We see them working with the Republican Party and independently, through that mechanism for independent expenditures.  ''They are a major part of the Jack Kemp-Newt Gingrich-Jesse Helms wing of the Republican Party,'' he continued, citing Representatives from Buffalo and from Georgia and the North Carolina Senator who could become the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Mr. Hamilton said one-fifth of all newly registered voters this year were born-again Christians. ''They can get the votes out and the new registration, and they claim moral correctness, and it's awful hard to fight,'' he observed.  But he also predicted the Republicans would have as much trouble holding their coalition together, including the three men he named, as the Democrats have had keeping the Democratic donkey intact.  ''You've got that wing of the Republican Party versus the Doles and the Bakers,'' he said, referring to Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, more moderate members. ''There'll be a mean fight,'' he predicted.
