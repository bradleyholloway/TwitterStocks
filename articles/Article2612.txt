 Hughes Aircraft Planning to Cut California Jobs --- GM Unit Moves to Reduce Payroll in State by 10%, Or at Least 3,200 Posts   By By Jeff Cole, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 1994  In yet another blow to California's hard-hit defense industry, Hughes Aircraft Co. is completing plans that will eliminate at least 3,200 jobs, 10% of its payroll in the state.  "You'll see a major reduction" in California employment, he said, responding to talk throughout the company that a major cutback in California is coming. "We are driving this company to be the most competitive that we know how to be."  Hughes already has cut its companywide employment to 50,000 from 63,000 since early 1992. The new cuts would amount to 6% of the current work force. The company employs about 32,000 people in California. Mr. Smith said "greater than 10%" of those jobs will be eliminated when consolidation plans are complete by mid-August. He declined to discuss how much greater the job losses could be.
