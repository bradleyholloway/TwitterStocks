 Economic Individualism and the Only Truly Just Society   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2006  Contrary to Prof. [Edmund Phelps]'s account, [John Rawls] didn't merely deny the justness of a hypothetical organization that benefited the upper and middle classes at the expense of those "at the bottom"; he denied that anyone should be allowed to improve his situation in life unless it could be demonstrated that each such improvement also served to benefit the "least advantaged." In other words, Rawls's account of economic justice was a pure expression of the spirit of envy, which Prof. Phelps rightly reminds us was condemned by his supposed model Kant as "the vice of mankind." Indeed, Rawls expressly justified envy in his book "A Theory of Justice" as "excusable" and even "rational" whenever the extent of economic inequality in a society exceeded certain (unspecified) limits. Thus Rawls encouraged anyone who resents the greater success achieved by others to blame his situation on their supposedly "unjust" treatment of him -- and to demand that "society" be reorganized to indulge his resentment.  Rather than turn to Rawls, Prof. Phelps and other defenders of the free-enterprise system would do far better to ground their argument on the doctrine of inalienable natural rights found in the Declaration of Independence and derived in turn from John Locke. Chapter Five of Locke's "Second Treatise" anticipates Prof. Phelps's own position by showing how allowing people the freedom to advance their own economic situation through honest labor and industry inevitably increases exponentially the stock of material goods possessed by their society, and thereby improves the lot of the "less advantaged" far more than Rawls's quasi-socialist proposals would ever do.
