 The Economy -- Capital: Taxes Still Haunt the Ghost of LTCM   By By David Wessel, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2002  In documents filed in the LTCM case, the government says the corporate deductions weren't kosher. The IRS has audited each of the big companies' transactions, according to the court filings. The outcomes of those audits aren't public. Advanta and EDS say they "don't have any exposure in our tax position" to the transactions described in the LTCM case, wording that suggests that each has come to a settlement with the IRS. Interpublic has disclosed that its tax returns for 1994 through 1996 are being audited, and says it has set aside enough money to cover any back taxes. An Aventis spokesman said: "There is nothing we can say about this particular story."  Round Three: Enter Long-Term Capital Management. "In an apparent attempt to generate additional unearned tax benefits," the government says, Babcock & Brown in 1996 arranged for Onslow to swap the preferred shares for a stake in LTCM with a guarantee that Onslow wouldn't lose money. LTCM partners Myron Scholes, a Nobel laureate, and professor-turned-trader Eric Rosenfeld negotiated for the hedge fund, the government says.  In April 2001, the IRS disallowed the deductions. LTCM partners, insisting the transactions had business purposes besides avoiding taxes, went to U.S. District Court in New Haven, Conn. The government now wants to take depositions from 60 people. LTCM is resisting. The trial is set to begin in March. Babcock says it's "confident that the transactions in question are absolutely valid and legitimate, and that the tax issues will be resolved accordingly."
