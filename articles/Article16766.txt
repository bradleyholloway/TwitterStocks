 Wal-Mart Slowdown to Hit Food Sector; Rivals Stand to Benefit, But Suppliers May Suffer As Growth Plans Shrink   By Jargon, Julie, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2007  Industry observers say packaged-food companies that rely heavily on Wal-Mart's supercenters, which sell everything from food to furniture, could be hurt by its plan to slow the pace of U.S. store openings. General Mills Inc., Kellogg Co. and Del Monte Foods Co. could feel the strongest impact, Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow said in a note to investors.  Wal-Mart supercenters have become an important source of growth for food companies. Wal-Mart is often the largest single customer for food companies, making up 10% to 18% of their sales and sometimes more than 30% of their growth rates, according to Mr. Moskow of Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has an investment-banking relationship with Kellogg, General Mills, Del Monte, Kraft Foods Inc., and Wal-Mart. Mr. Moskow doesn't own shares in any of those companies.  He estimates that Kellogg's Wal-Mart business grew 21% a year from 2003 to 2006, that General Mills' grew 15% a year during that period and that Del Monte's grew 7%, though those figures include international sales as well as domestic. Each company's overall annual sales rate was in the single digits during those years. Kraft, the country's largest food company by revenue, also relies heavily on Wal- Mart, with its business with the retailer's having grown 12% a year from 2003 to 2006, according to Credit Suisse.
