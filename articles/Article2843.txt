 Kmart Net Falls 40% on Overhaul Costs, But Beats Analyst Expectations by Penny   By By Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  Since arriving last summer at Kmart, the second-largest discount chain behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Mr. [Charles C. Conaway] has launched a massive turnaround plan to update the faltering chain. The company has slashed some prices to clear out old inventory and hired extra employees to move loads of goods out of trailers and onto selling floors.
