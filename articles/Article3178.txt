 Fall Travel Deals Arrive Early; Last-Minute Summer Vacationers Can Find Surprising Discounts; 50% Off in First Class   By de Lisser, Eleena, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2003  In addition to cutting some prices, they are trying gimmicks ranging from one-day sales (which are tougher for rival airlines to quickly match) to companion fares, which offer discounts to two or more people traveling together. This week UAL Corp.'s United Airlines launched a companion-fare sale and other carriers matched it, though several didn't require companion travel. United has a fare allowing two passengers to fly to London from New York for $238 a person roundtrip.  Prices to Europe are dropping. British Airways has a sale to London that expires Aug. 15 with fares starting at $323 roundtrip. US Airways has a fare from Baltimore to Shannon, Ireland, for $288. Continental Airlines and Delta are offering a $420 roundtrip ticket between San Francisco and London. US Airways is giving consumers an additional $100 off fares to Europe if they book online through its their Web site. (To get the discount, type in the promotional code EUR10071.)  For ResortQuest, a Destin, Fla., company that manages vacation rentals in the Southeast, Texas, Colorado and Hawaii, "August has been slowly chiseled away" as a prime vacation time, says its president, Jim Olin. Calling it a new "shoulder season" (an industry term for the period abutting a peak season), he says rates can drop as much as 40% from the high-season July rates. For example, a two-bedroom luxury condo at the Portofino in Pensacola Beach, Fla., that was going for $329 a night is available for $189 a night.
