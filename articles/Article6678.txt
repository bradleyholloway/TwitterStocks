 HealthSouth's Banker Resigns   By By Robert Frank, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 2003  Still, Mr. McGahan's departure is likely to raise further questions about UBS's role in the HealthSouth scandal. People familiar with the matter said UBS received a subpoena a few months ago from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information about its investment-banking transactions with HealthSouth. A UBS spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena. It isn't clear what information the SEC is seeking from UBS in the matter, but there is no indication that Mr. McGahan's work for the company is being examined as part of the investigation.
