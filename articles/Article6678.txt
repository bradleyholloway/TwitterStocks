 Profit in Motion: Tiny Sensors Take Off; Key to Wii's Controller and New iPhone, 'Mems' Are a Hot Product   By Bulkeley, William M, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2007  One of the devices, each about the size of a match head, sits inside the motion-sensitive, hand-held controller that lets Wii users "play" tennis, baseball or golf. The tiny sensors are a type of microelectromechanical system, known as "mems" -- and they are hot products.  Although Analog has been making mems since 1989, the market took off when auto makers decided the tiny machines, built using semiconductor technology, were reliable enough to replace the mechanical systems used to deploy air bags. The mems market has grown steadily since. Several other companies -- including Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH; STMicroelectronics, Geneva; and Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Austin, Texas -- also make mems, primarily for automotive and industrial applications.  Richard Mannherz, customer-marketing manager for Analog's micromachined-products division, says that "more and more products will include inertial sensors so they'll know what to do without your telling them to." He says that many actions that currently require a person to push a button could be accomplished automatically by a motion sensor.
