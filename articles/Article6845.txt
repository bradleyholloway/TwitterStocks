 Readers' Forum: "Impose a tariff on imported goods"   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2004  Re: Readers' Forum, "Free for All" (Sept. 5): Free trade may not be free and it may have cost plants and jobs, but it has also resulted in cheaper manufactured goods. What the American people overlook is that if they want cheap goods, they have to be produced where labor costs and taxes are low. A simple solution to this problem is to impose a tariff on imported goods.
