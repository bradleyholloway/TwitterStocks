 Bond Prices Fall Sharply as Concern Grows That Economy Will Speed Up   By By Edward P. Foldessy and Tom Herman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1986  Faster economic growth could prompt the Federal Reserve System to tighten its credit hold and drive up interest rates, some traders say. They are especially nervous about the outlook for Fed policy because of a recent surge in the nation's money supply. The basic money measure, known as M1, has soared $17.6 billion in the past five weeks, leaving it far above the Fed's target.  Fears about a tougher credit policy intensified yesterday because the Fed failed to take any steps to reduce the persistently high interest rate on federal funds. The rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend one another overnight, hovered around 7% for most of the session. On Friday, the funds rate averaged 6.84%.  Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said he doubts the Fed is adopting a tighter credit stance. "I don't see any reason for the Fed to tighten, given the mixed signals coming from the economy," he said. Business activity "doesn't look very vigorous," he contended. He estimated the economy is growing at only a 1.5% inflation-adjusted annual rate this quarter, compared with a 3.7% rate in the first quarter.
