 Politics & Economics: Senate Approves Big Spending Bill Amid Veto Threat   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2006  Encouraged by Mr. [Josh Bolten], his former budget director, Mr. [Bush] has been quick to enter the fray over the Senate's emergency-spending bill. There's little argument about the $65.7 billion provided for the military to help pay for the cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the hurricane-relief package has grown to $28.9 billion, a 50% increase.

"It's like kicking a baby."  "I'm not going to throw up my hands and surrender," Sen. Cochran said. "I'm going to try my best to negotiate with the House in a fair way and reach an agreement that the president can sign."
