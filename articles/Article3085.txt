 No Disclosure: The Feeling Is Mutual   By By John J. Brennan and Edward C. Johnson 3d, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2003  Disclosing the individual proxy votes of the hundreds of securities owned by the typical mutual fund is neither practical nor useful. If a mutual fund holds 200 stocks and proxy statements run 20 pages, this could require fund shareholders to analyze 4,000 pages of data to determine how the votes on each proxy question had advanced their interests. Shareholders currently pay fund managers to do this work for them. "Disclosure" would put the burden back on them. That won't help shareholders make better investment decisions. But it will distract them from more critical issues in judging funds -- like investment objectives, long-term performance, and risk.
