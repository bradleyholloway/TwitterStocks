 North Korea Seeks to Retain Reactor   By Fairclough, Gordon, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2005  "There are five parties that are in pretty close agreement," said Robert Zoellick, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, who was in Beijing for meetings with the Chinese government. "The key question is whether North Korea is willing to make the strategic decision it needs to make to go forward."  North Korea's chief negotiator, Kim Kye Gwan, told reporters that his country will give up pursuit of atomic weapons only if the U.S. "nuclear threat" is withdrawn and [Pyongyang]'s relations with Washington improve. But Mr. Kim also pledged to keep working to seek an agreement.  U.S. and Asian officials say Pyongyang wants the U.S. to abandon its policy of deterring attack on South Korea with a "nuclear umbrella" -- essentially the implied threat of nuclear reprisals. U.S. officials have rejected that demand.
