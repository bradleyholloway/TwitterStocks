 Harold Simmons Is Proposing to Acquire Rest of Sea-Land Corp. for $26 a Share   By By Karen Blumenthal and John D. Williams, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1986  Mr. Simmons said he made the bid, which would cost him about $450 million, because Joseph F. Abely Jr., Sea-Land's chairman, told him that Sea-Land's directors would seriously consider it.  Should Sea-Land accept the offer, the move would represent a dramatic turnabout by the Menlo Park, N.J., container shipping concern and score a major victory for the financier, who has a reputation for pursuing hostile takeovers. But Mr. Simmons's win could come at a high price. The shipping industry continues to be hurt by overcapacity and rate cutting, and Sea-Land is expected to report a large loss for the first quarter.  "I'm just hopeful that in the long term, it will pay off," Mr. Simmons said. "It's certainly not any cinch profit at that price." Mr. Simmons said he already has paid $218 million for his 39.3% stake in Sea-Land, representing about 9.2 million of Sea-Land's 26.5 million fully diluted shares.
