 Dart Group Moves Against Safeway's Takeover Defense   By By Paul M. Barrett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 11, 1986  Dart Group Corp. continued its push to acquire Safeway Stores Inc., attacking the supermarket chain's "poison pill" takeover defense in federal court in San Francisco.  Dart Group charged that Safeway's anti-takeover provisions "excessively burden" interstate commerce and constitute "a bad-faith manipulation of corporate machinery," in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal and state securities laws.  The disputed stock-purchase rights, issued by Safeway in February, enable shareholders to buy newly issued shares of the company's common stock at half price under certain conditions.
