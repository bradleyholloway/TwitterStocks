 Household Net Fell 17% as Sales Rose 4% in 3rd Quarter   By By Frank E. James, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1985  PROSPECT HEIGHTS, Ill. -- Household International Inc. reported that third-quarter net income dropped 17%, mainly because of weakness in its rental-car unit.  Household, which owns National Car Rental Systems Inc. and has interests in consumer finance, manufacturing and merchandising, said net for the quarter fell to $50.7 million, or 87 cents a share, from $61.3 million, or $1.10 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 4% to $2.06 billion from $1.99 billion.  Operating profit for Household's transportation business fell 41% for the quarter on 15% higher revenue. Despite good growth in car-rental activity, sluggishness in the used-car market continues to hurt that segment, Household said. A spokesman for the parent said the lower interest rates recently offered by auto makers have caused used-car sales to slow.
