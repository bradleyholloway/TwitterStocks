 Bush: A Big Win Brings Accountability   By By Albert R. Hunt, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 7, 2002  Before fitting the crown for King [George W. Bush], a few election aftermath heresies: The Bush mandate is enormously exaggerated, much of it blue smoke and mirrors, and a year from now Republicans may regret the accountability that comes from complete control; divided government has its political advantages.  This raises the stakes for the most acquiescent press corps since pre-Watergate; those liberal media conspiracy theorists never contrast the coverage of the Bush and Clinton White Houses. Will Mr. Bush be held accountable for who benefits from his tax cuts (hint: it ain't the $27,000-a-year waitress) and well beyond the opportunistically-timed sacking of SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, this administration's scandalous sandbagging of any corporate reforms?  To date, the Bush-manipulated press fails to note that even more than Mr. [Bill Clinton], decision-making in this White House is overwhelmingly poll and politically driven. When several big states nixed school vouchers, George Bush quickly abandons them. With West Virginia and Pennsylvania high on the 2004 must-win list, the free trader president embraces protectionist steel measures.
