 In Turkey, a Boost for U.S. Forces --- Prime Minister Gul Says He Will Advise Parliament To Back U.S. Troop Presence   By By Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  The Pentagon's rapid buildup of forces for a war with Iraq, expected to number some 150,000 troops by mid-February, got a key boost when Turkey's prime minister said his government would recommend parliament approve the presence of U.S. troops in the country, the first time Turkey has declared its backing for the U.S. war effort.  Large numbers of U.S. sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines are on the move to the Gulf. The USS Theodore Roosevelt and its battle group finished training this week in the Caribbean and began heading toward the region, where it will join three other aircraft carriers, each carrying 70 to 80 planes, already near enough to reach Iraq. If the U.S. decides to add a fifth carrier, the USS Kitty Hawk could move from its base in Yokosuka, Japan, very quickly. The USS Carl Vinson would move up from Hawaii to take its place. In addition, the U.S. is considering sending about two dozen bombers to Guam, from where they could reach North Korea, signaling that the U.S. isn't focused solely on Iraq.
