 The New New Federalism   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2005  It's clear the Controlled Substances Act gives the federal government the power to regulate, bar or restrict drug availability, up to a point. The question in Gonzales is whether the AG can use that power to accomplish a quite different public-policy goal -- the neutering of Oregon's assisted-suicide law -- simply by asserting that taking drugs to end one's life is not a "legitimate medical purpose" for a barbiturate. That law, we should add, was twice endorsed by Oregon voters in state-wide referendums.  Federalism is not a left-right issue, or at least it shouldn't be. It's a question of freedom and good governance. The last time assisted suicide came before the Supreme Court, in 1997, there was no such conflict. In Washington v. Glucksberg, the plaintiff sued seeking Supreme Court recognition of a Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and the Court ruled unanimously that no such right existed. At the end of the decision, Chief Justice [William Rehnquist] wrote: "Throughout the Nation, Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality and practicality of physician-assisted suicide. Our holding permits this debate to continue, as it should in a democratic society."
