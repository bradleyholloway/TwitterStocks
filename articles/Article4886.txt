 Christie's Sells a Van Gogh Portrait for $13.8 Million   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1988  Although the portrait of a 13-year-old girl became only the fourth most expensive ever, it sold for many times its last sale price in 1980 of $2 million. The telephone buyer of the van Gogh was identified only as "private collector, planet Earth" by the auction house. After the sale, Japanese dealer Kazuo Fujii said, "It's a good van Gogh, but not appealing enough to pay very, very high prices."
