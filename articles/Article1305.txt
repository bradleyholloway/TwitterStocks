 Firms Lose Round on Big Cash Payments   By By Laurie P. Cohen and Martha Brannigan, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1990  The ruling by Judge Vincent Broderick was the first decision in a heated battle that began in November when the Justice Department initiated unprecedented civil actions against two New York law firms.  Ruling immediately after a hearing, Judge Broderick said the law as previously stated by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York "is that neither the existence of an attorney-client relationship nor the payment of fees are protected by the attorney-client privilege."  The case was closely watched by defense lawyers across the nation, as well as the American Bar Association, which opposes the application of cash-reporting rules to lawyers. The IRS said recently that it planned to go after more lawyers in coming months, and the Justice Department is likely to bring civil actions against other law firms. While the New York ruling isn't binding in other jurisdictions, it is likely to be influential in future cases.
