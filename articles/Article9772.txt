 Patriotism, P. Diddy Shine in a Less-Than-Super Ad Bowl [1]  By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2005  Early respondents to The Wall Street Journal Online's poll on Super Bowl ads gave highest marks to Anheuser's military tribute, the brewer's "farm" ad showing a hoard of animals trying out for a job with the Clydesdale horses and Pepsi's "[P. Diddy]" spot.  "It just all seems watered down -- including Bud's ads," said Donald Weir, a 37-year-old New York comedian. While last year's Super Bowl will always be known for its "wardrobe malfunction," Super Bowl XXXIX could well be remembered as the game of the "commercial malfunction," said [Kaplan Thaler]'s Mr. [Robert Lee]. "Companies played it too safe." MSU ad professor Bill Ward echoed the thought. "The advertisers pulled their punches and the audience was bored."  Some tried-and-true Super Bowl ad tricks are starting to wear thin. While animal ads traditionally score well on Super Bowl Sunday, the online job-seeking site Careerbuilder's three ads featuring an office full of monkeys seemed silly. "They might as well have used goldfish," said John Staffen, an executive creative director at Havas SA's Arnold New York. "You can't go wrong with monkeys, but they did," added Mr. Weir, the comedian. Meanwhile, Bud Light's tough-talking cockatoo was also seen falling flat. "A talking animal and pretty girl . . . but no punchline," said Robert Kahn, a brand consultant at WPP Group PLC's Ogilvy & Mather.
