 Family Finances: Should You Get a Cellphone for a Preteen?   By Blackman, Andrew, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 2005  The marketing flurry is being driven in part by the cellphone industry's need to find new customers. "The U.S. market is fairly tapped out," says Linda Barrabee, senior analyst at Yankee Group. "Close to 80% of people between 18 and 65 have a cellphone. The youth market is where the opportunity is."  "The biggest concern is that you're putting the phone in the hands of a person who isn't used to paying the bills," says Mr. [Joseph Bradshaw]. Kids on a family plan generally have no limits on whom they can call or how long they can talk, so "it's possible for the kids to run up huge bills by going over the plan minutes."  Prepaid plans offer a little more parental control. "It's a way to give your child a phone where you can ensure you won't go bankrupt," says Sam Simon, chairman of the Telecommunications Research and Action Center in Washington, D.C. "Prepaid plans charge more per minute, but you can keep the child within a budget."
