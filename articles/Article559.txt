Paul Blair, the former Baltimore Oriole all-star center fielder, who later joined the Yankees and retired in 1980, has been hired as head baseball coach at Fordham University.  The university's athletic department will make the announcement at a news conference Monday.  Blair, who is 38 years old, was the object of controversy last month when the New York State Board of Regents passed a regulation allowing people who are not certified teachers to coach high school sports teams. The ruling was prompted by the Port Chester School District's attempt to sign Blair as a varsity baseball coach. State teachers' organizations opposed the ruling.  Blair played on six World Series teams, including the 1978 Yankees, and won eight Gold Glove awards.  Illustrations: photo of Paul Blair
