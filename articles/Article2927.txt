 Dow Jones Sues Cantor Over Data Payments   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2001  In the suit, Dow Jones said Telerate was effectively out of business after the sale and didn't owe money to either [Cantor] or Market Data. In addition, Dow Jones spokesman Steve Goldstein said Cantor has started to sell the data to other providers and would therefore be paid twice for the information.
