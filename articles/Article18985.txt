 GE and Lockheed Plan to Swap Holdings --- Companies Would Reap Large Financial Gains In Stock and Asset Deal   By By William M. Carley and Frederic M. Biddle, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 1997  The companies said GE expects to record a gain of more than $1 billion and Lockheed Martin a gain of more than $300 million when the deal is completed, which is anticipated before year end. The value of GE's stake in Lockheed Martin has soared since 1993 when Martin Marietta Corp., later acquired by Lockheed, bought GE's aerospace business in exchange for stock.  GE and Lockheed Martin share prices rose yesterday amid a surge on Wall Street. Lockheed Martin gained $4.0625 to $99.125 while GE climbed $2.50 to $67.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  For its shares, GE will acquire the stock of a newly formed Lockheed Martin subsidiary. The unit's businesses will include Lockheed Martin Aerostructures based in Middle River, Md., which mainly produces thrust reversers for jet engines built by GE and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. A GE spokesman said this business would be managed by GE's big jet-engine unit.
