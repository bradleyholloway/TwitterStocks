 Politics & Economics: In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2007  Judges across Bolivia held a one-day strike to protest President Evo Morales's attempts to overturn the suspension of four Supreme Court justices he appointed last year. Some 900 judges and magistrates sat out work as the Supreme Court issued a statement calling the president's actions "an intent to cast aside the judicial branch and implant a totalitarian regime." Mr. Morales said he respects the separation of powers and would accept the justices' suspension "if it is constitutional."
