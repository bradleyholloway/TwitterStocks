 Adaptive, Tumbleweed Hit Hard, As Nasdaq Slumps Into New Year   By By Larry Bauman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2001  Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks fell sharply, with the Nasdaq concluding the first trading day of the new year below its lowest closing level of 2000.  Moreover, the Nasdaq Composite Index was below 2300 at the 4 p.m. conclusion of trading. The index fell 178.66 points, or 7.23%, to 2291.86, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 21.04, or 4.35%, to 462.49.  Neff (NYSE), a Miami equipment-rental company, shot up 60%, or 75 cents, to $2. United Rentals, a Greenwich, Conn., equipment-rental company, offered to acquire a 72% equity interest in Neff, which would give United more than 80% of shareholder voting rights, for $37 million of common and preferred stock and $277 million of assumed debt. Neff said its board appointed a two-member committee to consider the offer.
