 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Moral Relativism Issue   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1988  Before the campaign moves beyond the Pledge, the ACLU and the furlough controversies dogging Mike Dukakis, it's worth trying to articulate why so many voters find these such compelling issues. The common thread is that the vast majority of Americans reject the strain of moral relativism that runs so strongly through the nation's cultural and intellectual elite.  Take the Pledge issue. William Bennett tells us he was at first stunned to realize as he toured the 30 schools he had identified as models that each one began the school day with either the Pledge or "The Star-Spangled Banner." Former Secretary Bennett concluded that this was no coincidence. "The valuable lesson for the children," he says, "is that there is something greater than themselves that they owe allegiance to, but that is also part of them."  There is the same relativism in spades in the ACLU issue. The big problem with the ACLU is that it has evolved into an absolutist institution that goes to the mat to invent "rights," but that utterly refuses to acknowledge any of the correlating duties of citizens. As L. Gordon Crovitz notes nearby, the ACLU even opposes workfare on the ground that welfare recipients cannot be required to do anything in exchange. Who's to say that work is better than idleness?
