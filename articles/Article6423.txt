 Mechanics Try Online Sales Pitches   By Higgins, Michelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2005  "Customer loyalty to us is everything," says Brad Petersen of Petersen Automotive, a service repair shop in Escondido, Calif., that uses an automated e-mail system from OnStation Corp. to send out service reminders to customers. "If we don't stay on top of technology and what the customer's needs are, it's easy for them to be lured away by a coupon they see for somewhere else," he says.  Other shops are posting digital photos of customers' cars online so customers can watch the progress of the work. "It's like having surgery," says Darrell Amberson of Lehman's Garage Inc. in Bloomington, Minn., which uses AutoWatch, provided by See Progress Inc., to let customers view their cars. "Some people would be fascinated by it. Others might not like it," he says.
