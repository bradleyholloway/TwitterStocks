 In Search of the Next `Hot Box' --- Tiny BlueArc Hopes for Hit With Data-Server Machine Aimed at Network Clogs   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2001  Things evolved differently in communications networks, where designers of traffic-switching boxes such as routers have long reached for ultrahigh speed by using chips that are tuned for a single purpose. Mr. [Geoff Barrall], who used to design such networking devices, believed that speciality chips also could handle repetitive tasks in data storage and retrieval, a main function of servers. These special chips do such things as interpreting the basic technical protocols and filing schemes used by popular operating systems. So instead of employing a Jack-of-all-trades microprocessor as its brain, each BlueArc server uses an assembly line of specialized chips that do a few tasks at blinding speed.  BlueArc designed its machines using chips that can be quickly reprogrammed by customers to fix bugs or make other changes. And, while the company is initially focusing on the storage market, it may eventually adapt the same principles for an ultrafast machine dedicated to running a single program, such as an Oracle Corp. database.  Mr. Barrall, a 32-year-old Ph.D. who originally focused on robotics, initially caught the eye of Ottawa-based Celtic House International, the first of three venture firms that have invested $37 million in BlueArc. It recruited Chairman Gianluca Rattazzi, an Italian-born entrepreneur who started three Silicon Valley companies and helped woo Mr. [Enrico Pesatori], who holds the chief executive title and had worked at Olivetti SpA, Zenith Data Systems, Tandem Computers Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. and Compaq. The 130-employee company started in England and still conducts most manufacturing there.
