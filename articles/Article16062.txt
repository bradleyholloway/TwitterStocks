 Watching the Web: Retirement-Planning Sites Have a Sheen of Certainty   By By Jared Sandberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 5, 2001  We reviewed five retirement-planning sites. Two of them, Financial Engines and mPower, are kinds of arms suppliers to the financial-services industry. They are the underlying technology to hundreds of employee-sponsored plans. If your company uses Vanguard to manage its 401(k) plan, then you're using Financial Engines' system. Last week, Microsoft's MSN Money began upgrading its retirement planning site using mPower's system. Others, such as Morningstar ClearFuture and Intuit's Quicken.com Retirement Planner, are popular financial-service sites. Lastly, we looked at an employer-sponsored plan administered by Fidelity Investments.
