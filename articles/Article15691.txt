 Citibank U.K. Teams With Virgin Unit To Offer Web Banking, Free Net Access   By By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1998  In a new marketing venture, the British division of Citicorp's Citibank has teamed up with British Internet provider Virgin Net, a unit of Richard Branson's Virgin Group PLC, to offer all its bank-account customers free, unlimited Internet access. Takers will be able to do all their banking on-line at a new Citibank Web site. They also will earn the bank's special interest rate, more than a dozen times as high as most British banks', on new checking accounts. They will get a free Internet account with Virgin, which normally would cost about 150 ($245) annually.  Hoping to reap maximum benefits with minimum investment, Citibank has gone about tackling the consumer market directly. Rather than set up physical branches in the United Kingdom, the bank has launched jazzy telephone-banking services, automated teller machines with advanced functions, and a proprietary service that lets customers perform account functions through a personal computer. With the new Internet venture, Citibank is hoping to capture the growing number of U.K. consumers who surf the Web daily and are keen to keep track of their finances on-line.
