 Cards of Fate: In U.S. Visa Lottery, Winners Find Luck Can Be a Fickle Friend --- The Dimovs Settle in Nicely But Road Here Proves A Big Gamble for Others --- The View From a Trailer Park   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1997  Gordana Sokolovska got lucky. She used to live in a stucco house in Skopje, Macedonia, a Balkan country prone to ethnic tension and earthquakes. Then she moved to an old trailer outside Detroit, a mid-American city prone to racial tension and tornadoes.  On the theory that millions ache to live in America, and in the interest of adding variety to the immigrant population, the U.S. State Department picks names out of a computer once a year in a global sweepstakes called the Diversity Immigrant Visa Lottery. The lottery is for people with no American connection -- no job offer, no uncle. Without connections, people don't get into the U.S. unless they sneak in. That's why so many do sneak in, and why so many who come legally -- more than 800,000 this year -- usually come from the same set of countries.  Mr. Dimov had studied in Moscow. He met his 29-year-old wife there; she is Russian, a choir director by profession. Mr. Dimov had performed in France, Italy and Spain, spent a year with an orchestra in the Canary Islands, a year in the Czech Republic. A reviewer for a Skopje newspaper once praised his "aggressive energy" and "blazing sound." But when Mr. Dimov got a job away from his country, he had to get a visa, and the job was often gone before the visa arrived.
