 Getting Going: Fund Indexers, Take (Another) Bow   By Clements, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2005  To gauge the chances of beating the market, I often look at the results of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX), one of the country's largest funds, with $104 billion in assets. This year, the Vanguard fund has slightly underperformed its competitors in the "large blend" category. But over the past 10 years, it has beaten all but 23% of these competing funds, according to Chicago fund researcher Morningstar Inc.  "People get into the market at the wrong time, and they get out of the market at the wrong time, and they chase the hot funds," he notes. "The model doesn't build in human mistakes, beyond the mistake of buying higher-cost funds."  As Mr. [Allan Roth] puts it, investing in actively managed funds is "like smoking two packs a day and expecting to live to 100. It could happen. But you certainly aren't helping your odds."
