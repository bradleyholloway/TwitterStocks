 Clear Channel Outdoor, IHS Go Above IPO Price in Debuts   By Cowan, Lynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2005  Clear Channel Outdoor's $630 million IPO was the first large deal since fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings Inc. went public in August. The IPO market has gone through a slow October, and recently has indicated investor appetite for some smaller deals, so Clear Channel Outdoor IPO's was seen as a test of how well the market would support a larger offering.  Clear Channel Outdoor is loaded with debt, most of it owed to its parent. Even after the proceeds of the IPO are used to pay down part of the debt, Clear Channel Outdoor's total debt amounts to about $2.7 billion, approximately $2.5 billion of which is owed to Clear Channel Communications. Put another way, the debt as a percentage of total capitalization was a lofty 98% before the IPO, and is 70% after the offering; the company now has no net tangible book value, even after paying off part of the debt.
