 Hollinger Holder Wants Fees Paid To CEO Returned   By By Elena Cherney, The Wall Street Journal,  May 21, 2003  The payments were part of "noncompete" agreements under which Mr. [Conrad Black], who is Hollinger's chairman, chief executive and controlling shareholder, and other executives agreed not to compete with the newspapers they sold. "We think the payments were improper, and the board didn't focus on it," said Chris Browne, a Tweedy Browne principal. Hollinger publishes London's Daily Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Mr. Black has faced mounting criticism in recent months from minority shareholders. In addition to the noncompete payments, the minority shareholders object to management fees paid to Mr. Black and other executives through a closely held company, Ravelston Corp. Ravelston, which indirectly controls Hollinger, was paid $23.7 million in fees last year and $29 million in 2001.
