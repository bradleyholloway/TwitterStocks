 Hasta la Vista   By Kedrosky, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2007  Microsoft president Steve Ballmer sees this, of course. In a recent interview he said that many of the company's engineers had already turned their attention from Vista to search and ads. The game plan: Improve search to be better than [Google]'s, while drawing more of the rapidly growing search-centric advertising pie to Microsoft's own network.  Meanwhile, Microsoft is trapped between Vista and a Google-created hard place. It is much like what happened to IBM years ago when Microsoft laid it low, with the company looking slow and the industry no longer afraid. Competitors now see Windows as a heavy weight around Microsoft's neck, one that keeps the company safely occupied on a treadmill far from their own businesses. That is why the best news for them in the last few days came when Microsoft began talking up a new version of Windows set for 2009. Yeah, go for it guys, knock yourselves out.
