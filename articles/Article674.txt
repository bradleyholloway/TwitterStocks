 Farm Bankers, Enjoying Rare Political Entree, Lobby for Inclusion in Any Farm Credit Bailout   By By Monica Langley, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1985  The four farm-state bankers arrive early at the Capitol Hill restaurant and decide who will sit beside the senator they've invited to lunch, and who will sit across from him. A round of beers later, Sen. Edward Zorinsky rushes in with an aide.  The Nebraska Democrat knows one of the bankers as a loyal constituent. Following introductions to the other three, Sen. Zorinsky tells them point blank, "You're a secondary priority to me right now. We've got to pass a farm bill first."  Mr. Gerhart and the others run commercial banks that lend primarily to farmers. They find themselves in trouble because of the sagging farm economy and the growing number of farmers defaulting on their loans. Private bankers, like Mr. Gerhart, in farm regions are being pulled down by the same problems now confronting the agriculture lending system, the federal Farm Credit System. He and his colleagues are in town to persuade Sen. Zorinsky and other lawmakers to include them in any bailout of the system.
