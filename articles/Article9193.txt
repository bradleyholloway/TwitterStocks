 NYSE, in a Break With Heavyweights, Calls for End to System Linking Markets   By By Greg Ip, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2000  The current system was created in 1978 to connect all the markets that trade NYSE-listed stocks and was meant to give the customer of any stock market access to the best price even if it is on another market. Previously, an investor who sold a particular NYSE stock on one market might get a lower price than was available at the same time on another market. The markets linked by Congress under this system are the Big Board, the five regional stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent.  The NYSE report was written by a committee made up of the board's 12 non-Wall Street directors. The proposal is part of a broad review of the Big Board's place in the rapidly evolving stock markets presented to the stock exchange's board yesterday. But not all Wall Street board members apparently were comfortable with all the proposals. NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso, who clearly backed the proposal personally, said the board unanimously "embraced" the initiatives, but stopped short of saying it endorsed them.  The proposal, however, flies in the face of what some of the Big Board's biggest member firms, in particular Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co., have been pressing for since last summer. Concerned that trading volume is becoming too fragmented among competing venues, making it hard to ensure an investor gets the best price, they have pressed for strengthening linkages, and some have even proposed that all stock orders be routed through a "central limit order book," which would send an order to whichever market was first to post the best price on the stock.
