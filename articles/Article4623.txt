 Bookshelf: A Revolutionary Primer   By By Gary Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 1986  But in Nicaragua today, a beginning reader will probably be handed a book of a rather different kind. "The Dawn of the People" (Nicaraguan Ministry of Education, 156 pages) is a textbook that was designed for Nicaragua's famous literacy crusade in 1980 and has been reissued yearly by the Sandinista government since then. Subtitled "Notebook of People's Basic Education," it can be found in Nicaraguan homes from the Miskitia jungles to the Managua earthquake ruins. Divided into 26 lessons, with abundant black-and-white photographs for illustration and "Let's Read and Comment" exercises for drill, "The Dawn of the People" speaks volumes about Sandinista education.  The first phrase of the basic reading vocabulary taught here is "la Revolucion" -- "the Revolution." Cecilia Rivera, a teacher in a Sandinista Collective of People's Education, explains that this phrase "has got all the vowels." The next word in the lesson, however, offers no such advantage. It is "lucha," which means "struggle." The main practice sentence accompanying this lesson is: "The FSLN struggles." (FSLN is the Spanish abbreviation for the Sandinista National Liberation Front.) To embellish the point, page six shows a photograph of a wall with FSLN painted on it. Indeed, with similar pictures of graffiti accompanying every lesson, "The Dawn of the People" serves among other things as a training manual for reading propaganda. Such indoctrinational graffiti appear all over present-day Nicaragua, often painted by the Sandinista People's Army and the Sandinista Youth party branch.  Lesson Two presents the word "chavalo" -- the Nicaraguan Spanish term for boy: "Let's read the recitation: The boy was in the struggle." Then, "Let's read and write: Long live the FSLN." A photo shows a painted graffito saying, "Viva el Che," together with a picture of Che Guevara from the Cuban revolution.
