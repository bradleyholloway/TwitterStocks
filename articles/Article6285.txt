 FDA Reconsiders Approval for Copy Of a Pfizer Drug   By Abboud, Leila, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 2004  Dr. Reddy's had used the route, called 505(b)(2) after the law that created it, to gain approval to market its version of Pfizer's Norvasc, which had U.S. sales last year of $1.9 billion. Instead of applying for a true generic of the blood-pressure medicine, which must be biologically equivalent to the original, Dr. Reddy's came up with a slightly different molecule. This allowed Dr. Reddy's to skirt Pfizer's patents and submit different data than required for a true generic.  The strategy appeared to work. In November, the FDA approved Dr. Reddy's application over Pfizer's objections. In its lawsuit, Pfizer argued that the FDA improperly used Pfizer's intellectual property, specifically data, in its original application for Norvasc, to approve Dr. Reddy's drug. Pfizer maintains that the agency isn't allowed to refer to Pfizer's data in evaluating Dr. Reddy's drug. If the agency did, it could call the approval into question, and may strengthen Pfizer's legal challenge.
