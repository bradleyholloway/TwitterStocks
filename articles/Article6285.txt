 Schreiber Awaiting Possible German Extradition --- Political Scandal's Central Character Will `Tell It All'   By By J.J. Moskau Handelsblatt Correspondent, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2000  THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT apologized to former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1997 and agreed to pay legal costs of Mr. Mulroney's libel suit over allegations that he received kickbacks on a contract to sell Airbus planes to Air Canada. An article about German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber in Wednesday's edition mentioned the allegations against Mr. Mulroney, but failed to say that the government called them "unjustified." (WSJ -- Jan. 17, 2000)  Mr. Schreiber is a hard man to pin down. The state prosecutor's office in Augsburg, Germany, wants to question him regarding tax evasion. The federal government is investigating his involvement with Mr. [Helmut] Kohl in the slush fund scandal. And since 1995, criminal investigators in Canada have been probing Mr. Schreiber's involvement in a scandal in which former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was alleged to have accepted kickbacks in connection with the sale of Airbus planes to Air Canada.
