 Krispy Kreme Is Picking Up Good Vibrations   By By Motoko Rich, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 1998  Krispy Kreme is striking out West with an expansion to California that could create more stores than it has on its home turf in the Southeast.  In its most ambitious bid to expand, the Winston-Salem, N.C., maker of the sticky, airy concoctions has signed a development agreement with Los Angeles-based Great Circle Family Foods LLC to open as many as 42 franchise stores in Southern California within the next four to six years. Krispy Kreme also is negotiating with developers it declines to name to create 30 stores in Northern California.
