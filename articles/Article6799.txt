 WEEKEND JOURNAL; Entertainment & Culture -- Movies: Indie Films Go to School; To Combat Superheroes, Small Flicks Offer Teen Angst (and Genghis Khan)   By Lauren A.E. Schuker, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2008  "Hamlet 2" is the musical version: the comedy, which set off major bidding wars at this year's Sundance Film Festival, centers on a washed-up actor-turned-high- school drama teacher (Steve Coogan) who writes a musical sequel to Shakespeare's "Hamlet" for his class to perform. In contrast to studios like Warner Bros. that have kept the plots of coming films like "Sex and the City" and "The Dark Knight" under tight wraps, Paramount Vantage is screening "American Teen" at about 150 high schools and colleges this month and next, to stir up buzz.
