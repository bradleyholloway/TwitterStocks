 Price Increases in Asia Fan Inflation Fears in U.S.; As Production Costs Rise, Imports Could Get Pricier; Fed Not Eager to Boost Rates   By Barta, Patrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2004  Those pressures matter to the U.S. and other countries because so many of the manufactured goods that Americans buy these days come from Asia. In some cases, products are made entirely in Asia and then sold in the rest of the world, so that any price increases ripple out to consumers in other countries immediately. In other cases, U.S. companies buy small components in Asia for use in products manufactured elsewhere. As the costs of those components rise, the U.S. companies face pressure to charge more for the finished goods. For U.S. consumers, all of this could ultimately mean higher prices for everything from DVD players and television sets to furniture and brake pads.  In the U.S., labor is a much bigger share of production costs than raw materials. And, with unemployment still relatively high in the U.S., wage growth has slowed sharply in the last year, allowing profit margins to expand. "Although prices for some commodities have risen, underlying consumer price inflation only now looks to be stabilizing at a low level after falling for some time," Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson said last week.  Henry Willmore, the chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York, says he believes the odds are "more than 50%" that Asia-inspired inflation will pick up noticeably in the U.S. in the next year. One reason, he says, is that the commodity price runup has been broader -- and has lasted longer -- than most other commodity booms of recent decades. And unlike past commodity surges, the current spike "is largely out of control of U.S. policymakers," since the impetus for much of the inflation is in Asia.
