 Divisions Resume on Iraq Inspections   By By Marc Champion in London and Guy Chazan in Moscow, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  Analysts stress that public statements made in the rancorous diplomacy over Iraq shouldn't be taken at face value. France, for example, has never ruled out participating in a war against Iraq and acknowledges that the U.S. has approached its defense ministry about how it might contribute. And U.S. and British sabre-rattling is aimed in part at keeping Iraq guessing, says Kenneth Payne, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank.  The differences echo the debate leading up to the U.N. inspections. The five permanent members of the Security Council -- the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and China -- spent two months arguing over the wording of resolution 1441, which provided a fresh mandate for the weapons inspectors to return to Iraq. Those negotiations -- between France, backed by Russia and China on one side, and the U.S., backed by Britain, on the other -- turned on whether the resolution would authorize an attack on Iraq, or whether military action would require a further Security Council resolution. Both sides claim the resulting compromise endorses their view.
