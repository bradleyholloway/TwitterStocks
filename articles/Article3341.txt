 Investor's Calendar   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2004  Decision Time: The 17-month saga of Oracle's $9.2 billion hostile bid for PeopleSoft could end this week. Friday is the deadline for PeopleSoft shareholders to accept a $24-a-share offer that Oracle says is final. PeopleSoft's board, however, vowed to resist the takeover even if a majority of shareholders tender their shares.  Earnings Come In: Cisco Systems said quarterly net income rose 29% from a year earlier, but offered a tepid outlook; Target said its profit jumped 78%, thanks to the sale of its Mervyn's stores and higher profit from its discount chain; Dell's net jumped 25% as U.S. business customers boosted spending on PCs and foreign markets showed strong demand.
