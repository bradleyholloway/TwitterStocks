 Vitamin Makers Still Face EU Objections   By By Stephen D. Moore, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  Along with Switzerland's Roche Holding Ltd. and Germany's BASF AG, the manufacturers include France's Aventis SA and Japanese chemical giants Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., Eisai Co., and Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. BASF agreed to acquire most of Takeda's bulk-vitamin operations three months ago, but the Japanese parent remains responsible for the former unit's share of legal settlements and other costs associated with the vitamin case, a BASF spokesman said.  The latest agreement pushed the total for fines and legal settlements to $2.2 billion. In May of last year, Roche and BASF pleaded guilty in a U.S. district court to price-fixing charges, and paid record fines under a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. Roche paid a $500 million fine and BASF $225 million. In addition, some executives from each company pleaded guilty and served jail terms as a result of their roles in the scandal. American authorities cracked the cartel with the cooperation of Rhone-Poulenc SA, a French company that merged with Hoechst AG to form Aventis last year.
