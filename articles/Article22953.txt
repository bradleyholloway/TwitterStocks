 Pentagon Plans Security Enclaves In Afghanistan --- In Protecting Aid Workers, U.S. Shows New Emphasis On Aid and Reconstruction   By By Ahmed Rashid, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2002  Since U.S. troops arrived in Afghanistan late last year, Washington has focused on catching remnants of the ousted Taliban regime and its al Qaeda allies, and has shunned Afghan calls to help provide security in warlord-controlled regions outside the capital, itself patrolled by an International Security Assistance Force comprising about 4,800 from two dozen nations. Kabul has also called on the U.S. to take a bigger role in reconstructing the country.  That worries aid agencies, who say the presence of the armed, uniformed officers blurs the distinction between soldiers and aid workers, making aid workers vulnerable to attack. Aid officials say the fact that U.S. officers work closely with regional warlords actually strengthens them and undermines efforts to broaden Kabul's writ beyond Kabul. Because the U.S. enclaves would rely on the goodwill of pro-U.S., anti-Kabul warlords, some fear, there would be little role for representatives of the central government.  At the same time, the new plan also has the Pentagon expanding its reach into the aid and reconstruction business, once the purview of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which U.S. officials familiar with the situation say the Defense Department has steadily sidelined in Afghanistan. They say USAID was not even consulted about the new plan, but presented with the decision by the Pentagon. That has given rise to talk in Washington about a similar situation in a post-Hussein Iraq: a U.S. general serving as a short-term ruler and controlling the country's reconstruction.
