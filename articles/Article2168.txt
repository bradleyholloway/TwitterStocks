 GOP plans small-business tax relief ahead of expected minimum-wage hike   By Georges, Christopher, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1996  As prospects brighten for a minimum-wage increase, Republicans plan a tax-relief package to soften the blow to small businesses. GOP leaders and their small-business allies oppose the minimum-wage hike, but they concede they are powerless to prevent it. The tax-cut bill, to be introduced on May 14, 1996, is an effort to mitigate what House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer calls "the inevitable job losses that will occur if the minimum-wage is increased."
