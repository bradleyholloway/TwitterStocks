 View / Music: Clubs Go Upscale With `Downtempo'   By By Martin Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 2002  "Austria has hardly any music industry, so many producers and musicians develop their sound independently," said Mario Kamien, half of the duo dZihan & Kamien, one of the leading downtempo groups. Vienna is also home to Kruder and Dorfmeister, a duo whose mid-'90s recordings, both together and in side projects such as Mr. Dorfmeister's Tosca and Mr. Kruder's Peace Orchestra, helped spur downtempo's rising popularity.  In 1995, around the time that Kruder and Dorfmeister were releasing their first dub reggae-influenced recordings, Mr. Kamien met Vlado dZihan while both were studying jazz in Vienna. The students bonded over a shared fondness for Turkish music and over building a new multicultural definition of what it meant to be European. Mr. Kamien, who is from Switzerland, and Mr. dZihan (pronounced Gee-hahn, hence the unusual capitalization), from Sarajevo, both grew up on a broad diet of international sounds from Europe's new immigrants. They initially put those sounds together in a five-piece band that included several Turkish instruments as well as Swahili rapping. Discouraged by an encounter with a major label, they pared back to a duo and began creating singles for their own Couch imprint.  Although downtempo, like most electronic music, is still primarily a DJ-based genre, these duos are edging back into organically created sound. For their recent record-release party in Vienna, dZihan & Kamien assembled what Mr. Kamien calls the Gran Riserva Orchestra, a 20-piece band with eight Turkish string musicians and several brass instruments, and Thievery Corporation is planning to tour next month with a small ensemble. Mr. [Eric Hilton] says the challenge of the setting will be to maintain downtempo's unique style.
