 Canada May Alter Its Sales-Tax Plan As Criticism Grows   By By John Urquhart, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1989  The Canadian government is expected to revise its planned 9% consumption tax because of growing criticism, political analysts said.  Business and consumer groups are complaining that the proposed value-added tax is too high and has too many exemptions. It is to take effect Jan. 1, 1991.  Critics of the tax are "pushing the government in the direction it probably wants to go anyway," said John Evans, president of the Trust Companies Association, a trade group. He predicted the government will revise its tax plan before it introduces legislation later this year to implement it.
