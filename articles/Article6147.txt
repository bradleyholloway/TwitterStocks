 Cruise Missiles Are Dumb Weapons to Use in Iraq   By By Lawrence F. Kaplan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 1998  It was in Baghdad during the Gulf War that we first got to know them. Whistling around street corners and across our television screens, cruise missiles seemed tailor-made for our video age, the smartest of a new generation of smart weapons. Should the U.S. strike Iraq again in the coming days, we can be certain cruise missiles will once again be widely employed.  They are, for these very reasons, exactly the wrong tools for the job. The missiles themselves are not so much the problem -- smart weapons are, after all, only as smart as their users -- but rather the manner in which they have been allowed to dictate strategy in America's ongoing conflict with Iraq. U.S. policy makers have used cruise missiles as a means to wield military power with minimal risk, minimal uncertainty and minimal mess. Yet the resulting "metal on metal" attacks have merely led Saddam to conclude that he enjoys more room to maneuver than Washington's rhetoric would suggest -- as indeed he does. An empty building here, an antiaircraft site there: The inanimate objects cruise missiles have been designed to destroy are mostly things the Iraqi dictator can do without.
