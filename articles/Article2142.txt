 Intrinsic value: Riklis plays McCrory creditors perfectly   By Lowenstein, Roger, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 1996  Roger Lowenstein comments on Meshulam Riklis, who Lowenstein says has seemingly enjoyed a lifetime of lucrative deal making while his bondholders have gotten poorer. Riklis promised the creditors of McCrory Corp, which has just finished four years in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, 100 cents on the dollar and a speedy recovery from Chapter 11. This never happened and McCrory Corp's financial condition has continued to deteriorate.
