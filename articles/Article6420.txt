 BFGoodrich Snares Contract With Airbus For Superjumbo's Landing-Gear Systems   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2001  Business with Airbus, in particular, is slated to grow much faster. Airbus currently accounts for about 14% of [Goodrich]'s aerospace sales, a percentage expected to rise to 20% over several years, reaching roughly the same proportion as Boeing, which has been fairly stable at around 20% of aerospace sales. "We've always seen Airbus as a particularly strong competitor" to Boeing, Mr. [David Burner] said in an interview.  Goodrich said the contract could total between $2 billion and $3 billion, assuming 300 of the A380s are built by about 2025. Airbus so far has 66 firm orders and options for more than 50 of the planes, though some industry officials doubt that anywhere near 300 will be built. Goodrich, for its part, says its projections are relatively conservative, as some Airbus market studies envision closer to 400 planes being built.  The pact makes Goodrich the exclusive supplier of the A380's nine-ton main landing-gear assemblies, as well as a pair of lighter gears under each wing. It also gives Goodrich primary responsibility for designing and maintaining the systems -- the type of long-term technical support tasks reserved for top-tier aviation suppliers. A smaller contract for the nose gear was awarded to Messier-Dowty, an affiliate of France's Snecma Group and until now the sole supplier of landing-gear systems on all Airbus models.
