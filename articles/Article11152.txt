 Thornburgh Had Role in Withholding Panama Drug Report From Congress   By By Andy Pasztor and Rick Wartzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1988  Richard Thornburgh, President Reagan's nominee for attorney general, participated in a decision to withhold from Congress portions of a 1975 Justice Department report that detailed drug-trafficking by high-ranking Panamanian officials and revealed corruption inside the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  The documents -- including memos to Mr. Thornburgh and excerpts of the report itself -- were obtained by The Wall Street Journal. There isn't any suggestion of illegality on Mr. Thornburgh's part, but the documents do raise questions about his handling of matters that could be legally and politically sensitive.  Mr. Thornburgh, whose confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled for today, said through a spokesman earlier this week that he had "no recollection of ever seeing or reviewing" the report or any of the related documents. But after reading some documents provided by this newspaper, the spokesman yesterday said Mr. Thornburgh recalled only that "his involvement in this matter was peripheral," and that he didn't remember making any "substantive decisions involving the report or its aftermath."
