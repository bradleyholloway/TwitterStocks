 Natural-Gas Bills Forecast to Rise By 50% in Winter   By Cohen, Stephanie I, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2005  Hurricane [Katrina] cut off close to nine billion cubic feet a day of natural-gas production. Less than a month later, Hurricane [Rita] prevented production of eight billion cubic feet a day at its peak.  The utility industry says it receives no benefit from natural-gas price spikes. Utilities pass along the price they pay to their customers, which typically accounts for about 70% of a customer's bill, Mr. [Roger Cooper] said. Utilities make their profit by delivering natural gas to customers at rates approved by state regulators.
