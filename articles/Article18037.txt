 Survivors' Stories: Prague Spring Leaders Try to Salvage Lives After 22 Years Adrift --- Historian, Economist, Singer And Poet, Careers Ruined, Are Exploring Freedom --- Issue: Renewal, Not Revenge   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1990  PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia -- In an old woman's living room, Pavel Seifter has rolled back the faded carpet and positioned his ladder at the French windows overlooking the museum on Wenceslas Square. "No good, these windows," he says. They are each double-layered, and divided into six panes. More work for the window washer.  The 52-year-old Mr. Seifter dips his rag into a bucket of soapy water and climbs the ladder. He looks small and drawn in his baggy, blue work suit. His beard has almost gone gray. He wets the top left pane and wipes it clear with a squeegee.  No, Mr. Seifter isn't a character from a novel by Czech exile Milan Kundera. He is a historian, a student of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and one of its victims. In 1968, he was beginning his career as a 30-year-old lecturer in modern history at the University of Prague. He belonged to the Communist Party. A year later, he had been expelled from the party and his post had been abolished. The heart was cut out of his career. He found this job in 1972. Mr. Seifter has washed windows for 17 years.
