 The American Civilization: American Journey: A Nation's Hopes Clash with Its Weariness on Jefferson Avenue   By Farney, Dennis, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 1992  The various cultures found along Jefferson Avenue in St Louis are featured as a mirror of American civilization. The street stretches between a black church barbecue selling crispy pig snoots at one end and white working-class "Hoosiers" drinking Budweiser at the other. In between, the street brushes against downtown and more than a century of American architecture, reflecting the forces and ideas that shaped the city and the country.
