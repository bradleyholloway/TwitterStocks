 Deals & Deal Makers: New HSBC Chief Will Minister U.S.-Loan Foray   By By James R. Hagerty and Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2003  Early last year, HSBC stunned its stock and corporate-finance teams by slashing cash bonuses for 2001 to zero, though strong performers were given HSBC shares. While other banks also were reducing bonuses in the face of falling markets, HSBC's cut was much deeper. Some of its top-rated analysts defected to other firms.  After the purchase is completed, HSBC will derive about a third of its earnings each from the Americas, Europe and Asia. That diversity, said Alex Potter, a banking analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, will make HSBC "a unique opportunity to play global growth." By contrast, Citigroup relies on North America for about 70% of earnings.  Mr. Green, who holds degrees from Oxford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, serves part-time as an Anglican minister and sometimes composes his sermons while flying to HSBC's outposts. He worked as a British civil servant and a consultant at McKinsey & Co. before joining HSBC.
