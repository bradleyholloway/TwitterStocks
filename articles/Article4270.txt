 Polish Leader Considers Radical Overhaul of Economy --- National Debate Centers on Role of Competition in a Communist Society   By By Barry Newman, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1987  WARSAW, Poland -- Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, his resolve strengthened by Mikhail Gorbachev's vision of modern socialism, is about to attempt a fundamental restructuring of his country's feeble economy.  Only the dreamiest economic thinkers talk of selling off the state's huge assets, but beyond that some of the proposals being put forward here wouldn't seem out of place before British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. Mixed enterprises, bankruptcies, higher pay for harder work, banking competition, and the sale of stocks and bonds are a few elements likely to appear in a prospectus for reform expected from the government soon, perhaps within weeks.  As in the Soviet Union, change would come from the top; the Communist Party would retain ultimate control over the economy. But in Poland, the possibilities under discussion could make for greater market orientation than has existed even in Hungary, the most economically liberal East European nation.
