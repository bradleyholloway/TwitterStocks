 Japanese Traditions Protect Bridgestone From Threat of Raiders   By By Bill Spindle, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2000  0. Bridgestone would be a large mouthful for a rival tire maker to swallow, even at its current shrunken market value. For example, the market value of U.S. industry leader Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. is only about one-third that of Bridgestone. And if leading tire companies such as Goodyear or France's Groupe Michelin wanted to buy into Bridgestone, they might face opposition from U.S. regulators concerned about one company dominating too much of the North American market.  Perhaps the biggest obstacle would be the fortress of shareholders loyal to Bridgestone management. These include a scion of Bridgestone's founding [Hiroshi Ishibashi] family, who owns a 3% stake, and a philanthropic foundation that is Bridgestone's largest single shareholder, with a 9% stake. Overall, analysts say that at least one-quarter of Bridgestone is owned by shareholders who wouldn't act against the wishes of the current management.
