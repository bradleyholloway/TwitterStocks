 Taste -- Houses of Worship: Not Free to Believe   By By Paul Marshall, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 5, 1999  To most Westerners, the incineration of Baptist missionary Graham Staines and his two young sons by Hindu militants in Manoharpur, India, a few weeks ago may have appeared to be an isolated tragedy. In fact, it is but an especially gruesome manifestation of a sectarian nationalism escalating throughout Asia, where national identity is now increasingly equated with religious homogeneity.  As the Staines killings attest, Christians in India have joined Muslims and Sikhs as targets of radical Hindus. Violence often erupts during elections, since Christians usually support the more secular Congress Party. Radical Hindus charge Christians with imposing "forced conversions" on reluctant Indians, but such accusations are baseless and stem in part from a fight for votes.  Similarly, the radical Hindus' depiction of Christianity as "foreign" -- and their inclination to demonize Christian missionaries -- are attempts to deny Christianity's two-millennium history in India and the fact that indigenous Indian Christians outnumber foreign ones by about 14,000 to 1. The four nuns raped in September 1998 -- in a particularly savage incident -- were Indian, not foreign.
