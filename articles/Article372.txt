 Interpublic's FCB Is in Talks To Hire Grey New York's Blamer   By Vranica, Suzanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2003  FCB, which does work on behalf of marketers such as Kraft Foods Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Adolph Coors Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., has made strides in its effort to turn itself around after client defections sent it reeling in 2001. The shop recently was invited to pitch for Yum Brands Inc.'s KFC account, a business that has annual billings of $225 million. Mr. [Brendan Ryan] has been revamping leadership teams in several of FCB's largest offices. Earlier this month, David Bell, chief executive of Interpublic, said, "FCB's growth numbers are improving."
