 The Gallery: Japan's China Syndrome   By By Matthew Gurewitsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1998  Washington -- "Twelve Centuries of Japanese Art From the Imperial Collections," on view exclusively at the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery through March 8, follows by less than a year the closing of "Treasures From the National Palace Museum, Taipei," which surveyed the culture of China from the Shang dynasty (c. 1600-c. 1100 B.C.) to well into the Ch'ing (1644-1911) and progressed in triumph from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and Washington's National Gallery. Try as one may to view the current show in isolation from that vastly larger, infinitely more varied, and far more widely traveled predecessor (which also drew from imperial collections), it is impossible to pass through the Sackler without thinking of China.  Exhibit B: an 11th-century scroll (number 9 in the catalog) of poems from the anthology "Wakan roeishu," with alternating texts in Chinese and Japanese. Viewers intimidated by calligraphy may take comfort from James T. Ulak, curator of Japanese art for the Freer Gallery of Art and the Sackler and of this show. Scholars aside, Mr. Ulak relates, the Japanese public is as clueless about this most prestigious yet most intimate of the Far Eastern arts as the average Westerner. Yet calligraphy -- ingeniously chosen -- accounts for nearly one-third of the 76 works on display. (For a variety of perfectly valid reasons, many of the works rotate on a schedule that is exasperatingly Byzantine.)
