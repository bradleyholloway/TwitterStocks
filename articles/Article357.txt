 A Test of India's Democracy --- Politician's Anti-Muslim Innuendo Could Boost Ruling Party   By By Joanna Slater, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 25, 2002  Crisscrossing the state, Mr. [Narendra Modi] is a whirlwind of playful humor and strident condemnation. He slams his political opponent, the Congress Party, and attacks Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, calling him a supporter of terrorism and referring to him as "Miya Musharraf." (Miya is a term used to address Muslims. Mr. Modi uses it as a pointed and mocking reference to Mr. Musharraf's religion.) At one stop early in his campaign, Mr. Modi recited an ugly stereotype about Muslims having too many children. After the outcry that followed, his rhetoric has become considerably more careful.  Born in 1950 in the northern Gujarati town of Vadnagar, Mr. Modi spent time as a youth with the local unit of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or Association of National Volunteers, the parent organization of the Hindu nationalist movement. He later became a full-time volunteer. In 1988, he joined the BJP, helping to organize processions aimed at drumming up support for the party. Rising through party ranks in Gujarat and later in New Delhi, Mr. Modi developed a reputation as an organizer. But it wasn't until last year that he became a candidate, taking over as Gujarat's chief minister.
