 Chemical Firms Resist Lures to Expand --- Response Cautious to Boom in Export Demand   By By Amal Kumar Naj, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1988  As the weak dollar has sent some U.S. export markets booming, the chemical industry -- strained for production capacity and unable to keep up with demand -- faces the temptation to expand.  Burnt by early-1980s problems of excess capacity, a stagnant market and poor profit margins, chemical manufacturers shed plants and products drastically until about two years ago, when the restructuring began to show modest profits. Now companies have entered a holding pattern -- cautiously finding ways to increase output with minor adjustments, expanding specialty lines where they have little competition, and beginning to diversify into related products.  Though the industry is expected to boost capital spending 14% this year, only about one-third of that increase is marked for physical expansion -- considered normal growth but insufficient to meet projected demand, analysts say. Meanwhile, the recent jump in export demand has brought the lure of bigger profits, if the companies were willing to build new plants or aggressively expand existing facilities.
