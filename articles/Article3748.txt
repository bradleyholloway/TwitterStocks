 UAW Taps GM as Lead Negotiator; Role May Put Auto Maker In Better Position to Forge Deal on Health-Care Costs   By John D. Stoll and Jeffrey McCracken, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2007  Shares of the auto maker surged 10% yesterday to $33.29 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading after the news that UAW President Ron Gettelfinger had signaled to his bargaining team that he is open in principle to creating a union-controlled benefits trust. Such a trust -- known as a VEBA, for voluntary employees' beneficiary association -- would allow GM, Ford and Chrysler to unload billions in retiree health-care obligations. Now GM, which has been fund raising for two years in order to restructure health-care benefits, may be in an ideal position to see its demands for revisions on medical expenses become a reality.  A person close to the negotiations said GM was picked as the target because the auto maker said more things that Mr. Gettelfinger and the UAW wanted to hear. Specifically, the auto maker addressed the goal of a "steady stream of money to keep a VEBA solvent." Among the fears the UAW had in agreeing to the VEBA was that the money would eventually run out because of the rapid inflation associated with health care or that the fund's investments wouldn't return as much as projected.  During those negotiations, the UAW suggested GM and the union consider setting up a VEBA that the union would run, according to people familiar with the talks. GM declined to pull the trigger because the UAW wasn't willing to give GM a generous enough discount on its liability. At the time, GM had about $20.5 billion in available liquidity.
