 Encouraging Rises in Ad Budgets Seen by Many Marketing Officials   By By Kevin Goldman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1992  Executives attending the four-day conference are seeing encouraging increases in ad budgets for the first time since the advertising slump took hold in early 1991. Senior marketing executives for such heavyweight spenders as International Business Machines and Campbell Soup say they expect increases of 6% or more in 1993.  The mood of the executives descending on Hot Springs is a powerful indication of where the advertising industry may be headed. The 224 corporations represented by the ANA collectively spent approximately $30 billion in 1991 on advertising, according to Leading National Advertisers, which tracks ad budgets of companies. Ad spending actually declined 1.5% in 1991 from the year before, the first such drop in 30 years. This year's billings may rise only 1%, which translates into a real decline after inflation, according to the pessimistic forecast of Saatchi & Saatchi's Zenith Media unit.  Advertisers cite a sense of a coming turnaround for the economy and concern over increasing competition among rival brands as the reasons for the uptick in ad spending. The forecast is all the more unusual because 1993 follows a year with many special events that usually afford a one-time boost in ad budgets, such as the Winter and Summer Olympic Games and the presidential election.
