 Disney Dissidents Vow a Fight If Eisner Isn't Ousted by 2005   By Bruce Orwall and Joann S. Lublin, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2004  Much may come down to Disney's performance. "If growth is going to stagnate again as it has numerous times over the last seven or eight years," said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Richard Greenfield, then the critics may get renewed traction. But their attacks would be blunted by continued earnings momentum; Disney this year is poised to post 50% earnings growth. Disney has a board meeting scheduled for next week, and the situation illustrates how thorny Mr. Eisner's planned two-year transition period could be. Executive-search firms began sounding out Disney board members about landing the CEO search when Mr. Eisner's troubles with shareholders deepened earlier this year. Those feelers apparently fell on deaf ears.  Mr. Eisner said late last week that he wouldn't seek a new contract as CEO at the end of his current deal in September 2006. Messrs. Disney and Gold earlier this year led a campaign to oust Mr. Eisner, which culminated in 45% of the shares voted at Disney's last annual meeting opposing Mr. Eisner's re-election to the board. Mr. Eisner was stripped of the company's chairmanship at that time.
