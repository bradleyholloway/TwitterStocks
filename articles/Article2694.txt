 Petsmart Inc. Widens Policy For Refunds   By By Frederic M. Biddle and Khanh T.L. Tran, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2000  The latest evidence of that skittishness came Friday with the disappointing initial public offering of Pets.com Inc., which traded at the $11 offering price at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after reaching as high as $14.  The pet-supply business is a $23 billion industry, much of it food that often is discounted. Petsmart's marketing moves are designed to help tie together its store, electronic-commerce site and catalog, and seem to be aimed at both traditional and online rivals.  Petsmart plans to announce that it will fully refund or credit returns of any pet product purchased from "any retailer associated with the sale of pets or pet supplies," in addition to its own catalog, purchases from its partly owned Petsmart.com online unit and its 493 stores in the U.S. and Canada.
