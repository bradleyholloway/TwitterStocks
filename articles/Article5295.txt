 Kuwait to Seek $5 Billion Loan From Banks --- Borrowing Is a Major Step In Attempt to Finance Its Recovery From War   By By Craig Forman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1991  The borrowing, Kuwait's first international syndication in the London-based Euromarkets, is part of its plans to raise roughly $10 billion to finance trade and reconstruction of the emirate's war-ravaged economy. Proceeds will be used for redeveloping the nation's oil sector and for road, telecommunication and other infrastructure, said Ahmad Abdul Qader Mohammad, director of debt management for Kuwait Investment Authority, which manages the government's financial position.  The $5 billion credit will be led by J.P. Morgan & Co., with National Bank of Kuwait and other international commercial banks also playing key roles. Mr. Mohammad said Kuwait hopes to have a group of as many as two dozen banks lined up for the credit by the end of the month, with the transaction completed by year's end.  In a preview of Kuwait's sales pitch for skeptical lenders, Mr. Mohammad gave one of the clearest -- and rosiest -- portraits yet of Kuwait's current financial position. Many bankers and businessmen have wondered about doing business in Kuwait amid continuing economic and political risk. The biggest worries are over Saddam Hussein's continued role as Iraqi leader, confusion over the pace of Kuwait's reconstruction and worries about Kuwait's internal political stability and promised transition to greater democracy.
