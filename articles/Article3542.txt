 Energy: Energy Firms Have Big Bets on LNG Imports; As Industry Predicts U.S. Demand May Surpass Growth Estimates, Experts Fret Over Supply   By Jakab, Spencer, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2006  "We've seen drilling productivity basically halved over the last five to seven years," said Keith Rattie, chairman and CEO of Questar Energy, which is active in a number of nonconventional fields. "All that implies a rising cost structure for U.S. producers, and that of course creates an opening for LNG." Some of the marginal nonconventional plays require prices of $5 to $6 per million British thermal units in order to garner acceptable returns. Sempra's Mr. Felsinger asserts that even with the multibillion capital investments required, gas in the form of LNG can be profitably shipped from anywhere in the world to North America for $4 to $5 per million BTUs. In New York, natural-gas futures settled at $7.007 per million BTUs, up 36.1 cents.  U.S. government forecasts project a growing role for LNG in the U.S. natural-gas mix, growing from 3% last year to 14% by 2020. Some experts say that U.S. dependence eventually will grow much faster. The key point of disagreement is the U.S. Energy Information Agency's contention that domestic output will start growing again. "The most optimistic [forecast] comes from the EIA, and they have missed it for years," said Don Felsinger, Sempra's chairman and chief executive. "They're still too optimistic."
