 Mixed Day For Stocks; Bonds Climb --- Blue Chips, Nasdaq Decline Amid Worry Over Profit Reports   By By Dave Kansas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 1995  Stock prices rebounded from their lows to finish the session mixed as investors continued to fret about third-quarter earnings. Bond prices rose and the dollar strengthened.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.56 to 4749.70, its second consecutive negative session. But it ended well above its intraday low of 4716.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index, beset by the groggy performance of technology stocks, dropped 7.12 to 1020.45.  Yesterday, investors hammered away at their favorite theme of the past few weeks: Buy stocks with more stable earnings outlooks, such as beverage, food, drug and utility issues, and sell the economically sensitive issues. Such a defensive strategy, analysts said, reflects the growing tension in the marketplace as investors gear up for the release of third-quarter corporate earnings.
