 Cutting a Deal at the Other U.S.-Soviet Talks   By By Elliott Hurwitz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1985  Next week, a U.S. trade delegation arrives in Moscow to discuss ways to facilitate U.S.-Soviet trade. This meeting -- the first of its type in six years -- has been the subject of both attention and misinterpretation as to its purpose and implications.  What does it mean that a delegation is going to Moscow now? Will we be giving the Soviets large credits or selling them high-technology equipment? Are we, through trade linkages, on the verge of a new era of detente? What is our policy toward U.S.-Soviet trade?  The purpose of the meeting is actually quite simple. Under the terms of an economic cooperation agreement made in 1974 and recently extended, we and the Soviets have agreed to discuss ways to facilitate trade between our nations. The U.S. delegation, led by Commerce Undersecretary Lionel Olmer, will suggest possible areas of mutual trade expansion as well as ways to expand business ties and enhance Soviet knowledge of U.S. products. The Soviets can be expected to respond with their own ideas in these areas. If sufficient progress is made in next week's meeting, there may be a follow-up mission by Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige later this year.
