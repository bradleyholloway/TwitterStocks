 Reformers in Iran Try to Defuse Clashes --- University-Student Group Vows to End Protest As Unrest Intensifies   By By Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1999  Iran's six-day-old student demonstrations heated up yesterday, with reports of tear gas, warning shots and bus burnings in Tehran, but pro-reform forces allied with President Mohammed Khatami redoubled efforts to cool the tensions.  The largest university-student group in Iran yesterday said it was ending its protests. A group of 111 intellectuals, including dissidents who have openly sought separation of religion from government, yesterday issued a plea for an end to slogans that would provide ammunition for "opportunists and adventurers." And newspapers that had threatened to suspend publication today, to protest the Draconian press law that started the week of unrest, said they would publish as usual, on the insistence of the pro-Khatami Ministry for Culture and Islamic Guidance.  Mr. Khatami, who had been winning his two-year struggle with government hard-liners before student unrest began on Thursday, is trying to avoid violence that could be blamed on pro-reform forces. And Iran's hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with whom Mr. Khatami holds frequent private consultations, issued an emotional appeal for calm on Monday, despite personal invectives hurled at him. The big question is whether either man can control extremists.
