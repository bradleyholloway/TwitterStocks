 Corrections & Amplifications   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2001  (See: "International: Germany's E.ON to Buy Powergen for $7.4 Billion --- Move Caps a String of Deals In Europe's Power Sector; World's No. 2 Provider" -- WSJ April 10, 2001)  AN INCORRECT DRAWING appeared with the continuation of a Marketplace article yesterday on AmeriMED clinics in Mexico. The man shown was real-estate developer Eloy Vallina, not Mark Engelman. A correct photo of Dr. Engelman appeared on page B1. (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ April 12, 2001)
