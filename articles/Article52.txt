 Pact by Southland Financial Seeks To Revamp Debt   By By Michael Totty, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1987  Southland Financial Corp. said it reached tentative agreement to give up a piece of its Las Colinas planned community in exchange for a much-needed capital infusion from Lincoln Property Co.  Southland called the agreement "the first step" in its efforts to restructure about $470 million in debt of its Las Colinas Corp., the unit that owns and develops land in the 12,000-acre Las Colinas development northwest of downtown Dallas.  Under the agreement, closely held Lincoln would receive a 20% stake in a new partnership formed to own, manage and develop about 3,500 acres of land under development in Las Colinas. In exchange, Lincoln would provide $50 million in first mortgage notes to the partnership.
