In looking for ways to help cut the Federal budget, Secretary of Education Bell needed to look no farther than his department's most sacred cow - college student aid. His assault is heresy to colleges and parents who have run up the program to an annual cost of nearly $5 billion. Tuition assistance has grown by 150 percent in just three years, epitomizing the Government's loss of control over spending. Mr. Bell is looking in a fat and proper place.  The Federal Government began helping college students a generation ago, when the Russians frightened America by winning the race to put a man in orbit. Gradually, the focus of the program shifted from technological training to the raising of opportunity for poorer citizens. Another big change occurred in 1978. In a burst of generosity to the middle class, Congress expanded the number of families eligible for outright tuition grants and made all students eligible for guaranteed low-interest loans.  No limit was placed on these good intentions. Thus appropriations for direct grants have had to rise from $1.3 billion in 1976 to $2.6 billion in fiscal 1981. And the number of subsidized borrowers rose from a million in 1978 to 2.3 million, increasing the cost to Government to $1.6 billion. Even parents who can afford tuition can hardly afford not to use the loans; they can earn twice their cost in very safe investments.  What's more, many of the borrowers have become so casual about repayment that the Justice Department has had to begin pursuing hundreds of them through the courts.  There are three ways to cut this program without imposing great hardship on many students or colleges. The Government should charge more interest for the guaranteed loans; they now go for only 9 percent. Loans should be denied to families that don't really need them. And the least needy families now getting grants should be given loans instead.  The Treasury now charges no interest for the time that student borrowers spend in college. If the interest were merely deferred until repayment begins after graduation, the Government could save about $100 million at once and up to $2 billion a year in five years.  As the author of a handbook on tuition aid has written, ''Parents would be stupid not to take advantage of all this largesse even if they don't need the money for tuition.'' What does that say about taxpayers who let such a program run on?
