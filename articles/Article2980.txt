 Lawyer's Ties Questioned In AOL Accord   By By Nicholas Kulish, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2002  Joe Sims, an antitrust expert and partner at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue here, was solicited by the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department on how the two agencies should divide responsibility for antitrust reviews. Mr. Sims had represented AOL against the FTC in its 2000 review of the merger with Time Warner, and continues to represent the company.  Mr. Sims e-mailed a document recommending that alignment, signed by himself and three co-authors and addressed to FTC Chairman Timothy Muris and Assistant Attorney General Charles James, on Dec. 21. The document also suggested reviews of cable acquisitions and mergers be handled by the antitrust division, led by Mr. James since he left Mr. Sims's firm to join the Bush administration last year. AOL Time Warner has signaled an interest in further cable acquisitions. Both the recommendations were incorporated in the final agreement.  FTC and Justice officials defended their process. "Given the diversity of perspectives of those who provided their views, and given their different client interests, Mr. Sims's participation did not pose a problem," said an FTC antitrust official. Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said Mr. Sims and the others were consulted "in their capacity as former enforcement officials who were able to provide an additional constructive perspective on the clearance process, just as we consulted current enforcement officials."
