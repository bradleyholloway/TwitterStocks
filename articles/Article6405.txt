 Taste -- Houses of Worship: In God He Trusts   By By Mark Tooley, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2001  After his swearing in, George W. Bush will become the nation's third practicing Methodist president. Rutherford B. Hayes was the first and William McKinley the last, 100 years ago. (James Polk and Ulysses Grant converted to Methodism on their deathbeds.) With the exception of Jimmy Carter, Mr. Bush is also possibly the most outwardly religious president since McKinley, who held hymn-sings in the White House.  Mr. Bush says he became a committed Christian at age 39, thanks to counsel from Billy Graham, a Baptist. He also credits a nondenominational Bible study for shaping his faith. But Mr. Bush became a Methodist, after an Episcopalian and Presbyterian upbringing, when he married his Methodist wife, Laura. After 20 years of affiliation, the Bushes seem unlikely to leave Methodism when they look for a church in Washington.  Foundry's minister, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, vigorously defended Mr. [Hillary Clinton] during the Monica scandal. A proponent of abortion rights and gay marriage, Mr. Wogaman says that he has invited Mr. Bush to attend Foundry. But prominent Republicans have not fared well there. Bob and Elizabeth Dole, longtime Foundry attenders, very publicly left that church in 1995 when Foundry's theological and political stances veered too far left.
