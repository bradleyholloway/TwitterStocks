 China's Textile-Export Explosion Falters --- Quota, Production Woes Make Some Buyers Shy Away   By By Julia Leung, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1988  SHANGHAI, China -- Coming out of nowhere in the past few years, China has become one of the world's biggest textile and apparel exporters. But it may have come too fast; its economic modernization has produced domestic shortages of some raw materials, while its flooding of the U.S. market led to a crackdown that has mired its American trade in uncertainty.  China is striving to produce better-quality goods and diversify into new markets, following the path set by Hong Kong and Taiwan in the 1970s to increase the value of their exports to the U.S. and Europe. But unlike Hong Kong and Taiwan, China doesn't have an army of entrepreneurs who can respond quickly to change -- and in the textile world, change comes fast.  Textile and apparel exports, vital to China's modernization program, have replaced crude oil as the country's biggest foreign-exchange earner. But following several years of rapid expansion, textile exports are expected to taper off this year, though garment sales will remain strong, Mr. Su says. Combined textile and apparel exports last year totaled $9.56 billion by Chinese reckoning.
