 Municipal-Bond Investors Move to the Sidelines Amid News of Big Losses by California Fund   By By Thomas T. Vogel Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 2, 1994  The excitement in the municipal bond market kept attention from the Treasury bond market where prices dropped slightly. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped less than 1/4 point to 94 2/32 to yield about 8.01%, compared with nearly 8% on Wednesday. Many Treasury players chose to stay on the sidelines ahead of today's widely awaited report on U.S. employment in November.  Last year Orange County and its various authorities sold nearly $225 million in debt issues, according to Securities Data Company. So far this year the county and its various authorities have sold more than $535 million of new debt issues. If the losses affect the county's ability to make interest payments on its debt, a credit downgrade could follow. Standard & Poor's Ratings Group is slated to meet with county officials next week to discuss the county's credit rating. Even the threat of a downgrade could push county bond prices lower as investors worry about the county's ability to service its debts.  Because the county released information on its investment fund losses late yesterday, it was too late for most money managers to act on the news. Even today, it may be difficult to quickly assess the effects of the losses since many bond issues from the county may be backed by sources of revenue completely unrelated to the county's investment fund, such as taxes or tolls, said Mr. Schroer of Franklin Resources.
