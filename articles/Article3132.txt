 The Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll: War's Success Is Boon to Bush --- Poll Shows President Gains on Issues on Home Front and Abroad   By By John Harwood, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2003  The optimistic mood echoed across a range of foreign-policy issues. Three-fourths of Americans endorse Mr. [Bush]'s decision to take military action against Iraq, a substantial increase from before the conflict in January. Despite controversy over the Bush administration's failure to win United Nations support for military action, only one-third say the war has hurt Americans' standing in the world. The proportion that says the war has increased the threat of terrorism against the U.S. fell sharply to 32%, from 52% just before the war.  The glow of military victory, despite the lingering, scattered hostilities in Iraq, also is boosting Mr. Bush on domestic issues. By 49% to 42%, Americans approve of his handling of the economy, reversing the finding of the Journal/NBC poll in January. On handling the war on terrorism and tax policy, Americans now give a wider edge to Mr. Bush and Republicans over Democrats in Congress than they did in January. Even on the traditionally Democratic turf of Social Security and providing prescription drugs for seniors, the president has eaten into the opposition's lead.  Not so clear is what Americans want done about it. A 49% plurality said Congress shouldn't pass Mr. Bush's plan, while 43% favor the plan. That opposition, though narrower than the public expressed late last month, helps explain why the House and Senate both have signaled that they will sharply reduce the size of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut.
