 Impeachment of the President: Flynt, Nemesis of Rep. Livingston, Haggles With Women Accusers   By By Ellen Joan Pollock, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1998  Publicly, Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is crowing. His offer to pay for information about the affairs of government officials led to the resignation of House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston of Louisiana.  But behind the scenes, Mr. Flynt is mired in tangled negotiations over what the bill will be. He says he has agreed to pay four women for their stories about Mr. Livingston; so far, he has advanced them a total of about $200,000. The understanding, he says, is that if Hustler publishes a story using their information, the women will share $1 million. But now, Mr. Flynt has been scooped by his own story.  In addition, Mr. Flynt says Hustler has shelled out roughly $300,000 to people who have provided information about other officials. He claims he has enough information on six officials -- a GOP senator, a House Democrat and four House Republicans -- to warrant publication. Part of what is holding up publication, he says, is the haggling over money.
