 Venture Bets on Wi-Fi in Public Places   By By Nick Wingfield and Shawn Young, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  The venture indicates how much the technology companies hope to profit through growing adoption of Wi-Fi. Intel, for instance, has announced plans to put Wi-Fi capabilities in a forthcoming microprocessor, dubbed Banias, that could make wireless capabilities a standard feature in computers. IBM will install the wireless equipment and back-office systems for Cometa, while AT&T will operate the network connections for the service.  Cometa is the latest effort to capitalize on the growing popularity of wireless fidelity, a technology standard also known as Wi-Fi and 802.11 that has been widely adopted by hardware companies. As prices on Wi-Fi gear have come down, the technology has been a hit among homes and office users, who use the technology to share Internet connections. Research firm In-Stat/MDR estimates users will snap up about 16 million Wi-Fi devices, which typically plug into laptops and other computers, this year.
