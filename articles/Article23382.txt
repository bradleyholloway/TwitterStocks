 Stock Market Quarterly Review: High Anxiety in the Bond Market; Inflation and Rate Jitters Tax the Nerves of Investors; A 'Bernanke Decoder Ring'?   By Hudson, Michael, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2006  "What we saw was an absolute changing of the guard at the Fed," said Paul Nolte, investment director for Hinsdale Associates, a boutique investment-management firm in suburban Chicago. "People are still not used to how [Ben Bernanke] works. The analogy I've been using is: We're all looking for a Bernanke decoder ring."  Robert Smith, chairman of Smith Affiliated Capital in New York City, said economic forecasters are using the wrong data to foretell what is to come for inflation and economic expansion. "There's this constant flogging of domestic statistics," Mr. Smith said. "Everyone talks globally but constantly flogs domestic statistics -- and constantly preoccupies themselves with lagging indicators." In his view, measures of global inflation and global-manufacturing capacity run counter to many U.S. indications, and provide evidence that inflation isn't as serious a threat as U.S. inflation hawks would have investors believe.  It has been a quarter with "more drama, more suspense, more volatility. And corporate treasurers hate volatility," Mr. [Steve Bohlin] said. "At the beginning of the year, everybody was talking 'One and done.' Now we're still at maybe one or two more [rate increases] and done. But people are not quite so quiescent about it any more."
