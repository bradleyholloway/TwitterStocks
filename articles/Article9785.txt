 Will Old Rulings Play a Role In Terror Cases?   By Bravin, Jess, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2005  Historically, such "unlawful" combatants "not only would not get POW status, they were executed on point of capture," he says. Under the "traditional paradigm, if you were a lawful combatant, you got everything. That has nothing to do with how unlawful combatants were treated."  "I have no doubt that in due course more senior people will be charged," he says. "If we were holding this conversation two years from now and we weren't prosecuting anyone higher up," it would be hard to argue the U.S. was being consistent with its World War II precedents.  The archives also make clear that some of the practices employed by the U.S. today resemble those that U.S. military commissions condemned when Americans were on the receiving end. The U.S. considered as war crimes such tactics as solitary confinement, sleep and sensory deprivation, manipulation of meal schedules, forcing men to answer questions while naked or restrained in painful "stress positions," and failing to register prisoners with the International Red Cross. Today, all have been approved or practiced at Guantanamo and other U.S. facilities.
