 Scores Are Killed In Wave of Blasts At Shrines in Iraq; Karbala, Baghdad Attacks Inflame Ethnic Tensions; Constitution Is Delayed [1]  By Dreazen, Yochi J, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2004  The blasts in Baghdad and the predominantly Shiite city of Karbala offered a vivid reminder of the steep security challenges confronting the U.S.-led coalition as it prepares to transfer power to a sovereign Iraqi government this summer. It was the deadliest single day in Iraq since the U.S. invaded last year and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein. Iraq's Governing Council declared three days of national mourning, and delayed indefinitely the signing of an interim constitution scheduled for this week.  The attacks triggered outpourings of anger at the U.S. on the part of Iraq's Shiite majority. Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, a Shiite cleric who has been locked in a political war of wills with the U.S. occupation authority over the timing of elections, blamed the U.S. for failing to maintain security in the country. In a statement released by his office in Najaf, Mr. Sistani blamed the U.S. for failing to prevent foreign militants from entering Iraq and carrying out the attacks.  In Baghdad, U.S. military officials said it is possible the bombings were a coordinated attack by Sunni Muslim militants who crossed into Iraq from other countries. U.S. officials recently released what they described as a memo from a Jordanian linked to al Qaeda describing plans to try to incite a civil war between Iraqi factions. Yesterday's violence almost certainly will stoke ethnic and religious tensions, which have complicated U.S. attempts to devise an acceptable plan to wind down the occupation and hand over sovereignty.
