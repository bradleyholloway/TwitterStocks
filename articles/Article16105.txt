 At the Boston Symphony, the Right Man for the Job   By By Greg Sandow, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2001  I'VE HEARD nothing but acclaim for James Levine's appointment as music director of the Boston Symphony and was thrilled to hear the news myself. I've also been impressed that the excitement doesn't only come from music critics; it echoes just as strongly inside the music business, especially from people who work with orchestras. Sometimes we hear questions about other new appointments -- about Franz Welser-Most, for instance, music director-designate of the Cleveland Orchestra. Does he really have the stature for the post? Is Christoph Eschenbach good enough for Philadelphia? Is Lorin Maazel plausible at all for the New York Philharmonic? But nobody has doubts about Mr. Levine. Everyone assumes -- and rightly so -- that he deserves to lead any world-class orchestra he wants.  For Mr. Levine, I have a question. He's known for his support of the past generations' atonal modernism, and conducts complex atonal works by Schoenberg, Webern, Berg and Milton Babbitt, both at the Met and in symphonic concerts he conducts with the Met orchestra at Carnegie Hall. His programs this year in Munich -- to the degree that he programs new music there at all -- have the same emphasis. But at the Met he also commissioned an opera by John Corigliano, who's hardly an atonal modernist, and works (upcoming) by Tobias Picker and Tan Dun, whose styles are also more contemporary. So what will he do at the Boston Symphony? Will he present a full spectrum of new American music, including pop-related works by young composers?
