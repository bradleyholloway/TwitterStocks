 Notable New Movies   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 1997  There's as much joy in the suburban Connecticut of "The Ice Storm" as in Mudville. Worse yet, the weather is rotten -- the emotional weather, the moral weather and the sky weather, which, on a Thanksgiving weekend in 1973, threatens a big and slippery chill. This movie, directed by Ang Lee ("Sense and Sensibility"), is one of those studiously acted, mostly mirthless comedies of manners that wins points for supposed seriousness; it's "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" played for angst and rue instead of laughs. In documenting the spread of the sexual revolution to the leisure class, "The Ice Storm" tells you everything you never wanted to know about how glum sex can be, whether practiced by adulterous neighbors suffering from chronic low-grade depression, or undertaken by their kids in undress rehearsals.
