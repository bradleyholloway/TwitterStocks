 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Showdown in Sarajevo   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1992  Western recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, however belated, was the firm stand needed to persuade Serbia's communist president, Slobodan Milosevic, that military action had cost him more than it gained. But the depth of his education will be tested by the postelection violence erupting among Serbs in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Bosnia-Hercegovina, a poor, mountainous region of 4.2 million inhabitants, is a microcosm of what was formerly Yugoslavia. There is no such thing as a Bosnian -- in either nationality or language. Muslim Slavs, who converted to Islam during 400 years of Ottoman rule, account for about 44% of the population. Orthodox Serbs make up 31% and Roman Catholic Croats 17% of the republic.  After the Croatian and Slovenian declarations of independence in June 1991 that set off civil war, Bosnia-Hercegovina maintained a feeble balance of terror, kept peaceful by the belief that hostilities there would be even harder to control than in Croatia. Radovan Karadzic, the main Serbian leader in Bosnia, said that if all-out war should erupt, "Northern Ireland would be like a holiday camp compared to Bosnia."
