 Market Indexes Drop on Worries Ahead of Economic-Data Release   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2000  Technology stocks, which had rallied so impressively just a week ago, showed they, too, weren't immune to worries about higher rates. Hewlett-Packard lost 5 9/16 to 132 1/2, Intel (Nasdaq) fell 2 1/16 to 119 1/16, and Cisco (Nasdaq) declined 1 15/16 to 66 1/16, as bellwethers in the sector evidenced some vulnerability.  Several of the stocks in high technology that have fallen then staggered to their feet-to be tripped again and gotten back up-stumbled again. Rambus (Nasdaq), for example, up 57% from its intraday low on April 17 through Tuesday's close, lost 10 to 199 1/2. National Semiconductor, ahead 26% from its April 14 intraday low at Tuesday's end, lost 3 9/16 to 58 7/16. Powerwave Technologies (Nasdaq), which rose 84% from its April 14 intraday low to Tuesday's finish, dropped 25 3/16 yesterday to end at 176 1/16.  But for once, technology, while not escaping a sell-off, didn't absorb the worst of it. While the Nasdaq 100 Index, a measure of the 100 largest Nasdaq-traded stocks that includes a number of blue-chip technology issues, fell 1.8% on the session, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/Keefe Bruyette & Woods Index, a measure of banks, dropped 1.9%. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Stock Index, a measure of companies that make capital goods, basic materials and industrial products, fell 2%.
