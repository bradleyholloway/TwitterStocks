 Free Market in Public Schools? Not Yet   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2005  The research by Caroline Hoxby detailed in your "Novel Way to Assess School Competition Stirs Academic Row" (page one, Oct. 24) isn't about anything remotely resembling "free-market competition." And, by the way, "free-market competition in public schools" is an oxymoron. Nothing in our public school system, or even the early 1990s Milwaukee voucher program, remotely resembles the key elements of free-market competition. For example, entrepreneurship, profits, product differentiation and price change aren't part of our public school system or Prof. Hoxby's paper, and they were virtually absent from the original Milwaukee program that allowed 1% of the children to transfer to private schools under significant, market-stifling constraints.
