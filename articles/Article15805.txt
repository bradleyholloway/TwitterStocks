 Public Storage Is `Comfortable' With Estimates --- Company President Agrees With Analyst Figures For 1st Quarter, Year   By By Ann Keeton, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1999  Harvey Lenkin, president and chief operating officer of Public Storage Inc., is "very comfortable" with First Call Corp.'s estimate that the company's funds from operations were 60 cents a share in the first quarter.  In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Mr. Lenkin also said he agrees with Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.68 a share for all of 1999.  In a presentation to analysts in Chicago earlier this week, Mr. Lenkin said Public Storage's pickup and delivery service, which has lost money since its introduction in 1997, will break even in the second half of 1999. The service lowered 1998 results by about 30 cents a share, Mr. Lenkin said.
