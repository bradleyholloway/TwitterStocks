 Workspaces: Seeing Stars   By By Patricia Davis, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 1997  -- WHO: Dawn M. Keezer, director of the Pittsburgh Film Office, created in 1990 to promote and assist the film industry in western Pennsylvania by sourcing talent and locations.  -- WHAT YOU SEE: Zombies. The homegrown variety. Hanging behind Ms. Keezer's desk is a poster for George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead," filmed in 1968 at locations around Pittsburgh. To date, staff have facilitated the production of 48 feature and television films. And Ms. Keezer has the framed posters to prove it -- "Silence of the Lambs," "Roommates," and "Only You" fill up walls of the office's herringbone wallcovering.
