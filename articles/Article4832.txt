 The Crash of '87: Most Institutions' Stakes Stable During, After Crash, Study Says   By By Cynthia Crossen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1987  Most institutions sat immobile during and immediately after the stock market crash, as short-term traders bought and sold the same shares repeatedly, according to a study by Georgeson & Co.  "There was no collective decision by institutions that something drastic had happened," said Richard A. Wines, vice president of quantitative analysis at Georgeson, a proxy solicitation and investor relations firm. "About 60% of the activity appears to be multiple transactions by people like traders, raiders and other short-term, speculative holders without regard for the fundamental values of the companies."
