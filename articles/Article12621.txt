 Formula for the Future: Stephen Richards wants Elderhostel -- now 25 years old -- to take some new risks   By By Glenn Ruffenach, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2000  To discuss some of these questions, Encore spent a recent afternoon with Stephen H. Richards, Elderhostel's president. Formerly a top executive at the American Red Cross and the International Rescue Committee, Mr. Richards, 53 years old, joined Elderhostel in 1997 and found, as he puts it, an "extraordinarily successful" organization -- but one that wasn't "as actively involved in program development as it needed to be." Like Elderhostel's founders, he has been anything but shy about addressing that problem and others.  Elderhostel isn't a travel agency; Elderhostel isn't a tour group. We try to make it very clear in our publications and our catalogs and our Web site what Elderhostel is. I think everyone within Elderhostel -- from the board [of directors] . . . throughout our staff -- recognizes that education is what Elderhostel is about.  MR. RICHARDS: We are going to begin this fall having people from overseas come to Elderhostel programs in this country. We feel like Elderhostel shouldn't be solely an American phenomenon, where only people in the U.S. and Canada have the benefits of going to the program. In the next year or two, [we will have] people from a variety of countries -- Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Japan -- coming to programs in this country. We want to make it a world-wide phenomenon.
