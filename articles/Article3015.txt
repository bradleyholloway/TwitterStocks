 Drug Makers Find New Way To Push Pills   By By David Armstrong and Ann Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2002  Most major pharmacy chains are giving such "switching" ads to customers, with one notable exception: CVS, the country's second-largest chain with 4,200 stores. CVS prints the HRP newsletter, but without such ads.  Mr. [Michael McClorey] said the switching ads empower patients to talk to their doctor about whether a change in drugs makes sense. "Patients have a right to know of alternatives," he said. Among other ads printed in the newsletters are reminders to patients to refill their prescription and suggestions for adjunct therapies, such as the maker of a toe-fungus medication targeting insulin users since diabetics often suffer from foot problems.  HRP acts as a middleman, contracting with 18 of the 20 largest drug makers. A drug maker pays as much as $10 million a year to HRP to reach drugstore customers, while the drug chains are paid by HRP based on the number of customers who receive the newsletters. Declining to specify the pharmacy fee, Mr. McClorey called it "nominal."
