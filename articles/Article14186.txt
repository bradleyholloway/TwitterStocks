 Strong Demand Leads Industrials, Broader Indexes to Record Levels   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1985  Much of the stock market's advance came after 2 p.m., when several buy programs hit the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and buying demand accelerated rapidly. Several traders said they were surprised by the institutional investors' sudden, aggressive demand for stocks. There wasn't any particular development that triggered the buying, they said.  Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up 3.37 to 204.23, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.82 to 117.70, both besting their previous highs, also set Nov. 27. The Nasdaq OTC composite index surged 3.54 to 316.68. That wasn't a record -- the mark is 328.91, set in June 1983 -- but it is a high for this year.  Volume surged, too. About 153.2 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, up from 109.7 million shares Tuesday. Underscoring the surge in demand for stocks, up volume -- the shares traded at prices higher than Tuesday's close -- was more than 124.3 million shares, while down volume was only 16.6 million. Advancing issues had a better than 3-to-1 lead over losers.
