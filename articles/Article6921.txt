 Delphi Now Seeks Revamp Specialist As Its Next Chief   By Joann S. Lublin and Joseph B. White, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2005  Visteon indicated in a filing with the SEC on Tuesday that unless a restructuring agreement with Ford is concluded soon, its cash flow this year wouldn't cover debt payments and capital spending needs. In addition, Visteon said it is at risk of violating debt covenants because accounting problems, which were disclosed Tuesday, have delayed filing of the company's first-quarter report to the SEC. Visteon spokeswoman Kim Welch declined to elaborate on the specifics of the talks.  At Visteon, the former Ford components unit with nearly $19 billion in annual revenue and 70,000 employees, Mr. [Michael F. Johnston] will take full control at a time when the company's long-term future is under a cloud. Standard & Poor's yesterday dropped the rating on Visteon's $2.4 billion in debt to single-B-minus from single-B-plus, citing concerns about the company's liquidity and ability to fund obligations. Visteon has $2 billion in unfunded pension and retiree- health-care liabilities.
