 Jordan Is Training the Iraqis on U.S. Missiles, Israel Says   By Mayer, Jane, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 24, 1990  Jordanian military officers have been training Iraqi troops to operate U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft missiles captured from Kuwait, government military sources here say.  Because of the training, U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf may be forced to fight against Hawks and other advanced U.S.-made weaponry, which Israeli experts believe the Iraqi troops would have been unable to operate without assistance. Both the radar tracking system and the method for reloading the Hawk missile are considered too complex to master without instruction.  Despite the politically charged situation in the Gulf, the Jordanians -- who have been calling for a peaceful, negotiated settlement -- have taught the Iraqi officers how to use the Hawks "on an ongoing basis," an Israeli military source said yesterday. "So now," he said, "U.S. troops will have to face their own U.S.-made weapons, captured by the Iraqis in Kuwait."
