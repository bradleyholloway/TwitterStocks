 The Middle Seat: Researching Your Airline's Safety Record; Spate of Crashes Prompts Efforts to Scrutinize Carriers; A Guide to the Ratings   By McCartney, Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2005  Instead of focusing on airlines, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration offers a list of countries that it says have inadequate oversight over their airlines, at least according to standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO. It's a more meaningful tool for travelers than the European blacklist; it is available at the FAA's Web site. (Go to www.faa.gov/safety/programs_initiatives/oversight/iasa/?CFID=3197897&CFTOKEN=98061215, and click on "Results.")  Airlines fall into one of two camps under the FAA rankings: does or doesn't meet ICAO standards. It adds an asterisk to countries that don't meet standards and don't have their own airlines flying to the U.S., such as Belize and Zimbabwe. Countries that don't meet ICAO standards and do have airlines flying to the U.S. are subject to heightened FAA scrutiny. They include Argentina, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Cote d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Nauru, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, Serbia and Montenegro, Turks & Caicos, Ukraine and Venezuela.  Air Security, based in Houston, believes there's a correlation between an airline's finances and the level of safety for its passengers. The firm also looks at security issues, from passenger screening to the likelihood of hijacking or terrorism events in different countries. But it won't make its list public -- the database is open only to corporate clients. But employees of many big companies can get access to the list through their corporate-travel departments.
