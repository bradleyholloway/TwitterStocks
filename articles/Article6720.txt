 Deals & Deal Makers: Bids & Offers   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2003  "Hmmmph! Luckily for everyone [Duisenberg] is leaving before fists start flying," Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics wrote in a report yesterday. As for his own assessment of the ECB president's latest remarks, Mr. Weinberg added: "A greater misunderstanding of Keynesian and monetarist economics is inconceivable."  Don't tell that to Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive, Philip Purcell, who was recently honored with this distinction by the New York City Central Labor Council. The council said Mr. Purcell has been a "strong advocate" on behalf of using union drivers to shuttle the securities firm's executives around in black limousines.  "Phil Purcell is a true friend of America's working families," the council's president, Brian McLaughlin, said in a statement, adding that he was a "model that all of corporate America should embrace."
