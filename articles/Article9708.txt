 WEEKEND JOURNAL; The Home Front -- details: Far-Off Lands, Over the Sofa   By Jacobs, Georgia, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2004  Anthony Steen, a conservative member of British Parliament, started collecting vintage travel posters 10 years ago when he needed to fill a lot of wall space and didn't want to spend a fortune, he says. While browsing at Christie's, a poster of hockey players at Chamonix caught his eye. Eventually, he had to get a bigger house to accommodate his collection. "I love the colors and the designs," says Mr. Steen. "They're not just posters, they're art."
