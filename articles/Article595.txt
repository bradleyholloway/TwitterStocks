To the Editor:  Home buyers should not be misled by your article ''Aborting a Contract on a Home'' (July 18). Although contracts of sale often permit a buyer to cancel for specific reasons or in certain events, a buyer does not have the right to cancel a contract merely because he has changed his mind.  he true ''general rule'' is that parties are bound by their contracts. A contract of sale is still a contract, not a buyer's option. Your article emphasizes the exceptions so much that they appear to swallow the rule.  In New York, a defaulting buyer may not recover his down payment. Moreover, most home contracts do not limit the buyer's liability to mere forfeiture of the down payment. Without such a provision, the seller may also elect to sue for specific performance to make the buyer close or for damages for the seller's loss of bargain. Given such a choice, however, most sellers elect to keep the down payment.  If the down payment is held in escrow, as it usually is, consent of both parties will probably be required to obtain its release. A seller who does not have another buyer in hand will be very reluctant to let a buyer cancel without good cause or to agree to refund a significant amount of the down payment.KARL B.
