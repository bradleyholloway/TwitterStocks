 Leading the News: Ford Expects to Post `Small Profit' For Third Period, Beating Forecasts   By By Joseph B. White and Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2002  Still, at a time when U.S. car and light-truck sales are running close to record levels, Ford faces a hard road to restoring the kind of profitability it enjoyed in the late 1990s. Ford shares rose on the news that the company would exceed the Thompson First Call consensus third-quarter forecast of a 10 cents a share loss, excluding any items, closing at $10.80, up 60 cents in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Such items are considered part of ordinary operations under generally accepted accounting principles.  Mr. [William Clay Ford Jr.] wouldn't predict Ford's results for the full year, but his forecast of a profit before items for the third quarter strongly suggests that the company will exceed the First Call consensus outlook for all of 2002, currently 29 cents a share, or about $524 million, excluding any items. For the first half of the year, Ford earned $502 million, before a $1 billion expense related to changes in accounting principles. The fourth quarter is typically one of the strongest of the year for U.S. auto makers.  Steve Lyons, head of the company's Ford Division in the U.S. said Ford will seek to reinvigorate sales of the Ford Focus small car in the U.S. by offering a five-year or 100,000-mile warranty on all 2003 Focus models, compared with the current three-year or 36,000-mile warranty. The warranty will be transferable to second owners, Mr. Lyons said.
