 Rethinking Hormone Therapy -- Again; Taking Estrogen Fails To Protect Heart; Slight Risk of Stroke   By Parker-Pope, Tara, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 3, 2004  The so-called WHI study was designed to assess whether older women should start taking hormones to protect them from heart disease. The answer to that question is clearly no. But neither phase of the WHI offers any insight into the issues faced by the typical 50-year-old woman seeking hormone treatment to relieve the symptoms of menopause. The average woman in the WHI is now 70 years old, long past the age when a woman is plagued by hot flashes and the other burdens of menopause. And both phases of the WHI looked at two distinct hormones, both of which are very different from many estrogen and progestin therapies on offer today.  The most surprising finding is the fact that the estrogen users didn't show any increase in risk for breast cancer. It has long been known that hormone use increases breast-cancer risk, and estrogen is known to fuel the growth of existing breast-cancer cells. But the fact that estrogen-only users aren't at increased breast-cancer risk shifts attention to Provera, the progestin used in the first part of the WHI.  Doctors have long been critical of the WHI for using Provera, a potent synthetic progestin that isn't well-tolerated by many women. Many doctors prefer Prometrium, a form of progestin that is more similar to the hormone in the body. Wyeth, which now offers a lower- dose version of Prempro that has 40% less Provera than the pill studied, says there aren't enough data to know whether progestin played any role in breast-cancer risk in the first study.
