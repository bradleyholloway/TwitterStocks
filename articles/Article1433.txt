 Improvement Seen In Macy Cash Flow During 2nd Period ---- Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 1991  R.H. Macy & Co. showed significant improvement in its operating cash flow during its second quarter ended Feb. 2, but sales fell sharply during the Christmas season.  Macy achieved those gains despite a 9.4% decrease in sales for the quarter, or about $2.21 billion in revenue compared with $2.44 billion in the second quarter of 1990. Some of the falloff in revenue reflected Macy's decision to reduce its Christmas inventory by more than $500 million compared with last year.  For the first six months of Macy's fiscal year, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation were $407 million, down 2.5% from $417 million during the same period a year earlier. A Macy spokesman noted that the retailer's poor first-quarter performance severely affected its six-month figures.
