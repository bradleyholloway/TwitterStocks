 Sanibel Searches for Calm In a Growing Sea of Traffic   By By Rafer Guzman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 3, 1999  For decades, the barrier island of Sanibel off Florida's Southwest coast has been known as a nature lovers' paradise and a quiet getaway for snowbirds.  Sanibel city officials say island life is growing increasingly hectic. More than three million vehicles cross the two-lane causeway into Sanibel each year, a 279% jump from about 975,000 in 1975. Yearly visitors to the 12-mile-long island's biggest attraction, the J.M. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, last year rose to 821,266, a 15-year high.  James Nicholas, a professor in the University of Florida's Urban and Regional Planning Department, was commissioned by the city in 1997 to write a report on Sanibel's city management. Mr. Nicholas's conclusion: "Sanibel is overutilized and overly congested," he says. "That has to be addressed, otherwise the community is simply going to become a pain, for residents and visitors."
