CHICAGO, May 16â€” A Federal judge today rejected a bid by Adlai E. Stevenson 3d to run for governor as an independent.  Mr. Stevenson said he would appeal the ruling, issued by Federal District Judge James B. Parsons. He withdrew as the Democratic candidate for governor to avoid running with a candidate for lieutenant governor who is a follower of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., the political extremist. Mr. Stevenson said he would continue campaigning while his advisers pursued plans to form a new party.  ''A lot of questions now have to be answered in the courts,'' he said to reporters, ''but in the meantime we'll keep running. There is an alternative to Governor Thompson. We're it.''  In 1982, Mr. Stevenson lost a bid to unseat James R. Thompson, the Republican incumbent, by 5,074 votes out of more than 3.6 million cast. The margin was the narrowest in Illinois history. Candidates Run in Tandem  In the Democratic primary March 18, Mark Fairchild and Janice Hart, followers of Mr. LaRouche, defeated candidates Mr. Stevenson supported for lieutenant governor and secretary of State. In Illinois, candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run separately in the primary, but run as a team in the general election.  Mr. Stevenson, who has characterized Mr. LaRouche's views as ''racist, anti-Semitic, anti-democratic and irrational,'' refused to run with Mr. Fairchild. Mr. LaRouche's views defy analysis in conventional political terms. Among other things, he holds that Queen Elizabeth of Britain heads an international drug ring, that Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, is a ''Soviet agent of influence'' and that the International Monetary Fund created the AIDS epidemic.  The Stevenson campaign has had other problems. Mr. Stevenson fell off a horse a few weeks ago and injured his back, preventing him from campaiging for about two weeks. Some of his statements have prompted derision from opponents who remind voters that in 1982 Mr. Stevenson told them ''I am not a wimp.'' This year, he has been reported as saying that when he goes turkey hunting he clucks like ''a female turkey'' to lure turkeys to him. Alternatives for Candidates  ''We have obviously had some surprises, some disappointments,'' Mr. Stevenson said today in response to a question about the progress of his campaign. ''But our determination is undiminished.''  Illinois law allows candidates to run as party nominees, independents, or write-in candidates. The filing deadline for independent candidates was Dec. 16, three months before the major parties' primaries. Third-party candidates have until Aug. 4 and people have until Oct. 31 to declare formal write-in candidacies.  Mr. Stevenson's suit argued that it was unfair to require independent candidates to file nearly 11 months before the election, when third-party candidates could do so eight months later.  His lawyers, citing a United States Supreme Court decision in John B. Anderson's 1980 independent Presidential campaign, argued that the early filing deadline was an unconstitutional infringement on his right to seek office and Illinois citizens' rights to vote for the candidate of their choice.  But Judge Parsons said guidelines set in the Anderson case required him to ''measure the competing interests of the state in maintaining a fair and democratic election procedure and the constitutional rights of voters and candidates alike to freedom of association, under the First Amendment, and equal protection of the laws under the 14th Amendment.''  By that standard the statute was fair, he said, particularly since it did not preclude Mr. Stevenson from gaining access to the ballot in other ways.  Noting ''special, even unique, circumstances presented by this case,'' Judge Parsons continued: ''Mr. Stevenson's problem was not created by the statute, but by circumstances which, to be corrected, would need to be addressed by the State Legislature, by the political parties, or by the candidates themselves.''
