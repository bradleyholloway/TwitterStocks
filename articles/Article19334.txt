 Regulators Widen AOL Review to Probe Role of Set-Top Boxes in Internet Access   By By Jill Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2000  The intense scrutiny came after the companies told the FCC that an agreement to open their cable lines to rival Internet providers didn't include set-top boxes. "Set-top boxes were not contemplated" in the pact, the companies wrote in response to an FCC question on whether rival Internet-service providers would be allowed to offer interactive services through set-top boxes.

Time Warner had no comment on the matter.
