 Colin Powell's Finest Hour   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2002  The big story coming out of this week's World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg seems to be that [Colin Powell] was booed. This is being chalked up by some as one more global U.S. embarrassment, but the closer we inspect this event the more it looks like Colin Powell's finest hour. As the quotes above suggest, he was booed for telling the truth.  So much for complaints about the "lack of U.S. leadership." What really upsets these folks is the fact that the U.S. was leading, only in a pro-growth, pro-trade direction they don't like. Clean water may not make great fodder for Greenpeace's alarmist fund-raising letters to aging liberals in Hollywood. But it will make a difference in the lives of millions of the world's poor. Colin Powell should hope he gets booed like this every year.
