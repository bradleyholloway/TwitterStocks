 Chevrolet Faces Rough Ride in Bid To Regain Sales Lead From Ford   By By Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1987  For the first time in more than 30 years, General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Division has come in second among auto company divisions for model-year sales of cars and light duty trucks. And the margin of defeat was substantial. Yesterday, Ford Motor Co.'s Ford Division reported it sold about 120,000 more vehicles than its archrival in the 1987 model year ended Sept. 30.  The loss hurts GM's efforts to boost its sagging market share and attract new buyers. Chevrolet, which bills itself as the "heartbeat of America" in its current advertising campaign, is GM's high-volume marketer, selling about 50% of all its cars and trucks. Chevrolet also serves as GM's "entry-level" division -- selling its lowest priced vehicles.  Winning back first place won't be easy. For the 1988 model year, Ford is forecasting about a 200,000-unit increase in sales to some three million cars and trucks. That's slightly ahead of the 2,950,000 sales Chevrolet hopes to get. In addition, Ford enters the new model year with four of the five top-selling vehicles in the industry: the full-size F-series pickup truck, the Escort subcompact car, the Ranger compact pickup truck and the Taurus midsize car. Only one Chevrolet model, the full-size pickup, is on the list this year, compared with three a year ago.
