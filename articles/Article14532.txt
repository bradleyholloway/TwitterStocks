 Judge's Opinion Says Regina Had Product Problems   By By Andrea Rothman, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1988  NEWARK, N.J. -- Regina Co.'s problems with defective vacuum cleaners apparently involve more than its Housekeeper and Housekeeper Plus lines, according to a judge's opinion.  Regina last spring delayed for two months the introduction of its Stutz vacuum cleaner because of "manufacturing, engineering and quality control" problems, U.S. District Court Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise noted in a ruling released here last week. Regina sued a former employee in early September, seeking to enjoin him from working for a competitor, where he might disclose trade secrets. The court denied Regina's request for a preliminary injunction, however.  Regina had brought suit against the former national sales manager for its Stutz vacuum cleaner, which was introduced in July. The employee, John Geehring, left the company after working only five months to go to Oreck Corp., a New Orleans vacuum cleaner company. The judge's opinion said one reason for his leaving was distress over the company's failure to correct problems with the machine.
