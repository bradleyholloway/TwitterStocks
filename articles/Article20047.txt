 BUSINESS: Why 'Tokyo Rose' Statutes Appear Outdated   By Deogun, Nikhil, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2006  Thanks to the Tokyo Rose statutes, the U.S. prohibits a foreigner from owning more than 25% of a broadcaster. So Televisa chief Emilio Azcarraga Jean, who is married to an American, teamed up with U.S. buyout firms to make a bid. These investors weren't willing to pay too rich a price and what was supposed to have been a heated auction ended with a whimper. Mr. Azcarraga, the one bidder who would have happily paid more and whose family helped found the network, was foiled by laws that had their roots in an era when radio was considered high- tech.  Mr. [Thomas Middelhoff] says that during his tenure Bertelsmann considered buying ITV, one of Britain's commercial broadcasters -- it already owned a stake in another one -- and would have faced no foreign- ownership restrictions. However, he would have faced plenty had he tried to buy NBC, Univision or, had it existed, a U.S. German-language broadcaster. Too bad for a CEO who once famously referred to himself as an "American with a German passport."  Let's say the government of Iran bought a U.S. broadcaster. The U.S. government could still regulate some of the content, just as it does with indecent programming, and impose the same national-security obligations on a foreign-owned broadcaster as it does on a U.S.-owned broadcaster.
