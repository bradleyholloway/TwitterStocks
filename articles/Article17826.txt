 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): School Daze   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1988  George Bush says he'd be the "education President." Various of the Democratic presidential candidates also have taken to intoning the "education" issue. No doubt one of these men will be elected President of the United States, but we wonder if any of them knows enough about what is actually going on in America's schools to win a local school-board election.  Our impression is that in recent years the U.S. elementary- and secondary-education system has taken at least one large step in the right direction: It now recognizes the value of accountability for the people running schools. This is in large part the result of efforts by people such as former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett. If administrators and teachers are held to account for their results, it follows that the quality of the system's product should improve.  The National Center for Education Information of Washington, D.C., recently took a look at local attitudes and came up with a remarkable range of opinion. Some 81% of school superintendents and 72% of public-school principals think U.S. educational standards have improved in recent years. But only 41% of the public holds that view and 49% believe schools have become worse.
