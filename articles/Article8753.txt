 As More Tourists Fly In, Roads Get Cold Shoulder   By By Jacqueline Bueno, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1996  Consider the experience of David Stroud, vice president of marketing at Silver Springs, a 350-acre nature-based attraction in North Central Florida. He's fully aware that tourism overall is booming. Yet at his park, he says, "there has been a dramatic decline in the number of out-of-state visitors."  According to the Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corp., a public-private agency that promotes tourism in the state, about 2.3 million visitors drove into Florida in March, 5.2% fewer than a year earlier. The March numbers, the latest available, marked the third consecutive monthly decrease in visitors behind the wheel; the numbers also were down 13.4% and 11.9% in January and February, respectively, from a year earlier.  At the same time, the number of travelers flying into Florida is increasing: More than 7.3 million tourists flew into Florida in this year's first quarter, up 5.6% from the first quarter of 1995.
