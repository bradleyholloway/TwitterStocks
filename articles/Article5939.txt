 Washington Group Sues Raytheon, Alleges Fraud   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  In the suit filed yesterday in Idaho District Court, the construction company alleges that Raytheon, Lexington, Mass., committed fraud in misrepresenting and withholding information during talks for the unit's sale. Washington seeks damages that include payments of more than $700 million to help pay for projects originated at Raytheon. Washington, which said it is considering filing for bankruptcy-court protection, is alternatively asking the court to rescind the acquisition.
