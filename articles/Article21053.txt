 Volcker Says Further Declines in Dollar Are Likely to Result in Higher Inflation   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 3, 1987  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the drop in the dollar has reached a danger point and that further declines are likely to result in higher inflation.  "The danger of movements from the present level is that you would get a more complete pass-through, I think, into import prices," Mr. Volcker told the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "And that's one sense that we are at a more dangerous point now."  In response to a question, Mr. Volcker also indicated some support for a tax on energy as a way to reduce the budget deficit. Noting that lower prices have boosted oil imports, Mr. Volcker said that "if you are going to raise revenues, that's one obvious place to look."
