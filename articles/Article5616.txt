 Pentagon to Delay Antimissile Test After Failures in Five Consecutive Shots   By By Thomas E. Ricks and Frederic M. Biddle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1998  In moves that appear intended to assuage congressional impatience with the antimissile program, which has failed to intercept missiles five times in a row, the Pentagon also said it is taking a series of steps to restructure the program and effectively punish the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp., which the Pentagon claims has poorly managed the program.  Air Force Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, head of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which oversees the program, said that among other things, he expects Lockheed to pick up a "significant" part of the multimillion-dollar costs of any future tests that fail.  The general said missile experts from Raytheon Corp., one of Lockheed's most determined rivals, have been brought in to help analyze why Lockheed's test shots keep failing. Calling this consulting arrangement "unusual and unprecedented," Gen. Lyles pointedly praised Raytheon as having "probably more tactical-missile experience than any other corporation in the United States." He said Raytheon would focus on systems engineering and systems integration -- that is, the efforts to combine the various parts of the antimissile system, which include the responding missile, a radar, a launcher and a command-and-control system.
