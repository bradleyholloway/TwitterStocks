 Chrysler Tells Iacocca It Won't Let Him Cash In His Options --- Auto Maker Cites Agreements With Kerkorian's Tracinda As Grounds for Refusal   By By Robert L. Simison and Oscar Suris, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1995  The retired Chrysler chairman offended his former colleagues in April by throwing in with investor Kirk Kerkorian in a takeover bid for the auto maker that eventually collapsed. So when Mr. Iacocca tried last week to cash in some of his old stock options, Chrysler's board found a way to say no.  In documents filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chrysler disclosed that it turned down a request by Mr. Iacocca to exercise options to purchase 112,500 Chrysler shares. Mr. Iacocca could have turned around and sold them for about $5.6 million at yesterday's closing price of $49.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.  Chrysler wouldn't say what Mr. Iacocca's exercise price would have been, but it did say the former chairman retains options to purchase a total of 1,488,368 Chrysler shares at an average price of $28.22 each. In addition, Mr. Iacocca is understood already to own $50 million of Chrysler shares.
