 Chrysler Agrees to Pay $1.6 Million Fine To Settle OSHA Health, Safety Charges   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1987  The Labor Department said Chrysler Corp. agreed to pay $1.6 million to settle government charges of worker overexposure to lead and arsenic, and other alleged health and safety violations in the workplace.  The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Chrysler's Newark, Del., assembly plant for 811 alleged violations. The penalty was the largest in OSHA's history and the second major agency fine involving Chrysler in recent months.  In a statement, Chrysler Motors Corp.'s chairman, Gerald Greenwald, said the company has been cooperating with the OSHA investigation "and has already acted on the majority of items." He added, "We are working on others." Chrysler Motors is the company unit that oversees the auto makers' vehicle production and sales.
