 With Water, Water Not Everywhere, Xeriscaping Gains --- But Landscaping Movement Still Faces a Huge Hurdle: People Love Their Grass   By By Frank Bass, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1996  At first, Joel and Kathy Wine's neighbors thought the stress of maintaining a lush St. Augustine grass lawn had finally gotten to them. While the rest of the neighborhood was manicuring their yards on a spring morning in 1988, Mr. Wine was ripping his yard up with a small bulldozer.  But what looked like madness in the spring of 1988 is beginning to look like sanity in the dry, hot spring of 1996. All across the Edwards Plateau, green, water-guzzling St. Augustine yards are falling parched victims to watering restrictions. All across the Edwards Plateau, that is, except where homeowners like the Wines have pulled up their St. Augustine in favor of xeriscapes, which feature low-water-consuming grasses, plants and trees.  But homeowners in the drought-stricken state aren't exactly rushing to class; Mr. Welsh estimates that fewer than 10% of Texans have xeriscaped yards. While water-rationing measures go into effect in San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen and Lubbock, xeriscape suffers from a major, perhaps insurmountable, problem: Even in the midst of a drought, people believe grass is good.
