 Some Democratic Economists Echo Mankiw on Outsourcing   By Davis, Bob, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 2004  At a Monday news conference, Mr. [Gregory Mankiw] said that sending U.S. service jobs abroad "is probably a plus for the economy in the long run." That is because foreign workers can do the jobs more cheaply, reducing costs for U.S. consumers and companies. "Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade," he added.  Since then, his remarks have brought sharp rebukes from lawmakers, including some Republicans. "Incredible indifference," said Democratic presidential contender Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina. "What planet do they live on?" Even Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said Mr. Mankiw's "theory fails a basic test of real economics."  Even among Democratic economists, though, Mr. Mankiw's remarks were mainstream. "Basically I agree with Greg's thrust," said Janet Yellen, who was President Clinton's chief economist. "In the long run, outsourcing is another form of trade that benefits the U.S. economy by giving us cheaper ways to do things."
