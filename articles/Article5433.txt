 Degussa's Chairman Acts Aggressively To Create Leaner, Stronger Company   By By Audrey Choi, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1992  In many ways, Gert Becker, chairman of Degussa AG, is using the tactics of a corporate raider on his own company.  Mr. Becker still has significant problems to overcome -- such as 2.6 billion marks ($1.67 billion) in debts, a money-losing metals and machinery division, a volatile precious metals business and cyclical weakness in the chemical industry. But if all goes as planned, many see in Degussa a prime example of what other German companies need to do to retain their global competitiveness but have been reluctant to do.  "Of all the stocks in the DAX 30 index, Degussa is the company that has been the most aggressive in cost-cutting over the past few years," said Hans-Peter Wodniok, German chemical analyst at James Capel in Frankfurt, who has placed a "buy" recommendation on the stock. Not including the effects of a recent eastern German acquisition, Degussa has trimmed its staff by around 10% since its peak in 1990, when it employed 35,000 people worldwide. In fiscal 1992 alone, Degussa eliminated 2,000 jobs, 1,200 of which were white-collar jobs pared from the German parent company.
