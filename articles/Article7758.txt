 Why Melinda S. Gets Ads for Panty Hose, Melinda F., Porsches --- What She Buys Gets Her Stereotyped by the People Who Rent Mailing Lists   By By Melinda Grenier Guiles, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1988  My names, actually. To figure out who was selling me to whom, I started using slightly different aliases for each new subscription and catalog order I placed. I'm now up to more than two dozen variations. Each "nom de post" has attracted a distinctly different pile of mail -- telling evidence of how the mail-order world stereotypes people by what they buy.  No one begs Melinda S., reader of Savvy -- a magazine "For the Successful Woman," to take a spin in a Porsche. She is urged to save on "slightly imperfect panty hose! Prices guaranteed for 30 days!" She is encouraged to take classes to develop "power communication skills" and "a more appealing professional image."  Such names don't come cheap, however. Renting a list for just one use -- few lists are sold outright -- can range from about $40 per thousand names to more than $150, depending on specificity and quality. "If you want my list, you can request recent buyers, frequent buyers, highend buyers, low-price buyers, female buyers by dress size, male buyers by ZIP code," says S. Roger Horchow, the chairman of the Horchow Collection and its coveted catalog list, which starts at $90 a thousand and doesn't include me. "But each breakdown costs extra."
