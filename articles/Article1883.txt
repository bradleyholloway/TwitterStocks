 Unocal Hopes Station Overhaul Pumps Up Its Fortunes --- Amid Fierce West Coast Competition, Concern to Offer Nongasoline Items   By By Andy Pasztor, The Wall Street Journal,  May 13, 1994  The company has quietly embarked on a program to convert about 200 of its 1,240 stations in California in the next few years to sell nongasoline items, from fast food and liquor to car washes. If the experiment goes well, many of Unocal's remaining California stations might be revamped. Unocal also is considering similar changes at its 200 or so other stations in nearby states.  Analysts and other industry observers say that the belated shift to convenience stores -- a move spearheaded in the 1980s by larger competitors that now dominate the California market -- might be too little and too late to markedly improve the company's fortunes. Slumping crude-oil prices and the reeling California economy threaten to crimp cash flow and derail Unocal's initiative even before its scheduled announcement of the changes next month. In addition, the company's increased emphasis on natural-gas exploration and production overseas is likely to siphon off funds needed to redo retail outlets back home.  Still, the decision marks an important turning point for the company. In spite of rapidly changing demographics and market conditions on the West Coast, Unocal long has prided itself on its contrarian full-service, no-minimart image catering to upscale motorists. Its dealer network has touted the advantages of the company's higher-octane fuel, while relying on auto-repair work as a major revenue source. Unocal enjoys such strong brand loyalty that the company recently began distributing free Styrofoam balls, emblazoned with its orange and blue logo, that Southern California drivers can attach to their car antennas. The balls were ubiquitous here 30 years ago.
