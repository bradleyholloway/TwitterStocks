 Many Investors Cautious Before Fed Meeting, But Some Try to Capitalize on High Volatility   By By Kopin Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 5, 2001  For instance, an investor bought an April strangle in Lehman -- buying April 65 calls and April 60 puts, each of which traded about 1,200 contracts at the Amex and CBOE.

Lehman's April 65 calls were at $7.50; the April 60 puts were at $6.80.
