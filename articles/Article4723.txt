 Business Bookshelf: Post-It Notes and Other Great Notions   By By Jack Falvey, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1987  Break-Throughs" (Rawson Associates, 371 pages, $16.95) is a "who done it/how they done it" business book. It probes some of the biggest product revolutions of the past 25 years. It reads like 13 individual mystery stories with the final chapter joining many of their common threads. Fortunately, it does not end with the "10 Steps To Success" that have become a staple of the pop-management-book culture.  John Ketteringham and Ranganath Nayak take us well beyond the myths and public-relations puffery that obscure such product developments as the emergence of 3M's Post-It Notes and the Sony Walkman, and the victory of VHS over Betamax video recorders.  These two Ph.D.s from Arthur D. Little & Co. have a highly readable writing style that is quite refreshing in an era when consulting reports often masquerade as management essays. "Break-Throughs" tells tales of discovery, authentic accounts of recent product innovations. As the authors declare, "This is a book of similar human stories that serve, in a shrinking world, as the adventures of our time -- the intellectual and financial expeditions into the unknown that must precede every commercial breakthrough."
