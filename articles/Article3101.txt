 Wolfowitz Tries to Spur Afghan Reconstruction   By By Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2003  Even if all the money pledged in Tokyo arrives, U.S. officials concede that it won't be enough to sustain the rebuilding effort beyond 2004. As part of a new push to get more money for Afghanistan, Dov Zakheim, the Pentagon's top budget official and a leader of the effort to secure more money for reconstruction, is planning a trip to the Philippines, Brunei, Japan and South Korea in coming weeks. Mr. [Paul Wolfowitz] also promised he would try to find more money, in addition to the $600 million already budgeted by the U.S. for Afghan reconstruction in 2004, to allow U.S. Army Civil Affairs teams to take on other projects inside Afghanistan.
