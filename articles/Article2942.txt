 U.K.'s Mint Molds New Image for Sovereign Coins   By By Alejandro J. Martinez, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2002  First introduced in 1489 with a depiction of King Henry VII on his throne, the "King's coin" made a statement to the rest of the world about the wealth of England. During the 19th century, the gold sovereign became the most secure trading currency in the world. "At the height of the Victorian era, when the sun never set on the British Empire, it never set on the gold sovereign either," said Michael Sedgwick, a North American representative for the Royal Mint in New York.  The Royal Mint, in Llantrisant, England, declined to comment about the release of the new coin, except to say that it will make an official announcement soon. The design is said to have been inspired by that on sovereigns struck during the first 50 years of the reign of Queen Victoria and will show the Royal Arms within a wreath of laurel. Afterward, the regular design of St. George and the Dragon will return.  The Royal Mint refrains from recommending them as an investment. "The Royal Mint believes the true purpose of these coins is the enjoyment the pleasures of ownership bring," Mr. Sedgwick said. (Like other mints, the Royal Mint is also a business, of course, and it is hoping that the noncollecting public buys them as an authorized souvenir.)
