 My Baby Came Special Delivery   By By Timothy Tregarthen, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1987  Wednesday: We get a call from a brave young woman on the East Coast who is about to have a baby and wants to give it up to us for adoption. She has heard about us through a good friend and wants my wife to fly out to meet her. The baby is due in a month. My wife leaves on the first available plane.  Thursday: My wife calls. The woman has just been to the doctor. He thinks the baby will be a boy. It, or he, has a strong heart and is of average size. There is some concern he may be a Democrat.  Sunday: I visit friends who have had babies and thus have baby supplies to lend. I pick up sleepers, blankets, a variety of outfits with cute little ducks on them, mobiles, music boxes, a swing, a high chair, and a host of other essentials. I worry about the baby-goods industry. There seems to be a vast stock of perfectly good baby supplies available from friends, obviating the purchase of nearly everything.
