 Lilly Will Sell Elizabeth Arden For $700 Million --- Faberge's Purchase Reflects Demand for Top Names In Cosmetics Industry   By By Wendy L. Wall and Ann Hagedorn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1987  Eli Lilly & Co. agreed to sell its Elizabeth Arden cosmetics business to Faberge Inc. for about $700 million.  Many analysts called the steep price a coup for Lilly and a reflection of the fierce competition for top-of-the-line cosmetic companies during a period of industry consolidation. In April, when Lilly said it would shed Arden to focus on its core pharmaceutical business, most analysts expected the unit to fetch no more than $600 million.  Faberge, with major brands including Aqua Net hair spray and Brut men's toiletries, has been eager to expand its shampoo and fragrances base. The company looked at Germaine Monteil and Charles of the Ritz earlier this year, but both businesses were too small for its expansion plans, said Daniel J. Manella, Faberge chairman and chief executive officer.
