 The Opiates of the Masses . . . and the War They've Provoked   By By Christopher Caldwell, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  In "Forces of Habit," University of North Florida historian [David T. Courtwright] shows that drugs -- from caffeine to cocaine -- are woven more tightly into Western history than we recognize in this modern era of moralistic prohibition. Armenians fermented wine at least 6,000 years ago, Andean peasants have chewed coca for five millennia and Herodotus writes of Scythians "howling with pleasure" while burning marijuana. Intoxicants, Mr. Courtwright concedes, are "unexpected weapons against the human condition." How we use and regulate them can tell us what kind of society we are.  Meanwhile, governments were slowly changing course, from drug exploitation to drug prohibition. Mr. Courtwright notes that government attacks on profitable industries are historically rare. Why did powerful forces with an interest in banning intoxicants arise in the 20th century? For one, intoxication was less compatible with industrial society. ("A drunken field hand was one thing, a drunken railroad brakeman quite another.") The result, after decades of political haggling, is our $35 billion War on Drugs, an effort with which -- despite a few quibbles -- Mr. Courtwright is in sympathy. He dismisses legalization as "a form of reactionary libertarianism" and complains that the social costs of the black market are "seized upon and given wide publicity by prohibition's ideological opponents."
