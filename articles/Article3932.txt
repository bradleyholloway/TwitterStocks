 Barclays Plans ETF Tracking Silver; Approval Is Sought for Fund To Be Marketed as Interests In Physical Metal Assets   By Tara Siegel Bernard, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 21, 2005  News of the silver trust drew a lukewarm reaction from financial planners, who said investors would be better served with an ETF that tracks a broad basket of commodities. "It's nice to have some other commodities choices, but silver is kind of narrow," said John J. Lah, a financial planner and principal at Waverly Financial Group in Woodstock, Md., who specializes in creating portfolios of ETFs. "I would prefer to see a more diversified basket of commodities. . . . Gold has much more appeal than silver itself [because] silver is more volatile, and gold traditionally works better as an inflation hedge."  Others echo that sentiment. "I've seen no developments in the silver market that would make me anything more than indifferent to having an allocation to silver," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Co., and an avid fan of ETFs. "We have gold allocations in our portfolios and that makes sense to us . . . as a hedge position relative to currency risk."
