 Federal Agents Seize Computers in 27 Cities As Part of Crackdown on Software Piracy   By By Sarah Sparks, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  The 15-month federal undercover investigation, dubbed "Operation Buccaneer," focused on the DrinkOrDie pirate group, part of the broader Internet hacker network dubbed "warez" (pronounced "wares"). A senior Customs investigator, Allan Doody, said the DrinkOrDie group has "perhaps the best reputation for cracking software" among the 10 or so main warez groups.  The group, like other warez communities, seems to focus not on profiting from the stolen programs, but on earning the respect of other hackers through competitive and increasingly daring hacking jobs, Mr. Doody said. DrinkOrDie, which started in Russia in 1993, became famous among hackers in 1995 for stealing and cracking software copy-protection programs on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system, and broadly distributing the pirated program just two weeks before Microsoft released its legal version.
