 European Cyclical-Stock Issues' Recent Weakness Spurs Some Managers to Start Looking Elsewhere   By By Silvia Ascarelli, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1999  Yesterday, for instance, Europe's attention was more focused on growth stocks, those seen as having the potential for rapid earnings growth. Pharmaceutical stocks rose, while telecommunications shares gained in London but largely faltered in continental Europe.  "The risks certainly have risen," says Ben Funnell, a member of the European stocks strategy team at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and one of the first to promote cyclical stocks this year. For the moment, he is still recommending that investors own plenty of cyclical shares, particularly in base materials and construction. But his team turned sour on one cyclical sector -- oil companies -- a month ago, citing slowing earnings momentum and other factors.  Historically, cyclical stocks have been poor long-term investments. But they star when economies start growing, and stars are what they have been this year. The Dow Jones Stoxx basic-resources index, which includes companies in the paper, steel and metals sectors, has skyrocketed 57% so far this year. The Dow Jones Stoxx industrial goods and services index, which covers heavy machinery, electrical components and equipment as well as transportation equipment, is up 29%. Both easily outstrip the 12% gain this year in the broader Dow Jones Stoxx index, which measures the performance of 614 European companies.
