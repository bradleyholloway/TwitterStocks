 Takeoffs & Landings   By By Rafer Guzman and Jane Costello, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2001  Of course, that's an accident. For the third time in six months, Hilton personnel inadvertently loaded a room rate of zero into its reservation system. This past month, travelers were able to book online rooms at no charge at eight Hiltons in the U.S., including properties in Flagstaff, Ariz., San Diego and Hilton Head, S.C. Earlier this year, the hotel had a similar problem with travelers booking no-cost rooms at hotels in Mexico City and Vancouver, Canada.  In the wake of TWA's bankruptcy-court proceedings and subsequent purchase by American Airlines, members of TWA's Ambassadors Club program are being folded into American's Admirals Club. But their welcome there will be short-lived for some: American has notified some 30,000 TWA fliers with so-called lifetime memberships that their access will expire April 30, 2003. "Lifetime members will then be allowed to renew their Admirals Club membership," according to American's letter. The price: $250 per year.
