 Brazil's Presidential Campaign Ends With Tempered Absurdity   By By Thomas Kamm, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1989  Even with Mr. Santos out of the race, 21 candidates will be fighting for a chance to lead Latin America's most populous, wealthiest and most indebted nation, making it all but certain that a second round will be necessary Dec. 17 between the two leading vote-getters. Many analysts are betting on a highly polarized runoff between center-right candidate Fernando Collor de Mello and the Marxist-leaning Luis Inacio da Silva, known simply as Lula.  The campaign ended Sunday with candidates holding their final mass rallies and debates. A prime topic of concern was facial hair: Socialist Leonel Brizola says Mr. da Silva should shave his beard and show his face. Mr. da Silva countered that saying this was as ridiculous as him asking Mr. Brizola to wear a wig. Meanwhile, Mr. Collor vowed he would make current President Jose Sarney, who isn't running, "shave his mustache."  Despite Brazil's tremendous economic and social problems, this rhetoric is widely considered an improvement over Mr. Santos, whose out-of-the blue decision to run two weeks ago threw the campaign into upheaval. Although he acknowledged he had no program, his status as Brazil's most popular TV emcee made him an instant favorite. One poll showed him in first place, with an astounding 29% of the vote. Others showed him with 10% to 19% -- not enough to win, but enough to change the face of the elections by stealing votes from more-serious contenders.
