 Anheuser Recalls Twist-Off Bottles Of Beer in Europe   By By Beth M. Mantz, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1999  European beer drinkers aren't expected to shy away from their Budweisers despite a recall of certain bottles by Anheuser-Busch Cos.  Anheuser-Busch has confirmed that it recalled the twist-off bottles of its Budweiser beer in Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium, the Netherlands, Latvia, Germany, Switzerland and France because of a potential problem with the tops.  Anheuser-Busch said all of the recalled bottles were filled at a brewery in Spain. Because of a manufacturing problem at the glass suppliers in Spain and in Portugal, the top ring on some of the twist-off bottles in the recall countries extends slightly further out than it should and can break off when the bottle is opened.
