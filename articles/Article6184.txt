 Under Review: Art Documents -- and Survives -- Dresden's Misfortunes   By By Manuela Hoelterhoff, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 2003  The closest I've come to tears in a museum was standing in front of the huge panoramas by Bernardo Bellotto showing Dresden in its baroque glory rising over the Elbe River, as lovely as a garlanded porcelain centerpiece from nearby Meissen. Bellotto's pictures confirm the misery of present-day Dresden and the insane destructiveness of Sir Arthur "Bomber" Harris, who sent in the RAF knowing that the city was neither a military nor an industrial site -- unless you count the mass production of porcelain shepherdesses. This was an act of sadistic violence against history -- for Dresden belonged to civilized Europe, not the Third Reich.  You would think Dresden has suffered enough. But last year's cataclysmic rains flooded the Zwinger's basement and wrecked its new storage areas. While the museum is restoring them, it has sent many old master pictures to London. I will avoid ironic comment. "Masterpieces From Dresden," now at the Royal Academy, presents highlights of the Zwinger's collection, including a Durer portrait, several works by Bellotto, classical scenes by Poussin and Lorrain and a silvery Watteau.  In 2005 the U.S. becomes the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian, barren Christian theocracy. Gilead's few fertile women are forcibly turned into brood mares, "handmaids" denied the right to read, write and own property. One of them, Offred, attempts to fight the system. Margaret Atwood's creepy novel should have made for a great opera, and a timely one too -- think of how many folks in the U.S. would find happiness in Gilead. But the British premiere of Poul Ruders's "The Handmaid's Tale" just provided tired polemics and banal music and no balm at all.
