 Lab Work: Monkey Deficit Crimps Labs --- Rhesus Shortage Has Scientists Scrambling for Alternatives   By By Sarah Lueck, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2002  When University of Pittsburgh virologist Michael Murphey-Corb tried to buy 32 rhesus monkeys for an experiment last year, they were so expensive -- as much as $6,000 each -- she had to scale back her research into an AIDS vaccine. Forced to settle for 24 animals, Dr. Murphey-Corb had to defer investigating whether the vaccine would work as an early treatment for the disease. Fed up with spending a third of her time trying to find rhesus monkeys, Dr. Murphey-Corb says she is switching to a closely related species, the cynomolgus monkey, which costs about half as much as the rhesus and is readily available. "I have to get on with my research," she says.  In the 1970s, researchers bought as many as 12,000 rhesus monkeys annually from India, the main source for the animals, also known as rhesus macaques or Macaca mulata. The export of the monkeys was already controversial and sensitive in India, as Hindus consider them a sacred incarnation of a god. Then, in 1978, India banned the exports after news reports that the U.S. was using them in radiological weapons experiments. The price per monkey jumped from about $100 to about $4,000.  Before last fall's anthrax outbreak, testing of an anthrax vaccine stalled for two years because federal researchers couldn't get enough rhesus monkeys. Out of urgency, they decided to use Chinese instead of Indian rhesus. But making that switch presents its own problems. Anthrax research done in the 1950s relied on Indian rhesus, and scientists have disagreed about whether the Chinese animals are similar enough to use in new studies.
