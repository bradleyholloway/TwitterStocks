 Appeals Court Orders Army to Reinstate Homosexual but Avoids Broader Ruling   By By Richard B. Schmitt, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 1989  A federal appeals court here ordered the Army to reinstate a soldier who was ousted for being homosexual, but backtracked from a ruling that extended constitutional protection against discrimination to homosexuals.  The court barred the Army from dismissing 14-year veteran Perry Watkins because it had allowed him to re-enlist on previous occasions knowing that he was homosexual.  At the same time, the court declined to revive a decision by a three-judge panel of the same court in February 1988 that said homosexuals should be treated like racial minorities in discrimination cases. The decision, vacated when the full court agreed to rehear the case in June, would have made it more difficult for government agencies to justify discrimination. It was believed to be the first such determination by a federal appellate panel.
