SAN DIEGO, Nov. 10â€” Citing preservation of ''integrity,'' the National Basketball Association has ordered the San Diego Clippers to sever their ties with hotel-casino operations the club has used in promotions.  Jack Joyce, the league's director of security, said he sent a letter to San Diego last week directing the Clippers ''to terminate immediately any and all promotional arrangements, or other associations involving the Clippers and any casinos and gambling establishments.''  Joyce said the Clippers' promotional activities involving the Sands Hotel, which operates hotel-casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, had probably resulted from Donald Sterling's unfamiliarity with league bylaws. Sterling bought the team during the offseason.  ''The commissioner's office doesn't feel anyone in the N.B.A. should associate themselves with gambling, even though it is legalized,'' Joyce said. ''We are very sensitive to this.''  Ted Podleski, general manager of the Clippers, refused to comment on the directive. Efforts to reach Sterling were unsuccessful. A spokesman for the Sands said the association with the Clippers was intended to promote resort properties, and not necessarily casinos, to the San Diego market.  A widely advertised sales promotion offered free hotel accommodations with certain purchases of 1981-82 season tickets. The flyer for the promotion read: ''Hoop it up with the Clippers, then whoop it up at the Sands, free.''
