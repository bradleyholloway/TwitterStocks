WHAT The Waterman Signe Boucheron fountain pen, which has a translucent blue barrel, an 18-karat-gold cap and a list price of $2,500. Only 3,741 have been made. The number is the sum of the years in which the two companies that designed it were founded: Waterman, the French-based pen maker that is now owned by Gillette, in 1883, and Boucheron, the Parisian jeweler, in 1858.  PARISIAN LANDMARKS Alain Boucheron, the president of the company his great-grandfather founded, calls the Waterman Signe Boucheron ''a pen to dream with.'' His dream was to transform a $700 Waterman Edson fountain pen into something more elaborate. He designed a gold Art Deco trellis that he said reflected ''the up strokes and down strokes of handwriting as well as the arches of the Place Vendome.'' Boucheron's trademark, which appears on the gold cap, bears the image of the Place de la Concorde.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
