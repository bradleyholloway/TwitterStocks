 Review / A Surfer's Guide to TV: Daring Feats and Divine Follies   By By Barbara D. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 24, 2000  This campy Cinemax "Reel Life" look at the life of Tammy Faye Bakker Messner and the birth of televangelism features sock puppets and wry chapter headings, is narrated by drag queen RuPaul Charles, and paints a far more sympathetic portrait of the often-battered, but still unbowed, Tammy Faye than you might expect. (The Rev. Jerry Falwell is the chief villain here, portrayed as a decidedly un-Christian schemer who betrayed Tammy Faye and her then-husband, the Rev. Jim Bakker, in the midst of their scandal.) The documentary, produced and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, reveals the vulnerable woman beneath the painted -- and heavily mascara-ed -- surface.  No sequined costumes, scantily clad assistants and other Vegas glitz for [David Blaine]. In this special, the magician casts his spell on audiences of ordinary folks -- and such celebs as Kevin Spacey, Michael J. Fox and Lenny Kravitz -- right on the gritty sidewalks of New York, looking a lot like an especially talented three-card-monte player from the pre-Giuliani Apple and the un-Disneyfied Times Square. And beginning Monday, Nov. 27, Mr. Blaine, the epitome of low-key, streetwise cool, will risk downright hypothermia on the corner of Broadway and 44th Street. For 58 hours, he will be encased in six tons of ice, molded to fit around his upright body. Then, on Wednesday evening, after a nationwide audience has been treated to the taped segments of this special, Mr. Blaine will be freed from his frozen block -- live (we hope) on television.
