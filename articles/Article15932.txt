 What A Cup Of Coffee Holds   By By Paul Engstrom, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2000  As people age, they become more sensitive to substances, including caffeine, that boost blood pressure (in the case of caffeine, the physiological mechanism isn't known). So why isn't there a hue and cry about older adults drinking too much coffee? Because of the tolerance the body builds up over time to habitual caffeine use.  The tension and irritability that some people feel after consuming caffeine seem to decline with age, at least in studies of men. Though the reason isn't clear, Paul Arciero, an exercise scientist and associate professor at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., theorizes that older men build up a cellular tolerance to caffeine over the years, so their emotional response to it isn't as extreme as that in younger men.  Can caffeine really jump start your thinking processes? A study of more than 7,400 people between the ages of about 20 and 60 suggests it can. Moreover, older subjects in this study seemed to benefit more from the cognitive-improving effects of caffeine than did younger subjects, according to Dutch researchers Wim J. Riedel and Jellemer Jolles.
