Correction Appended THE auction season moves into high gear next week with sales of modern and Impressionist art at New York's two top auction galleries. The first sale of the week begins Tuesday at 7 P.M. at Christie's, Park Avenue and 59th Avenue, with 12 paintings from the collection of Charles Tobatschnik, a Toronto builder, whom Christie's lists as ''anonymous private collector.'' The most important of these works are Kees van Dongen's 1908 ''Portrait of Madame Malpel'' and Georges Braque's 1906 ''The Harbor at Antwerp, the Mast,'' each expected to sell for as much as $300,000. Notable, too, are van Dongen's 1905 ''Nude Against Black Background'' (up to $250,000) and Albert Marquet's 1905 ''The Blue Pavilion at St.-Cloud'' (up to $200,000).  In the session that follows at 7:20 P.M., the four most important paintings are by Pablo Picasso: his 1915 ''Bottle of Anis del Mono, Compote Dish, Pipe,'' a Cubist oil-and-sand-on-board work, which may bring as much as $500,000; his 1900 ''Fair Booth at Kermis'' (up to $450,000); his 1937 ''Portrait of Dora Maar'' (up to $400,000), and his 1906-7 ''Head of a Sailor'' (up to $350,000). Other works of interest are Franz Marc's 1913 ''The Red Horse,'' a gouache on paper laid down on board (up to $350,000); Wassily Kandinsky's 1929 ''Inside Group,'' oil on canvas (up to $350,000), and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's ''Black Dancer,'' from the Henry Ford 2d collection (up to $300,000).  Christie's will hold two other sales next Wednesday at 2 P.M., when less-costly paintings by major modern and Impressionist artists will be auctioned, and Thursday morning, when drawings and watercolors by many of the same artists will be up for bidding. The star lots Wednesday are Georges Rouault's ''Study for the Flowers of Evil'' and Pierre Bonnard's 1940 ''Lemon Trees at Cannet,'' both estimated to go for as much as $50,000. Thursday, the major works are Marc Chagall's ''Study for 'Over the Village,' '' from around 1917 (up to $160,000); Cezanne's ''Winding Road,'' from 1900-6 (up to $150,000) and his ''Roses,'' from the late 1880's or early 1890's (up to $100,000).  Sotheby Parke Bernet's sales begin next Thursday at the house's Madison Avenue and 76th Street rooms, and many of the more important lots are in the 7 P.M. session of 60 Surrealist art works collected by Julien Levy, the late art dealer, who acquired most of these works directly from the artists. He opened his gallery in 1931 and over the next 18 years held pioneering exhibitions of Surrealist and Neo-Romantic art and photography. Outstanding are Salvador Dali's 1929 ''Accommodations of Desire'' (up to $500,000), Arshile Gorky's 1942 ''The Pirate I'' (up to $400,000) and Alberto Giacometti's ''People Don't Play Games'' (up to $400,000).  In a second session of less-costly works from the Levy collection Thursday at 2 P.M., the most important painting is Victor Brauner's 1938 ''Alphabet of the Head'' (up to $35,000).  More important are the paintings up for bidding next Friday evening at 7 P.M. from the collection of the late Sam Salz, art dealer, and the estate of Ann Burnett Tandy, widow of Charles Tandy, founder of the Tandy Corporation of Texas, whose family business included ranching, oil and aviation. Mr. Salz, who helped form the collections of Paul Mellon, Henry Ford 2d, Edgar and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, Andre Meyer and David Rockefeller, ran a private gallery from his East Side town house for more than 30 years. Following a short-lived career as an artist after World War I, the Austrian-born dealer opened his first gallery in 1923 in Cologne. In 1938 he left Nazi Germany and resettled in New York. Among the more than 30 works from his collection up for bidding is Cezanne's ''Hills Near La Montagne,'' a Mont Ste.-Victoire scene (up to $2 million). From the Tandy collection is Picasso's 1901 ''Mother and Child by the Sea'' (up to $800,000). Notable, too, are Renoir's 1880 ''Woman With a Straw Hat,'' Cezanne's ''Still Life With Apples and Napkin,'' from 1879-80, and Monet's ''Pleasure Boats at Argenteuil,'' each of which is expected to sell for more than $1 million. Another major work is Modigliani's ''Portrait of a Young Girl,'' from 1917-18 (up to $900,000).  In two other Sotheby's sessions of works by modern and Impressionist artists next Friday, the top lot in the morning sale, beginning at 10, is Eugene Boudin's 1890 ''The Beach at Scheveningen'' (up to $85,000), and in the afternoon, starting at 2, it is Paul Klee's 1920 ''Portrait of a Boy'' (up to $200,000).  Two hundred Chinese-fan paintings from the collection of the late Chan Yee-pong, a Hong Kong collector, will be up for bidding next Thursday at 2 P.M. at Sotheby's York Avenue galleries, at 72d Street. Collected over 20 years, the 214 fans date from the Ming Dynasty in the 17th century through the Ching Dynasty in the 19th century, and selections have been exhibited at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., and at the University of Kansas Museum of Art. The most important are two 19th-century fans - an ink-on-gold-fleck-paper example by Zhao Zhiqian, depicting a blossoming branch, and an inkand-color-on-gold-fleck-paper painting that shows a squirrel on a branch. Each is expected to sell for up to $4,000.  English and Continental pottery and porcelain will be auctioned at Christie's East, the Christie's annex at 219 East 67th Street, next Tuesday at 2 P.M. and Wednesday at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. The most important lots are two brown-glazed, multihandled mugs of the kind called tygs, one a globular vessel from 1711 with two double-loop handles (up to $8,000) and the other a cylindrical vessel, dated 1659, with four double-loop handles (up to $6,000 each). There is also a rare breakfast set from about 1775 made at the Gotha factory in Germany, which was in business for only 20 years. It is said to be in perfect condition (up to $6,000).
