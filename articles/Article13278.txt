 Who Needs A Flood Policy?; There's a Good Chance You Do; Feds Urge More Inlanders to Buy Insurance Before the Next Katrina   By McQueen, M P, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2006  Few people heed that advice. Roughly half of all private homes in the country's highest-risk flood zones have flood insurance, according to the Rand study. Federal law requires homeowners in flood zones to have flood insurance if their mortgage is government-sponsored or guaranteed. But an estimated 25% of these homeowners don't comply, for reasons that aren't clear, according to the Rand study.  Lisa Magee and her husband, Chris, an Air Force captain, were glad that they complied. The couple bought a house in Ocean Springs, Miss., a year before Katrina hit in August, and were required by the mortgage lender to buy flood coverage because they lived near a bayou. "[FLOOD] insurance saved us," says Ms. Magee, whose neighborhood was hard hit by the hurricane. "Some neighbors didn't have adequate insurance, and some didn't have it at all. And they lost everything."  Of the new private-sector policies on the market, Fireman's Fund offers a special endorsement for flood coverage in its homeowner policies in 29 states, but only in low- to moderate-flood-risk areas. The policies offer broader coverage limits than the government insurance, living expenses, and full replacement cost of structure and contents. Flood insurance adds about $220 to $600 to the company's overall homeowner premium, which at Fireman's averages about $3,500.
