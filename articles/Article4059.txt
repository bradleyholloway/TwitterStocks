 Tax Plan's Boost to Privatizing Services   By By E.S. Savas, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 1985  Some state and local officials believe that President Reagan's proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes would cause painful reductions in local government services. No way. The impact on state and local services will be negligible, but the opportunity to actually improve services is immense.  Let's examine the implied scenario that leads to the gloomy forecast: A loss of deductibility will cause wealthy taxpayers in some states to pay more in federal income taxes. These taxpayers will successfully press for cuts in state and local taxes so that their total taxes -- federal, state and local -- will be as low as they were before the reform. Finally, the thinking goes, this loss of revenue for state and local governments must inevitably be translated into proportional reductions in services. This reasoning does not withstand even cursory inspection.  More important is the simple acknowledgement that a reduction in revenue does not have to be witlessly accommodated by a corresponding reduction in services. Giving the taxpayers more for their money -- by better management and increased productivity -- is a vastly better alternative. In fact, state and local governments now have available a thoroughly tested technique that regularly produces productivity improvements in the range of 30% to 50%: privatization.
