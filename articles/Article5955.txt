 Dollar Gains on Yen, Loses Ground Against Euro   By By Jennifer Downey, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2001  Late Wednesday, the euro was at 88.49 U.S. cents, up from 88.20 cents in London and from 88.36 cents in New York late Tuesday. The dollar was at 122.15 yen, up from 121.90 yen in London and from 121.27 yen late Tuesday in New York.  Considering the triad of bad data out of Germany, "the euro's move down has been relatively well-contained," said Andy Chaveriat, technical analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. This could suggest that the euro is just retracing, rather than reacting to fundamental data, or that markets are convinced the U.S. and euro land's "relative economic pictures are evening up . . . or evening down," he said.  In an interview published on the Financial Times Web site yesterday, Japanese Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka said that reform efforts could cause the yen to weaken. It's a link economists have stressed recently, but markets have been reluctant to admit as optimism buoys the yen. "If we accelerate the reform process this will have a deflationary impact, and we will then continue monetary easing," Mr. Takenaka said, according to the FT interview. Easing would increase the supply of yen, pushing the yen's price lower.
