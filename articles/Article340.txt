The question is: how free is free? Since the summer of 1980, the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore has been representing the City of New York in an effort to convince the courts that the 1980 census figures, which show a marked decrease in the city's population, were in error.  The work has been pro bono publico, ''for the public good.'' Had the firm actually charged the city for the hours its attorneys put in to date, it maintains, the bill would be $1,865,132.  Instead, there is a bill for $348,245.23, which Cravath is asking for reimbursment of ''out of pocket'' expenses. The city has already agreed to pay $255,000, and the Board of Estimate is expected to authorize $100,000 more either at its meeting today or on Dec. 17.  But yesterday, at the board's executive session, Hadley W. Gold, first assistant corporation counsel, was called in to explain the new costs. 'We Are the Client'  Armed with two thick folders full of receipts and a hefty computerized expense statement, he explained that free is free up to a point, and that the city policy is that expenses are usually paid for by the client.  ''We are the client,'' he noted. ''These are expenses that lawyers would normally incur. They have been audited by the Mayor's office.'' More than 60 law firms handled more than 600 cases for the city on a pro bono basis since the policy was introduced in 1978 by Allen G. Schwartz, the Corporation Counsel. Mr Schwartz said through a spokesman that when expenses were minor law firms often absorbed them, but when they were substantial, the city has reimbursed the firms.  Among the items in a $132,796.76 bill submitted to the city by Cravath on July 29 were the following expenses:  - $96,129.30 for document reproduction.  - $18,811.01 for travel expenses, mostly involving Washington.  - $3,018.88 for telephone and other communication costs. Outstanding Debt at $93,610  The city paid $90,000 on this bill before reaching the $255,000 its self-imposed ceiling. This left $42,796.76 unreimbursed, and since then other bills have come in, bringing the total outstanding debt to $93,610.05.  Should the Board of Estimate, as expected, approve raising the ceiling on authorizations, it will allow Cravath to be reimbursed for the current outstanding bills. But it seems clear that there will be more bills.  ''I would anticipate,'' Mr. Gold told the board, ''that since the case goes on - it's in the United States Supreme Court right now - there will be additional expenses.''  By that time, Mr. Gold and everyone else at the Corporation Counsel's office will be working for Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., who on Jan. 1 will replace Mr. Schwartz. For the last year and a half, Mr. Schwarz has been the lead counsel for Cravath in the lawsuit.
