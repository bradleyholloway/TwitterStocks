 Old Spice Whistles New Tune to Young   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2002  Under the noses of its adult fans, Old Spice has become a popular deodorant with guys in their teens and 20s. Few use aftershave, so Procter & Gamble, the maker of Old Spice, won't push that signature product. Instead, P&G will press its advantage with this age group by selling them two new types of deodorant -- a gel stick antiperspirant and an aerosol can, forms its research shows are most popular with young guys -- as well as soap and scented deodorant wipes. To promote its young image and products, Old Spice plans to nearly double its advertising spending this year to almost $48 million.  P&G is dispatching skimpily clad "towel girls" to Florida for spring break to pass out Old Spice soap. Its biggest splash is planned for Old Spice Cool Contact, a gray rubber tub of strongly scented deodorant wipes that guys can use to brush sweat off their brows and bodies. (P&G hastens to call the product "refreshment towels," a spokesman says, so people don't think of baby wipes.) P&G's Mr. [Derek Bowen] says he envisions passing out samples with rental tuxedos at high-school prom time. Tubs of about 20 wipes sell for $3.99 and hit store shelves next week.  Old Spice, which first became popular during World War II when its aftershave was included in toiletry kits for GIs, was the No. 10 brand in a crowded field in late 1989. Old Spice made deodorant but didn't push it until it became a way to jump-start the brand with guys who barely have peach fuzz. P&G introduced Old Spice deodorants with names like High Endurance, in 1993, and Red Zone, in 1999, all designed for a younger, more macho man.
