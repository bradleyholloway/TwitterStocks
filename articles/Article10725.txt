 Opened Door: Direct Flights Abroad Help the South Attract Much Foreign Capital --- A 'New Boy' Network Tries To Assist the Investors; Gov. Wallace's Tax Pitch --- But Atlanta Still Isn't Paris   By By John Huey, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1985  HAWKINSVILLE, Ga. -- A while back, Pulaski County's lone commissioner, John Henry Anderson, heard that this tiny community was one of 77 being considered as a plant site by a British paper company. He and five other local businessmen drove two hours to Atlanta, hopped a direct flight to London and made their pitch.  Then in 1978 -- with pressure on regulatory authorities from President Carter -- cities such as Atlanta and Dallas became bona fide international "gateways" offering regular flights to several world capitals. A huge door had opened to the whole Southern U.S. -- and it opened with a squeak hardly noticed outside the region.  Although the South remains a financial colony of Northeastern money-center banks and big insurance companies, its business community is aggressively renewing long-dormant ties with Europe and pursuing new relationships with Asian traders and investors. The foreigners are attracted mostly by money, and they like the South's business climate so much that they willingly tolerate the substantial cultural differences; even Atlanta can often be something less than Paris-on-the-Chattahoochee. What stirs the Southerners' interest is mostly money, too; the net foreign-capital inflow into the U.S. totaled $100 billion last year, according to Commerce Department estimates.
