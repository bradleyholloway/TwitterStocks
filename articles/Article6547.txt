 Kmart Says CEO Conaway Resigned, Adds Post to Plate of Chairman Adamson   By By Amy Merrick, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2002  Mr. Conaway, 41, joined Kmart from CVS Corp., where he was president and chief operating officer of the drugstore chain. While nominally Kmart's CEO, he had receded into the background in the past six weeks. Analysts and investors have expressed frustration that Mr. Conaway failed to publicly defend Kmart as suppliers were halting shipments and credit agencies were swiftly downgrading its debt. Mr. Conaway wasn't available for comment, Kmart said.  Known for his behind-the-scenes financial background, Mr. Conaway found himself catapulted into the spotlight at Kmart in May 2000 as the leader of a flagging American icon. He assembled a young management team stocked with Wal-Mart veterans. Vowing to make Kmart the "authority for moms," he signed high-profile deals to get brands like Joe Boxer and Disney -- and a long-term contract with Martha Stewart. He also got rid of merchandise-stuffed trailers that sat idly behind Kmart stores.  Kmart executives soon were criticized for practically igniting a price war with giant Wal-Mart through Kmart's "BlueLight Always" program, in which it permanently cut prices on 38,000 items. Last fall, Mr. Conaway told analysts the discounts were depressing overall sales. As Wal-Mart's and Target's sales kept climbing during the holidays, Kmart fell further behind.
