 Tokyo Tells Banks To Boost Profits Or Face Penalties   By Fackler, Martin, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 2003  Friday's order by the regulatory Financial Services Agency also underscored how inconsistent reform efforts have been in the past. The directive targeted 15 banks that had received tens of billions of dollars of public funds in 1998 and 1999 to help clean up bad loans. They include three of Japan's four biggest lenders: Mizuho Holdings Inc., UFJ Holdings Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. The fourth-largest, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc., wasn't named because it is the healthiest of the biggest four banks and didn't need to take any public funds in those two years.  Still, FSA officials said bad-loan disposals couldn't solely account for the size of banks' losses. They said the banks needed to take additional steps to improve performance, though they didn't specify what. Analysts have urged banks to cut staff and move into more lucrative fee-based businesses, like asset management.
