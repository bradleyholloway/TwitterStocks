 A Reprise of Discredited Theories   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2006  In their March 28 editorial-page commentary "For People and Planet," Al Gore and David Blood define "externalities" as costs imposed by business on society and the environment, and they call for businesses to defray these costs. And they convey an ominous warning: "'License to Operate' may no longer be taken for granted by business."  I've had no trouble at all sorting through the gibberish in the rest of the essay. Messrs. Gore and Blood will assign arbitrary monetary values to the toll they claim I've inflicted on society and extract damages from me, and that money will go toward new government initiatives. While I appreciate a wild, drunken spending spree as much as the next person, I also enjoy clarity, and I would greatly prefer that the authors drop the obfuscation and false piety. They want money, and lots of it, to fund their pet projects. A gift wrapping of "social responsibility" and "externalities" won't disguise the stench of what's inside their package.
