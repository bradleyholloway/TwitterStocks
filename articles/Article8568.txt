 Why cattle eat federal grass   By Jennings, Colleen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 1995  Colleen Jennings responds to the Jan 3, 1995 article "An End to Cowboy Welfare," saying that "those who oppose grazing and logging, etc. on public lands are destroying the areas they loudly proclaim are being preserved" and that "we all must work together and prevent destruction of these precious resources by the noisy few who haven't a clue as to how the majority of stockmen actually enhance and improve their allotments."
