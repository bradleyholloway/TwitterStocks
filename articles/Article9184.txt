 Three Hot Managers Remain Bullish on Techs   By By Danielle Sessa, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 2000  The three pros -- Quint Slattery, manager of PBHG New Opportunities Fund; Kevin Landis, chief of Firsthand Technology Value Fund; and David Alger, skipper of Spectra Fund -- know a thing or two about investing. Mr. Slattery posted the best 12-month record with a sultry 533.05% return, placing it far ahead of the competition, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. The fund has $457 million under management.  Mr. Landis sports the best record of any mutual-fund manager during the five years ended March 31. His $4 billion fund is up an annualized 67.24% for the period, according to Morningstar, of Chicago.  Mr. Alger's $1.03 billion fund boasts a 31.21% annualized return over the past 10 years, just nudging out Paul Wick's Seligman Communication & Information Fund and Gary Lewis's Van Kampen Emerging Growth Fund by less than one percentage point to claim the top prize. (In determining which managers performed best, Morningstar ranked the funds that had the same manager for the entire period being judged.)
