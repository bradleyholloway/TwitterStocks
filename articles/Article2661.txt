 The Contract mistake   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1994  An editorial recalls how many Democrats and their allies believed that the "Contract with America" that Newt Gingrich and 300 House GOP candidates signed on Sep 27, 1994 would help their cause in the congressional elections. With the GOP now in control of Congress, the editorial says that the Contract may have only opened the bidding for changes in government.
