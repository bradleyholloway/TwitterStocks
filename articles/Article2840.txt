 Shares of GE Climb as Chairman Predicts Earnings Growth of at Least 10% in 2001   By By Matt Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2001  Mr. [JEFFREY R. IMMELT] said cost cuts and other synergies from joining Honeywell to GE should exceed $3 billion, more than twice GE's initial estimate, analysts said. He said the outlook for Honeywell's first-quarter earnings, which some analysts have said they expect to be poor, is "consistent with GE's expectations." GE originally had hoped to close the transaction this quarter, eliminating the need for Honeywell to report earnings, but European regulators have extended a review of the deal, pushing it back at least several months.  The focus of the meeting was GE's efforts to apply the Internet and other digital tools across its operations. The company reiterated that savings from these efforts should total $1.6 billion pretax in 2001. Those savings will come from conducting nearly $14 billion in Web-based auctions and moving work processes to the Internet. GE said it expects sales over the Internet to be greater than $15 billion in 2001.
