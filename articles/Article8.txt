New York City sank into bitter, snowy cold yesterday, a situation that exhilarated some, including eager skiers and sledders in Central Park, but brought suffering to many tenants of buildings without heat.  Grim discomfort, snarled traffic and the bureaucratic problems of pared city staffs and shrunken budgets were lost on those for whom snow is still a thing of beauty, or an opportunity for urban humor.  ''This is the first snow of the winter that I like,'' said John Gonzalez at the Rockefeller Center skating rink. ''I like it when it sticks to the street like this, when the city is hushed. The snow makes New York look like it is friendly. It gives it the feeling of another time.''  But while some took pleasure in the crystal air - a low of five degrees yesterday morning - more than 20 city workers sat at video terminals in the city's Central Complaint Bureau in Harlem, logging the miseries brought by the cold to those whose heating and hot water systems had failed. 6,736 Complaints in 9 Hours  From 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., the bureau workers punched 6,736 complaints into the computer system, for follow-up by an overtaxed force of 400 housing inspectors.  Emergencies of leaking pipes or cold involving elderly people, the handicapped or children were placed at the top of the growing pile, but no one was guaranteed a response in less than 24 hours. The actual response time can take days or weeks, officials said, and for some residents, patience has turned brittle since the cold first gripped the city in earnest over Christmas.  At 3 P.M., a police officer called from a building on Morris Avenue in the Bronx. ''These people tell me they've been complaining of no heat or hot water for three weeks, and that no inspector has been out yet,'' he said. ''There are 75 or 80 people here, and lots of children. They're getting pretty hostile. I do believe we have a potentially riotous situation.''  ''The only way for the city to really act on this question is to declare a heat emergency crisis,'' Assemblyman John C. Dearie, Democrat of the Bronx, said last night. ''Tons of complaints come pouring into the city complaint bureau, and with four teams working, they say it takes a week to visit the buildings and another two to get it fixed.''  ''But within 24 hours,'' Mr. Dearie continued, ''this can be a matter of life and death. We need a special commissioner to come in with a crisis attitude, to reach in and cut red tape, to train more building inspectors, and mobilize city resources immediately to solve this problem.'' Mr. Dearie said he would push his proposal with Mayor Koch, but the responsible city officials said separately that they were aware they had a problem.  ''Because of the unprecedented cold, we'll be announcing some new initiatives next week, some things we can do to immediately dispatch housing inspectors to these buildings,'' Robert K. Davis, deputy commissioner for operations of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said. Budget constrictions have cost the department 200 housing inspectors in the last two years, Mr. Davis said, ''and this year, we lost $3.1 million in state funds for code enforcement.''  The 200,000 daily commuters on the Long Island Rail Road were also warned of possible delays this morning because of snow and subfreezing temperatures. The railroad issued an advisory last night suggesting that its passengers plan extra traveling time to allow for shortages of equipment, slow-running trains, malfunctioning gates and signal problems.  Among those in New York City who took little pleasure from the snowfall was Meyer Levine, 58 years old, of Brooklyn. Shades of Appreciation  ''All my friends are lying by the pool in Florida telling me that snow is beautiful and I should appreciate this 19 degree weather,'' he said. ''I should appreciate the gray gunk that comes on the street after the snow mixes with everyone's filthy boots. I should appreciate the fact that my feet are so stiff that I lost three toes already since Christmas? What do all those old beach bunnies know about appreciation?''  Appreciation? ''Come on, come on,'' Ira Lowenstein said to his wire-haired terrier, Sheba, out for his morning toilet in Riverside Park. Mr. Lowenstein jumped up and down, blew warmly on his cupped hands. ''Come on. This is no time for fooling around. Let's get down to business.'' Sheba, less chilled than Mr. Lowenstein, continued to eye an Irish Setter several yards away.  Appreciation? Victor Boff, 65, was feeling keen when he and six other members of the Iceberg Athletic Club climbed out of the Atlantic Ocean at Coney Island after a 5 minute to 10 minute swim a little before 2 P.M. The air temperature at the time, he said, was about 5 degrees; the water temperature, 34.  ''Today was a challenge because it was much colder than usual, the temperature being way below zero, including the wind chill factor,'' he said. ''The hair on my chest and head were coated with ice when I got out. It's something you really have to experience to appreciate.''  ''When you get out, the thermal changes in your body are terrific,'' said Mr. Boff, who claims not to have missed a winter dip in the Atlantic in 30 years. ''Your body turns a bright red color. That's hypothermia. Your blood is really circulating, and you get a terrific feeling that lasts for weeks. It makes you eat like an athlete and sleep like a baby.''  The snow - one to four inches of it fell on the city through the weekend -brought hundreds of Mr. Boff's spirit to sled in Central Park. And it did not dissuade 1,000 runners from a five-mile race through the park yesterday morning, even though the fast, fiveminute-mile runners suffered a wind chill factor of from 45 degrees to 50 degrees below zero.
