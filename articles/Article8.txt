The staff of the New York State Public Service Commission has recommended that the commission not approve the proposed merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic unless Nynex agrees to compensate its customers for the loss of a potential new competitor in the New York telephone market.  The recommendation, which came in testimony filed with the commission on Monday, will probably not prompt New York's regulators to block the $22 billion deal, according to people familiar with the commission. But it could force Nynex to cut its residential rates and increase the penalties recently assessed to the company for its poor customer service.  The staff members did not recommend specific rate cuts or increased penalties. But in harshly worded testimony, a panel of staff members said that Nynex's customer service was deplorable and that merging with Bell Atlantic would only reduce the pressure on the company to improve its service quality or keep a lid on monthly rates.  A spokesman for the commission, David Flanagan, said the recommendations of the staff members would be weighed by the five commissioners, along with testimony from consumer groups, long-distance carriers like AT&T and the two companies themselves. Mr. Flanagan said the commission planned to rule on the merger early next year. Three of the commissioners, including the chairman, were appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, one by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and one by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.  The chairman, John F. O'Mara, said in a recent interview that he would be reluctant to approve the deal ''unless we're satisfied that the merger is going to have a beneficial effect on customer service.'' But he also expressed enthusiasm that the companies had chosen Manhattan as the site for their headquarters.  Several consumer lobbying groups, who oppose the deal in its current form, said that Nynex ought to cut the rates for its 7.5 million residential customers by $1.25 billion over five years. That number reflects both the internal savings generated by the deal and a calculation of how much customers could have saved if Bell Atlantic had entered New York as a competitor to Nynex, rather than a partner.  For a single customer, such a cut would translate into $1.70 a month in the first year, rising to $4 a month in the fifth year.  ''The companies have not promised to pass through any cost savings from the deal to ratepayers,'' said Robert Ceisler, the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog agency. ''We think the commission ought to extract some benefits from the merger.''  When Nynex and Bell Atlantic announced their plans to merge last April, they predicted that the companies would generate $600 million in savings within three years by combining operations and laying off 3,000 people from their work forces totaling 133,000.  Stanley Fink, the senior vice president of regulatory and governmental affairs at Nynex, said yesterday that the company would not rule out negotiating new rates with the commission. But he noted that Nynex had already frozen its basic rates as part of a seven-year agreement with New York State. Over the first five years of the plan, Nynex estimates that residential and business customers will save $1 billion.  ''People should not use this unrelated merger as a reason to get something from us that they think they should have gotten before,'' said Mr. Fink, who is a former Speaker of the New York State Assembly.  In their testimony, the commission staff members also said the merger would erode Nynex's already shaky customer service because the company's senior executives would be more focused on making the deal work than on eliminating problems in phone service or speeding up repair crews in trouble-plagued neighborhoods like the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.  ''With levels of performance such as this, management should be focusing on improving service quality in New York, rather than becoming preoccupied with merging with another telecommunications giant,'' the panel of staff members said in their testimony.  The Public Service Commission recently imposed $62.3 million in fines on Nynex for missing customer service benchmarks in the first year of its seven-year rate agreement. But the commission said Nynex had shown some signs of improvement in service in the third quarter of 1996.  Mr. Fink said that Nynex has pledged to spend an extra $1 billion during the next five years to rehabilitate its aging telephone network with fiber optic strands and new copper wire. The commission could also demand that Nynex spend even more for improvements as a condition of approving the merger.
