 U.S. Change in Rule on Withholding Is Reshaping Eurodollar Bond Market   By By Matthew Winkler, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 1985  HELSINKI, Finland -- As the Association of International Bond Dealers conducts its 17th annual meeting here this week, the Eurobond market is booming. Already this year, borrowers have raised $46 billion with new financings, mostly denominated in dollars -- an annual rate about 38% greater than the record $79.9 billion of Eurobond offerings in 1984.  The withholding exemption has drawn a wave of foreign investment into the U.S. bond market and, in the process, has reversed the historic relationship between the anonymous, bearer Eurodollar bonds and registered U.S. bonds. Until mid-1984, most Eurodollar bond issuers paid lower interest rates on their debt than the U.S. Treasury on its issues. Now, most must pay at least as much as the U.S., and many pay more.  By the end of 1984, foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes had increased 75% to about $445 billion from $254 billion in 1983, according to the Treasury Department. Net foreign inflows into Treasurys more than tripled to $18.7 billion from $5.5 billion in 1983. Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds climbed 72% to $32.6 billion from $18.9 billion in 1983 and net foreign inflows into U.S. corporate debt soared to $12 billion from $914 million the previous year.
