 Center for National Policy Sheds Its Bland Past In Effort to Inspire Ideas for New Liberal Agenda   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1986  On the seventh floor of a Senate office building they gathered, nearly 100 college students spending the hot summer months as congressional interns, and their talk had a sense of urgency. The Center for National Policy had called them together to discuss the creation of liberal newspapers on the nation's college campuses.  Venturing into such activist involvement in campus concerns was an unusual foray for a Washington think tank, a marked departure from the sober, sometimes solemn sessions on farm credit, industrial policy, arms control and military strategy usually undertaken by such groups. And by evening's end there were stirrings of interest among the students, even the prospect that the center will help liberal news organs spring up later this year at the University of Pennsylvania, William and Mary, American University and the University of Michigan.  "Progressives suffer in comparison to conservatives in terms of their vision," says Kirk O'Donnell, the former general counsel for House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D., Mass.), who has been president of the center since February. "There is no progressive agenda for the future, and that may be one reason young people are turning to the Republican Party." His goal is to help create a new agenda to breathe life into liberalism and attract new legions of followers.
