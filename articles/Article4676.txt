 Inroads That Go Beyond Affirmative Action   By Kennedy, Robert D, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 1990  Demographic changes are fundamentally altering the American work force, and industry must implement more active strategies to efficiently develop that increasingly scarce asset. In the 1990s, labor force growth will be less than a third what it was in the 1970s. A bigger share of that smaller labor pool will consist of people who have traditionally been absent from the ranks of business leadership -- women, minorities and immigrants.  That's a prescription for failure. Just opening the company's doors to minority applicants will not be enough. Traditional methods will not bring more people into the pipeline, nor will they develop the minority managerial talent upon which our future economy depends. Many minority youngsters view the corporate environment as unfamiliar, even threatening, territory. It will be necessary to help prepare promising young people for college, nurture their talents, interest them in corporate careers, and foster their progress in the managerial ranks.  Ideally, there should be a nationwide organization that, with corporate support, would develop corporate-ready minority professionals, prepared for entry-level management jobs and able to move on to increasingly responsible positions. Such an organization would identify promising minority high school students, prepare them for college, place them in supervised corporate summer internships, and provide counseling and support services to groom them for corporate careers.
