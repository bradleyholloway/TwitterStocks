 Prisoner Nation   By By Norbert Vollertsen, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 2003  During my interviews, I met many human-rights activists who had devoted their lives to helping the North Korean refugees. Hiroshi Kato, a Japanese journalist and organizer of Life Funds for North Korean Refugees, based in Tokyo; Sang Hun Kim, a South Korean former U.N. official and human rights volunteer; Chun Ki Won, a South Korean Christian missionary; and many others. We realized from our experience in the field in China that the North Korean defectors had risked their lives fleeing starvation and oppression.  Another strategy of ours was to create a flood of North Korean "boat people." We made extensive plans for vessels to carry refugees across the Yellow Sea from China to South Korea. Once again many activists and even a freelance photographer for the New York Times got arrested. Beijing treats the North Korean refugees -- and increasingly those who help them as well -- like common criminals. China continues to prop up [Kim Jong Il]'s evil regime even as thousands sneak over the border to escape it.  Even worse, the South Korean government has largely turned a blind eye to the plight of their "brothers" to the north, and in many cases has actually hindered their escape. Our plans to cross the Yellow Sea were foiled in part by South Korean authorities who used surveillance, interception and minders to disrupt our plans. Read this again, for I wish to stress the shame of it: South Korean authorities worked actively to foil our attempts to bring North Korean refugees to freedom. But under South Korean law, North Korean refugees cannot be turned away. It is time for Seoul to live up to this promise.
