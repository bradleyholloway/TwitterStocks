 Bookshelf: The Black Experience: Rage and Reality   By By Clarence Thomas, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 1987  Through a series of 10 metaphorical tales or "chronicles," Harvard law professor Derrick Bell explores the theme of the subtitle of his book "And We Are Not Saved: The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice" (Basic, 288 pages, $19.95). The dialogue form -- exchanges between character Bell and his fictitious heroine, Geneva Crenshaw, a black civil rights attorney and law professor -- enables author Bell (who is black) to be provocative without appearing dogmatic.  We eavesdrop on conversations between committed black scholars who confidently and credibly express their qualms and quarrels about a future strategy for black Americans. In the fictional chronicles we behold a series of spectacles and mysteries: Ms. Crenshaw appears at the Constitutional Convention; the children of wealthy whites have their color and character transformed; a disease materializes that strikes only at single professional black women; pebbles are found to cure black criminality. These tales revolve around a variety of themes, including voting rights and proportional representation, the benefits and harms of school desegregation, the limits of legal remedies, and "the social affliction of racism." Each conversation discusses or refers to underlying scholarship.
