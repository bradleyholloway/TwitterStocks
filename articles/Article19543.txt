 World AIDS Experts Debate Treatment Vs. Prevention   By By Rachel Zimmerman and Mark Schoofs, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2002  That question will be the centerpiece of the coming World AIDS Conference, which will draw more than 10,000 AIDS researchers, activists and physicians to Barcelona starting this Sunday. The clash between proponents of AIDS treatment and those who favor focusing on prevention will profoundly affect how most of the $2 billion Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria will be spent.  A new target of criticism is Mr. [Bill Gates] and his Foundation, which is staunchly backing the prevention side with hundreds of millions in funding and Mr. Gates's personal influence. Though Mr. Gates will stay away from Barcelona, a new "prevention task force," led by his top AIDS-prevention expert Helene Gayle, formerly of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be taking center stage.  Twenty years after the AIDS virus was first identified, huge gaps in knowledge, especially among young people, are pervasive. A report by UNAIDS and the U.N.'s International Children's Education Fund in countries with generalized HIV epidemics, such as Cameroon, Central African Republic and Sierra Leone, more than 80% of young women ages 15 to 24 don't know enough about HIV. In Ukraine, although 99% of girls had heard of AIDS, only 9% could name three ways to avoid infection.
