 Cooper Tire Sees Rise In Sales, Flat Profit For 2nd Period, Half   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 25, 1984  FINDLAY, Ohio -- Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. expects second-quarter and first-half sales to rise more than 25%, but higher materials costs and competitive pricing will hold profit about even with a year earlier, Ivan W. Gorr, president, said.  The producer of replacement tires and industrial rubber products will have second-quarter sales of about $143 million, compared with $112.4 million the year earlier, Mr. Gorr said. First half sales will rise about 29% to $277 million from $213.9 million.  But net income for the quarter and half will about equal the $6.2 million, or 62 cents a share, and $10.3 million, or $1.04 a share, for the comparable 1983 periods, Mr. Gorr said in an interview.
