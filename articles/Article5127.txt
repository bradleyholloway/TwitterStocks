 Bond Sale May Herald Lower Rates --- Average 8.84% Yield Trailed Expectations As U.S. Ends Auction   By By Constance Mitchell and Jones Hayden, The Wall Street Journal,  May 11, 1990  The average yield of 8.84% on the 30-year bonds was the lowest at an auction since last May, when the yield was 9.11%. And yesterday's yield was even lower than the 8.88% average yield on the Treasury's 10-year notes that were auctioned Tuesday. Long-term rates are generally higher than those with shorter maturities, so the discrepancy reflects that rates were falling even as the auction proceeded.  "We had excellent domestic institutional demand. This was a good auction," said John Costas, co-manager of government trading at First Boston Corp. He said, however, that some dealers may have been disappointed that Japanese demand for the 30-year bonds was lukewarm. But at First Boston, which has far more U.S. than foreign customers, "our tenders {bids from investors} were the strongest in six or seven auctions," Mr. Costas said.  "Mortgage rates are coming down even as we speak," said Paul Havemann, a vice president at HSH Associates, which compiles mortgages rate information. Mr. Havemann said that rates on conventional mortgages, which rose from 9.8% in early January to about 10.6% last week, fell yesterday to about 10.5% and will probably fall further today. Prior to the bond auction, economists worried that bond yields would exceed 9% at the auction, which prompted some mortgage lenders to raise rates. But now, "just about every lender we survey said they are cutting rates," said Mr. Havemann.
