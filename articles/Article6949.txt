 British Police Fear Additional Attacks; Lack of Clues, Strong Leads Suggests Terrorists Learned From Madrid, Still Lurking   By Keith Johnson in Madrid, David Crawford in Berlin and Jeanne Whalen in London, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2005  Since Thursday's attacks, investigators have been pursuing similarities between the London bombings and those in Madrid, which killed 191. In Madrid, the train bombers tried in vain to blow up a high-speed rail link days after the first bombing but couldn't place the detonators.  Two weeks later, the bulk of the terrorists blew themselves up in a Madrid safe house after they were cornered by police. Investigators said they had planned additional attacks in Madrid: Plans found in the building's rubble highlighted new targets, and the seven terrorists retained more than half of their initial cachet of 200 kilograms of dynamite, according to Spanish police and court documents.  According to Spanish court documents and police reports, suspected Islamic terrorists have refined how they plan for such attacks. First, they started using coded conversations to confound wiretaps -- for example, saying "notebooks" for false passports, or "honey" for explosives. Then, they began using encryption to try to establish secure communications. Some also have stopped using email, relying instead on a single email account accessible to all cell members in which unsent "drafts" contain crucial information. In addition, many terrorists -- including Osama bin Laden -- have entirely stopped using cellphones and satellite phones to sidestep eavesdropping, according to German police and U.S. intelligence reports.
