 California Agrees to Spend $40 Billion To Buy Power Under 10-Year Agreements   By By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 6, 2001  Mr. [Gray Davis] said the 40 ten-year deals -- some of which are firm contracts, others tentative agreements -- would provide an average capacity of 8,886 megawatts of electricity. During a hot summer day, California's peak demand can hit 45,000 megawatts of capacity. The average price of this power would be $69 a megawatt hour, with the average being about $10 a megawatt hour higher than that figure during the first five years, the governor said. These prices are far below the current spot-market prices of $200 to $400 a megawatt hour.  Indeed, many of the agreements announced by Mr. Davis still have to resolve uncertainties before becoming actual contracts. Some power generators said they were surprised by the governor's announcement, since they are still in the process of trying to finalize contracts. Among the concerns they cited was where the money to fund the long-term contracts will come from.
