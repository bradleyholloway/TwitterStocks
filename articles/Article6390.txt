 DoubleClick Warns It Will Miss Fourth-Quarter Profit Estimates   By By Jennifer Rewick, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2000  Stephen Collins, DoubleClick's chief financial officer, said DoubleClick overestimated revenue on the expectation that it could upsell online advertising options to its customers. He cited the overall downturn in the advertising industry.  Others weren't as skeptical. Henry Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., noted that shares of DoubleClick were down only slightly yesterday, slipping six cents to $11.94 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  DoubleClick also expects to take a write-down of goodwill of $70 million to $85 million related to previous acquisitions. The company also plans to write off $19 million owed by advertising client AllAdvantage.com, which may not be able to pay its bill.
