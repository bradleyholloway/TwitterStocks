 Attention Shifts to Social Security; As Overhaul Plan Gains Momentum, Bond Dealers Brace for Potential Impact   By Lagomarsino, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 10, 2004  "The market should take it very seriously, because it does look like there is some momentum," Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said of the administration's plans to revamp Social Security.  The [Bush] administration has acknowledged more borrowing would be needed to fund its plan to create personal investment accounts in Social Security. White House spokesman Scott McClellan said this week there would be some "upfront transition financing" to move toward personal savings accounts and a stronger Social Security system.  Ratings firms appeared less enthusiastic, however, largely because the bond sale is intended to partially fund an $8.5 billion stock- buyback to take the company private. Standard & Poor's yesterday downgraded the company's triple-B unsecured debt rating to triple-B- minus. Fitch Ratings earlier this week downgraded senior debt ratings for Cox to one notch above speculative-grade, assigning it a triple-B- minus rating. Moody's Investors Service in October had cut by one notch senior debt ratings of Cox to the lowest investment-grade rating, Baa3.
