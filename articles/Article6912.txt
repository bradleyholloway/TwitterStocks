 Governors Seek Wider Ethanol Use; Coalition Backs Expanding U.S. Production Mandate To Reduce Oil Dependency   By Fialka, John J, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 2005  "We think it's time to broaden the concept of ethanol beyond traditional agriculture," said Jason Grumet, executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a foundation-backed research group that has proposed enhanced ethanol production. He sees an "encouraging convergence" on the issue between environmental groups and ethanol's traditional supporters in the Corn Belt. Ethanol, when blended into gasoline, stretches the fuel's supply and makes it burn more cleanly. The nation's ethanol producers currently make about 3.7 billion gallons a year, 95% of it from corn.  Raising the amount to eight billion gallons and adding incentives for potentially cheaper feedstocks would still make ethanol less than 5% of the nation's fuel supply. But Ed Murphy, a group director for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil industry, said it will fight further incentives. The Institute had agreed with ethanol producers to support a mandate of five billion gallons a year by 2012. (Currently, oil refiners get a 51 cent federal tax credit for every gallon of ethanol they use as a gasoline additive.) "We think that's adequate," said Mr. Murphy. "After that, it's up to them to prove they can compete with other fuels."
