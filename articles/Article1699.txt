 Retail Sales Post 5.1% Increase For Last Year --- Gain, Helped by December, Was Biggest Since 1989; Producer Prices Inch Up   By By Lucinda Harper, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1993  Total retail sales for the all-important month were 8% above December 1991 levels, a figure that the industry watches closely. Department store sales were up 10.3%. At apparel stores, sales were up 13.5%.  Separately, the Labor Department said prices at the wholesale level crept up 0.2% in December after dropping the same amount the month before. The report suggests that inflation remains well in check despite recent pickups in economic activity. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, as economists often do to gauge underlying inflationary pressures, producer prices rose 1.9% last year, the smallest increase in 10 years.  The pickup in retail sales in December wasn't spread evenly. Sales at department stores and apparel shops, usually great benefactors of holiday spending, didn't rise as much as they usually do at this time of year. After removing the usual seasonal fluctuations, sales at department and apparel stores were down from November.
