 Airline Woes Hold Dangers for Leasing Companies   By By J. Lynn Lunsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2002  About 50% of all airplanes in the world fleet are owned or managed by leasing companies. The two largest are Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corp., a unit of American International Group, and General Electric Co.'s GE Capital Aviation Services; each has a fleet of more than 500 airplanes. ILFC said yesterday that it had no airplanes on lease to US Airways. GE, however, said it has a number of airplanes on lease or under lease-financing arrangements to US Airways, but it wouldn't say how many. "We have been talking to the airline and we continue to do so," a company spokesman said.  James D. Tussing, a lawyer for Fulbright & Jaworski in New York who has been involved in several airline bankruptcy-court proceedings, said that leasing companies, like other creditors, are in a far stronger negotiating position with airlines before the airlines seek bankruptcy-court protection. Once a carrier files for Chapter 11, the creditors face the challenge of seizing airplanes, finding new customers and then refitting them with new interiors and paint jobs. "Very often, the lessors will determine that the best home for that equipment will be with the original airline, even though it is in bankruptcy," Mr. Tussing said.
