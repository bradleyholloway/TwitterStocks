 Fickle Consumers Force Auto Makers to Be More Flexible --- Toyota, Honda, GM, Others See Need to Equip Plants for Variety of Vehicle Types   By By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2001  One motivating factor behind Toyota's decision to boost the Kentucky plant's flexibility is fear of rapidly changing consumer tastes. Many American consumers have been ditching traditional sedans to embrace car-truck hybrids such as the Toyota Highlander. Keeping factories flexible enough to cope with such rapid change in tastes, Mr. [Gary Convis] said, is a good defensive move.  Toyota's rival, Honda, knows this well. The Japanese auto maker, which has transformed several plants in Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom and the U.S. since the late 1990s, has been struggling to keep its plant in Britain humming because of weak sales in Europe. As sales fell 23% in the year ended March 31, Honda's only European car-assembly factory in Swindon, England, which has capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles a year, produced just 76,500 vehicles, or 51% of the capacity.  Honda executives say investments in making the Swindon plant more flexible will help fix the situation. As part of a European overhaul, Honda has said it will start producing later this year the redesigned CR-V small sport-utility vehicle, and later a hatchback version of the Civic in the U.K., both intended in part for export to the U.S. Though still tentative, Honda expects to export 100,000 such vehicles a year from the U.K. to markets around the world, including more than 60,000 CR-Vs and 15,000 Civic hatchbacks to North America.
