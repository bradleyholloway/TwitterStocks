 Pressure on Chrysler Grows To Counter Kerkorian Bid --- Share Buyback Is an Option; Nagging Doubts Remain About Suitor's Financing   By By Wall Street Journal Reporters Steven Lipin, Gabriella Stern and Robert McGough, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1995  Chrysler Corp. is under pressure from major shareholders to respond to Kirk Kerkorian's $20 billion takeover bid with a big share repurchase or other steps, although doubts persist about Mr. Kerkorian's ability to finance the deal, investors and arbitragers say.  On Wednesday, Mr. Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. made an unsolicited offer to buy the 90% of Chrysler shares he doesn't own at $55 each, which would value the whole company at $22.8 billion. But while Mr. Kerkorian's bid spurred a $3.3 billion gain in Chrysler's market value on Wednesday, he acknowledges his offer is "subject to financing" and remains just a letter to the board for now.  In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chrysler shares fell 87.5 cents yesterday, to $47.875, down from Wednesday's high of $52.50. Volume of 12.2 million shares was almost four times the stock's average daily volume. Fueling the stock's slide were the lack of financing details from Tracinda and the Chrysler board's announcement after the market closed Wednesday that the company wasn't for sale. Chrysler characterized the proposed deal as a "leveraged buyout" that would put the company at risk.
