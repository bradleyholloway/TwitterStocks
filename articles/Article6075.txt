 Ah, Paris: Strolling Along the Seine, Sipping `Totally Toffee' --- Foamy, Sweet U.S. Coffee Drinks, Slurped on the Go, Are Taking Off; No More Sneers About `Sock Juice'?   By By Alison Morris, The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2002  Indeed, the old school in Paris thinks it's all just a fad. Jacques Metoyer, owner of the Flores cafe in central Paris, says the new coffee takeout shops aren't a threat because they are so impersonal. "These coffee shops may work right now because they are in fashion, but they won't last," he predicts, standing behind the register to greet his regular customers. "People feel like coming here because it's like being at home."  Mr. [Philippe Bloch] got the idea for his coffee chain while visiting New York in 1993. He was drawn to Coopers Coffee, on busy Columbus Avenue. The first time he passed it, he was lured in by the strong coffee smell wafting onto the street. Inside, he was amazed at the selection of drinks and the unfamiliar vocabulary. He watched in wonder as people ordered coffee to go and then headed out to work.  In 1999, the pair tried again, opening up in the trendy Marais district of Paris. This time, Columbus Cafe took off. In the first weekend after its grand opening, the store baked 800 muffins a day. In 2001, the company doubled its revenue to six million euros. Now, Columbus Cafe is pouring approximately 7,000 cups a day and winning over customers to coffee's more avant garde forms. "It's the only place you can get good iced coffee," Ms. [Sauvanet] says.
