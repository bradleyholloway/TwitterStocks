 Aventis Sued Over Monitoring of Blood Thinner   By Scott Hensley and Julia Flynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 4, 2003  PharmaNetics filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina in Raleigh yesterday after the market closed. The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against Aventis for promoting Lovenox as needing "no routine monitoring." PharmaNetics also wants Aventis to stop claiming that the drug is effective starting with the first dose.  Aventis spokeswoman Patti Munzer said that the company is confident that Lovenox's advertising and marketing is "fully compliant with regulatory guidelines." She declined to respond to the charge that Aventis had breached an agreement with PharmaNetics. "We haven't seen the lawsuit yet, so it would be premature to comment," she said.
