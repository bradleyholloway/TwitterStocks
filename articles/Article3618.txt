 A Note of Faith in Brazil's New Regime --- Departing Finance Minister Praises Moderates Poised To Take Reins of Economy   By By Jonathan Karp and Michael Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2002  Reversing his own criticism of the Workers Party during a heated election campaign in which economic policy took center stage, Mr. [Pedro Malan] praised moderate advisers to President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. "There has been a clear shift in the views and positions of what I call the sensible voices of the opposition," he said in an interview, adding that he believes these moderates hold the "upper hand" in forming the new government. He singled out Antonio Palocci, the head of Mr. da Silva's transition team and a possible successor to Mr. Malan -- and the person he had been meeting in the Finance Ministry just before the interview.  Brazil's currency has recovered from the historic lows it hit during the presidential campaign, but the real has still lost 34% against the dollar this year. The economy may not exceed last year's growth of just 1.5%. Yet the silver lining for Mr. Malan has been a turnaround in Brazil's external accounts. Brazil's current-account deficit will shrink to between $8 billion and $9 billion this year, from $33.6 billion in 1998. Economists say the weak currency and sluggish demand for imports produced this improvement, but Mr. Malan also credits domestic productivity gains that came with opening Brazil to foreign trade and competition. "This is not a passing phenomenon," he said. "It has structural underpinnings."
