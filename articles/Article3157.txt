 Business Air Fares Level Off After Steep Ascent   By By Danielle Reed, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 21, 1999  One big reason: The industry is facing an unexpected slowdown in travel, caused in part by its own steady price increases. "The airlines just pushed business travelers to the point of near rebellion," says Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an aviation-consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo. "You're seeing companies replacing air travel with e-mail."  The upshot is deals, after a fashion: $608 round-trip between Detroit and Washington, down $60 from a year ago; $710 between Atlanta and Chicago, down $260. Holly Fossen expected to pay well over $400 for a recent last-minute business trip from Newark, N.J., to Orlando, Fla. Instead, Continental Airlines flew her south for $287.  Business fares -- those that don't require a long advance purchase or impose other restrictions -- are still far from cheap. Flying coast to coast at the last minute in coach can cost as much as $1,800 round-trip, compared with less than $400 if the ticket is bought far in advance. Last year, business fliers spent about $60 billion on air fares.
