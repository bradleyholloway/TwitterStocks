 Ahead of the Tape   By By Jesse Eisinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 13, 2003  In what looks to be a nice Wall Street piggy bank, these financial institutions are mainly banks, such as Bank of America and Wachovia, which are American Financial's two largest tenants. As it happens, some of these banks also are underwriters of the IPO, including Bank of America, the lead underwriter, and Wachovia, a co-underwriter. The other lead underwriter is Friedman Billings Ramsey, an investment bank that doesn't own any properties. However, the firm did help found the company, still owns a big chunk, and gets fees from the REIT.
