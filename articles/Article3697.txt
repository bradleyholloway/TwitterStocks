 Europe's Hostage Lesson   The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2007  The story of Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo, a reporter for La Repubblica kidnapped last month by the Taliban, is a textbook example of what happens when you cave in to terrorism. Rome pressured the Afghans to release five Taliban prisoners to spring Mr. Mastrogiacomo. In turn, his Afghan driver was beheaded and his translator had his throat cut by the Taliban when Kabul didn't bow to additional demands. Heartened by Italy's willingness to play along, the Taliban will doubtless try again, putting more lives at risk.
