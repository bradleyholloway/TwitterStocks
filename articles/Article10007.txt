 Subprime Politics   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 7, 2007  The noted banking expert Jesse Jackson is scheduled to be a featured witness at today's hearing, along with a couple of unfortunate consumers who were sold mortgages they couldn't afford to repay. Senator Chris Dodd, Chairman of the Banking Committee, is in high dudgeon, threatening legislation and talking about the American dream becoming a nightmare for those who can't make their mortgage payments. It's time for a reality check.  Related to this is the contention, made by the same populists on the current "predatory lending" rampage, that banks make money by charging them "excessive" interest. But, if anything, the recent spate of bankruptcy among subprime lenders suggests that they were charging too little interest to compensate for the credit risk they were taking by lending to people with bad credit histories.  Members of Congress know it's a pain to wrestle with Mr. Bernanke over monetary policy, and the Comptroller's rules for mortgage lending don't make for sexy newspaper copy. It's so much more fun to knock around a couple of prosperous-looking bankers. So in searching for a scapegoat, the politicians are returning to that old chestnut, "predatory lending."
