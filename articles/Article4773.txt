 Stock Prices Rise a Bit as Investors Get Few Clues From Dollar, Bonds   By By Beatrice E. Garcia, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1987  Stock market investors were still focusing on the foreign exchange market. But they got little help from the dollar, which was little changed in New York trading. Bond prices moved only marginally higher.  One reason for the lackluster activity might be caution ahead of today's report on the April merchandise trade deficit and the May index of producer prices. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect the trade deficit to have expanded to $13.9 billion from the $13.6 billion deficit in March. May producer prices are expected to be up 0.5%, compared with a 0.7% rise in April.  Larry Wachtel, a market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, said he was willing to discount yesterday's lackluster session despite what seems like directionless trading, because the major market barometers continued to inch higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed nearly 145 points from its recent low on May 20 and is now about 45 points from its record of 2405.54.
