 Stocks Across Latin America Post Steep Declines Despite the Apparent Victory of Brazil's Cardoso   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Sara Webb in New York and Michael R. Sesit in London, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1998  Brazil dropped as much as 6% before closing down 4.5%. Argentina, which shed nearly 5% at one stage, closed down 2.2%, while Mexico fell more than 4% before ending down 2.9%. The sell-off reflected the realization among investors that it could take a while before Brazil comes up with a fiscal package or receives any financial aid from international sources.  In Europe, the Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 665 European companies closed down 5.77 points, or 2.6%, at 212.96, reflecting a decline across most of the region. Germany's Xetra DAX index closed down 1.2%, the French CAC 40 index ended 2% lower, while Italy's MIBtel index dropped 3.7% due to the latest political upheaval. In Spain, the IBEX-35 index closed down 0.2%, after being up as much as 3.2% on hopes that President (Fernando Henrique) Cardoso's election victory in Brazil would help Spanish stocks with big exposure to Latin America. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed down 2.1%.
