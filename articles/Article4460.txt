 Chase Confirms Move Of Back-Office Site   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 1988  Chase Manhattan Bank confirmed it will move 5,000 back-office workers to a new site in Brooklyn. The bank will thus become the largest commercial or industrial employer in a long-struggling borough that New York City has been trying to revive for years.  Chase, which had been seriously weighing a move to New Jersey, decided to move its back offices to Brooklyn after getting an unprecedented package of New York state and city economic incentives, valued at an estimated $228 million over 25 years.
