 Boeing Sees End Of China Dispute As Boost to Sales   By By Jeremy Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1995  Boeing Co.'s sales to China should get a boost from the resolution of the U.S.-China dispute over intellectual-property rights, said Frank Shrontz, chairman of the aircraft maker.  At the height of the dispute, which was resolved late last month, Beijing threatened to cancel orders for Boeing airliners. Mr. Shrontz said the company realizes it is "a target whenever trade friction occurs" between the U.S. and China, but "hopefully the two countries' relations will remain on an even keel so we can continue to generate airplane sales."  Mr. Shrontz said Boeing hasn't seen any new sales since the row over intellectual-property rights was settled, but added, "I think they will be forthcoming."
