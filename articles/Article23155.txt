 Wright Foundation Has Designs on CEO   By Maher, Kris, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 3, 2004  -- Will the CEO work and live in buildings designed by Mr. Wright? "The person will be working in a space that both Frank Lloyd Wright and Taliesin architects worked in, and there is housing available for them at both Taliesin and Taliesin West. Probably the greatest perk of the position is being an official spokesperson for the legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright."
