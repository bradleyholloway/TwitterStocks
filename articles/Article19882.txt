 Shell, BASF Near Plastics-Venture Sale   By Singer, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  The consortium beat out rival bids at first from private-equity funds and then a competing bid by Iran's National Petrochemical Co. The Iranian company, a state-controlled firm, was a politically controversial candidate because a U.S. embargo forbids Iran's control of U.S. assets and the import of Iranian products into the U.S.  Haldia officials couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. [Purnendu Chatterjee] didn't return calls seeking comment and an Access Industries official declined to comment. Representatives of BASF and Shell, which has headquarters in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, weren't available.  Shell and BASF said in July they planned to find a buyer for the Basell joint venture. The move is part of Shell's vow to sell as much as $12 billion (9.33 billion euros) of noncore businesses in the next three years.
