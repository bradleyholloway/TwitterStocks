 How to Beat the Muslim Brotherhood   By Stephens, Bret, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2006  Mr. [El Gendy]'s formula for defeating the Brotherhood involves three ingredients. The first is public services, with a businessman's twist. In addition to doing the bidding of his constituents, he has launched a personal campaign to raise money for civic projects. "I tell people, I am one man, I have one million pounds [about $175,000]. You are a million; each of you give one pound [about 18 cents]." Approaching his village, he points to the shell of a hospital he's building using matching funds. "In Egypt, we have a heritage of people expecting they'll be taken care of" -- by their elders, by the state, by God. "That's wrong," he says. "We need to change the mentality."  The second ingredient is nationalism. In a recent interview, Muhammad Mahdi Akef, the Brotherhood's supreme guide, expressed his feelings about Egypt thus: "Screw Egypt and the Father of Egypt." For Mr. El Gendy, the quote exposed the Brotherhood's Achilles' Heel: Ultimately, it is more interested in the Muslim nation than the Egyptian one. Mr. El Gendy has introduced a bill in parliament to liberalize the display of the Egyptian flag, which had been strictly regulated since the days of Gamal Abdel Nasser and prohibits its use as, say, a bumper sticker. "You have to get people to look in the mirror and say, 'I'm Egyptian, that's fantastic,'" he says.  Finally, there is Islam, or Mr. El Gendy's version of it. "I'm one of those guys who represents 90% of Muslims who are looking for the right way." He proposes opposing the Muslim Brotherhood with what he calls the "Believer Brotherhood," the belief's particulars being less significant to him than the act of belief itself. "Whenever the prophet speaks of the believers in the Holy Koran, he also speaks of love. If you attack a believer, the first thing he'll ask is, 'What did I do wrong?'"
