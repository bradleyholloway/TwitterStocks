 Congressional Investigators Suggest Bolar Switched Drugs in FDA Tests   By By Gregory Stricharchuk, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 4, 1989  Congressional investigators said they have received information that suggests Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. filled capsules with SmithKline Beecham PLC's blood-pressure medicine to win government approval to sell a generic version of the drug.  The allegations against the Copiague, N.Y., company were made in a letter from the chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee investigating generic drug companies to Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The subcommittee said memos it obtained from an outside lab hired by Bolar to test the drug suggest Bolar substituted SmithKline's product to obtain approval to sell the drug in 1987.  If the allegations prove true, Bolar would become the second generic drug maker to have tricked the FDA to get approval to sell copies of Dyazide. In June, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., admitted to the FDA that it submitted Dyazide in Vitarine capsules to gain FDA approval. Vitarine was the subject of a front-page story in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. Bolar was the first out with a generic Dyazide, and Vitarine was close behind.
