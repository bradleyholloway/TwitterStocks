 Stocks Fall; Don't Fret   By By B. Mark Smith, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 2000  Take, for example, the 1987 crash. Immediately before the crash, dividends were roughly 3%, and interest rates 10%. (For purposes of simplicity, we shall ignore share repurchases.) This means that, given the assumptions of the model, investors before the crash were anticipating that future dividends would grow at a 7% annual rate.  Stocks are volatile today because much more emphasis than ever before is placed on predicting cash flows from businesses, particularly technology companies, that are growing very rapidly, and whose future cash flows are hard to accurately anticipate. Investor assumptions continuously change; each small change in assumptions is magnified into large swings in stock prices. There need be no overarching macroeconomic reason for this, such as unfavorable election results, Federal Reserve policy changes, etc. Instead, wide swings such as that which we are now experiencing are inevitable, and should not be seen as a source of great concern.
