 Monthly Mutual Fund Review: Disappearing Act: Unit Investment Trusts Are Vanishing as New Fund Vehicles Surface --- Assets and Sales Are Falling; Merrill Lynch Abandons The Once-Hot Business   By By Aaron Lucchetti, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  In 1994, unit investment trusts outnumbered mutual funds -- 13,310 to 5,330 -- according to the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group. Since then, the funds business has exploded, while the number of traditional UITs has slipped to about 10,000. Assets of UITs -- most recently tallied at $88 billion -- are more than 30% below their peak of the 1980s and just a sliver of the trillions invested in mutual funds. And gross sales of UITs this year are off 24% from the same period last year, according to ICI.  The growth in stock-oriented UITs brought detractors who argued that the products were great for brokers, but lousy for investors. "Beware of brokers bearing UITs," Frank Stanton, a Morningstar Inc. analyst, warned in the fall of 2000, in what has become a typical cautionary refrain. Mr. Stanton started looking into the products after receiving calls from investors who complained they couldn't easily find data and analysis on their UITs. (Performance information on UITs is usually found only through the firms that sell them, as opposed to newspaper listings or popular investment Web sites.)  For buy-and-hold stock investors, UITs have another unpleasant feature: Their fixed term -- often one to two years for stock UITs -- forces an investor to change into a new UIT at the end of the vehicle's life even if the investor doesn't want a new strategy. This usually brings more commissions and can have negative tax consequences, even if an investor chooses to roll over into a new UIT with the same strategy.
