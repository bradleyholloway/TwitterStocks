 FHA Mortgage Isn't Headache It Used to Be   By By Michael Days, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1985  The image has lingered, but the reality has changed. For first-time homebuyers who are short on savings but have plenty of income, and for others looking for ways to finance investment property, fixed-rate mortgages insured by the FHA are becoming increasingly attractive.  That's partly because private lenders are becoming more stingy about accepting small down payments. But it's also that over the past year or so, the FHA has cleared up some of the administrative hassles associated with its loans. And while some home sellers still balk at accepting buyers with FHA-insured mortgages, other recent FHA changes have made sellers less resistant.  The attraction of the FHA mortgage is obvious: Instead of the traditional 15% or 20% down payment, FHA-insured loans often cover more than 95% of the entire cost of acquiring the property, including closing costs. So borrowers often need only put up a few hundred dollars. And the rate is usually a bit lower than on conventional loans.
