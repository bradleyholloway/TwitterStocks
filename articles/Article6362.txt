 Protecting Shareholders Is No 'Shenanigan'   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2004  The Dollar General case resulted in a $172.5 million recovery for the class, plus corporate governance changes to boot. TRSL recently recovered $300 million for Bristol-Myers's shareholders. In a suit against the directors of Siebel Systems, Inc. challenging the issuance to directors and executives of millions of dollars worth of stock options in violation of the company's stock option plan, TRSL was able to achieve not only a cancellation of the options (worth $56 million), but also significant corporate governance changes including a restructuring of the company's compensation practices and the addition of an outside director. In the HealthSouth case, TRSL challenged the continued service on the HealthSouth board of directors who served while company management allegedly engaged in a massive fraud. Over bitter opposition from the company, we prevailed and achieved an unprecedented result -- the removal of those directors and their replacement with directors chosen with the participation of HealthSouth's institutional shareholders.  Your chastisement of TRSL's director, Bonita Brown, an outstanding public servant, for failing to contact Regal before instituting suit demonstrates how little you understand about the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such contact would not have altered in the least the course of action Regal's directors had chosen. Moreover, your assertions about Ms. Brown's deposition are inaccurate. Ms. Brown, director of an $11 billion pension fund, demonstrated more knowledge of the facts than Regal's own directors, who approved the dividend.  We're disturbed about your criticism of the investments and litigation of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) and State Employees' Retirement System (SERS). We are especially concerned that you suggested our trustees breached their fiduciary duty to our members.
