 Pechiney Suggests It Will Seek A White Knight to Fight Alcan   By Carreyrou, John, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2003  One company, Norsk Hydro, appeared to give a boost to Alcan's bid, saying it would be interested in buying Alcan's half of the big German rolling mill, AluNorf, if Alcan is forced by the European Commission to put it up for sale. (Alcan sought to acquire Pechiney four years ago, but was thwarted by European antitrust concerns.)  After meeting on Tuesday evening, Pechiney's board issued a statement saying the 41 euro a share offered by Alcan was "clearly inadequate." The Pechiney board also called the offer "highly uncertain" for antitrust reasons. The person close to Pechiney said the Pechiney camp feels the company is worth "at the very least 50 euros to 55 euros per share."  When Alcan and Pechiney first attempted to merge in late 1999 as part of a three-way deal with Switzerland's Algroup, their agreement valued Pechiney at 58 euros a share. But Pechiney's stock price dropped by nearly half in the past three years.
