 Politics & Economics: Congress's Fall Agenda Takes Shape; Seeking Party Unity Before Elections, Republicans Shelve Domestic Policy for Security Issues   By Rogers, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2006  The backroom talks capture the uncertain mood in the Capitol as lawmakers return -- the Senate today and the House tomorrow afternoon -- for an abbreviated pre-election session. "Everybody's tentative; it's a tentative time," says Rep. Deborah Pryce (R., Ohio), who heads up the party conference and finds herself in an unusual battle for re- election.  "It reminds me of Wimpy," says a Democratic leadership aide, referring to the rotund and mustached freeloader in old "Popeye" cartoons. "'I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,' Wimpy would say. Republicans are asking voters to re-elect them now and they will do their work later."  A second "hostage" has been a proposed $2.10-an-hour increase in the federal minimum wage -- which has been $5.15 for the past nine years. Many Republican leaders prefer to avoid the issue, but Rep. Pryce herself says "it's a matter of fairness" and the real question is to find a sweetener for small-business employers who would be most affected.
