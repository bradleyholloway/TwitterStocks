 Symantec Virus-Scanning Patent Could Fend Off Software Rivals   By Richmond, Riva, The Wall Street Journal,  May 4, 2005  Symantec Chief Executive John Thompson has said Microsoft's slow pace of product development shows effective virus protection is a difficult undertaking. At a conference in February, he said Symantec is ready to "fight Microsoft in the marketplace."  The patent covers a method for quickly detecting viruses hidden in complex computer files and pushing out updates to Symantec's security software without having to do time-consuming product testing. Symantec says the technology is "fundamental" to all of its products.  "Without this type of technology, we'd literally have to scan every byte of all the major sections of the file, which would be very slow," says Carey Nachenberg, chief architect at Symantec Research Labs and the inventor of the technology. "I can't imagine solving this problem any other way."
