 Leading the News: GAO Surrenders List of Detainees Received From INS   By By Marjorie Valbrun and Gary Fields, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 2002  Sen. Russ Feingold (D., Wis.) and Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.) had made repeated requests to the GAO to hand over the list, which the GAO last week obtained at their behest from the INS, an arm of the Justice Department. An INS spokesman said he knew nothing about the unauthorized release of the list or yesterday's events. A GAO spokesman declined to comment.  The INS, already under fire for a host of embarrassing and controversial missteps, was further rebuked by Mr. Conyers. "The INS's refusal to trust the people's representatives in Congress with such basic information on the detainees is an affront to democracy and due process," he said. "By keeping their identities secret, the [Bush] administration is continuing to avoid oversight of the unconstitutional tactics it has resorted to in its post-9/11 dragnet."  A House Democratic aide said Anthony Gamboa, the GAO's general counsel, refused yesterday to confirm whether the GAO had the list and he said that if it did, the document would be considered "workpaper." Under GAO guidelines, workpaper can be reviewed under certain circumstances by lawmakers who requested the data. "It's kind of unusual for someone who is in what is essentially an attorney-client relationship with Congress to invoke a privilege to not release something to Congress," the aide said.
