 A Firm's Culture Can Get Lost in Translation   By Dvorak, Phred, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 3, 2006  Toronto -- THREE TIMES a week, staffers at the Canadian unit of Japanese videogame maker Koei Co. begin the day by standing next to their desks and facing their boss, Hidenori Taniguchi. "Good morning, everyone," says Mr. Taniguchi. "Good morning," chant Koei Canada's 30- odd employees.  Koei Canada staffers say Japan has been good about ceding creative control. Koei Canada's first product -- a futuristic racing game called "Fatal Inertia" -- was conceived entirely in Toronto. Unlike typical Koei offerings, which feature multitudes of characters, the stars of "Fatal Inertia" are the race's hovercraft. The Canadians persuaded top executives to include realistic smoke and sparks when vehicles crash, rather than the lights and fireballs used in most Koei games.  Still, Koei co-founder and chief adviser Yoichi Erikawa says he is taking hints from IBM Japan, and won't push all of Koei's practices on the Canadian unit. Koei Canada's staffers won't be pressured to match the long hours of Japanese programmers, says Mr. Erikawa, who visits Toronto every other month. Nor do the gym-loving Canadians need the daily exercise routines imposed on employees in Japan.
