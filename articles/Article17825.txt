 Panel Votes Bill To Sharply Boost Minimum Wage   By By Albert R. Karr, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1988  A House subcommittee voted to boost the federal minimum wage to $4.65 an hour over the next three years.  The measure was approved, 6-3, by the House Labor Standards Subcommittee after the panel rejected, 7-2, a provision that would have tied the minimum wage after the first three years to the average wage paid nationally to manufacturing workers.  The Senate Labor Committee is expected late this month or in April to take up its version of the minimum wage bill, which includes indexing the minimum to the average manufacturing wage. The Reagan administration has opposed the measure, arguing for certain changes, among them deletion of the indexing plan.
