 Leading the Charge to Transform A Sport Steeped in Tradition   By Cho, Cynthia H, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 2004  Mr. France: They succeed all the time, and they succeed because they have the right platform for the goals and objectives they're trying to reach, whether that's Home Depot, Coca-Cola, you name the company. They all have a very different view on how they want to participate with Nascar -- some do it better than others, of course. But the ones that do it well, they get a lot of value and benefit, and that's how it should work.  Mr. France: All the time, it's an ongoing issue that we all work through. And you just try to make sure that the paths are very clear as to what rights are granted and which rights are not. In the end, you try to give people what they bought and the tools they need to be successful. If you're in the sport, even if you're at a small level or at a very large level, we'd like for you to have a good experience, and we'd like the program to work because that's good for the sport.  Mr. France: We have done a lot. And we have a lot more work to do. One of the things that we think has the most promise is the "Drive for Diversity" program. There are smaller, regional divisions that Nascar has. We are fielding racing teams for people who would not have had the opportunity to showcase their talents. That's the biggest we're doing. "Drive for Diversity" puts people behind the wheel that would never have had the opportunity. Nascar sponsors individual teams who have a person of color, somebody who would not have the opportunity otherwise. And then they're noticed by bigger teams -- it's like minor-league baseball.
