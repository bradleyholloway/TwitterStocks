 Fast Retailing Designs Aggressive Expansion; Japanese Clothier to Open Flagship Manhattan Store, Weighs a Giordano Tie-Up   By Chozick, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 2006  Analysts say Fast's strategy is risky but could reap profits. Masafumi Shoda, a Tokyo-based retail analyst with Nomura Securities, says Fast's share price, which rose 0.9% Friday to close at 9,620 yen ($84.08), might fall in the short term. But he rates the company a "buy" and believes its aggressive tactics will help in the medium term. "Fast Retailing is in a very important transition period right now," he says.  Overseas expansion hasn't been a big success. Two Uniqlo stores that were opened in Beijing last September closed six months later. In 2001, Fast opened 21 Uniqlo stores in the U.K., but only eight remain. On the other hand, Fast's Uniqlo store in Hong Kong turned profitable just three months after it opened in September.  The Japanese retailer has said it plans to spend about 300 billion to 400 billion yen in coming years to gain other brands. Last month, Fast launched a tender offer for control of Cabin Co. of Japan, a women's apparel retail affiliate that is ailing. It already has stakes in higher-end women's brands, such as Theory and the French brand Comptoir des Cotonniers. In February, Fast will open the first Comptoir des Cotonniers store in Tokyo's chic Ginza district.
