 Catalyst Energy's Price Is Unnerving Holders As It Languishes Well Below Buy-Out Terms   By By Kevin G. Salwen, The Wall Street Journal,  May 3, 1988  In January, Karibu Corp., which is led by Catalyst's senior management, agreed to pay $11.75 a share. But Catalyst stock has sold at a pretty steep discount since, and closed yesterday at $9.125 a share, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Short-sellers are swarming around Catalyst, offering a host of reasons the buy-out won't succeed. That's a bit scary, even to a relatively impartial analyst. Richard Sweetnam, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., New York, contends, "If the deal falls through, the stock probably instantly opens down 3 points."  The bearish case is enough to have driven some holders from the issue. IDS Financial Corp., which held more than 100,000 Catalyst shares late last year, sold what was left of its stake shortly after the buy-out was announced. "They did some very interesting things at Catalyst," recalls Bernhard Fleming, who follows the company for IDS. "The magic just sort of disappeared."
