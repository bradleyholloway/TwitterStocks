 PNC Financial Unit to Merge With a Thrift --- First Federal Pittsburgh, A Mutual Institution, Set For Unusual Acquisition   By By James S. Hirsch, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1989  Seeking to expand its retailing operations, Pittsburgh National Bank, a unit of PNC Financial Corp., agreed to merge with First Federal of Pittsburgh.  First Federal approached PNC Financial several months ago after Congress passed the thrift bailout bill last summer. Among other things, the bill creates higher capital requirements for thrifts and makes it easier for banks to acquire them.  The proposed merger comes on the heels of the announcement last week that PNC's chief rival, Mellon Bank Corp., has agreed to acquire 54 branch offices in the Philadelphia area from Meritor Savings Bank for about $335 million. And some banking analysts predict that the bailout bill will encourage further marriages between deposit-hungry banks and capital-short thrifts.
