 Sotheby's, Christies' Are Being Sued By Overseas Buyers   By By Ken Bensinger, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 7, 2000  Steven Reiss, a lawyer for Sotheby's, said he believes the case will be dismissed. "The U.S. isn't a proper jurisdiction for these claims," he said. Attorneys and a spokeswoman for Christie's declined to comment. But some legal observers said the alleged wrongdoing would have had a global impact and therefore the case may be applicable to U.S. courts.
