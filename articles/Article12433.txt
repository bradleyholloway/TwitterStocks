 Serbs' Ferocity Came as Shock, Refugees Recall   By By James M. Dorsey Special to the Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1999  ULCINJ, Montenegro -- Ljuljeta Salja Lugajio's family was sitting down to a late lunch on the eve of the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday when 10 heavily armed Serbs burst into their home in Kosovo. "They came unexpectedly," the Kosovo refugee says listlessly, describing the March 27 events from the safety of a rented house in neighboring Montenegro. "They didn't knock, they broke down the door."  Mrs. Salja Lugajio's story is but one of countless tales of violence being told by the more than 460,000 Kosovar refugees who have poured into Albania, Montenegro and Macedonia since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization two weeks ago began bombing Yugoslavia over the Serbian-run country's refusal to sign a treaty to bring peace to Kosovo. The bombing unleashed a massive wave of terror by Serbs against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. Dozens of refugees in both Macedonia and Montenegro interviewed in recent days draw a picture of Serbian forces using extreme brutality-including mass murder, beatings, extortion and looting-to empty Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian population.  The latest troubles aren't the first in Mrs. Salja Lugajio's town. Ljodja is a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, which has been fighting Serb security forces for the past year and advocates independence for Kosovo. Much of the town of 8,000 was burned down by Serbs last autumn because of its support for the KLA. The Serbs who broke into Mrs. Salja Lugajio's home had been seeking her husband because his brother is a KLA member, she says. "The Serbs were going from house to house demanding money and gold. They didn't ask us for anything," she says, a friend holding her hand. "They had my husband marked as an enemy."
