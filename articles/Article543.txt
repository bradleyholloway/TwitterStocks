SANTA FE, N.M., June 23â€” Princess Anne, asked how she felt being an aunt with the birth of a son to her brother, Prince Charles, and the Princess of Wales, told reporters, ''That's my business!''  Princess Anne made the same comment twice when visiting American Indian villages Tuesday 70 miles north of here during her visit to the Western United States.  Wrapped in a bright red Indian shawl, the Princess earned the applause of villagers when she shuffled her feet to the sound of drums in an old Indian warrior dance.
