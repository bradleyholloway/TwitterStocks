 MarketWatch: That Old Ticket Sold for How Much?   By Hoak, Amy, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2007  "Some people will ask me to do an appraisal in advance of purchasing an item," she says, a safeguard that may be cost effective on some of the more significant pieces of sports memorabilia. "Some people will consult with us before they sell an item," and will also ask for help in finding the right market in which to sell the piece, she adds.  "One of the most important things to learn about an item is the history . . . how did a person obtain it," Ms. [Margaret Olsen] says. "There's a tremendous amount of fraud that exists," she says, and the fewer intermediate stops an item has, the more certain one can be that it's authentic.  Sometimes an item has an "added characteristic of value," Ms. Olsen points out, such as the 1986 Super Bowl ring of former Chicago Bears player William "The Refrigerator" Perry. That Perry's size-23 ring is the largest in Super Bowl history gives it a touch of added value, should it ever be up for sale, she says.
