 A Hometown Boy Dates Chelsea; Are Property Values Rising Yet?   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1998  In many small towns, a local boy made good is a source of pride.

The 20-year-old religious-studies major at Stanford later described himself to the San Jose Mercury News as the younger Ms. Clinton's boyfriend.

The Woodlands sensed a marketing opportunity.
