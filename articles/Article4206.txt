 Bond Prices Hardly Budge as Investors Wait for Clues on Fed Policy, Economy   By By Tom Herman and Edward P. Foldessy, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 1986  Investors continued to mark time amid confusion about the outlook for the economy and the Federal Reserve System's credit policy. Some analysts say the Fed already may be easing credit conditions slightly in an attempt to rejuvenate the economy. Others, though, contend the economy will pick up steam soon, that the Fed hasn't changed policy and that it probably won't at least until after next month's elections.  Government economic reports to be released over the next week or so are likely to paint a mixed picture of the economy and inflation. Today, the government is scheduled to release its producer price index for September. The median estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Money Market Services Inc. calls for an increase of 0.3%, the same as in August. But individual estimates vary widely, from a decline of 0.4% to an increase of 0.6%.  Investors paid little attention to money supply figures released by the Fed yesterday afternoon. The Fed estimated that the basic money supply, known as M1, declined $1.4 billion in the week ended Sept. 29. That was in line with what most analysts had expected, but it still left M1 far above the Fed's target of 3% to 8% growth this year.
