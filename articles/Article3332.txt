 Blue Chips Decline As Crude-Oil Prices Match Recent High   By Browning, E S, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2004  Talk that high prices for oil and other commodities could hold back world growth caused declines in industrial metals such as copper, nickel, lead, zinc, tin and aluminum, but not in oil. Prices of crude- oil futures jumped $1.13, or 2.15%, to $53.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, matching Monday's 21-year closing high. Oil- supply worries persist ahead of the winter heating season.  Computer-chip stocks rose, however, following Intel's report of lower-than-expected quarterly inventories and higher-than-expected sales. Resilient chip stocks helped cushion the decline of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which fell 0.24%, or 4.64 points, to 1920.53, off 4.1% this year.
