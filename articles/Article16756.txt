 After the Revolt, Creating a New CEO; A trio of new leaders is quietly redefining the top job; A lower profile, a shorter leash   By Murray, Alan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 2007  Ms. [Carly Fiorina], once hailed as the most powerful woman in business, faced a fractious board at Hewlett-Packard, which lost faith in her management style and what directors saw as her arrogant disregard for their opinions. Mr. Greenberg's hand-picked board of directors turned against him only after AIG's accountant refused to sign the company's securities filings so long as he remained at the top. Mr. [Harry Stonecipher] ran afoul of his own ethics campaign at Boeing, by having an affair with an executive there and showing stunningly poor judgment by sending explicit emails to her during work hours. Other executives before him had done much the same, with minimal consequences. But in an emotional board meeting, directors asked Boeing's ethics officer Bonnie Soodik this question: "How can you administer an ethics program for 160,000 employees if it's perceived that your CEO is above the rules?" Shaking, and with tears welling in her eyes, Ms. Soodik responded: "I can't."  Asked whether he had changed the company's strategy, Mr. [Mark Hurd] responds: "Well, we have one." He says strategy at HP "had become too high-level. The important thing for us is to be able to take strategy down to where you can seamlessly move from strategy to operations." If the strategy isn't clearly driving operations, he says, "my argument is that you don't have a strategy."  Asked whether he had changed AIG's strategy, Mr. [Martin Sullivan] answers: "In many respects, not really." Says Mr. [Jim McNerney]: "The strategy hasn't changed at all. But the devil is in the details." He says, for instance, he gets weekly briefings on progress of the company's new 787. "I'm probably a lot more deeply involved than my predecessors were on those things."
