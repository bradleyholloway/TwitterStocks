 Restaurants: No Tips, Please -- Just Pay the Service Fee   By By Bob Ortega, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1998  This summer, Chateaulin notified customers that instead of tipping their waiters, they would be assessed a flat 15% service charge. The restaurant owners' intentions were honorable, they say -- equalizing the pay of the kitchen staff and the waiters, whose tips resulted in disproportionately higher earnings. But like a growing number of restaurants in Boston, Chicago, New York and Boca Raton, Fla., Chateaulin had another reason for abolishing tips in favor of a service charge: the Internal Revenue Service.  In the past three years, the IRS has been cracking down on unreported tip income. First, the agency told restaurants that if their waiters reported tip income of less than 8% of gross receipts, alarm bells would ring in IRS offices. Now, the IRS is trying a new tactic: It has notified restaurant owners that they may be liable for a share of back taxes on unreported income unless they participate in an IRS program that requires them to track their employees' tips.  Though common in Europe, Asia and Latin America, service charges in U.S. restaurants have been as rare as steak tartare, except for parties of six, eight or more. And that is the way many waiters and customers have wanted it. Kermeen Fristrom, a retired English teacher, recently enjoyed an exquisite dinner with friendly and attentive service at Monet, another Ashland restaurant that recently added a fixed service fee. Mr. Fristrom says he would have left a tip of more than 15%, but the service charge dissuaded him from leaving anything on top of that. "I prefer a choice," he says.
