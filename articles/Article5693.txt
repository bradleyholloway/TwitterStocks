 Managing Editor Of Seattle Times Blasts Hearst   By By Rachel Zimmerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 10, 1999  In public, executives of the Blethen-family-owned Seattle Times and the Hearst-owned Seattle Post-Intelligencer have been offering heroic proclamations for the past week, talking up a new business arrangement filed with the U.S. Justice Department.  As a result of that arrangement -- a renegotiated Joint Operating Agreement -- the Times will begin publishing in the morning and competing with the P-I head on. In exchange, the P-I will get a 40% cut of profits -- up from 32% -- and, even if the P-I shuts down, a guaranteed 32% of profits until 2083.
