 MANSION --- Race to the Top (Price) at a Tony Address --- Exuberant pricing soars higher at an exclusive Manhattan building but volume has slowed; a new wave of 'It' condos   By Jackson, Candace, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 2012  Rick Kelly, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, says some of the pricing there today is tied to an "irrational exuberance" over the past few months about the building and the high-end market in general, with roughly $4,500 to $7,000 per square foot a more realistic price for units on lower floors without park views and no outdoor space, and $8,000 to $10,000 per square foot for apartments on higher floors with park views. According to public records, the apartment is owned Neil Witriol, the retired president of a company that makes steam baths and showers.
