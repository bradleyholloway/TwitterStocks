 Politics & Economics: An About-Face on '527' Groups; Republican Conservatives Now Lead Effort to Defeat House Bill Limiting Donations   By Cummings, Jeanne, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 3, 2006  In the 2006 campaign so far, it is right-leaning 527s that are most active. The Club for Growth, a conservative economic-issue group, is leading the charge to kill the Republican bill that would shut down 527s. The Club for Growth received $8 million in donations during the 2004 cycle; for this cycle, its donations as of May tally $5.1 million. "I don't know how they would expect organizations to sit on the sideline and cheer when they are talking about taking a wrecking ball to the First Amendment," says David Keating, the club's executive director.  The fracas stems from the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law, which banned unlimited "soft-money" donations to political parties from companies, labor unions and wealthy individuals. But many of those donors didn't rein in their spending in the campaign cycle that followed. Instead, they found a new outlet in 527 advocacy groups, which could take unlimited funds from donors, though they ostensibly couldn't explicitly say who to vote for and couldn't coordinate their efforts with the parties.  Mr. [George Soros], for instance, has given about $1 million to one 527 group, America Votes, a voter-turnout operation. Most of his other donations this cycle are to traditional party committees and candidates. "George fundamentally believes the effort to elect Democrats has to be united under the banner of the Democratic Party," said Michael Vachon, Mr. Soros's spokesman. "There wasn't sufficient time in 2004 to do that."
