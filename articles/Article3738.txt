 Earnings Digest -- Retail: Sears Narrows Earnings Estimate   By Covert, James, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 2007  Last month, Sears said it expected earnings of $160 million to $200 million, or between $1.06 and $1.32 a share, "assuming current sales patterns persist." At the time, analysts had expected Sears to report second-quarter earnings, excluding items, of $2.12 a share, the average estimate from Thomson Financial. The latest quarter's estimate includes gains totaling six cents a share.  In the 13 weeks ended Aug. 4, Kmart sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.8%, with declines in most categories. Sears's domestic same-store sales fell 4.3%, with declines in most categories offset partly by increases in consumer electronics, women's apparel and footwear.
