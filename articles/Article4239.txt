 Mortgage Rates Rose Last Week Slightly to 9.37%   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 9, 1987  Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 9.37% interest rate on 30-year conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. This was marginally up from the 9.30% rate for the week ended Dec. 26 but substantially lower than the 10.8% rate a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.  Michael Lea, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said the interest-rate spread between yields on the primary and secondary mortgage markets has been shrinking lately and that the relationship flip-flopped last week. The secondary market refers to the purchase and sale of existing mortgages, mostly by government agencies. Freddie Mac, for example, buys mortgages from lenders, packages them into securities and sells them to investors.
