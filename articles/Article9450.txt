 Leading the News: Intel Cuts Forecast For Its Revenue And Profit Margin   By By Don Clark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2002  "It's no longer Intel or the PC that is the bellwether for the semiconductor industry," argued Brian Halla, National's chief executive officer. "Intel is really kind of in a niche at this point."  Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said the average selling prices of the company's chips "took a hit," contributing to the margin shortfall. In the first quarter, prices for its low-end chips were strong because Intel couldn't meet customer demand; in the second quarter, average prices fell as Intel caught up with demand for inexpensive chips, he said.  Besides results from operations, Intel said it expects to take a $230 million expense from acquisition-related amortization in the second quarter, compared with a previous projection of $115 million. The change is primarily due to a write-off associated with a line networking circuit boards acquired when Intel bought Xircom Inc. last year.
