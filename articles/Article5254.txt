 Newell Amends Filing to Reduce Size Of Stanley Bid; Target Stock Falls $1.375   By By Carlee R. Scott, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1991  Newell Co., in an amended filing, sharply reduced the size of the Stanley Works stake that it is seeking regulatory permission to acquire.  "Given the friendly nature" of discussions it has held with Stanley in recent years, Newell said yesterday, amending its Hart-Scott-Rodino filing "seemed appropriate." It didn't elaborate.  Newell last month asked the Justice Department for permission to acquire 15% to 25% of Stanley's stock outstanding, with an indicated maximum value of about $400 million. Stanley made the filing known last week, when it filed a suit challenging Newell's possible acquisition bid. Yesterday's amended filing sought clearance to purchase in excess of $15 million of stock.
