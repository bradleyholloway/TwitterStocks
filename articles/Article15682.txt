 Patriot American Posts 62% Increase In 1st-Quarter Net   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1998  Patriot declined to discuss details of the legal settlement but said it would let the company complete its pending acquisition of Interstate Hotels Co., one of the largest owners and operators of Marriott hotels. Because there isn't any assurance that the companies will be able to reach a definitive settlement agreement, the trial, which was supposed to start yesterday in federal court for the District of Maryland, was delayed a week, the companies said. Patriot and Interstate said they postponed their rights to terminate their agreement to sell Interstate to Patriot if the transaction isn't closed by May 31 until June 7.
