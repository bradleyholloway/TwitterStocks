A new westbound train to serve the East End of Long Island on Sunday and holiday evenings is on the Long Island Rail Road's summer schedule, which went into effect this morning and will remain until October.  The usual two extra summer trains from Montauk on Sundays and holidays will leave at 7:06 and 8:06 P.M. and are scheduled to put passengers in Pennsylvania Station at 10:14 and 11:10 P.M., after a change in Jamaica, Queens. The new train, called the ''Cannonball,'' will make fewer stops after the Hamptons and is scheduled to put passengers in Pennsylvania Station at 9:14 P.M. It is to leave Montauk at 6:30, East Hampton at 6:54, Bridgehampton at 7:03, Southampton at 7:11 and Westhampton at 7:30 P.M., and should cut the Montauk-Jamaica time to 2 hours and 20 minutes.
