 Asea Brown's Profit Surged In Nine Months --- Robust Sales in Asia, Cuts Elsewhere Helped Rise To $444 Million in Period   By By Margaret Studer, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 1994  ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. said net income more than doubled in the first nine months to $444 million, boosted by buoyant sales in Asian markets and cost-cutting in Europe and the U.S.  "We are on target with performance improving all the time," ABB Chief Executive Officer Percy Barnevik said after the announcement. Mr. Barnevik noted the "first signs of an upswing" in demand in Continental Europe, continued "strong" sales in Asia and a "satisfactory" outlook in North America.  Mr. Barnevik suggested that the fourth quarter and 1995 would benefit from an increasing improvement in demand from the West European chemical, steel, pulp and paper industries. And this year and next, he said, results shouldn't be burdened by the massive restructuring costs that depressed performance in 1993.
