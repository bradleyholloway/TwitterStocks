 Reagan Scraps Proposal to Sell Missiles to Saudis --- President's Aides Resigned To Certainty Congress Would Defeat Arms Sale   By By Tim Carrington and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1987  In what one Pentagon official called "facing realities," the Reagan administration withdrew its proposal to sell $360 million of Maverick missiles to Saudi Arabia.  During the past few days, administration officials have become resigned to the certainty that Congress would kill the proposed arms sale. In the Senate, Sens. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) and Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) organized 67 senators to oppose the sale -- enough to override a presidential veto.  But the withdrawal still came as a surprise. According to a Senate aide, a State Department official arrived at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with a letter announcing the withdrawal one minute before the panel was scheduled to begin considering a resolution to block the sale.
