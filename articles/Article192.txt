RICHMOND, Aug. 16â€” The James River Corporation said it would restructure its operations, including the sale or shutdown of $1.3 billion in operations that have not been profitable. The company said the move would increase the resources available for expansion and ''allow the company to simplify its structure so that it can concentrate on global growth opportunities.''  The restructuring, to be completed within a year, is expected to bring charges of $150 million to James River's first-quarter earnings. The operations to be divested or closed include business-papers units in Berlin and Groveton, N.H., and in Wiggins, Miss.; coated printed-papers operations in West Linn, Ore., and towel and tissue operations in South Glens Falls, N.Y., and Ashland, Wis. James River plans to use the proceeds to reduce debt and repurchase stock.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
