 Boeing May Enter A Modified 777 In Tanker Battle   By Andy Pasztor and J. Lynn Lunsford, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2005  U.S. Rep. Ken Calvert, a California Republican who is chairman of a subcommittee on aeronautics and serves on the Armed Services Committee, is among those pushing the 777. The military and Congress "probably will go to a new tanker design" based on the 777, because "it gives us a lot more flexibility," Rep. Calvert said in an interview. "I don't think we want to buy a plane" like the 767, he added, "because it's on the way out" of production.
