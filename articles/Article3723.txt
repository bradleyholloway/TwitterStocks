 Hot Topic: Chinese Fake Out   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2007  All of which has politicians calling for new trade restrictions. In response to concerns about fish safety, the Food and Drug Administration recently required testing of all fish imports from China, a regulatory burden so onerous it amounts to a ban. Senator Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) -- of 27.5% punitive tariff fame -- has called for creation of an "import czar" to "focus on the rising tide of Chinese goods coming in to the U.S." Other Members of Congress are taking the opportunity to refight the 2000 battle over China's World Trade Organization accession.  Importers are also becoming vulnerable on store shelves. Consultants who work with U.S. companies sourcing in China predict a flight to quality as safety fears mount. Brand protection will become more important than ever. Witness Colgate's extensive efforts to warn consumers about tainted toothpaste bearing counterfeit Colgate labels. Brand protection is a bigger concern for smaller companies than for huge multinationals like Tylenol and Pepsi that have weathered safety scares in the past. Smaller companies may get only one chance with consumers.  The least productive response is U.S. protectionism, which will lead to higher prices and less competition. Other countries will respond by also using quality as an excuse for trade barriers, the way they already have against U.S. beef after a rare case of "mad cow" disease. The best education for crooked Chinese capitalists is likely to be the harsh judgment of American business partners and consumers.
