 One Thing Is Clear: Transparency Is Big In Handbags Today; See-Through Plastic Has Appeal to Assertive Souls; Tacky to Letitia Baldrige   By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2007  The man, who did not have X-ray vision, was able to see through the 21-year-old's Chanel tote bag because it was made of clear plastic. "It's so cheesy," says Ms. [Sarah Fister], a senior at Oregon State University. "Guys are always like, 'Oh, I can see right through your bag.'"  Ms. Hoffman recalls shopping at a department store while carrying her clear bag. "My cellphone was on silent mode and it started ringing so the light was blinking," says Ms. Hoffman, an executive at a court- reporting firm in San Antonio. "This woman came up to me and said, 'I think there's something going on with your phone.' I was like, 'OK, you're being very nosy!'"  Indeed, etiquette expert Letitia Baldrige calls the entire concept "very tacky." "This is 'Show and Tell' in its most miserable form," says Ms. Baldrige, who was Jacqueline Kennedy's chief of staff in the White House. "Items that women carry simply are not meant to be seen by the public. It's just like showing off your underwear."
