To the Editor:  An ''At the Bar'' column (The Law, Jan. 20) discusses the case of Jack Solerwitz, lawyer for 800 of the striking air traffic controllers dismissed by President Reagan in 1981. Mr. Solerwitz was suspended for a year by a Federal court ''for clogging its calendar with appeals it deemed frivolous.'' You say I testified in his case that a lawyer should argue that the earth is flat if a client so demands. That is the contrary of what I said. My point was that lawyers are ethically forbidden to make arguments that are frivolous. I defined a frivolous argument, in part, as one that is contrary to commonly accepted facts that would be judicially recognized. Thus, I said, it would be frivolous and therefore unprofessional to argue to a court that the earth is flat.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
