 Odd Couple: A Political Neophyte And an Ex-Sandinista Run Nicaragua Today --- Chamorro Takes a Back Seat To Her In-Law, Lacayo, And a `New' Gen. Ortega --- Disputed Gifts of La Pinata   By By Jose de Cordoba, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1991  MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- One tense afternoon last year, after the Sandinista Front lost the presidential elections to Violeta Chamorro, representatives from her 14-party coalition met for hours in the manicured grounds of a school here to discuss the Ortega Problem. At issue was whether to remove Gen. Humberto Ortega, the younger brother of Sandinista Daniel Ortega, from command of the Sandinista Armed Forces.  At one end is Mr. Lacayo, 43 years old, a tall former Jesuit seminarian and businessman with no previous political experience. Mr. Lacayo has emerged as the government's "super minister" in charge of the actual workings of government while Mrs. Chamorro, a symbol of unity, reigns rather than rules. Mr. Lacayo's hand is evident everywhere, from negotiating debt relief to bargaining with college deans over budget cuts.  At the other end of the axis is Gen. Ortega, 44, a former Sandinista revolutionary who once said Managua didn't have enough lampposts from which to hang all the bourgeoisie. But he has changed his tune. Earlier this year, Gen. Ortega caused a sensation when he said he had heated disagreements with his brother Daniel and added, in an interview, that a revolutionary's job now is to back Mrs. Chamorro's government.
