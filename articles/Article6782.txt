 BP Trims Tally of Reserves 2.5%, But Deals, Discoveries Offset Cut   By Bhushan Bahree, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 12, 2004  Still, the change comes at a time when the energy industry is focusing on the reliability of oil companies' reserves. The revision is the largest such change since BP's 1998 merger with Amoco. The largest previous revisions in BP's oil reserves since the merger were a downgrade of 97 million barrels in 2001, and an upgrade of 112 million barrels in 2000. The largest such revisions in BP's gas reserves were the equivalent of an upgrade of 153.8 million barrels in 2002, and a downgrade of 125.2 million barrels in 2001.
