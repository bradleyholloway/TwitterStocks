 India Launches Massive Effort To Fight Polio   By By Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2003  The world is close to eradicating polio, which mainly affects children and can cause paralysis. But the latest figures show a significant rise in new cases last year in two countries, India and Nigeria. Of the 1,886 new cases reported last year, 1,556 occurred in India, and of those about 1,200 were in Uttar Pradesh, a poor northern state with 173 million people. Nigeria had 187 cases.  The new immunization round is expected to cost some $32 million, of which about half covers the cost of the vaccines and half is for the cost of delivering them to Indian children. Financial donors include the governments of India, Britain, the U.S., Germany, Japan, and organizations such as Rotary International and the World Bank. India hopes to launch six polio-immunization campaigns in 2003, including two national ones, at a total cost of $86 million, according to the WHO.
