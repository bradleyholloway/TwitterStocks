 BMC Software's Latest Deal Rocks Industry's Big Boats --- Purchase of Boole & Babbage Might Shatter Peace With IBM, Computer Associates   By By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 20, 1998  By making sure his company's software always fit with the grander designs of Computer Associates Inc. and International Business Machine Corp.'s Tivoli Systems Inc., BMC remained in a fast-growing and relatively safe niche of making software that helps other programs work faster or better.  Earlier this month, however, BMC agreed to buy rival Boole & Babbage Inc. for about $900 million in stock. The deal would catapult BMC to the third-largest supplier of software for managing computers and give it key software needed to move out of its niche.  If a clash does come, it won't be a David-and-Goliath battle. BMC has used its hugely profitable mainframe-software business to buy and build its way into new markets before. The 18-year-old company began life as a small, direct marketer of tools that optimize mainframe databases. Today, BMC claims gross-profit margins of 90% -- better than Microsoft Corp.
