 How Hot Investments Burn the Little Guy; Commodities Trades Can Rapidly Sour; Mr. Snell's Dice Roll   By Raghavan, Anita, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2007  Ms. [Meghan Bator] declined to comment. In an answer to the claim, she denied making any misrepresentations to Dr. [George Roffman]. Ms. Bator and Universal, in legal papers, said Dr. Roffman was advised of the risks of trading commodities, and in taped conversations was told of all charges to his account "to the penny" each time a new position was opened. "This claim must be seen for what it obviously is -- a frivolous and opportunistic attempt by the estate's attorney to milk Roffman's estate for a fee."  Mr. [Arnie Goldman] didn't return a call for comment. Regulators have barred Liberty Real Assets from trading in commodities; a number for the firm on the NFA Web site wasn't in service. In an answer to the claim in 2005, Mr. Goldman denied pitching heating oil as a "no-brainer." He said in the claim that he told Ms. [Jaca Collins] commodity options are "very risky investments" and disclosed all commissions.  The brokers said they weren't to blame, responding in a legal claim that Mr. [William Snell] "was an experienced, sophisticated and knowledgeable businessman" who had "represented that he had a net worth of over $1,000,000" and "had been trading commodities for over 20 years."
