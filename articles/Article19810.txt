 No Curtain Call for the Full Monti   By Carney, Brian M, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 4, 2004  In matters of substance as well as style, Mr. Monti broke new ground. The first merger Mr. Monti blocked, between British travel companies Airtours and First Choice, extended the notion of "collective dominance" from two actors to three. Under this dubious theory, mergers are prohibited if the commission determines that reducing the number of companies in a given market will increase the likelihood of anticompetitive behavior by the firms that remain.  Finally, Mr. Monti extended the commission's remit in non-merger cases as well, aggressively pursuing a case against Microsoft both during and after the Redmond, Wash., company's long legal fight back home in the U.S. Earlier this year, after an investigation that spanned nearly all of Mr. Monti's term in office, the commission decided against Microsoft and in favor of itself, levying an unprecedented $600 million fine and ordering changes to its core operating-system product.  Last but not least, Mr. Monti is on his way out. His term ends this month, and his replacement, a Dutchwoman by the name of Neelie Kroes who has come under attack in her confirmation hearings for her ties to business. Ms. Kroes had until recently been serving on a number of corporate boards, precisely the sort of experience likely to lend a counterweight to Prof. Monti's rather academic approach to analyzing merger cases. If Ms. Kroes can overcome the built-in antibusiness bias of the career bureaucrats that will be working for her the next five years, she stands a chance of making a considerable improvement on Mr. Monti's checkered record.
