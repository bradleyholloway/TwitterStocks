 Lam to Lay Off 700 Employees As Demand Drops   By By Ralph T. King Jr., The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 13, 1998  FREMONT, Calif. -- Lam Research Corp. said it will lay off about 700 employees, or 14% of its work force, and take a restructuring charge of as much as $85 million due to slumping demand for its semiconductor-manufacturing equipment.  "This action will allow us to align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, enabling us to fund research-anddevelopment programs critical to our longterm success," said James W. Bagley, Lam's chief executive officer.
