 Take Two -- Hollywood Rewrite: Viacom Outbids GE To Buy DreamWorks; As the Conglomerate Pores Over Details of Deal, Rival Schmoozes Mr. Spielberg; Mr. Redstone's Three Calls   By Merissa Marr and Kate Kelly in Los Angeles and Kathryn Kranhold in New York, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2005  It was the GE Way vs. the Hollywood Way, and the Hollywood Way got the deal done. Yesterday, Viacom announced plans to acquire closely held DreamWorks, the live-action film studio that made hits like "Saving Private Ryan" and "American Beauty," for $774 million, plus the assumption of about $840 million of net debt. The deal also will give Viacom the right to distribute movies from DreamWorks Animation SKG, a separate public company. To help pay for the deal, Viacom plans to recruit outside investors to contribute as much as $1 billion of the total $1.6 billion package.  Mr. [Bob Wright] flew to Los Angeles the following day for a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Geffen at his house in Beverly Hills, Calif. During the tense discussion that ensued, according to people familiar with it, Mr. Wright picked over the disappointing performance of some of DreamWorks's more recent films: "The Island"; "Just Like Heaven," a romantic comedy starring Reese Witherspoon; and "Dreamer," a family film about a young girl's rehabilitation of an injured horse. Those three movies together had created a loss of around $60 million for the studio, according to a person familiar with the results.  Back at the Universal camp, talks with DreamWorks were becoming bogged down in details such as tax issues and the accounting of the distribution deal between DreamWorks and its sister company DreamWorks Animation. As an additional complication, DreamWorks Animation is currently the subject of an informal Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry over the release of its "Shrek 2" DVD.
