 Year-End Review of Markets and Finance --- The Bond Market: Safety Spurs Scramble for Government Debt   By By Tom Herman Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Jouranl, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 1989  Short-term Treasury bills and notes are especially popular now that they offer about the same or even higher yields than long-term government bonds. Since you can earn 9% on one-year Treasury bills and 9.14% on two-year notes, many investment managers say, why take a risk on stocks or long-term bonds?  Tax-free municipal bonds, which provided sparkling returns last year, also are selling briskly among safety-conscious investors. Many forecasters expect tax-free bonds to look even more attractive this year, partly because of speculation that Congress will raise taxes.  But junk bonds turned in even better results and continued to attract more investors. Junk bonds, the high-yield, high-risk issues with low credit ratings or no ratings at all, turned in the best performance in the fixed-income sector last year, according to Chet Ragavan, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Merrill Lynch index of junk bonds showed a total return of about 13%, up sharply from 4.67% in 1987. Total return includes both interest income and price changes.
