 Adelphia Woes Put Hockey Team On Thin Ice   By By Stefan Fatsis and Deborah Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2002  The Rigas family, not Adelphia, owns the Sabres and the six-year-old HSBC Arena in Buffalo. But Adelphia has bankrolled the team since John J. Rigas, former chairman and chief executive, began acquiring a stake in the franchise in 1995. The family completed full ownership in 2000. According to the people familiar with the team, the Sabres owe about $150 million to Adelphia, including $110 million in the form of unsecured loans. Adelphia also owns $36 million of a secured bank loan to the team.
