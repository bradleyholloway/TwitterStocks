 Business and Finance [4]  The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1989  DANNY WALL RESIGNED as the nation's chief thrift regulator, the first government casualty of the huge savings and loan scandal. Wall had been under fire recently, particularly for his reluctance to seize Lincoln S&L of California despite warnings from regional examiners that the thrift was operating recklessly.  LIN Broadcasting's board endorsed a sweetened bid from McCaw Cellular that analysts valued at $122 to $140 a share, or up to $6.85 billion. The bid, the largest ever in the cellular communications market, appears to end a long takeover battle.  Bush's nominee for an SEC seat is expected to be Philip Lochner, Time Warner's general counsel and a former colleague of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden. Lochner's selection, if confirmed, would bolster Breeden's control over the commission.
