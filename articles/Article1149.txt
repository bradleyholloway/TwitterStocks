 Revenue Raising in Bush Administration May Come Down to a Matter of Semantics   By By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 1989  White House budget director-designate Richard Darman said several revenue-raising measures might not really be tax increases, although the public perception of them might keep them off limits to the Bush administration.  Mr. Darman appeared to open a crack in the door to an increase in excise taxes by saying a boost in the federal gasoline tax under some circumstances might be considered a "user fee." In a written response to questions from a Senate committee, Mr. Darman also suggested increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco might fall under the same rubric.  Still, Mr. Darman invites the conclusion that Mr. Bush might accept some kind of tax increase. Mr. Bush "has stated that he would oppose all new taxes," Mr. Darman wrote to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. But he added, "That doesn't mean that all increases in government receipts are 'new taxes.'"
