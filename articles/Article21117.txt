 Conservative Think Tank Comes Back From Brink Of Financial Disaster, Leaning More to the Right   By By Edward Sussman, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 3, 1987  When the American Enterprise Institute was facing bankruptcy last year, the conservative think tank sold its little-known but influential Regulation magazine to a former Reagan administration official named Christopher DeMuth. Mr. DeMuth said he took over the publication just as a hobby.  A few months later, Mr. DeMuth agreed to take over AEI itself. Needless to say, he has given the magazine back to the institute. The publication has been doing better these past six months and the think tank seems to be following suit. Under Mr. DeMuth, AEI has been struggling to come back from near financial disaster and to refocus its public-policy agenda.  Credit for the institute's success belongs largely to William Baroody Sr., its president for 25 years. But the institute ran into hard times after Mr. Baroody died in 1980 and was succeeded by his son, William Jr. Some charged that as the institute took on more middle-of-the-road scholars, its conservative outlook suffered. The Olin Foundation, presided over by former Treasury Secretary William Simon, cut off funds to the institute. And the Reader's Digest Foundation stopped donations after discovering that an endowment of about $1 million it had established for AEI's long-term health had been depleted to cover operating expenses. By mid-1986, AEI was in severe debt.
