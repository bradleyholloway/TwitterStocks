 Wendy's Teams Up With Irish Baker In Joint Venture   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 9, 2001  Tim's parent, Wendy's International Inc., said it will join with Irish baker and agribusiness IAWS Group PLC in building a bakery in southwestern Ontario, primarily to make French baguettes for lunchtime sandwiches at Tim's but also eventually to produce other specialty breads for more than 2,000 Tim's in North America.  Wendy's and IAWS each will invest between $35 million to $37.5 million in the venture, which could produce between $5 million and $7 million in income for Wendy's by 2003, company executives said on a conference call.  Indeed, responding to an analyst's question on a possible breakfast business, Mr. [Jack Schuessler] said, "We have had discussions that down the road [IAWS] may help us look at a breakfast program." He also reiterated that Wendy's balance sheet "can adequately handle more types of things like this."
