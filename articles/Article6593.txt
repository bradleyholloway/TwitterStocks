 Disney Board Braces for Impact of New Independence Rules   By By Bruce Orwall, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2002  While the changes at Disney wouldn't force the three board members to step down, they would still have an impact, as they would diminish Mr. Gold's influence. People familiar with the matter say he has been pressing Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Eisner to improve the company's faltering performance and often has pushed for better governance practices. Mr. Gold is a business partner of Disney Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney, and they have grown increasingly worried about the plummeting value of Mr. Disney's 17.5 million-share Disney stake.  The changes hinge on how the recommended NYSE standards for director independence are interpreted. Disney's current standards already bar directors from being considered independent if they have immediate family members who work for the company. But Disney's definition of "immediate family member" didn't include independent adult children. An NYSE spokesman said the organization hasn't yet defined what constitutes an "immediate family member," but Disney expects it to include offspring of any age.  Friday's SEC filing reveals Mr. Gold's daughter, Jennifer Gold, in fiscal 2001 made $85,111 working for Disney's consumer-products unit. Mr. Watson's son, David Watson, made $152,608 at the Disney Channel. And Ms. Bowers's son, Craig Bowers, worked a portion of the year for Disney's Internet group, making $81,863. Mr. Bowers no longer works for Disney.
