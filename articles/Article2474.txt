 Deep Freeze: As Russia's Markets Swoon, the World Wonders What to Do --- The U.S. Is Wary of Providing More Money, but Fears Global Crisis Without It --- Painful Choices for Yeltsin   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mark Whitehouse and Andrew Higgins in Moscow and Bob Davis in Washington, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1998  Russia's stock, bond and currency markets all snapped amid investor fears that the government would default on its domestic debt, devalue the ruble or do both. Trading froze as banks and brokers refused each other's business. Annual yields on ruble-denominated bonds soared to more than 200% from 150% as even the hardiest investors shunned the risk. The stock market had to be closed for 35 minutes as prices crashed. It ended down 6.5% on little volume because stocks simply couldn't be traded. So far this year, it has lost more than 75% of its value.  Of course, the country's markets could snap back, as they have before, when Russia and the West have agreed upon combined action. Despite its current problems, the country has made considerable strides toward capitalism -- privatizing its state-run industries, inviting foreign investment, developing bond and stock markets and controlling hyperinflation. Investors had rewarded that progress by buying the country's securities. Just last year, in fact, Russia was the world's best-performing emerging market.  U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David Lipton met in Moscow with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to determine whether Russia has the political resolve to salvage itself. The U.S. administration, facing a skeptical Congress, is skittish about discussing new money if Russia doesn't show that it can take drastic measures. Indeed, the past few weeks, during which the IMF has poured in $4.8 billion, have shown U.S. officials that the money goes out nearly as quickly as it has come in.
