 The Gallery: An Outsider Comes In --- A Show at the Folk Art Museum Focuses on Henry Darger's Art Rather Than His Psychology   By By Tessa DeCarlo, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 2002  New York -- [Henry Darger]'S collage-paintings of hermaphroditic little girls battling evil soldiers have made him America's most highly regarded creator of outsider art, acclaimed by mainstream critics as well as outsider connoisseurs. Now an inaugural show of 26 of his pictures at the brand-new American Museum of Folk Art here asks whether the world is ready to take Darger seriously not only as an outsider, but as an artist.  Jane Kallir, whose Galerie St. Etienne in New York handles works by Darger, welcomes this approach. "Henry Darger is a great artist, and it has nothing to do with what he may have thought about little girls," she says. But in the outsider and self-taught art field, "no one has wanted to know that these artists work like any other artists. [Brooke Anderson] has done a superb job, but it remains to be seen whether people are going to get off the `dirty old man' fixation."  Dr. [John MacGregor], who helped the museum organize the Darger papers, contends that subtracting the sickness from Darger would leave merely pretty pictures of girls and flowers. "There's enormous interest in Darger, especially among young people, because he was extraordinarily weird," he says. "The danger is that people only remember that he's weird and forget just how good he is."
