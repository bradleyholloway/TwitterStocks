 Renewed Growth Seen for Argentina As Nation Recuperates From Recession   By Friedland, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 1996  "We're no longer in a downward spiral, but I don't expect a dramatic rebound," says economist Pedro Lacoste. Agrees Agostino Rocca, president of Organizacion Techint, a conglomerate: "The recovery will be slow and cautious."  Mr. Lacoste and other economists worry that the pickup in economic activity won't be enough to feed the kind of increase in tax revenues needed for Argentina to meet its commitments to the International Monetary Fund. Tax collections have fallen short of target for three out of the last four months. Fiscal performance "is what investors will be watching closely," says Bear Stearns & Co. managing director Tulio Vera.  "I think we've done a good job positioning ourselves for the recovery," says Mr. [Domingo Cavallo]. "Within the next few months, we'll know whether we have a new boom on our hands or whether we've been irresponsibly optimistic."
