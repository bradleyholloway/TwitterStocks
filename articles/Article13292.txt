 Cathay Seeks Control of Dragonair To Expand Access to China Routes   By Bruce Stanley and Laura Santini, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 2006  Cathay Pacific would purchase the controlling stake from two mainland Chinese companies -- China National Aviation Co., or CNAC, and conglomerate Citic Pacific Ltd. -- that together own 71.8% of Dragonair, these people said. It would also purchase a 7.7% stake held by Swire Pacific Ltd., part of the Swire Group, of London, and Cathay's largest shareholder. The moves would simplify the complex relationship between the companies. Cathay already owns a 17.8% stake in Dragonair.  Cathay Pacific, Dragonair and Air China declined to comment on the talks, as did a spokeswoman for Swire Pacific. Sara Sze, an official with CNAC, which has a 43.3% stake in Dragonair, said she didn't know of a transaction. Citic, which owns 28.5% of Dragonair and 25.4% of Cathay Pacific, didn't respond to requests for comment.  Cathay Pacific controlled Dragonair from 1991-96, when it scaled back its stake in the airline as part of a strategic rearrangement ahead of Britain's handover of political power in Hong Kong to China. Cathay and Dragonair have since become sometimes rancorous competitors on flights to Taiwan and other regional routes, and Cathay has had to make do in China with limited passenger service to Beijing and Xiamen and cargo service to Shanghai.
