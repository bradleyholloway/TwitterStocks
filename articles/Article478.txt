As part of a weekend festival of early music at the Symphony Space, Music for a While offered a program devoted to the verse and music of the 14th-century French composer Guillaume de Machaut on Sunday afternoon. The staged presentation, which purported to be an allegorical dramatization of Machaut's life, was entitled ''La Fontaine Amoureuse'' and featured as its final part ''Le Lai de la Fonteinne,'' the composer's tribute to the Virgin Mary.  One would hardly have thought that Machaut's music, which is as lively and immediate as if it were written yesterday, needed costumes and specious choreography in order to make an impression. But Music for a While went all the way with its sugar-coated production, including a processional from the rear of the hall at the start and every bell and whistle in the instrumental arsenal of ''medieval'' music.  In spite of that, the musical performance, as distinct from John Genke's serviceable narration, was lifeless. The singing of Peter Becker in the tenor and countertenor parts was tired - a surprising difference from the way he sounded three years ago in similar repertory - and that of Sheila Schonbrun was only fitfully expressive and stylistically wide of the mark.  In the instrumental numbers, particularly the rounds of the ''Lai de la Fonteinne,'' the playing was poorly tuned and frequently quite sloppy. Mr. Becker's cribbing of the text in the final concerted number reflected unfavorably on his preparation. Theodore W. Libbey Jr.
