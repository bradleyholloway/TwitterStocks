 The Fair City   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 21, 2001  The lunch was to mark the publication of a new book by CNBC host Chris Matthews, but it became an opportunity for Wall Streeters and other New Yorkers to reinforce their resolve and optimism. Mr. Matthews noted that uppity New York City has once again been fully accepted by the nation's heartland, its image now shaped less by elites who fill gossip pages than by the firefighters and police officers who risked their lives as well as by ordinary citizens who pitched in to help. As the song says, it's one helluva town.
