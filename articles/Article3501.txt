 Tyco Details Plan To Split in Three; Its Shares Tumble   By Jennifer Levitz and Charles Forelle, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2006  Timothy Ghriskey, of the Solaris Asset Management hedge fund in New York, said the forecast was "certainly a negative surprise . . . It does make you think that the restructuring is partially driven from weakness, a fundamental weakness, and that perhaps [Edward D. Breen] simply couldn't run this company well and that's why it's being split up." Mr. Ghriskey said Solaris is a Tyco shareholder.  Mr. Breen was forthright in saying the problems in health care were related to Tyco's "own internal issues," rather than the market's demand for the unit's products. He said the unit was hurt by regulatory issues, product recalls and a backlog in production, but he declined to give more financial information until the company releases its earnings in two weeks. He said he was "encouraged about where health care was heading."  Moody's Investors Service rates Tyco's debt at Baa3, one notch above junk status. Standard & Poor's rates it triple-B-plus, three notches above junk. S&P maintains Tyco on "Watch Negative," meaning it may downgrade its rating.
