 House Votes Curb On Asian Textiles; Veto Threatened   By By Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 11, 1985  The House, signaling strong discontent with the Reagan administration's trade policies, approved by a large margin a bill that would cut back textile and apparel imports from many Asian countries.  But opponents of the textile legislation were cheered by the 262-159 vote because it indicated that the measure doesn't have the support of two-thirds of the 435 House members. A two-thirds vote would be necessary to override a presidential veto, which has been threatened.  The vote was a significant test of the recent surge of protectionist sentiment in the House. Proponents said they wished to "send a message" to the White House and the rest of the world about their growing concern over the widening U.S. trade deficit.
