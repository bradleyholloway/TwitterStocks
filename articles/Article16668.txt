 PURSUITS; Entertainment & Culture -- Morgenstern on Movies: The Surprise Artist; How Johnny Depp keeps defying expectations   By Morgenstern, Joe, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2006  Everyone who has seen "Pirates" can readily recall Jack Sparrow's quirks -- the slyness, the blitheness, the woozy feyness that slides in and out of genial gayness. Even those who haven't seen the film seem to be aware that the model for this unlikely hero was Keith Richards, although an earlier stage in the character's evolution may well have been that aforementioned Don Juan, who wore eyeliner and, in a fantasy sequence, sported a mask and bandana as a typhoon survivor washed up on the island of Eros. Moviegoers who don't usually register the specifics of performance love to talk about his work in "Pirates," but it's hardly the first time Mr. Depp has inspired such discussion. He has a star presence and a star's set of skills -- in "Don Juan DeMarco" he managed to dominate most of his scenes with Marlon Brando -- but without the burden of a star persona. Like the younger Dustin Hoffman, he declines to confine himself to roles that conform to his public's expectations.  Both of those films were directed by Tim Burton, which makes it all the more puzzling, and intriguing, that Mr. Depp seemed uncharacteristically ill at ease as Willy Wonka in Mr. Burton's lavishly stylized "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." It's as if he'd felt a heavy burden of debt to a children's classic. And knew that what he was playing -- the epicene affect, the prissily piping voice, the creepy resemblance to Michael Jackson -- didn't add up to a lot of fun. But Willy was an exception that proves a general rule. Watching Johnny Depp is almost always enjoyable. Now that he's in the singular position of doing anything he chooses, it will be fascinating to see what he does next.
