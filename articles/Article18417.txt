 Revised Figures On Deficit Spur Search for Cuts --- Projected Savings Shortfall Could Threaten Support For Spending Initiatives   By By David Rogers, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 1993  The result is to lessen the impact of the administration's program, even though the underlying projections show the deficit shrinking. In fiscal 1997 and 1998, for example, the White House would meet or surpass its deficit goals, according to the CBO, owing partly to higher revenues from the exisiting tax base.  White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty met yesterday with Democratic moderates in the House, and there is growing pressure that the overall level of spending cuts promised by the president must be met. Thus any shortfall cited by the CBO would have to be matched by new savings, which could push the deficit target for 1997 below $200 billion.  "That is a concern," said White House Budget Director Leon Panetta, who met last night with moderate House Republicans before joining his former Democratic colleagues on the House Budget Committee. The panel is to take up the budget resolution next week. "The president feels very strongly about the investment proposals," Mr. Panetta said. "We think our numbers are solid, but if the feeling is that the House has to have the blessing of CBO, we'll work with them."
