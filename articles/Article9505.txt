 A Special Weekly Report From The Wall Street Journal's Capital Bureau   By By Jackie Calmes, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2002  Top Health and Human Services officials visit for briefings as Bush weighs whether Americans should be vaccinated against smallpox. The department readies a public-education campaign should he give the go-ahead. U.S. troops will get vaccines, amid concerns that "Iraq has a weaponized program involving smallpox," a Bush aide says.  NAME-DROPPER: Bush aides dismiss stories claiming Democrats are among choices for SEC chairman as the work of Harry Clark, former head of the Clark & Weinstock lobbying firm who is now at the U.S. trade representative's office. "He has circulated names," Bush adviser Glenn Hubbard says, but "most of the names getting serious consideration come from people" in the White House complex.  Some Republicans worry as more middle-class taxpayers have to pay the complex alternative-minimum tax. The AMT was intended to hit the rich who otherwise could avoid taxes with a raft of breaks, but it wasn't indexed for inflation. Bush's 2001 tax act worsened the problem. The White House figures a fix can be part of broader changes in tax policy, in a second Bush term.
