 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1997  CHRYSLER NAMED Thomas T. Stallkamp president, essentially anointing him heir apparent to Robert J. Eaton, the No. 3 auto maker's chairman and CEO. Stallkamp is best known as a cost-cutter, and he also recently oversaw Chrysler's key minivan operations. The selection, which was expected, comes years before succession is likely to be an issue, but the move further underscores Chrysler's break with its chaotic past.  Merrill Lynch is in advanced talks to acquire technology investment-banking boutique Hambrecht & Quist for more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.  Japan's Sumitomo Bank is seeking buyers for its California retail-banking franchise and its commercial-banking department, moving to pare back overseas in an effort to shore up operations at home. Sumitomo Bank of California could fetch up to $1 billion.
