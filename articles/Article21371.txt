 Corn Futures Prices Settle Higher as Market Responds to Rumors of Soviet Grain Purchase   By By Scott McMurray, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1989  Corn futures prices jumped the daily permissible limit in early trading on rumors of major Soviet grain purchases, then gave up part of their gains by the close of the session as traders expressed doubts about the extent and timing of the Soviet's grain purchasing plans.  The question of whether the Russians are coming into the U.S. grain markets as buyers this fall has been hanging over the grain and soybean futures markets for months. Comments from Soviet officials in recent weeks that their country had completed grain purchases for the current year -- calendar or fiscal year, no one knew which -- only added to the uncertainty about their purchase plans.  Comments from Cooper Evans, the White House's agricultural adviser, set the stage for the early rally yesterday when he told reporters on Friday that a major sale of agricultural products to the Soviet Union would be announced shortly. Futures traders appeared to interpret Mr. Evans' remarks as meaning that the Soviets were about to make huge purchases of U.S. corn, with one market rumor yesterday putting the purchase at a whopping two million metric tons.
