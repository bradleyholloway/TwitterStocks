 Rebuilding Trust: Big Florida Developer Faces Tough Questions In Wake of Hurricane --- Lennar Sold Luxury for Less; Now Some Buyers Think Style Replaced Substance --- `Temptation to Find Blame'   By By Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 1992  But in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, Mr. Moland and other South Florida homeowners are wishing they had cared less about style and more about the substance of their homes. Mr. Moland's roof caved in and a back wall broke away. Across town, Hope Scott was shocked as she slogged through mildewing piles of insulation and waferboard in what was once the living room of her Lennar home. "I didn't know what kind of material was in the building until the hurricane came," she says. She had never thought to ask.  Lennar has always been a name people in South Florida trusted. In a business where builders come and go, it has lasted four decades. When something in a Lennar house broke down, homeowners knew the company would be around to fix it. Lennar was the white knight of Florida builders, stepping in to finish subdivisions when other developers went belly up. Last year, it was named Company of the Year -- and its president and chairman, Leonard Miller, was named Man of the Year -- by two Florida publications.  But Hurricane Andrew has thrown Lennar, along with other South Florida builders, into the middle of another storm. Homeowners like Mr. Moland and Mrs. Scott are angrily wondering why their houses didn't hold up. Residents of five Lennar subdivisions have filed lawsuits in Circuit Court in Dade County, blaming Lennar's "improper selection of building materials and improper construction" for hurricane damage.
