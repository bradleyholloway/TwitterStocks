 Your Money Matters (A Special Report): Family Matters; Preparing for Plastic: Debit cards; Credit cards; Prepaid cards; Which one is right for your children? And how do you make sure they use it wisely?   By Mintz, Jessica, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2006  "Using debit cards allows you to manage limited resources more effectively and safely than paying with credit cards," says Mr. [Stephen Brobeck]. Debit cards tied to kids' own checking accounts may drive the point home better, though if a card is associated with the parents' account, "parents can learn more about their child's spending patterns," he adds.  It can also be good for parents to step back and let their kids really use the card, Mr. [Rich Martinez] says -- even if they spend $100, the monthly credit limit at Young Americans Bank, on a pair of jeans. "Let them go and buy something," he says. Then, parents can lend counsel, saying, " 'OK, now you have to be responsible to make your payments.' " The children may not realize the high price they have paid until they're forced to make a series of payments with interest over a period of weeks, he says. And like many adults who make payments on credit-card debt each month, the children may learn that their payments force them to forgo other desired items in the meantime. "The impact is that those jeans came at a cost, a choice over other things," Mr. Martinez says.  Not everyone agrees, however, about the lessons the kids really learn. "We discourage parents from giving credit cards to children," says the Consumer Federation's Mr. Brobeck. "It is generally not a good idea to teach kids how to spend money they don't have." Credit cards "discourage the ability in kids to defer gratification," he adds.
