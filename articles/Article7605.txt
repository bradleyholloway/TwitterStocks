 World-Wide [2]  The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1987  France, which was supported by Britain and West Germany, declined to attend the meeting in Rome because of apprehension that the U.S. might launch a military strike against Lebanon. The parley was scheduled to open today and was to have focused on the recent spate of abductions in Beirut. State Department officials said military steps weren't on the agenda. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said the U.S. had reduced the size of its naval force in the eastern Mediterranean, but noted that it was keeping more than a dozen warships on alert.  Reagan will meet Wednesday with his special national security review board for further questioning on the Iran-Contra affair. The president had met with the commission last month. A White House spokesman said Reagan has agreed to turn over to the panel "appropriate excerpts" of his personal notes about the initiative.  The Kremlin confirmed that it plans to resume nuclear testing after an 18-month pause, saying the decision was justified by security interests. Officials, however, said Moscow wouldn't attempt to match a U.S. space-based antimissile project. A Reagan aide said it was "preposterous" for Moscow to deny it was developing such a system.
