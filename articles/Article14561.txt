 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Fundamental Fairness   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1989  Judge Mohl has ordered Dartmouth College to reinstate immediately as full-time students two members of the conservative Dartmouth Review, who'd been suspended from school last March by the college's disciplinary committee. The students and the Review for which they wrote had become embroiled in a dispute with a black, liberal music professor. Though narrowly reasoned, Judge Mohl's decision granting the students injunctive relief against Dartmouth focused precisely on the kind of thinking that now stands as a high wall between conservatives and liberals on many campuses. It is a kind of thinking that looks upon itself as fair and reasonable. It is not.  Months before the disputed incident, faculty members on the Steering Committee of the Women's Studies Program sent Dartmouth President James Freedman a letter, written in the earnestly sensitive language of wronged academics, saying the Review had subjected their colleagues to "slanders" and "sexist and racist" characterizations. A co-signer, Albert Lavalley, sat on the committee that suspended the Review staffers, and Judge Mohl said the Women's Studies letter clearly reflected bias and prejudice against Review staffers. Mr. Lavalley, he said, shouldn't have been on the disciplinary committee.
