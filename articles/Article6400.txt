 The Political Ad Takes Tender Root in Asia --- Democracy Spurs the Spots But Not Much Flash Yet; Western Shops Reluctant   By By Michael Flagg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2001  Consider Thailand, where one generally accepted estimate by Thai researchers says politicians spent $1.2 billion in a 1996 election, more than the Democratic and Republican parties combined spent on that year's U.S. presidential election. Much of the spending in Thailand, the researchers estimate, went to buy votes; so much money sloshes around the countryside at election time that makers of big-ticket products like motorbikes and appliances routinely run more ads then.  Political advertising hasn't fully taken off in Asia. The ads are usually fairly basic and cheap. "You're not likely to see the kind of sophisticated things that run in the U.S. -- heavily researched, changing every week," says Andre Nair, until recently a managing director of Bcom3 Group's Starcom, which buys television time and newspaper space for advertisers. "Here it's more mass rallies and kiss-the-baby kind of stuff."  One multinational that is taking on political work is Grey Global Group Inc.'s Grey Worldwide. It was a Grey unit in the Philippines that worked on ending the ban on political ads. A Grey unit in India also worked on the successful 1999 re-election campaign of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
