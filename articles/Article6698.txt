 Samsung's i500 Packs PDA Power, Cellphone Portability   By By Walter S. Mossberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2003  The Samsung's dimensions and weight may not seem much smaller than the Kyocera's but, in the hand or pocket, the differences are striking. The Samsung looks and feels like a normal flip phone; the Kyocera looks like a larger mutation of a flip phone.  Like the Kyocera, the Samsung i500 seeks to maximize screen real estate by mounting the screen in the top half of the opened clamshell. The Palm handwriting input area is in the bottom half, above the standard phone keypad. The screen, while smaller than the Kyocera's, is sharp and displays vivid colors. Even small type looks crisp on it. And the keypad lights up.  Samsung has integrated the phone and Palm functions much better than Kyocera did -- for instance, the touch screen works while you're in phone mode. Samsung has included handy buttons on the sides to switch between Palm and phone modes, to display menus on any screen and to invoke voice dialing.
