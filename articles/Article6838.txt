 Key AIDS Study In Cambodia Now in Jeopardy   By Marilyn Chase and Gautam Naik, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 2004  Organizers of the Cambodian trial, which is sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, promised that the 960 participants, who have yet to be selected, would receive counseling about safe-sex practices, monthly testing, condoms, and $3 a day for transportation. If Viread proved effective as a preventative, participants would receive a free supply of Viread for two years. But any that contracted HIV may have to rely on Cambodia's low standard of healthcare and limited access to antiviral drugs.  At the Bangkok conference, AIDS activist group Act Up Paris and a group of prostitutes called the Asian Pacific Network of Sex Workers brandished signs that read, "$3 can't buy sex workers' lives." They seized the stage at a scientific session and spilled fake blood on displa ys, including Gilead's.  Mary Fanning, associate director for clinical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says offering volunteers 30 to 40 years of care, as the protest group demands, wouldn't pass an ethics test because it is an "undue inducement." Incentives "so enormous" could entice volunteers to enroll in a study regardless of the risks, she says, tainting the informed consent process.
