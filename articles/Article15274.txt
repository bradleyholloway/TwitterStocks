 A Guy Who Counts: An Exciting Actuary? Well, There Is One, Michael J. Gulotta --- He Helps Companies Mired In Major Pension Crises, Plays Role in Acquisitions --- But Not All Take His Advice   By By Lee Berton, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 1994  The company, which he founded in 1985 while working at AT&T and which now has 30 actuaries and 100 other employees, thrives by saving companies big money. Carolina Power & Light Co. says that since 1991, Mr. Gulotta has helped it design health and welfare plans for 8,000 employees that save it up to $500,000 a year. "Unlike most unimaginative actuaries, Mike Gulotta is innovative and energetic," says Murray Gould, the Raleigh, N.C., utility's tax manager.  "The trick is to untangle the Gordian knots of complex tax rules, and Mike is like a Houdini," Mr. Gould adds. Mr. Gulotta helped Carolina Power establish a voluntary employee-benefits association, or VEBA, with specially designed trusts that avoid taxes on investment gains. Growing tax-free, the trusts fund employee life- and health-insurance benefits.  Rush projects are routine for the hard-charging Mr. Gulotta, who is athletic enough to play racquetball on weekend mornings and unconventional enough to own, with two partners, six trotting and pacing horses. One time two years ago, a client needed a new pension-plan design overnight for bargaining the next day. The only hope to reach the client on time was to take a small propeller plane through a storm. "We were tossed around like sacks of flour," Mr. Gulotta says. "I was never so frightened in my life."
