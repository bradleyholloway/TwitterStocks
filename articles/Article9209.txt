 What's News: Southeast   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 2000  PaineWebber Group Inc., which recently agreed to buy J.C. Bradford & Co. for $620 million, is laying off as many as 550 Bradford employees, or 55% of the work force at the securities firm's Nashville headquarters. About 200 investment bankers, stock analysts and other staff will lose their jobs when the deal closes this month. An additional 350 workers, mainly in computer operations and accounting, are being offered bonuses to stay on while PaineWebber switches over Bradford's systems to its own, which is expected to take until Labor Day. Outside of Nashville, PaineWebber plans to keep Bradford's 1,700 stockbrokers and other staff.  Chalk one up for Alabama's tort-reform prophets. Avondale Mills Inc. of Monroe, Ga., says it will spend $74 million to upgrade its yarn and fabric plants in the state -- a step it says it wouldn't have taken if Alabama legislators had not agreed a year ago on civil-liability reforms, including a cap on punitive damages. The tort-reform package "was utterly essential," according to an Avondale executive. The company also plans to invest an additional $41 million in plants in South Carolina. Alabama officials say the company was the first to draw an explicit link between its decision to expand and last year's tort reform.
