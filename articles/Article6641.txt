 In Brief   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 10, 2007  Endemol Entertainment Holding NV, the creator of "Big Brother" and other television programs, said it agreed to purchase Endemol France for about 450 million euros ($586 million) in cash and debt. The French unit was separated from the rest of Endemol in 2005. Both Endemol and its French subsidiary are controlled by Spain's Telefonica SA, but Endemol has been publicly listed in Amsterdam since Telefonica floated a 25% stake in November 2005.
