 Hollywood Journal: Hollywood Throws Out the Book --- Flops, Hard-to-Adapt Novels Have Studios Shy of Books; A Clancy TV Miniseries?   By By Tom King, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 13, 2000  After a decade of blockbuster movies based on books by the likes of Tom Clancy and John Grisham, studios have cut way back on the number of novels they have acquired -- and, more importantly, on the amount they're paying for them. Thanks to a recent string of book-to-film flops, a dearth of hot new authors and an almost total absence of risk-taking in Hollywood, you're more likely to see new books come to your TV screen, or no screen at all.  That's partially because publishers are giving Hollywood less to work with: They're putting out fewer plot-driven thrillers and more novels with twists and turns that are hard to film. Studio execs have turned their noses up at Margaret Atwood's "The Blind Assassin," currently No. 7 on the New York Times bestseller list. "They say it's too complicated to make," says Mr. [Ron Bernstein]. And then there's Zadie Smith's acclaimed first book, "White Teeth," an epic story of two multiracial families that jumps from Jamaica to Bangladesh and Turkey. One executive declares it "unfilmable."  Now, in a sign of the times, some big books that might previously have gone to the silver screen are instead heading for TV, where the financial risks are lower. The success this year of the TV movie "Tuesdays With Morrie," based on Mitch Albom's bestseller, has made some wonder if books like "Angela's Ashes" would have been better served -- and lost less money -- on the small screen. Indeed, that may be where the next Tom Clancy novel is headed. People close to Mr. Clancy, whose bestselling Jack Ryan novels have been turned into blockbusters for Paramount, say the author is close to a deal that would turn his current No. 1 New York Times bestseller, "The Bear and the Dragon," into a TV miniseries.
