 TVs Replace Tanks in Some Soviet Plants --- Defense Industry Switching Uneasily to Consumer Goods   By By Peter Gumbel, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1988  The Soviet Union has long had two separate economies: a military one that takes the best brains and resources, and a civilian one that gets what's left. Thus, the Soviets have a huge space program but no nonstick frying pans; they make plenty of weapons to chill the spines of their enemies but not enough refrigerators to chill the produce of their citizens.  Mikhail Gorbachev is trying to address this discrepancy. As part of his crash program to put more food and goods into consumers' hands, the Soviet leader has ordered the hush-hush defense sector to help. Over the past months, top managers in the military sector have switched over to run civilian production ministries, and defense industry departments have been ordered to produce consumer goods.  Thus the Ministry of Medium Machine Building, which makes missiles and other lethal hardware, is now supposed to churn out equipment for the dairy-processing industry, computers for schools, video recorders, high-performance batteries and 600,000 refrigerators a year. Other ministries have been given similar tasks, including production of 40% of the plumbing fixtures needed for Soviet apartments.
