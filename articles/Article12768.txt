 Rethinking War   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 2002  September 11 brought home the vulnerability of the U.S. homeland, and it's expensive to defend. The U.S. is already spending more on homeland defense -- overflights, airport security, and so on -- than the $1 billion a month it spends in Afghanistan. There are now more U.S. troops in Utah protecting the Olympics than there are in Afghanistan.  -- Denying sanctuary to enemies, $3.2 billion. The aim here is to develop long-range strike capabilities, such as unmanned vehicles, and the ability to insert Special Operations Forces into enemy territory. Among the budget requests are $629 million for Global Hawk, a high-altitude unmanned vehicle that has proved extremely useful in Afghanistan, and $1 billion to convert four Trident subs (out of 18) from nuclear-missile duty to carry 150 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 Special Ops forces.  -- Space, $200 million. The long-term goal here isn't Star Wars but protecting U.S. military and commercial assets in space and denying enemies the use of space. Dominating space today is what taking a hill once was to the infantry. Without space, U.S. troops couldn't communicate, planes would have a hard time flying and precision weapons would fail.
