 Letters to the Editor: The Fed's Green Paper Chase   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 15, 1992  The theory offered by Paul L. Kasriel of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago and Robert Laurent of the Chicago Federal Reserve -- that the operation of the Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) in its bailout program has had the effect of pulling reserves out of the banking system, thus shrinking the money supply -- is compelling ("How the Fed Subverts Its Rate Cuts," editorial page, Dec. 23). However, a more thorough analysis suggests that:  1) In the very short term (30-60 days) the effects of the RTC funding dynamics may be to exert downward pressure on the Fed funds rate, but the longer-term effects are neutral.  During the past year, when depositors shifted from less liquid M2 and M3 accounts to more liquid M1 accounts, an interesting thing happened on the way to the bank. Bank-deposit liabilities that did not require fractional reserves were suddenly switched into accounts that did, and to the tune of almost $50 billion (the other $20 billion going to cash as indicated previously). That forced banks to come up with about $5 billion to satisfy reserve requirements. Where did the money come from? In fact, $2 billion came from the residual of the total factors supplying reserves that were not converted to cash held by the public as described above and $3 billion came from surplus vault cash, cash that had never been counted in total reserves. Though it appears that Fed reserves have grown by 10% in the past few months (from $49 billion to $54 billion), in fact only $2 billion of that is from fresh Fed activity. The balance represents a drawdown or, more precisely, a reclassification of surplus vault cash to vault cash fulfilling reserve requirements . . . "old" money, if you will.
