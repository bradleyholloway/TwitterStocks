 Chevron Expects Refining Margins to Hurt Profit   By Campoy, Ana, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2007  The San Ramon, Calif.-based company, the No. 2 U.S. oil company by market capitalization behind Exxon Mobil Corp., said yesterday it expects third-quarter earnings will be significantly lower than the record $5.4 billion it earned in the second quarter. It said the main factor would be a drop in refining margins, or the difference between the price oil companies pay for oil and the price of the products they produce with it. Chevron also cited nonrecurring items.  For Chevron, tougher refining margins remain the chief factor. Earlier this summer, margins were at record highs. Unplanned shutdowns at refineries dwindled gasoline stocks at a time when demand was at its highest as drivers went on vacation, pushing prices up.
