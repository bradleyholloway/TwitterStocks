 Airlines' Concerns Over Terrorism Prompt Major Changes in Industry   By By Gary Cohn, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 11, 1986  Events of the past month -- culminating in the bombing last week of a Trans World Airlines jetliner over Greece -- are prompting changes that go beyond increased security. TWA is sharply reducing service to the Mediterranean area and starting flights to Alaska and Hawaii. Eastern Airlines yesterday postponed plans to begin flights to Madrid, Spain, another troubled destination. And Eastern is planning an advertising campaign, called "Faces of Home," to encourage domestic travel and capitalize on fears of flying abroad.  The industry's obsession with terrorism and security was reflected in an incident on American Airlines Flight 360 on March 7, nearly one month before the TWA bombing.  Such caution is understandable. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, 20 hijackings and 14 other cases of sabotage took place aboard commercial airliners around the world last year. One of the most serious episodes occurred last June, when Lebanese-Shiite gunmen hijacked a TWA jet with 104 Americans aboard and forced it to fly to Beirut, Lebanon. An American Navy diver was killed, and the remaining hostages were held for 17 days. Earlier this week, Mexicana Airlines pilots said they believed the Mexicana jet that crashed last week, killing all 166 people aboard, was bombed as part of an insurance scam.
