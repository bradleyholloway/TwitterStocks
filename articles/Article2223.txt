 World Wire [9]  By Compiled by Richard L. Holman, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1996  France said it sold 24.9 million shares, or 9.1%, of the big petroleum company Elf Aquitaine SA for 10 billion francs ($1.96 billion). Proceeds will almost cover the government's injection of 11 billion francs into Thomson SA to cut the defense and media giant's debt as part of its sell-off. Investors in France and abroad bought 4.6% of Elf for 417.50 francs ($81.96) a share, and 4.5% was sold to Elf's Fingestval unit. The stock closed at 423.4 francs, down 2.1 francs, in Paris yesterday. The government has effectively completed Elf's privatization, begun 1994. Its remaining 0.75% holding is earmarked for Elf employees.  Despite predictions of a year-end slump, new-auto sales in Western Europe last month raced up 15% from a year earlier and 9.6% from September, preliminary registration figures show, indicating annual sales totaling 13 million vehicles. The strong performance was attributed partly to French subsidies to perk up the sector. Registrations swelled 25% from a year earlier to 202,200 vehicles in France and rose 6.4% in Germany to 284,500. Fleet buying helped sales in Britain.
