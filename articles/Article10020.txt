 Wal-Mart Agrees to Sell Receivers for HD Radio   By Ovide, Shira, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 2007  "When America's biggest retailer steps up, it shows we've really reached prime time," said Peter Ferrara, president of the HD Digital Radio Alliance, a coalition of major radio companies that support the technology.  "HD radio has a difficult spot to carve out in what's becoming a very much more evolved audio-listening landscape," said John Rose, a partner with Boston Consulting Group.  The radio industry also is positioning HD radio as a free alternative to satellite radio. HD radio "is truly a product that our customers want to have available in our stores," said Tara Raddohl, a spokeswoman for the retailer. "We want to offer incredible products at a great value; this is a perfect example."
