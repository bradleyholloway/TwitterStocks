 Art Journal: The Eating Indicator --- At Pre-Sale Bashes, Cheap Snacks Portend Crummy Sales; Creamed Lobster and Hirst   By By Alexandra Peers, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2001  It's brunch time at Sotheby's. White-coated waiters with silver hors d'oeuvre trays circle the crowd like satellites, million-dollar artworks line the galleries, and corporate titans talk Picasso by the bar. The bash is the auctioneer's preview of its all-important Impressionist art sales. So, what's on the menu? Chicken hash, floppy triangles of skewered pineapple and scrambled eggs dotted with black flecks. Is that caviar -- or coffee grounds?  "It's all part of the total massage," says Kathleen Guzman, former president of Christie's East and now consultant to eWolf's Inc., a Cleveland online auctioneer. In the art world, food is key in the elaborate courtship that starts with wooing a seller over dinner, moves on to signing a contract that often specifies how elaborate a pre-sale party will be, and then may extend on to a gallery-opening banquet or Bollinger toast in a "consignor's skybox" overlooking an auction. Good food, and plenty of it, is a subtle signal to collectors of good times.  Overkill? No, market-share battle. Larry Gagosian, a rival gallery owner, had just thrown his fest for British artist Mr. [Damien Hirst]. It was the blowout of the season, complete with Salman Rushdie, David Byrne and Martha Stewart. Virtually every artwork was gone before the minions of chef Daniel Boulud, of Manhattan's four-star restaurant Daniel, had finished ladling the lobster. Of course, the strong sales might have had something to do with Mr. Hirst's talent or Mr. Gagosian's connections. But the beef was excellent.
