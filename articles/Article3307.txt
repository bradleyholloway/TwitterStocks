 Some Frames Border on High Art   By Feinstein, Roni, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2004  Many painters, among them James McNeill Whistler, Thomas Cole, Frederic Church and Childe Hassam, were famously involved with the design of the frames that surround their pictures. Cole and Church, both Hudson River School painters, favored different styles of frames for their landscapes. The "Cole frame" is decorated with dense floral patterns in low relief, which echo and reinforce the painted areas of foliage. Church-designed frames feature geometric patterns and are often stepped, as are many 19th-century frames, in such a way as to help lead the eye into the spatial depth of the picture. In both cases, the frames play aesthetic as well as functional roles, contributing in fundamental ways to how the paintings are perceived.  Most 19th-century American frames consist of wooden substrates embellished with applied ornament known as "compo" -- a moldable substance that dried hard and was gilded in the same way as carved wood. Although most of the 19th-century frames in the exhibition are listed as "Maker: Unknown," a few of the most intricately conceived and beautiful ones were designed in the 1890s by the architect Stanford White, who created frames for such artist friends as Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Thomas Wilmer Dewing. Included in the exhibition is a wide, flat frame, golden-brown in tone, ornamented with row after row of concentric bands so narrow that the whole resembles an assembly of gold chains of different widths and patterns laid side by side. The ornamental patterns -- among them classical egg and dart, a wave pattern, a braid and twisted bands -- were arranged to suggest contrasting directions and speeds of movement. The picture it once graced is today unknown.
