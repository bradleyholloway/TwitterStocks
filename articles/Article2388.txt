 Friends in High Places Worry Firms in Indonesia   By By Peter Waldman and Jay Solomon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 1998  JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Peregrine Investments Holdings Ltd. made a $265 million bet that it could parlay a banking relationship with a company linked to President Suharto's eldest daughter into a lucrative foothold in Indonesia. It lost.  For years companies looking for a quick, smooth entry into booming Indonesia made a beeline to the six Suharto kids and their many friends and proxies. The deals and joint ventures they made, accounting for a sizable chunk of the Indonesian economy, helped bring badly needed technology, capital and know-how to Indonesia. The foreign partner did the work; the Suharto partner provided the connections to get it done.  But now the A list is becoming the black list. With much of corporate Indonesia technically insolvent from the plunge in value of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, and with the Suharto regime ever-more challenged, first-family companies have gone from stars to stigmas. Their shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange have fallen faster and further than the market as a whole. And dogged even more than other companies by Indonesia's political uncertainty, the Suharto-linked companies are expected to face particular difficulties attracting fresh loans and equity investments whenever the economy stabilizes, analysts say.
