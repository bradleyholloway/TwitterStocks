 Wall Street Winces at Shearson's Victory --- Few Will Emulate Its Role in Koppers Fight   By By Bryan Burrough, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1988  Shearson and its aggressive British client, Beazer PLC, have triumphed in a $1.71 billion takeover that was closely watched by a slew of Wall Street firms contemplating similar moves. Despite their own missteps, the pair won after a complex defense strategy designed by Koppers' Wall Street adviser, First Boston Corp., collapsed at the eleventh hour.  But the public relations storm stirred up by Koppers and its hometown of Pittsburgh has convinced some takeover professionals that Shearson may have paid too high a price. Shearson and its parent, American Express Co., were publicly attacked by everyone from Pittsburgh's mayor to the state of Pennsylvania's treasurer, who cut off all state business with the firm; Koppers employees even posed for pictures cutting their American Express cards in half.  What Shearson did, in effect, was become the first investment bank to act as a corporate raider. In a strategy orchestrated by the firm's mergers head, J. Tomilson Hill, Shearson took a 46% stake in a group led by Beazer that bid for Koppers in March. That stake is now convertible into a small preferred stock position in Koppers; Beazer will own the company, while Shearson will reap fees estimated between $50 million and $60 million.
