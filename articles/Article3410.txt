 The Economy; CAPITAL: Populist Scythe Aids 'Death Tax' Foes   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2005  Advocates of repeal steered the issue away from facts to morality, declaring the estate tax an unfair levy on success. They also put faces on it -- U.S. farmers and small-business owners, never rich fellows who wanted to bequeath mansions or portfolios. One of the most prominent belonged to Chester Thigpen, a tree farmer from Mississippi, who testified in favor of repeal at age 83 in 1995. "It turns out," Mr. [Michael Graetz] reports, "that Thigpen's estate was too small to be affected by the estate tax, but that was just a detail."  Those opposed to repeal never found a way to counter such stories. "The only reason you were given to oppose repeal," Bill Frenzel, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota, said the other day, "was that somebody else whom you don't know . . . and none of your friends or neighbors know, who lives in a gated community in the Caribbean, is going to pay this tax."  "We've been fighting this on the grounds that it's an unfair tax, and if you believe that, it's hard to argue for anything except repeal," says Dena Battle, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business.
