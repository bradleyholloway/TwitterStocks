 Ad-Packed TVs May Soon Be Boarding City Buses --- Joint Venture Targets Vehicles Where Confined Passengers Are Ideal Captive Audience   By By Robert Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2001  Itec also generates content at its small Orlando studios, such as trivia questions that appear occasionally on the bus TVs. "It really doesn't take much to entertain most people on a bus ride," says Daniel West, vice president of Itec Network, the closely held company's telecasting unit.  So far, advertisers have been pleased with the results of the Orlando pilot program -- and the cost to participate, says Annette Percival, president of Advantage Marketing Concepts, a media-buying company in Orlando. The Orbital-Itec partnership has guaranteed a total of one million viewers during six months of telecasting the 30-second spots, for $1,500 a month, Ms. Percival says. By comparison, she says, reaching such an audience via television in Orlando homes would cost about $3,500 a month.  This week, Orbital is launching an effort to market the systems to municipal bus services nationwide. The Dulles, Va.-based company is offering to distribute Itec's TV monitors for free to municipalities that agree to try the bus-TV system. Orbital says it's in talks with several cities but declined to say which ones. Under proposed sales agreements, Orbital and Itec would split about 90% of the revenue.
