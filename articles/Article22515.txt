 Gore Faced With Converting Supporters Into Believers   By By Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 2, 1999  And so, when House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Ms. (Katherine) Wheeler's favorite Democrat, opted not to enter the presidential sweepstakes, the influential New Hampshire state senator joined a long list of others who swung over to the (Al) Gore camp. But Mr. Gore's conquest was not of the heart. Asked why she supports the vice president, Ms. Wheeler replies: "You might as well be practical. All the Democrats were signing on with the vice president, and I didn't want to be the odd man out."  Mr. Gore's lone Democratic challenger, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, lags far behind the vice president in the endorsement contest. Even so, his supporters are quick to identify specific issues or personal attributes that drew them to the dark-horse candidate. For example, Mark Longabaugh, another former Gephardt ally and now Mr. Bradley's national coordinator in New Hampshire, speaks of the "integrity" of his candidate and says the Democratic Party "has gotten too preoccupied with small ideas and poll-tested tweaking of public policy. This party has always been about big ideas. That's our heritage. I think you will see Bill Bradley make that case."  It's not that Mr. Gore is without his own avid converts. Take the case of Jim Demers, Mr. Gephardt's key man in New Hampshire. The vice president was in New Hampshire on the February day that the House minority leader announced he wouldn't seek the presidential nomination. Within hours, Mr. Demers had two telephone messages from the vice president. By nightfall, an airport meeting was hastily arranged, and Mr. Demers says he was hooked by Mr. Gore's knowledge, experience and sense of humor. "I was one of the most short-lived free agents in New Hampshire politics," says Mr. Demers, who immediately began drafting other Gephardt backers to the Gore camp.
