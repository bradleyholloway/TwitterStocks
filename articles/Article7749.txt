 Industrials Soar 64.16 Points and Bond Prices Jump On Report Bolstering Prospects for a Stable Dollar --- Japanese Officials Quoted As Saying Nations Agree To Hold 125-Yen Level   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1988  The bad news bears ran for cover yesterday as prospects for a stable dollar launched the bond and stock markets on ebullient afternoon rallies.  Triggering the run-ups was a news report out of Japan quoting unidentified Japanese government officials saying that the seven leading industrial nations would keep the dollar stabilized at 125 yen. The G-7 move is expected to come at a meeting in Washington next week. This wasn't a substantial development -- the G-7 nations last December adopted a stabilization policy believed to be in that range -- but it offered welcome respite for investors weary of being battered by a weakening U.S. currency and lethargic markets.  The rally got started in the foreign-exhange market. The G-7 news story prompted currency traders to bid up the dollar from its low yesterday of 124.80 yen, and bonds and stocks quickly followed. Although the dollar retreated slightly from its high of 126.38 late in the day, the stock and bond markets kept charging upward.
