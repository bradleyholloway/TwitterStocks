 On the Data Trail of Potential Terrorists   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2004  It's interesting to note that Newton Minow takes as the initiating event of his "seven clicks" the purchase of airline tickets by two suspected terrorists, "using their real names, addresses, phone numbers and frequent flyer numbers" ("Seven Clicks Away," editorial page, June 3). Surely the government should be checking such records as frequent flyer program member rosters and public telephone directories for the names of suspected terrorists, irrespective of whether they have current air travel reservations. If intelligence officials had identified Nawaq Alhamzi and Khalid Al-Midhar as members of American Airlines' frequent flyer program, they could have connected the two men -- via Mr. Minow's putative "clicks" -- to almost all of the other soon-to-be hijackers, and had the entire cell under surveillance.
