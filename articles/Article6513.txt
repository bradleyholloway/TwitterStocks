 Allies in War on Terror Get a Helping of U.S. Largess --- Egypt Was Hurt Fiscally; When It Comes to Yemen, Rewards Are Trickier   By By Christopher Cooper, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2001  The rewards are beginning to flow. In November, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, David Welch, said he would accelerate and immediately release $100 million in U.S. Agency for International Development payments to help Egypt cope with the fallout from terrorism. The money is part of the roughly $2 billion that Egypt receives annually in U.S. aid. Secretary of State Colin Powell recently suggested he will release early even more money to help Egypt deal with the downturn. And Mr. [Richard Boucher] said the U.S. has begun taking another look at a proposal that has been sitting on the table for years: establishing a free-trade agreement with Egypt. "It is in the interest of both countries that U.S.-Egypt economic ties remain strong," Mr. Boucher said.  This isn't the first time the U.S. has rewarded countries for supporting U.S. policies in the Middle East. Egypt is the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid, much of it the direct result of the 1979 peace pact it signed with Israel. And 10 years ago, after Egypt supplied troops and supported the Persian Gulf War against Iraq, the U.S. responded by forgiving about $7.5 billion in Egyptian debt.
