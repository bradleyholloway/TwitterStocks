 Cross Country: The Troubled Texas GOP   By Gurwitz, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2007  "There's a certain inevitability in demographics," he told me. "We knew that if we could win 40% of the Hispanic vote," as Mr. [George W. Bush] did in 2004, "we'd control Texas until 2030." But in 2006, the number of Texas Hispanics who voted Republican fell to between 30%-35% (depending on the poll).  Last month, an Austin-based polling and political consulting firm decided to quantify the GOP's standing in the state. "We were frustrated by people talking about how bad things are for Republicans in Texas," says Marc DelSignore, vice president of Baselice & Associates, Inc. What his firm found dovetailed with the national polls and Mr. [Masset]'s political forecast. Older and white voters who predominate in suburban and rural communities continue to have positive impressions about the Republican Party, but there's an image problem among the state's growing number of younger voters and Hispanic voters, who are more numerous in urban centers. "When we looked at the numbers," Mr. DelSignore says, "this grew into a compelling narrative."  If there's a silver lining for Republicans, it's that the Democrats haven't been improving their own image. As Mr. Masset puts it, "There's still a chance the Democrats can screw this up royally." But depending on voters to reject the other party is a losing strategy. To maintain their position, Republicans will have to overcome the sense that they are more interested in warring with each other than in governing. They'll also need to come to grips with this reality: Even Texans don't have to vote Republican. Absent compelling reasons to support the GOP, Texas could become the new California.
