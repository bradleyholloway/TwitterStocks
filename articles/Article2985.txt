 Letters to the Editor: Cancer Research Sinks Into Bureaucratic Fog   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2002  As long ago as 1979, senior scientists at the NCI uncovered and pursued research leads that led them to identify mechanisms enabling cancer cells to digest barriers to neighboring regions (invasion), carve out new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and penetrate walls of existing blood vessels capable of transporting tumors to distant parts of the body (metastasis).  This work was published widely, confirmed by scientists all over the world and shown to play a pivotal role in colorectal, melanoma, prostate, breast, pancreatic and stomach cancers. It even led NCI scientists to identify hundreds of putative anti-invasion peptides for which they received five U.S. patents. Virtually none of the drug candidates have been synthesized or tested, preclinically or clinically.
