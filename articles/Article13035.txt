 Nuveen Explains Hit to Muni Funds   By Hayashi, Yuka, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2004  As selling pressure mounted in April, many of the Nuveen funds saw the discount to their net asset value -- or the percentage difference between the price the shares trade at and the higher per-share value of the fund's portfolio -- widen sharply. For example, the discount on its leveraged California muni funds widened to an average 8.55% from 1.95% during April. "These average discounts are above the historical levels we have observed," Mr. [William Adams] said.  As the biggest provider of closed-end muni funds, Nuveen has a lot riding on them. With more than $36 billion in assets, these funds represent more than one-third of the company's $101 billion in total assets under management as of March 31. Poor performance of existing funds make it hard for Nuveen to bring new funds to the market -- a big source of earnings growth for the company last year.
