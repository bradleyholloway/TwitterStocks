 Help on Getting Organized   By Ruffenach, Glenn, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 2004  A Web site called Today's Seniors also has a good collection of forms. From the home page, www.a-guide-for-seniors.com, click on Financial Organizers, where you will find six sets of templates (for insurance, final wishes, etc.). One caveat: With both Fannie Mae and Today's Seniors, you must print the forms from the Web sites and then enter the data manually. There is no way to enter or update the information online.  One stumbling block, according to Ms. Langdorf, is privacy: Some older adults are hesitant to write down and share every piece of personal information with their children and heirs. The answer, she says, is simple. "You don't have to tell your children everything. But you want to be able to say, 'If something happens to me, go to the red notebook on my desk. That's where you'll find all the information.'"  "They died simultaneously due to a single auto accident and when we went in to the house, we found that virtually every special 'item' had been labeled as designated for one or the other of us. For example, a special Christmas decoration was labeled for me, and a different one for my brother. On a piece of tape under one heirloom was one name, and under a different heirloom was the other.
