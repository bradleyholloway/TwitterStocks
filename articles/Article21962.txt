 Sail-By Shootings Become a Problem In Monterey Bay --- Sea Lions Are Among Victims Of the Spiteful Violence Protectionism Has Spurred   By By Charles McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 2, 1994  MONTEREY, Calif. -- A federally protected California sea lion nicknamed Rafiki recently became the target of a growing terror in the marine world: the sail-by shooting. While she was swimming and fishing with friends out on Monterey Bay, someone shot her in the head at point-blank range.  "We've got a serious problem on our hands," says Bob Jones, a special agent and sea-lion crime expert with the National Marine Fisheries Service here. Adds Peigin Barrett, executive director of the Marine Mammal Center: "It's open season." The center is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of sea-lion assailants.  Poaching has always been a threat to sea lions and other animals. But the killing was done for sport or for money (a grizzly bear gallbladder can fetch $65,000 on the aphrodisiac market in Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea). Now, though, wildlife officers say they are seeing attacks motivated by spite -- the mere resentment of wildlife protections.
