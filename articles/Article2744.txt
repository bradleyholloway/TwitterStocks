 EarthLink Says It Won't Install Device for FBI   By By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Nick Wingfield, Ted Bridis and Neil King Jr, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2000  The FBI has used Carnivore, as the surveillance device is called, in a number of criminal investigations. But EarthLink is the first ISP to offer a public account of an actual experience with Carnivore. The FBI has claimed that Carnivore won't interfere with an ISP's operations.  EarthLink's problems with Carnivore began earlier this year, when the FBI installed a Carnivore device on its network at a hub site in Pasadena, Calif. The FBI had a court order that allowed it to install the equipment as part of a criminal investigation.  The FBI connected Carnivore, a small computer box loaded with sophisticated software for monitoring e-mail and other online communications, to EarthLink's remote access servers, a set of networking equipment that answers incoming modem calls from customers. But Carnivore wasn't compatible with the operating system software on the remote access servers. So EarthLink had to install an older version of the system software that would work with Carnivore, according to Mr. [Steve Dougherty].
