 Davenport Chooses Leaders -- and Waits   By By Mary Ellen Lloyd, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 10, 2001  With the cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy, earnings and stock markets, Mr. [Joseph Antrim], the head of Davenport & Co.'s asset-management business and senior portfolio manager for the Davenport Equity Fund, believes his firm's focus on buying leading companies and controlling risk should pay off once the economy begins turning around.  "Sept. 11's events only made the negative trends in the U.S. economy and the stock market accelerate," Mr. Antrim said. That underscored the value of Davenport's investing policy of "picking the leaders and holding on," he said.  The Richmond, Va., firm also may switch out of a leader in one industry if its shares have held up fairly well and Davenport can boost positions in other leaders whose prices have "a lot of snap-back potential" from recent significant declines, Mr. Antrim said. For example, Davenport recently sold its stake in Sara Lee, which it had held for a couple of years, in order to increase holdings in American Express and AOL Time Warner, which are both trading at half their year-earlier levels.
