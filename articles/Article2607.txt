 Democrats' Patient-Protection Measures Fail in Senate   By By Laurie McGinley and Shailagh Murray, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 1999  Senate Republicans dealt Democrats setbacks on patients' rights legislation, including rejecting an effort to give doctors maximum freedom in determining what care is medically necessary for HMO patients.  The 52-48 vote came as the Senate, in its first series of votes on rival patient protection bills, rejected the Democrats' tougher, more comprehensive approach on issues ranging from women's health to emergency-room services. The votes were, as expected, mostly along party lines, although the Democrats picked up a few Republican votes on each issue.  The GOP effort means that the Democrats are unlikely to lure enough votes from across the aisle to force the Republicans to accept any of their more stringent protections. In some respects, each party is getting what it wants: The Republicans are beating back what they consider excessive Democratic proposals, while the Democrats can claim that the GOP is ignoring consumer interests.
