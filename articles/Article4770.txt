 Technology (A Special Report): WSJ Review --- Who Makes Technology Work: The Grades Are in for Nine Major Industries --- Pharmaceuticals   By By Michael Waldholz, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 1987  In recent years, industry and university scientists "have made the conceptual and technical breakthroughs (in biotechnology) that will serve as the basis for all kinds of new drugs and diagnostics for years to come," says Herbert Weissbach, director of the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, a research organization funded by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a major pharmaceutical concern and a unit of Switzerland's F. Hoffmann-LaRoche & Co.  Still, the drug industry's ability to capitalize swiftly on these breakthroughs lags. True, no country leads the U.S. in producing drugs such as IL-2 that are harvested from the body's immune system, brain and other organs. But most of the industry's fledgling biotechnology firms can't afford the costly research and development needed to prove a new substance safe and effective. The established drug makers, such as Merck & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co., that do have the resources to exploit biotech's promise only now are beginning to aim research and development efforts in that direction.
