 Inspiration to Sell Its Danville Stake To Plain Holdings   By By Allanna Sullivan, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 1985  Inspiration Resources Corp. said it plans to sell its interest in Danville Resources Inc., an oil and gas concern, to Plain Holdings B.V. for $215 million.  Inspiration, an agricultural products and mining company, will use proceeds to slash its $508 million of debt. The sharp reduction in debt "will allow the company to move forward and make acquisitions in fields that will provide greater cash flow," Inspiration's chief financial officer, William Frank, said.  Reducing debt was of "paramount concern" to Inspiration, Mr. Frank said. Although the long-term prospects for Danville are good, a rebound in the oil and gas business won't happen in the next year or so, he said. "We can't afford to carry Danville and wait."
