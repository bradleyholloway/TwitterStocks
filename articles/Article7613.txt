 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Plain Talk in Munich   The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1987  Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle's pithy remarks last weekend to a group of NATO defense officials in Munich did not go unnoticed. The White House hastily denied that they represented administration policy. New speculations came out of the Pentagon about whether Mr. Perle's long-rumored resignation might be imminent, an estimate that probably is once again premature. Moscow radio commentator Igor Charikov hurled invective, comparing Mr. Perle to a "certain tropical bird with the ability to imitate people," a metaphor too deep in meaning for us to fathom.  If Xinhua didn't think Mr. Perle was saying anything remarkable, it may have been because the Chinese, unlike Westerners, haven't suffered years of exposure to arms control illusions. Were it not for the willingness of so many Westerners to suspend logic, the core of Mr. Perle's address would hardly raise a murmur. He simply asks, "What Western leader would turn in his country's last remaining nuclear weapon on the strength of assurances -- mere words -- that the Soviets have done the same? The simple truth is that the verification of an agreement to abolish all nuclear weapons is not difficult, or very difficult: It is impossible."
