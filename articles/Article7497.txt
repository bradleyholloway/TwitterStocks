 The Town Meeting, New England Staple, Faces Tide of Change --- Its Functions Are Restricted, And in Some Cases Ended; Lovell, Maine, Carries On   By By David Shribman, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 7, 1986  Since 1796, the people of Lovell, a town of green shutters and 816 souls in the shadow of western Maine's White Mountains, have trudged through the ice and snow to this building to perform their civic duties. But despite the picturesque scene, the New England town meeting is in trouble. And its difficulties run far deeper than the whispering that one of Lovell's selectmen and overseers of the poor will quit if a certain someone is elected to the board. (She isn't.)  This month, as town-meeting season reaches its peak in remote valleys and hidden harbors, increasing numbers of residents, local officials and even political scientists are questioning whether the town meeting is becoming obsolete.  "Town meeting fits a certain view of American life -- open, honest, up-close, face-to-face," says Frank Bryan, a University of Vermont political scientist who specializes in local government. "But the view more and more is bouncing up against reality. Lots of times town meeting is dull and tedious. Townsfolk don't vote 'right.' So lots of newcomers are beginning to say that town meeting is good so long as it doesn't decide anything important."
