 Bookmarks   By By Jeffrey Burke, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 3, 2003  Yet this book has little of the brainy, technologically hip challenge often found in [Richard Powers]'s prose. Indeed, the novel is at its most engaging in reader-friendly scenes of family life and strife. It often soars in passages that celebrate the beauty of vocal music, including a climactic scene that reunites characters, themes, tragedy and song in a feat of Dickensian brio.
