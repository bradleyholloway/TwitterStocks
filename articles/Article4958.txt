 Several Electric Utilities Are Expected to Post Above-Average Boost in Dividends Next Year   By By Bill Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1988  If you're Christmas shopping for an electric-utility stock that's expected to pay an above-average dividend increase next year, analysts suggest the following stocking stuffers: PSI Holdings, General Public Utilities, Southern Indiana Gas & Electric, Central & South West, TECO Energy, Kansas Gas & Electric and Consolidated Edison of New York.  As a result, the average dividend increase next year will be only about 2.5% to 3%, predicts Robin Jaffe of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. And some power companies will be in danger of having to cut their dividend. But first the winners.  PSI Holdings, says Mr. Luftig, has sufficiently recovered from its 1985 write-off of an investment in a nuclear power plant to be able to restore its dividend in 1989. He expects the new annual rate to be $1 a share. Ms. Jaffe, after a recent luncheon with PSI Holdings executives, looks for 80 cents a share.
