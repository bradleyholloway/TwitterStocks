 Ask Dow Jones   By Herman, Tom, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 4, 2005  A: What I wrote is correct. You're probably thinking of the general time limit for filing amended returns. But there's a different rule for worthless securities. To take a deduction for a worthless security, claim it in the year it actually became worthless. If you don't discover it became worthless until some later year, file an amended return for the year in which it became worthless. The IRS says to file that amended return within seven years from the date your original return for that year had to be filed, or two years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.
