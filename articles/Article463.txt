The Seemala Corporation, a subsidiary of Ivan F. Boesky & Company and a leading Wall Street risk arbitrage firm, stands to turn a quick profit on the pending takeover of Marshall Field & Company by Batus Inc. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Seemala disclosed that it had acquired 9.9 percent of the common stock of Field, or 1,078,200 shares.  Seemala, named for Mr. Boesky's wife Seema, purchased the stock for $30,416,100, or $28.21 a share.  It has been tendered to Batus, the holding company for the American assets of B.A.T. Industries of London. By last week, Batus had received 92 percent of Field's stock. Batus has agreed to pay $30 a share for all of Field's outstanding common stock. This means that Mr. Boesky's company will turn a profit of $1.9 million on its investment when the merger is completed, probably before July 1.
