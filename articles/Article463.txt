In a bizarre accident, a 77-year-old woman was killed in south Brooklyn yesterday when a rock bounced from the wheels of a passing dump truck and crashed through the windshield of the car she was riding in with her husband.  The woman, Credo Veira, was in the passenger seat of a red Toyota traveling southward on Ralph Avenue near East 66th Street in the Flatlands section about 10:50 a.m., the police said. The dump truck was passing in the opposite direction on Ralph Avenue, the police said, when a brown basketball-sized rock that had been lodged between its wheels suddenly flew up, smashed through the Toyota's windshield and struck Mrs. Veira in the head. She was taken to Kings County Hospital, the police said, where she was pronounced dead a half hour later.  To see the full article, subscribe here.
