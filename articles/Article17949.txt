 Pratt Hotel Accuses Trump in Lawsuit As Feud Flares Over the Site for Casino   By By Neil Barsky, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 4, 1989  The long-running feud between Pratt Hotel Corp. Chairman Jack Pratt and casino tycoon Donald Trump reached a boiling point in an Atlantic City, N.J., state court.  In a lawsuit filed yesterday, a Pratt Hotel unit charged Mr. Trump with interfering with its contract to buy Penthouse Hotel's Atlantic City casino site, which Mr. Trump bought March 19 for $35 million.  At the center of the dispute are Mr. Trump's efforts to prevent Mr. Pratt from building a casino alongside Trump Plaza Casino Hotel on the Atlantic City boardwalk. Since 1987, when Pratt Hotels announced it signed a contract with Penthouse to purchase the site, Mr. Trump opposed the project on the grounds it would create parking and pedestrian congestion in the neighborhood.
