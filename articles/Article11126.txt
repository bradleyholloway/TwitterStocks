 The Blues Man From Boise   By By Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 6, 1988  His name is Gene Harris. He is 54 years old, a native of Benton Harbor, Mich., and an Idahoan since 1977. Never adept at self-promotion, he is a household word only in Boise. Still, Harris is known to jazz aficionados, and to his peers, as one of the greatest blues pianists in the world. And his fame is finally catching up with his virtuosity; a brilliant new album with an unwieldy title -- "The Gene Harris All Star Big Band Tribute to Count Basie" -- is No. 7 on Billboard's national jazz chart.  From time to time Harris leaves Boise to play, usually as part of the Ray Brown Trio. Within the past year he has appeared in New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, West Germany, Spain and Japan. Audiences love the interplay between Brown, a renowned bassist, and Harris, whose technique and volcanic energy moved one colleague to say, "If God meant us to play like that, He would have given us 88 fingers."  The lounge is small, with barely enough room for 35 seats and Harris's 9-foot Baldwin grand. On a recent Saturday night, though, more than a hundred people squeezed in to listen, clap and cheer as Harris and some local sidemen played. First came a few piano solos. There were ballads, such as "Sweet and Lovely," which Harris invested with startling strength and passion. There were rhythm tunes -- such as Duke Ellington's "In a Mellotone," or "The Hills of Idaho," written by a black man named Jesse Stone -- that Harris developed with bold harmonic inventions, crystalline runs and the joyous trills that have become his trademark.
