 On Film: The Seduction of Mr. Straight   By By Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 1986  Jonathan Demme's fine new film, "Something Wild," stars Ms. Griffith, who first gave full expression to her dark-side-of-Judy-Holliday persona in "Body Double." Here she plays a naughty girl who, by the sheer force of her sexuality, turns a staid young man's life around. It's the same idea as "Ball of Fire," the Howard Hawks film in which Barbara Stanwyck plays a burlesque dancer who yanks Gary Cooper's encyclopedia writer out of celibacy.  Mr. Demme's variation on this romantic comedy theme is a romp, but a disturbing romp. His Mr. Straight is played with comic dexterity by Jeff Daniels, the versatile young actor who was the philandering husband in "Terms of Endearment," the movie-screen idol in "Purple Rose of Cairo," and the sympathetic editor in "Heartburn." In this picture, he learns that a lark with a woman who carries handcuffs in her bag can easily turn into more than a randy financial adviser expected.  Mr. Daniels and Ms. Griffith work wonderfully well together -- two people who constantly lie about who they are and what they want. As Charley, the conservative tax consultant, Mr. Daniels has a pleasant, vacuous look; you expect him to nod and tell you to have a nice day. Ms. Griffith's Lulu picks him up when she sees him walk out of a coffee shop in executive gear -- without paying. She "kidnaps" him, and before he's able to register what's happening, she's got him handcuffed to a bed in a sleazy motel room and is smearing his face with lipsticky kisses. With his face all red, he looks beat up -- and in a way, he has been.
