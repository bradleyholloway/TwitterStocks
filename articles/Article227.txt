KEYSER, W.Va., Aug. 11â€” An explosion ripped through a rocket propellant laboratory along the Potomac River late yesterday, scattering debris more than 1,000 feet and leaving no trace of two workers apparently killed in the blast, officials said.  A large crater was left where the wooden laboratory had stood. The concussion was felt seven miles away. It was the third fatal explosion in 20 years at the Navy Ordnance System Commands Allegany Ballistics Laboratory, a sprawling complex in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle. The center is operated by Hercules Inc. under a Navy contract.  The authorities could find no remains of Charles W. Folk, 26 years old, of Mount Savage, Md., and Bruce LeGeer, 25, of Cumberland, Md.
