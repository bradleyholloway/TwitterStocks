 Some On-Line Users Have Gotten Hooked And Caught in Net --- Snickers, Jokes Are Subsiding As Medical Circles Take Serious Look at Affliction   By Strassel, Kimberley A, The Wall Street Journal,  May 24, 1996  "It just kept getting worse and worse. He'd created a new world for himself on the Internet," Maureen Stadleman, his mother, says. "He lived in his bedroom, stayed up all night, and I couldn't physically get him out of bed in the morning. He became violent -- broke things and screamed all the time. He quit everything that was real in life."  Interneters Anonymous, modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous, jokingly requires Net addicts to "surrender their will, lives and mouse pads to the almighty Webmaster" and "promise never to make payments to America Online, CompuServe or the Microsoft Network." Netaholics Anonymous, another satirical group, has compiled a list to tell if you're hooked: "Your phone bill comes to your doorstep in a box," for example.  "Many people sought treatment and their doctors simply laughed at them," she says. "The doctors were saying, `Just turn off the computer.' But that's like saying to an alcoholic, `Just stop drinking.'"
