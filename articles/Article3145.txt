 El Paso, Williams Post Steep Losses For First Quarter   By By Russell Gold, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2003  With a scarcity of buyers interested in acquiring energy-trading activities, companies like El Paso have resorted to unwinding their contractual positions. El Paso continued to hold 27,000 trading positions at the end of the first quarter, down 33% from the fourth quarter, said Dwight Scott, chief financial officer. The operations generated a loss for El Paso of $186 million in the quarter.  The other executives leaving El Paso are Greg Jenkins, president of El Paso's petroleum and liquified natural-gas business, and Clark Smith, president of its trading operations. The responsibilities of these positions will be assumed by other executives, according to the company.
