 Gifts: Apple for the Teacher? Today, It's Biscotti or Spa Socks   By By Emily Nelson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1998  In Weston, Conn., Marilyn Harbage purchased potpourri, a calendar, a large candle in a gold-trimmed glass dish, and "spa socks" (with bows and rubber soles so they can be worn at the gym) for her 10-year-old son's teachers at Fairfield Country Day School. Last year, Zachary Harbage gave his homeroom teacher a fleece scarf with teddy bears on it.  Susan Efron, in Larchmont, N.Y., is giving decks of holiday playing cards for about $25 from Tiffany & Co. to the four teachers at the public elementary school who teach her nine-year-old son, Alex, and 11-year-old daughter, Sara. For Sara's English teacher, Ms. Efron bought a silver boomark at the Museum of Modern Art gift store. Last year, she gave her kids' teachers Zagat restaurant guides.  In Dallas, at the private Lamplighter School, the family handbook contains this admonition about gifts to faculty and staff: "The school asks that parents not present valuable gifts to faculty or staff members or individual gifts of cash. However, the desire of a student to show appreciation for a teacher should not be denied." Written by a committee of faculty, administrators and parents, the gift guidelines go on to describe the many funds at the school that welcome donations in a teacher's name. To give gift-givers publicity, the school publishes a "gifts album," listing parents who contribute and the teachers they honor.
