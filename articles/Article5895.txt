 Tossup in Presidential Election, Economic Data Indicating Slowdown Help Generate Bond Buying   By By Gregory Zuckerman and Steven Vames, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 10, 2000  That caused Treasurys to jump and stock prices to fall sharply, on the logic that Mr. [Al Gore]'s policies could hurt some business but also could lead to more aggressive debt buybacks, which is supportive for bonds, said John Santoro, director of fixed-income trading at SG Cowen in New York.  News that the economy may be slowing more rapidly than expected, and that inflation remains tame, also helped Treasurys. The Labor Department reported that the producer-price index for finished goods rose 0.4% after rising 0.9% in September. When volatile food and energy items are excluded, prices declined for the first time since January, falling 0.1% amid the biggest drop in passenger-car prices in a decade. Both of the index's main components were off of analysts' expectation of a 0.1% gain in both the overall and core PPI figures.  Following the PPI report's release at 8:30 a.m EST, Treasurys prices rose modestly. While the report wasn't seen as changing interest-rate expectations, the indication that the U.S. economy is moderating was clearly a balm for a market rattled by the energy-price driven gains in the PPI reported last month, market participants said.
