 Workspaces   By By Jason Allen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 10, 2002  What you see: A sea lover. This chairman, chief executive and weekend captain has decorated his office with antique nautical objects. The oldest item -- and certainly the biggest -- is the boat docked next to his desk. "It was so big, it was hard to keep in the house. My wife suggested it would be nice in my office," says the 70-year-old head of executive-search firm Directorship Search Group. The boat, five feet long and five feet high, is a 112-year-old working model of a schooner. The portrayal is so detailed, it even comes with a lifeboat with teeny paddles ready on deck. All the visible ropes and pulleys are fully functional. In 1890, it may have been taken down to a local pond where children would have raced it against others like it.
