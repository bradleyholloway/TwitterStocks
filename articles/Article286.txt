LLOYD CARR will coach Michigan's football team for the 1995 season, it was announced yesterday. Carr, who had been an assistant head coach and is starting his 16th year with the Wolverines, was appointed interim coach earlier this month when GARY MOELLER resigned after a drunken confrontation with the police. Athletic Director JOE ROBERSON said the move will allow him to search at a more leisurely pace for a permanent replacement and give players some stability.  Michigan is coming off back-to-back 8-4 seasons. (AP)  To see the full article, subscribe here.
