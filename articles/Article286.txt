Dr. David Hunter Hubel knew he had been proposed for the Nobel Prize in past years, but was still surprised and thrilled at the award yesterday.  ''There has been so much exciting work going on in the field,'' he said. ''It's kind of a lottery.'' He was in the shower at his home in Waban, Mass., when the news came.  He was born in Windsor, Ontario, in 1926 and received his bachelor's of science in 1947 and medical degree in 1951 from McGill University in Montreal. After worki ng at the Montreal Neurological Institute, Johns HopkinsUniversity an d the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, he moved to Harvard Un iversity Medical School in 1959 as an associate in neurophysiolo gy and neuropharmacology.  He became a United States citizen in 1953. In 1965, he was appointed professor of physiology at Harvard and has been the George Packer Berry professor of neurobiology since 1968. 57 American Nobel Winners  Dr. Hubel and his co-prize winner, Dr. Roger W. Sperry, were the 56th and 57th American citizens to win a Nobel Prize. Dr. Hubel's career and that of the third co-prize winner, Dr. Torsten N. Wiesel, have been intertwined since t hey were post doctoral fellows at Johns Hopkins in the late 1950's.  In 1959 they went together to Harvard with a senior professor, the late Dr. Stephen W. Kuffler, and Harvard Medical School built its young department of neurobiology around them.  The man who brought them to Harvard was Dr. George Packer Berry, then dean of the medical school, who retired in 1966. ''I remember that Dr. Kuffler had these two young assistants,'' Dr. Berry said in a telephone interview today. ''They had already been collaborators for several years and they were like identical twins.''  Dr. Hubel was married in 1953 to the former Shirley Ruth Izzard. They have three children: Carl Andrew, Eric David and Paul Matthew.
