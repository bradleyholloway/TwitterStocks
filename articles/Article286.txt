 Telecom-Olivetti Match Redraws Merger Map --- U.S. Carriers Are Expected To Play a Bigger Role As Europe Consolidates   By By Gautam Naik and William Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  May 25, 1999  Deutsche Telekom AG has suddenly been cast as a loser now that its hoped-for merger with Telecom Italia seems dead and its valued partnership with France Telecom SA is on the skids. Just as suddenly, Olivetti's move has made a German industrial company, Mannesmann AG, the second-biggest phone carrier in Italy with the acquisition of Olivetti's stakes in two Telecom Italia rivals.  Deutsche Telekom, by signaling its willingness to do a deal through its bid for Telecom Italia, may now become an acquisition target, bankers say. At the very least, it will have to find a new partner. Its former ally, France Telecom, will have to do the same. The French company is seeking damages of as much as several billion euros, saying that the proposal for a German-Italian union violated a longstanding partnership between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom disagrees with the charge.  In the longer term, Olivetti's win is sure to spur other mergers and acquisitions. Many U.S. carriers don't want to be left behind. SBC Communications Inc., for example, is buying Ameritech Corp., the biggest American investor in Europe's $170 billion-a-year phone market, with interests in Denmark, Belgium, Hungary and elsewhere. "We do have to figure out a way to leverage that footprint" and create a more potent presence in Europe, said Donald Kiernan, chief financial officer of SBC, in a recent interview. SBC isn't ruling out other Europe-related acquisitions. "We don't have any trans-Atlantic capacity," said Mr. Kiernan. "Linking the U.S. and Europe is our No. 1 priority."
