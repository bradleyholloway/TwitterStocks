 Philips Net Rises, But Year Targets Appear Clouded   By Knapen, Joon, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2004  Profit also was lifted by 251 million euros in net income from LG Philips LCD, its liquid-crystal-display joint venture with LG Electronics Inc. of South Korea, and by a 99 million euros gain on a license agreement between Microsoft Corp. and Philips's InterTrust Technologies Corp. venture. Pricing for an initial public offering of LG Philips LCD shares is slated for this week.  "This is a clear disappointment, and casts doubt whether or not Philips can deliver on its promise of a 14% Ebita margin in 2004," said Peter Olofsen, an analyst at Stroeve. Philips, nevertheless, repeated the target for the unit in 2004, citing a 15% increase in orders in the second quarter.
