 Plaintiffs Lawyers Take Aim at Democracy   By By Walter K. Olson, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 21, 2000  In a brute triumph for litigation force and a grim setback for democratic governance, the Clinton administration and lawyers for city governments last week bullied the nation's largest gun maker, Smith & Wesson, into agreeing to a variety of controls on the distribution of its products that the administration hadn't been able to obtain through the normal workings of legislation. Glock and other gun makers appear likely to follow.  With quaint if unintended humor, reporters describe Smith & Wesson's capitulation as "voluntary." In exchange for knuckling under to a long list of demands, which include the adoption of external trigger locks, the development of "smart gun" technology within three years, and extensive controls on the marketing of its products, Smith & Wesson was spared the threat of a direct federal lawsuit and promised a settlement of some of the 30-odd suits filed against it by municipalities. The sheer cost of legal defense against these suits, whatever their outcome, had grown ruinous: a company statement said the deal was aimed at preserving the "viability of Smith & Wesson as an ongoing business entity in the face of the crippling cost of litigation."  Using the deliberate infliction of litigation costs to obtain leverage over an opponent was once considered a breach of legal ethics, but times have changed. Litigators boasted that their attacks would bleed the thinly capitalized gun industry into submission. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo warned gun makers that unless they cooperated they'd suffer "death by a thousand cuts." Several makers have in fact gone bankrupt since the courtroom siege began.
