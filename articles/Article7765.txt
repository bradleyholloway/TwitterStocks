 Venezuela, in a Policy Switch, Will Seek At Least $2 Billion in New Bank Loans   By By Roger Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 7, 1988  CARACAS, Venezuela -- One of Latin America's most-compliant debtors, Venezuela, will seek new terms for payment of its $30-billion foreign-bank debt, a move that seems certain to create tensions with international creditors.  Finance Minister Hector Hurtado Navarro said in an interview the country has decided to seek "not less than two billion dollars" in new foreign bank loans because of mounting balance-of-payments problems. Such a demand would constitute a radical departure for Venezuela, which has repaid both interest and principal without seeking new money from banks since the international debt crisis broke in 1982, though it has reduced the size of its principal payments.  "It is impossible that Venezuela go on paying unless creditors recycle part of our payments," Mr. Perez said in an interview. Describing the IMF as a vehicle for "economic totalitarianism," he said Latin America's fourth-largest debtor had got "absolutely nothing" from paying interest as well as principal. He said there would have been a military coup in Peru if President Alan Garcia in 1985 hadn't declared a ceiling on interest payments of 10% of export revenue. Future Venezuelan payments, he declared in language reminiscent of Mr. Garcia's, would have to be linked to "our export earnings, new credits and reasonable interest rates."
