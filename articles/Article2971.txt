 Winter Olympics 2002: On the Nevada Fringes, Looking for Olympic Geld --- The Hacienda (Legally) Markets Games Specials; Fun Visit From the Feds   By By Jim Carlton, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2002  Ms. [Cummins] is all business when it comes to talking about the Olympics. One of her first inklings that the Games could provide a spillover came, she says, when she was visited by a pre-Olympic delegation from a certain Eastern European country last summer. Even she recognized a transportation hurdle -- 180 miles is an Olympian distance to travel. Hence, while many Nevada brothel owners don't like to talk about their business and don't advertise at all, she decided a major Olympics marketing push was in order.  The great thing about Nevada's brothels being legal is that if you want to find out stuff about them, the easiest thing to do is to go straight to the police. Nobody's trying to cover up anything. So we wandered into the Elko County Sheriff's Department, on whose watch are two of the aforementioned businesses, Bella's Hacienda Ranch and Donna's Ranch. They sit side-by-side on a dirt road dirt just outside this pop. 1,000 Interstate 80 town whose motto could be: "You Don't Have to be Lonesome Here!"
