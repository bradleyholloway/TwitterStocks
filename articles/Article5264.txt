 Letters to the Editor: America's Fictional Self-Image   The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 1991  Arthur Schlesinger worries about too much American cultural fragmentation because of ethnic and racial labeling ("Toward a Divisive Diversity," editorial page, June 25). I agree with him that such labeling needs to be minimized, but I don't agree such labeling is inherently minimized by de-emphasizing the historical contributions of "nonwhites" in deference to the contributions of those who see themselves as white.  It is because we live in a nation so insistent on defining its self-image according to yet-to-be-realized ideals of democracy and true freedom that we desperately need curricular reform. Our addiction to that fictional self-image is demonstrated, for example, by our insistence on holding a series of self-congratulatory parades in the wake of our "victory" in the Persian Gulf. Our government encouraged the Kurds to seek the same freedom and democracy the parades champion, only to ignore their liberation struggle after we accomplished our true purpose -- restoring the free flow of oil. The fictional American self-image also keeps us from thinking too much about the fact that Kuwait, the nation we supposedly freed, remains a monarchy.  For example, if history texts were rewritten to include a chapter on miscegenation as it occurred under American slavery, people might understand the extent to which blacks and whites in America are connected, rather than separated. Greater emphasis should be placed on the other dehumanizing aspects of slavery as well, granting that institution at least as much space as historians devote to the conflict that ended slavery. We could benefit from a more detailed history of Reconstruction, and the vicious tyranny of the Jim Crow laws that followed. Maybe then Americans would appreciate why African-Americans as a group have had such a difficult time unifying as the singular people the nation insists upon seeing us to be.
