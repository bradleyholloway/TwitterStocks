 Elton John's Treasure Trove Rocks British Art World   By By Claire Clifton, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 1988  London -- The amazing Elton John Collection goes under the hammer at Sotheby's here, in a four-day auction that starts tonight. The public already has had an ample look, first at the Victoria and Albert Museum and just now at Sotheby's. It is the liveliest show in town and a real crowd-pleaser.  Elton Hercules John was born on March 25, 1947, and christened Reginald Kenneth Dwight. He attended Pinner County Grammar School and the Royal Academy of Music in London. His entry in "Who's Who" is mostly taken up with a long list of his hit songs (all of his albums made gold). His first big one was "Empty Sky" in 1969, and his American tour in 1970 made him an overnight success in the New World. He also was a major pack rat, but very successful at that too.  Specialist dealers, such as Irina Laski, who with her partner John Jesse were pioneers selling art nouveau and art deco in London, say they sell to the establishment now and no longer are avant-garde. She adds that prices have soared in the past 18 months. Ms. Laski thinks a comparable field to explore now, for someone with Elton John's foresight and money, "might be modern British paintings," but also says "there are no areas that are ignored. Everyone thought it was going to be objects from the '50s, but they are very expensive, especially glass. But everything will go up. It's all relative."
