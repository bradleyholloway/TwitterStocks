 Inside track: AT&T officials hang up on some stock   By O Brian, Bridget, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 1995  Some of the architects of AT&T Corp's breakup have sold some of their holdings in the telecommunications giant. Seven senior executives exercised options for 281,403 shares between late Oct 1995 and early November. The transactions, which have a value of $17.6 million, occurred some weeks after AT&T said it plans to split into three separate, publicly traded companies.
