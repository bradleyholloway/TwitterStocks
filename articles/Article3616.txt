 PURSUITS; Picks -- Online: Music; At new Web store, many songs sell for a few cents   By Jamin, Warren, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2006  Amie Street, a recently launched music Web site that carries independent -- and mostly little-known -- artists, is trying an unusual model for selling music. Instead of selling songs at one fixed price, the site determines prices for songs based on how frequently they're downloaded. Newly submitted tracks are free when they're added and then rise in price as people download them; after about 130 buys, they reach the site's maximum price of 98 cents. Many songs on the site are currently priced at six cents or less.
