 Looking Back, Persistence Is the Lesson   By Badal, Jaclyne, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2007  A diversified portfolio that considers an investor's time horizon -- getting more conservative as the need for cash draws nearer -- was crucial to weathering the 1987 crash and the volatility experienced this summer. These days, small investors can easily get an age- appropriate asset allocation by buying "lifecycle" or "target-date" mutual funds that become more conservative over time.  In 1987, the strategy du jour was "portfolio insurance," meant to give institutional investors a shot at big gains while limiting downside risk. But the strategy, which had never been tested in a crash, broke down, and investors who had cavalierly taken on extra risk because they had "insurance" suffered major losses.  Investing comes with risks, and investors should be leery about dumping money into a strategy that hasn't been tested and that they don't understand, says B. Anthony Weber, chief investment officer at Veredus Asset Management in Louisville, Ky. "There are no perfect hedges," Mr. Weber says.
