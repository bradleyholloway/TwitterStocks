 Where's the Port in This Rough Market?   By Zuckerman, Gregory, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 2007  In fact, there is evidence that global investments are more "correlated" than ever before, making it hard to find shelter when broad U.S. stock-market gauges tumble.  Since July 19, when the Dow benchmark closed at a record 14000, stocks of companies in so-called emerging markets, such as Brazil, have dropped 5.7%, according to a Dow Jones Wilshire index.That's right in line with the 5.8% loss for the Dow, the home of some of the strongest U.S. stocks. Small U.S. stocks have fallen even harder, with the Russell 2000 off 11%. Even gold showed some weakness, dropping 0.7% in the period.  As is typical in a "flight to safety," some investors have sought shelter in U.S. Treasury obligations, pushing their yields down and prices up. (See "Stat of the Week" for more on bonds.) And many ordinary investors took comfort in having some of their dollars stashed in low-risk income holdings such as bank certificates of deposit and money-market mutual funds.
