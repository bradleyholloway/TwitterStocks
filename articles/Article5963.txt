 Letters to the Editor: Vegan Diets Aren't For Poverty-Stricken   The Wall Street Journal,  May 10, 2001  Ms. [Kathy Guillermo] went on to note that "cutting back on meat production by a mere 10% would free up enough grains and vegetables to feed 60 million starving people." First, that Harvard study was discussing corn-fattened beef, not the chicken that is under discussion here. Second, while I am sure Ms. Guillermo is a vegan, most people are not nor do they wish to be. Finally, there are well-documented problems with vegan diets related to lower amounts of protein, amino acids, iron, vitamins B-12 and D, and various enzymes.
