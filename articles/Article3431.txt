 Business and Finance   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2005  MORGAN STANLEY'S CEO agreed to step down in the face of rising opposition, the departure of top executives and employees and other setbacks for the investment bank. Philip Purcell said he would retire as soon as a successor is named, walking away with an estimated $62.3 million. Morgan Stanley directors could face surprisingly slim pickings in their search for a new chief.  Morgan Stanley's board may look at selling some pieces of the financial "supermarket" that Purcell had fought to keep intact.  Deutsche Bank's CEO said he may be interested in a takeover in or outside Germany, in the wake of UniCredito's planned HVB deal.
