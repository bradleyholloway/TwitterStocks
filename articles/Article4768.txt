 The Hearings: What if Congress Hadn't Vacillated?   The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 1987  Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.): I have studied the checkered career of assistance to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua. In 1982, Congress authorized and appropriated $24 million. In 1983, we increased that to $27 million, but we restricted it to humanitarian assistance only, no military aid. In 1984, zero, no humanitarian, no military. In 1985, zero for military, but then when we got to September '85 to March '86 we authorized and appropriated $27 million for humanitarian only and a limited amount of information sharing. Then in '86 for fiscal '87, $100 million for humanitarian and military, but of course that got delayed by the speaker of the House until the last, waning moment of the session. Now 1987, this year, I think the smart money is on another big fat zero.  I've been involved with foreign policy for more than 25 years as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and from that perspective, I think a great deal of blame for this foreign-policy foul-up rests right at the doorstop of Congress. Over those years, as everyone knows, there has been a great change in the constitutional role of Congress in making foreign policy. Since Vietnam, Congress likes to boast that it's been an equal partner with the president in shaping foreign policy. Well, I think Congress ought to shoulder the blame for an on-again, off-again Nicaraguan policy. President Reagan, who still carries the burden of making foreign policy, must deal almost daily with 535 secretaries of state in the House and Senate who seldom can form a simple majority around a single issue.
