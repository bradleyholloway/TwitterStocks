 U.N. Rightly Imposed Sanctions on Terrorists   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 2006  Mr. [David Crawford] is also wrong in stating that the Security Council does not debate designations. In fact, they are debated extensively, usually over a period of many months. By way of example, we approved sanctions for Saad al-Fagih, a known associate of Osama bin Laden, Abdelghani Mzoudi, a member of the Hamburg cell that planned 9/11, and Mamoun Darkazanli, a known al Qaeda financier. These are the same three people Mr. Crawford cites to prove the system is broken. I believe they prove the system is working. Mr. Crawford would have known these facts if he had called the U.S. Mission to the U.N. to ask. But he didn't.
