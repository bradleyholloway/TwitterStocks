 Golden Nugget Bid For Hilton Stake Hits Another Snag   By By Bill Johnson, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 1985  The co-executor of the estate of Conrad N. Hilton called "inadequate" Golden Nugget Inc.'s $72-a-share offer to buy the 6.8 million shares of Hilton Hotels Corp. common stock that the estate holds.  The response by Los Angeles attorney James E. Bates is a setback to the plan outlined Wednesday by Stephen A. Wynn, Golden Nugget chairman, president and chief executive officer, eventually to buy all the Hilton stock. As previously reported, Mr. Wynn said he hoped to enlist Mr. Bates's support in buying the estate's 27.4% block of Hilton. With that stock in hand, Mr. Wynn said, Golden Nugget would make a similar offer for the rest of Hilton's 24.7 million shares outstanding. Purchasing all the stock would cost about $1.78 billion.  It wasn't immediately clear what effect Mr. Bates's negative response would have on Golden Nugget's offer. Golden Nugget spokesman Bruce Levin said neither Mr. Wynn nor the company had received Mr. Bates's letter.
