One of them calls itself "anticapitalist" and believes the company should be renationalized. The deal survived when one union, Force Ouvriere, supported it, on condition that it last 10 years and be written into law. "We thought that if we didn't negotiate to get the best deal possible then, we'd end up with mass layoffs being forced on us later," said Pascal Courtin, a leader at Force Ouvriere.  The euphoria didn't last. France Telecom couldn't pay for acquisitions with its own shares because the government didn't want to lose control over the dilution of its stake. (The government still owns slightly less than a third of the company.) Instead, France Telecom racked up 70 billion euros in debt. France's telecom market was opened to competition, allowing consumers to choose among multiple mobile-phone and fixed-line operators for the first time.  The pair worked on a business plan for several months. "You can't confuse profits with revenues," said Mr. [Francois Thibault]. "That's something I learned from Thierry."
