 Barron's Insight: Big Bertha Club's Maker Might Be Worth a Swing   By Strauss, Lawrence C, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 2004  Callaway, whose Big Bertha driver revolutionized the business in the early 1990s, now finds itself in the No. 2 spot in the important woods category, behind the TaylorMade unit of Germany's Adidas-Salomon.

Alexander Paris, of Barrington Research in Chicago, rates Callaway stock "market perform" but says that over the longer term it's probably worth more than the current price: "It's selling at pretty close to book value, with no debt, [and] it's got very strong free- cash-flow generation."
