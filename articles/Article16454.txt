 Executive Ranks See Surge in New Hires, Openings; After Long Freeze in Top Jobs, Recovery Helps Open Doors; Search Firms Reap Benefits   By Kris Maher and Erin White, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2004  Office Depot Inc., the office-supplies retailer, said yesterday it's seeking a new chairman and chief executive after CEO Bruce Nelson resigned "by mutual agreement." Playtex Products Inc. yesterday named Neil P. DeFeo president, CEO and a director of the personal-care and consumer-products company; he stepped down last year as president and CEO of Remington Products Co. Gymboree Corp. is seeking a chief operating officer, a new post at the clothing retailer.  "Everyone's been bootstrapping for the last several years in retail," says Lisa Harper, chairman and CEO of the Burlingame, Calif.- based retailer. "We really need to add some additional operational support." Gymboree is still looking for a chief operating officer.  "People in their late fifties are saying, 'You know what, I'm going to opt out now or find my replacement,' " says Bert Hensley, chairman and CEO of Morgan Samuels Co., a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based executive-search firm. "I've never seen this happen before" to this extent as companies focus more on succession planning, he adds.
