 Mark Everett's Painful, Revelatory Music   By By Jim Fusilli, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 12, 2003  Mark Oliver Everett, who's better known as E, leader of the band Eels, is baring his soul again, this time on his ninth album, "Shootenanny!" (DreamWorks). Mr. Everett's customary awkward eloquence is in ample supply on its 13 tracks, but never before has he brought so much fire to his music. It's his best work, which is saying something: Previous Eels albums such as "Electro-Shock Blues" and "Beautiful Freak" were among the finest rock recordings of the '90s.  Most of "Shootenanny!" was recorded in a hectic 10-day stretch, with many of the tracks performed live by Mr. Everett with bandmates and visiting musicians. (On previous Eels recordings, he played most of the music himself.) Accordingly, there's a rough, jagged edge to several cuts, including "All in a Day's Work," the disc's bluesy opener, and two finely crafted pop tunes, "Lone Wolf" and "Rock Hard Times." But "Shootenanny!" also is rich with the gentle, offbeat ballads for which Mr. Everett is best known, in which his thin, reedy voice wafts over a single electric guitar or what sounds like a toy piano.  Recognition has come gradually to Mr. Everett, whose first album was issued in 1992. His songs have appeared in films such as "American Beauty," "The End of Violence" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." He was recently filmed by Wim Wenders for Martin Scorsese's forthcoming PBS documentary on the blues; Mr. Everett performed a Skip James song on pipe organ. And his delicate score graced the recent film "Levity," the soundtrack to which Mr. Everett said is "the album of mine I'd most like to listen to."
