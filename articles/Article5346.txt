 Was AAA Too Fast When Writing Up `Speed-Trap' Towns? --- Angry Residents and Police Say Auto Club's Research Was Unfair -- and Wrong   By Binkley, Christina, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 10, 1996  Residents object that the AAA isn't considering the towns' safety. "I know this isn't much of a town to some people, but you'd think people could appreciate" the need to protect residents, says Sandy Tomlinson, president of the Lawtey Parent-Teacher Organization.  Further, Mr. [Randy Bly], a former police officer in Pinellas County, says he hasn't calculated what percentage of the towns' tickets were issued to out-of-town drivers. Nor does he know how many cars on the highway come from out of town. "We just needed to get a very general idea of what was going on out there," he reasons. He says he came to his conclusion by leafing through the towns' courthouse records on traffic and noting the general trend. Adds Ms. [Cynthia Sharpe], "It's an observational thing."  "If a police officer isn't writing tickets, he's not doing his job," says Capt. [Richard Cates], who is the Lawtey police department's leading ticket-issuer. "There are officers who don't write two tickets a year. With 50,000 people being killed a year [on U.S. roads], I don't think it's right."
