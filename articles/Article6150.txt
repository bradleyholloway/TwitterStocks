 Review / Toys: She Builds Her Own R2D2---Phew!   By By Kate Flatley, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 11, 1998  My first thought when I looked at my new Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System was "Cool! This is going to be great!" When I opened the box, however, and saw the 727 Lego blocks for the basic system and the 149 pieces for my Extreme Creatures expansion set my second thought was, well, something unprintable in this newspaper.  The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System is a new product line from Lego created in cooperation with MIT. What it does, according to my now well-worn User Guide, is let kids (ages 12 and up) "design and program real robots that move, act and think on their own" using a PC and an RCX Lego microcomputer, which functions as the "brain" of the creation. Teen inventors program the microcomputer using an easy-to-handle programming language called RCX Code.  It may have been designed for kids, but, as reported in The Wall Street Journal's Marketplace section yesterday, Lego is finding that nearly half of those playing with the sets (of which it expects to sell 80,000 this year in the U.S.) are grown-ups. Being both a grown-up and a former teen, I tried out the RIS to see just whom it would suit. I was more than a little intimidated by the project: Building things with Legos has never been my forte -- that was always my brother Brian's area of expertise. But pride dictated that if 12-year-olds could handle it, I could.
