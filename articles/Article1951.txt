 For Industrial Recruiters, The Key Word Is `Power'   By By Ken Gepfert, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1994  "We need a lot of power" to run a steel plant, explains Ken Iverson, chief executive of Charlotte-based Nucor. A difference of only 1/100th of a penny per kilowatt-hour translates to $750,000 in annual power costs for the planned 150-megawatt, electricity-fired steel plant.  Nucor's preoccupation with power costs is far from unique. Southeastern industrial recruiters are increasingly turning to electricity rates to gain an edge over neighboring states. Leading the charge: the region's largest utilities, which are urging regulators to permit a variety of flexible, discounted rates for large industrial customers.  Late last month, the North Carolina Utilities Commission gave Duke permission to offer discounts of as much as 20% to large customers that locate or expand in the state, provided they meet minimum requirements for power usage, investment and new jobs. South Carolina regulators approved a similar Duke plan in August.
