A postage stamp honoring Jackie Robinson, who 35 years ago became the first black player in major league baseball, was introduced yesterday at a ceremony in Manhattan.  The commemorative stamp, a head-and-shoulders portrait of Robinson behind a scene depicting him sliding into home plate, is the fifth in the Black Heritage USA Series.  It will be issued Aug. 2 in Cooperstown, N.Y., the site of baseball's Hall of Fame. Previously released stamps in the series honored Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King Jr., Benjamin Banneker and Whitney M. Young Jr.  ''Because of Jackie Robinson, anything we want in life is possible,'' Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, a college friend of Robinson, said at yesterday's ceremony. The Mayor said that when he and Robinson attended U.C.L.A., ''we could not dream someday that blacks would be holding positions of great importance in this country.''  Robinson retired from baseball in 1956 and died in 1972.  Illustrations: photo of Jackie Robinson
