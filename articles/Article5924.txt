 Taste: Wow! Not Again! --- You open the Times; You see "Writers on Writing;" You want to die   By By Nicholas von Hoffman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 9, 2001  Though denying that he suffers from this disorder, Mr. [David Leavitt] tells us that as a child he had "a fascination with telephones." And then he tells us that "another [Asperger]-like obsession from those days was with Playboy magazine, which I obliged my mother to buy me each month less to satisfy some nascent erotic curiosity than because I so appreciated the reliability of the magazine's monthly features." Of course the magazine's most reliable monthly feature was and still is to be found on the centerfold. At least one of Mr. Leavitt's readers would like to know exactly how he talked his mother into making this monthly purchase.  Mr. [Carl Hiaasen] intends to go for the funny bone, but there are some WOW writers who may not be wholly aware of the jocose striations embedded in their musings. Susan Sontag, a one-of-a-kind star in the Manhattan firmament, writes this about writing: "Let's say it's a mess. But you have a chance to fix it. You try to be clearer. Or deeper. Or more eloquent. Or more eccentric. . . . Writing is finally a series of permissions you give yourself to be expressive in certain ways. To invent. To leap. To fly. To fall."  [Annie Proulx] is matched in energy by Louise Erdrich, who is trying to master Ojibwemowin, the language of her Chippewa ancestors. "My English is jealous," she writes, "my Ojibwe elusive. Like a besieged unfaithful lover, I'm trying to appease them both." And it just might be possible! To engage Ojibwemowin is "to engage the spirit," she claims, so it is likely that her English will "forgive" her.
