 Long & Short: Microsoft Can Count; Intel Can't [1]  By Eisinger, Jesse, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2004  That was the number of congressmen who voted for the Baker Bill, a measure that damages efforts of the Financial Accounting Standards Board to enact rules mandating the expensing of stock options. The bill violates FASB's independence and fights the inevitable. Hundreds of companies have moved to voluntarily expense stock options because compensation costs companies money -- no matter what Silicon Valley will have Congress believe.  Warren Buffett rightly has said that if the bill becomes law it "could cause the mathematical lunacy record to move east from Indiana." That's where, famously -- and perhaps apocryphally -- the Indiana state legislature voted to simplify the value of Pi to 3.2 to make the life of schoolchildren easier.  These delaying tactics won't succeed. The Senate is highly unlikely to let the Baker Bill become law. And investors are figuring out for themselves the pernicious dilutive effects of stock options. In the coming years, investors will gravitate to those tech companies that take the right path. And Microsoft will be at the top of that list.
