 Train Pulls Out On New Corner Of Debt Market; Auction-Rate Securities Failing to Draw Bidders; A Toll on Port Authority   By Liz Rappaport and Craig Karmin, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 14, 2008  The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's interest rate jumped Tuesday to 20% from about 4.2% when bidders didn't show up at an auction of its securities by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. For the next week at least -- until the rate is reset again in the next auction -- the Port Authority, which oversees New York-area transportation facilities such as bridges and tunnels, will have to pay close to $390,000 in interest payments to holders of the securities. In a sign of the headaches this can cause for holders of these instruments -- which include many corporate treasurers -- US Airways Group Inc.revealed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the airline's cash fund of $3.13 billion had $411 million of "short-term investments in auction-rate securities which failed to settle at auctions."
