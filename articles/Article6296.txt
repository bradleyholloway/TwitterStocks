 Techs Rally Strongly, Blue Chips Wilt; Credence, Teradyne Are Among Gainers   By By Robert O'Brien, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 11, 2000  Semiconductor stocks paced the technology rise, as investors reacted favorably to fourth-quarter profit showings in the group. Credence Systems (Nasdaq), a maker of testing systems for chip-equipment makers, rose to 114 15/16, up 11 11/16, outstripping its previous 52-week high, after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings late Wednesday that blew past analysts' forecasts. Credit Suisse First Boston issued an upbeat research note on Credence, saying that even at current prices, the stock's valuation looks reasonable.  Chip-equipment stocks rallied, with Applied Materials (Nasdaq) ahead 11 1/64 to 174 3/4, and Novellus Systems (Nasdaq) ahead 6 1/2 to 59 3/4, while chip makers Broadcom (Nasdaq), ahead 12 1/16 to 349, and STMicroelectronics, which rose 5 15/16 to 215 1/8, also notched sharp gains.
