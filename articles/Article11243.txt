 Dun & Bradstreet Accused of Fraud In Five More Suits   By By Johnnie L. Roberts, The Wall Street Journal,  May 5, 1989  Five more Dun & Bradstreet Corp. customers accused the company in separate lawsuits of fraud by misleading them into overpurchasing credit-data services.  The complaints, filed in Superior Court in Union County, N.J., followed unsuccessful efforts to seek about $500,000 in refunds from the information concern. Among other things, the suits alleged that Dun & Bradstreet violated New Jersey's Customer Fraud Act. Each complaint seeks a separate trial and unspecified damages, which could be tripled under the fraud law. The headquarters of Dun & Bradstreet's credit services operations is in Union County.
