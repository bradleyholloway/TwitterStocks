 Tracking the Numbers / Outside Audit: KPMG Used Its Own Shelter on Tax Return   By Weil, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 14, 2005  The IRS added the strategy, called 401(k) Deduction Acceleration Strategy, or "401kAccel," to its published list of abusive transactions in June 2002. KPMG sold it to at least 143 companies, which together "claimed undisclosed millions in accelerated tax deductions," according to a July 2002 court filing by the IRS in connection with its probe into KPMG shelters.  The 2001 slide show was prepared by members of KPMG's compensation- and-benefits tax practice, which designed and sold 401kAccel. The presentation said 401kAccel promised "significant tax savings." But it also cited a downside. "Caveat: IRS may challenge strategy on assertion that it is a 'listed transaction.' "  Internal reports by the firm's comp-and-benefits group said Deloitte was KPMG's "only major competitor" on 401kAccel, although PricewaterhouseCoopers also offered a similar strategy. In an interview, Roger Page, Deloitte's vice chairman for tax, said Deloitte advised "substantially less than 50" companies to use its version of the strategy, beginning in mid-1997, before the IRS challenged it in 2002.
