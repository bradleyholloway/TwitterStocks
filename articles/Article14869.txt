 Sony May Be Staging A Fresh Talent Raid On Rival Warner --- Industry Reports Say Target Is Mark Canton, Friend Of Sony Unit's Chairman   By By Laura Landro, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 5, 1991  On Friday, spokesmen for both Columbia and Warner, a Time Warner Inc unit, denied industry reports that Mark Canton will leave Warner to join Columbia. Mr. Canton, who is executive vice president of world-wide production at Warner, is a close friend and longtime associate of Mr. Guber, chairman and chief executive of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and Mr. Peters, who recently left his post as cochairman to become a producer again, with his company based at Columbia.

Mr. Canton himself has made no secret of his disenchantment at Warner and his eagerness to join Columbia, several of his associates say. Mr. Canton referred a call on Friday to a Warner spokesman.
