 Letters to the Editor: Mixed Reviews on Hearings Drama   The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 7, 1987  Most of the coverage addressed social, political and military dimensions of the weapons and support activities to the Contras and the roles of various American organizers. But the media and in particular the Journal -- as the foremost voice of the business community -- did not address a key and non-controvertible issue. Regardless of which way your sympathies lie for the philosophy, attitudes and expectations of the principals under investigation, the business community must have disrespect for the organizing group's incredible lack of business systems, procedures and intelligence in the way the funds contributed and expended were booked, accounted for and allocated.  The Iran-Contra hearings really set the stage for the most disgraceful spectacle the American people have ever witnessed. I had to remind myself constantly that I was in America -- not Russia, China, Poland or behind the Berlin Wall, where political dissenters or prisoners are being constantly interrogated and harassed to admit to crimes they did not commit. John Nields could have been Stalin's chief prosecutor.  Col. North has become a media superstar, thereby gaining exemption from clear-sighted scrutiny. Oliver North is a master of distortion. He claims not to have used government funds to solicit aid for the Contras, but each time he made use of the National Security Council offices, equipment and staff for this end, he was using government funds. He was clearly not working on this project at home in his spare time. This is an obvious violation of the Boland amendment. He was even, indirectly, making a fund-raising pitch for the Contras during his testimony, which I found completely inappropriate.
