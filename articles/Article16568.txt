 Ford Unveils New Incentive Plan   By Stoll, John D, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2005  The program, which offers cash rebates as an alternative to cut-rate financing on many vehicles, replaces the employee-discount program that was discontinued Monday after three months. Ford spokesman Jim Cain said the company anticipates dropping 2005-model inventory to "basically nothing" by the time the new deal expires on Jan. 4.  A GM spokeswoman declined to comment yesterday on whether Ford's latest announcement would pressure GM to follow suit with new incentives. "I'm unaware of any expected announcement," said spokeswoman Deborah Silverman.
