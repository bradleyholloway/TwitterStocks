 AMA Asks Justice Agency to Challenge Aetna Purchase of Prudential Business   By By Nancy Ann Jeffrey, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1998  In a letter to the Justice Department's antitrust division, the AMA expressed concern about the market-power effect of the transaction on the health-care system, physicians and patients. Aetna, of Hartford, Conn., announced this month that it had agreed to buy the health-care unit of Prudential, based in Newark, N.J.  The AMA letter, which stopped short of explicitly saying the AMA opposed the deal, marked the first time the association of 270,000 members has ever taken such an action over a proposed health-care merger, AMA officials said. The move reflects the animosity many doctors have come to feel toward Aetna as it has become an increasingly powerful health-care player in many markets.
