 Debt Reduction In Telecom Area May Hurt Stocks   By By Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 10, 2001  "If there is one theme in the filing associated with Lucent's convertible preferred offer, it is that the banks are definitely going to get whatever there is to be gotten out of this company," says Carol Levenson of GimmeCredit.com in Chicago, a debt-research firm. "Bondholders, hybrid-securities holders and of course equity holders have lengthier, more junior and less certain payback horizons."  One covenant of the new agreement bars Lucent from cash dividend payouts to shareholders until certain conditions are met. Moreover, some of the strong demand for the convertible securities -- an issue of about $1 billion initially was planned -- has come from hedge funds, according to analysts. These investment pools for institutions and wealthy individuals want them because they serve as a hedge for short positions in the common shares. Analysts also note that the hedge funds were attracted by relatively generous terms: Investors will receive an 8% annual payment, compared with 6% to 7% for comparable convertibles, and its conversion premium of 22% is less than the 27% or more that others carry.  Mark Altherr, a director in the fixed-income division of Credit Suisse First Boston, notes that Lucent's bonds rallied when the convertible offering was done "because it showed that Lucent could still access capital." But he believes the debt "trades way too well for a company with its low double-B rating. There is huge downside risk. Both the bonds and the equity are priced too optimistically. The market is giving [Lucent] credit for a turnaround when there is no evidence that turnaround is happening." He also concludes, "The best place to be is the bank debt."
