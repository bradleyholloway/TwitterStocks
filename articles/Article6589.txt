 Politics & Economics: U.S. Shifts Uranium From Poland To a Secure Facility in Russia   By Fialka, John J, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 2006  Starting two years ago, the U.S. has initiated 14 shipments of Soviet reactor fuel back to Russia, involving more than 500 pounds of highly enriched uranium. "We just learned about this a couple of months ago," said Mr. [Bryan Wilkes], referring to the Polish reactor fuel, which had been in storage for years. As part of its agreements with Poland and other former Soviet satellites that have the fuel, the U.S. converts their research reactors to use low-enriched fuel, which doesn't pose a weapons threat.
