 Shopping Date: Limited Brands To Launch Coed Selling Areas   By By Shelly Branch, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 12, 2002  The nine new commercials are scheduled to air on network and cable stations, during episodes of shows including "ER" and "The West Wing," both of which air on General Electric's NBC, and such cable networks as Viacom's MTV. According to Bear Stearns estimates, Limited has traditionally spent the bulk of its advertising budget -- some 82%, or $115 million -- on Victoria's Secret, while keeping other brands in the closet. So far, Limited has committed about $10 million to the fall Express campaign, and will re-evaluate funding early next year.  For Limited, whose other stores include Limited and Bath & Body Works, the moves signal a break from the company's traditional selling and advertising formulas. Unlike competitors Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, which have long sold men's and women's apparel under the same roof, Limited Brands has always segregated its offerings.
