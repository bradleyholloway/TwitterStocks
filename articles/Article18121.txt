 Billie Jean and Jennifer: God Bless the Child   By Klein, Frederick C, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1990  New York -- Since last year's World Series I have refrained from making jocular references to earthquakes, but I could have sworn the stadium wobbled a bit here Friday when Linda Ferrando, the 82nd-ranked women's tennis player, defeated No. 3 Monica Seles in a third-round match at the U.S. Open. Women's tennis in recent years has been a decorous affair, with the common folks giving their betters their due, and then some.  At the least, Ferrando beating Seles was comparable to Kansas State beating Nebraska at football, and the upset remained an exception here. Thirteen of the 16 seeded ladies advanced in stately fashion to the fourth round, including numbers 1,2,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.  She continues as a honcho in the sport, serving as commissioner of a professional team tennis league that survives if not prospers, and a related, grassroots organization that has brought the joy of the game to thousands. She's a TV commentator, employed at the Open by the USA cable network. She helped coach Martina Navratilova to an unprecedented ninth Wimbledon singles title a couple months back. When Life magazine recently took it upon itself to choose the 100 "most influential" Americans of this century, she was one of four athletes to make the list, along with Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson and Babe Ruth.
