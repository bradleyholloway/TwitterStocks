 American Barrick Says 4th-Period Net Nearly Tripled   By By Larry M. Greenberg, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 5, 1993  Last year, the Toronto mining concern produced 1.3 million ounces of gold, with Goldstrike contributing 1.1 million ounces of this. Total company output is expected to rise to 1.5 million ounces this year, and then to 1.7 million ounces and two million ounces in the following two years, respectively. Robert Smith, American Barrick's president and chief operating officer, said that in order to continue increasing its production after 1995, the company will have to find large new reserves of gold ore. Production from the company's new Meikle mine in Nevada, due to open in 1996, will largely supplant existing reserves that are being depleted, he said.
