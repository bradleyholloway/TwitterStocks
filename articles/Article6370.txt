 Tenet Shareholders Re-Elect Chairman, Directors to Board, Thwarting Dissident   By By Rhonda L. Rundle, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 12, 2000  Two years ago, Tenet embarked on what Mr. [Jeffrey C. Barbakow] called a "back-to-basics" focus on operations. Tenet strengthened financial controls and improved its billing and collections processes. The company also revamped its management structure to shorten the chain of command for local hospital executives. Before those moves, Tenet's bad debt had started to rise as a result of a shift to more managed-care contracting. Also, federal payments for Medicare patients had been cut in 1997, putting financial pressure on all hospitals.
