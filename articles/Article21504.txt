 Seagate Technology to Unveil Products In Bid to Renew Disk-Drive Lines' Shine   By By G. Pascal Zachary and Paul B. Carroll, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 2, 1990  Seagate, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., was for much of the 1980s the dominant supplier of small hard-disk drives, which act as electronic file cabinets for personal computers. But in the past two years, Conner Peripherals Inc. and Quantum Corp. have raced past Seagate, grabbing rich contracts supplying drives to such major PC makers as Apple Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. The only big PC maker with which Seagate has a sizeable contract is International Business Machines Co., but its sales to Big Blue are stagnant, analysts said.  "Seagate waited too long to get behind new technologies," Doug van Dorsten, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said. The company pioneered PC drives in the 5 1/4-inch size, but was slow to grasp the importance of the trend toward 3 1/2-inch and 2 1/2-inch drives, Mr. van Dorsten said. PC makers prefer these smaller drives, because, by taking up less space and using less power, they help reduce the overall cost of making a PC.  Seagate's new products, which are expected to include improved 3 1/2-inch drives and the company's first 2 1/2-inch drives, should help it stay in the race with Conner and Quantum, the two fastest-growing companies in the computer industry. But it is unclear whether the new products will enable Seagate to win the contracts with PC makers that analysts said are critical to its future.
