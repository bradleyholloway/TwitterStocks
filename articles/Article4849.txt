 A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories   By By Selwyn Feinstein, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1988  Some smaller brokerage houses are interested in picking up seasoned talent; "we have openings and we're hiring in any area where we can find a good player," says Lawrence Silver, a vice president of Raymond James Financial Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. Hanley Dawson Cadillac, a Chicago auto dealer, has interviewed two former brokers and a trader and probably will hire one. Corcoran Group, a New York real-estate firm, is eager to take on a few hot sales people.  But Wall Street's newly unemployed needn't bother to knock on the doors of such corporate giants as International Business Machines Corp., Exxon Corp. or General Electric Co. They're mostly interested in technical workers, preferably at entry-level wages. Also, some financial-service companies that might have hired brokerage workers have had layoffs of their own.  In 1987, under prodding from the IRS, corporations pushed workers to adjust tax withholding to reflect the initial phase of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Further tax changes come into effect this year, and workers probably will find it advantageous to file new W-4s for 1988, says Samuel Murray of CPA Arthur Andersen & Co. But the IRS isn't requiring new W-4s and most companies are remaining aloof.
