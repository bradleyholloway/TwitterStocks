 Donnelley Unit Sued After Inmate Allegedly Misuses Marketing Data   By Miller, James P, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 1996  The 1994 episode underscores the dangers of giving prison inmates access to highly personal information about consumers. "It's an important case," says Marc Rotenberg, of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, a privacy advocacy group. "It goes right to the question of privacy safeguards in the marketing industry."  A Donnelley spokesman says senior management didn't know that prisoners were entering the data because the work was handled through a contractor. Senior management learned of the arrangement when Ms. [Beverly Dennis] received the letter and "we ordered it stopped," he says. Using prisoners to handle consumer data, he says, "wasn't Metromail's policy then, it isn't now, and it never will be." He said he couldn't comment on the suit's specific allegations.  "If it said [on the circular] it would be sent to a prison, I certainly wouldn't have filled it out," the Ohio grandmother said in an interview, adding that when she received the letter, she was "terribly frightened."
