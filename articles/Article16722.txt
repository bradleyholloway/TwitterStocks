 Hinduja Weighs Cellphone Bid   By Guha, Romit, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 2007  The company has sent letters to Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. to ask if it is interested in selling its majority stake in Hutchison Essar, and if so, how much of a stake. "We expect to hear from [Hutchison Whampoa] early next week," said A.K. Das, vice chairman of Hinduja Group. Mr. Das said it was too early to decide how much his group would be willing to pay for a majority stake.  Hinduja Group will "only be interested in a majority stake" in Hutchison Essar, Mr. Das added. "We don't stay in a company holding a minority stake."  Other companies that have expressed interest for Hutchison Telecommunications' stake in Hutchison Essar include the United Kingdom's Vodafone Group PLC and Reliance Communications Ltd., India's second-largest mobile-phone company by subscribers.
