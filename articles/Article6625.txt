 De Beers Receives Approval From EU For Sales Overhaul   The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 12, 2002  De Beers controls about 60% of the world's rough-diamond supply and produces 43% of the world's output. In May 2001, the European Commission complained that De Beers's criteria for selecting dealers were too restrictive and could violate EU rules. The EU's executive was worried that the mining powerhouse's sales system could strengthen its dominant position. At the time, the World Federation of Diamond Bourses said it was worried about the future of small diamond dealers.
