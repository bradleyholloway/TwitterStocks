 Qwest Used 'Abusive' Tax Shelter; Second-Quarter Charge Was Partly Tied to Plan Set Up on KPMG's Advice   By Weil, Jonathan, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 2004  The disclosure, contained in a footnote to a quarterly report that Qwest filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, marks the first acknowledgment by Qwest that it used the shelter known as "contested liability acceleration strategy," or CLAS. The disclosure comes as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is considering whether to pass new rules limiting the scope of tax services that independent accounting firms are permitted to sell to their audit clients. KPMG has been Qwest's independent auditor since 2002, though it wasn't the company's auditor at the time it sold the CLAS shelter to Qwest.
