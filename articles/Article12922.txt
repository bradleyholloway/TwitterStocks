 Manager Offers Market `Therapy' --- Eaton Vance Fund Skipper Seeks Former Highfliers Hurt by Short-Term Woes   By By Ian McDonald The Wall Street Journal Online, The Wall Street Journal,  May 6, 2003  Before finishing his master's in business administration and starting his investment career in 1976, the manager of the $505 million Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Value Fund earned a master's degree in psychology and worked as a family therapist. Tapping his psychology background, Mr. [Michael Mach] has taken a contrarian tack, trying to buy shares of solid companies when short-term negatives have weighed them down. His fund averages a 0.6% annual gain over the past three years, topping nearly 90% of the nation's large-cap value funds, according to Morningstar Inc.  A: We look for companies that we think have strong business franchises and attractive growth prospects. We also only buy when they're at a discount valuation [versus the overall market]. Following this style means you have to be patient and have a contrarian bent. In early 2000, for example, we looked at Nokia. It's a great franchise with great growth opportunities, but the valuation wasn't attractive at all. Last fall, when Nokia was at about $12 a share . . . I stepped in and bought the stock, [which was at $16.83, up 15 cents, in 4 p.m. composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange], because it met all of my criteria.
