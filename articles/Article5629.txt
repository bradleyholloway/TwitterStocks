 America 1998: High on Stock Options: Two Friends Hunting for Gold in Silicon Valley   By By Quentin Hardy, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 10, 1998  SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Sheila Leary and Cheri Kalenian are best friends and veteran players in the high-stakes Silicon Valley options game.  "If you do it right, you can easily double your salary," says Ms. Kalenian, 27, who got her start along with Ms. Leary in 1991 at software maker Adobe Systems Inc. Options, 31-year-old Ms. Leary adds, are "how you really make your money out here."  In 1995, less than a year after she came aboard, Remedy went public. The stock rocketed. Ms. Kalenian got options on "quite a few" shares below the IPO price, though she declines to give specifics. Then the stock split, and split again. With related stock purchases, she says, "I made 80 times my money." She declines to disclose the dollar value of her gains.
