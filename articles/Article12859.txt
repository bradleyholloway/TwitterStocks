 Saving Up for the Lean Times Ahead   By By Andrew Stark, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 6, 2002  Very roughly, you're obese if you're 20% above your ideal body weight. And, as Ms. [Ellen Ruppel Shell]'s title suggests, genes are a big part of the problem. Over the past decade, biomedical researchers have begun showing that in an obese person there is often a malfunction in the proteins or receptors required to make a person feel sated after he has eaten. By creating a perpetual sensation of gnawing hunger, an obese person's body relentlessly signals that eating unlimited quantities of food is a biological necessity.  The problem, however, is not that Ms. Shell's argument grates. It is that it is unhelpful. Let's take a current controversy. Some airlines now charge an obese person more because he requires more space on the plane. Ms. Shell would say that this is unfair. After all, a person is fat through no fault of his own; genes and culture combined to make him so. But that argument rejects any possibility of personal responsibility and thus denies dignity to the very group it is attempting to help.  Ms. Shell's claim that genes and culture conspire to create obesity is also a rather anemic defense of the fat person. Again, economic custom offers a more robust one. The obese person, after all, is someone who wastes little food and spends few calories. He may also have what scientists call a "thrifty metabolism" -- one that requires a minimal expenditure of calories to do a given task, obeying the ancient biological imperative to save them as fat for the lean times ahead.
