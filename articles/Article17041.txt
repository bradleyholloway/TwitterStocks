 Books -- Review: Rhapsody Imbued --- A composer who brought an ecstatic mastery to music and life   By Epstein, Joseph, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 5, 2009  The second son of a Russian Jewish family in New York, he was a genius of the natural kind -- his mother had no special interest in culture or talent for music; his father ran bakeries, Turkish baths, a cigar store and a pool parlor, and was briefly a bookie -- but Gershwin had only to sit down at a piano in his boyhood to realize that in music lay his destiny. The book is an "intimate portrait" that tells the story of its subject's life and career with an admirable economy, showing an impressive feeling for the complexities of Gershwin's character and the twists in his fortunes.
