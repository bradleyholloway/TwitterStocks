CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 4â€” An executive of Dome Petroleum Ltd. said today that there was ''a definite possibility'' Dome might become the third company to withdraw from the $13 billion Alsands oil sands project because it questions the profitability of the venture.  Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. and Chevron Standard Ltd., which had a combined 18 percent interest in the stalled project, withdrew from the eight-company Alsands consortium on Monday.  Dome has yet to make a final decision on continued participation, but John Beddome, a Dome senior vice president, said in an interview that ''we can't feel very optimistic .''  Mr. Beddome said that under certain forecasts for international oil prices Dome's return on investment from the 137,000-barrel-a-day oil sands plant could be less than 14 percent. ''There is no way that we can get 20 percent,'' he said, which was the amount Alsands sought in negotiations with Ottawa and Alberta.  Mr. Beddome said Dome expects to make a final decision within the next two weeks. Officials of Shell Explorer Ltd. refused to comment on reports that the Houston-based company could be the next to withdraw from the project.  The six remaining partners in Alsands, which has scheduled an executive committee meeting for Calgary Feb. 17, are Shell Canada Resources Ltd., 25 percent; Shell Explorer, 20 percent; Petro-Canada Ltd., 17 percent; Gulf Canada Ltd., 8 percent; Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas, 8 percent; and Dome, which is in the process of merging with Hudson's Bay, 4 percent.
