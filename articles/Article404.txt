 Nestle Profit Rises 8%, Helped by L'Oreal Gain   By Ball, Deborah, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 25, 2005  The maker of chocolates, Ralston pet food, Nescafe coffee and Stouffers meals said net income rose 8% to 6.72 billion Swiss francs ($5.78 billion), or 17.29 francs a share, from 6.21 billion francs, or 16.05 francs a share, a year earlier. Results were helped by a gain from L'Oreal SA, the cosmetics company in which Nestle owns a 26% stake. L'Oreal sold its minority stake in drugs maker Sanofi-Aventis SA last year, providing a one-time gain to its shareholders. Nestle, which doesn't report quarterly results, said sales slipped 1.4% in 2004.
