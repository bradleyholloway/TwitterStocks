 General Electric Co. PLC of Britain Prepares For Makeover, With Brand New Name, Focus   By By Julia Flynn, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 6, 1999  In fact, by then, GEC will be a different company altogether. Drawing inspiration from Mr. (Jack) Welch, Lord (George) Simpson is in the process of reinventing GEC. His goal: to create a cutting-edge technology company and prepare it for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, that bastion of fast-growing technology stocks.  Lord Simpson has taken on some pretty tough corporate turnarounds over the years, including Rover Cars and Lucas International, but GEC may be his most ambitious project yet. For starters, he is selling GEC's core business -- defense electronics -- to British Aerospace PLC for around 7.7 billion ($12.49 billion). If that deal is approved, he will have shrunk GEC's work force to around 45,000 from 180,000, and sliced its revenue by more than half, to around 4.7 billion.  But perhaps the biggest challenge for Lord Simpson is changing the rigid culture of GEC, a legacy of Lord Weinstock. With his intense focus on cost controls and predictable earnings, Lord Weinstock helped GEC to survive the economic downturns that wiped out many other British manufacturers. But as a result, the company also failed to capitalize on early leads on such promising technologies as wireless communications.
