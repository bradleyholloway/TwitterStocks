 Marsh's Retirement Work Is an Issue; Regulatory Inquiries Focus On the Practices of Units That Advise Plan Sponsors   By McDonald, Ian, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 2005  Marsh also said it received a request for information from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. in January about the funded status of Marsh's retirement plan in addition to financial and business developments since New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed his bid-rigging suit against the company in October. The PBGC is a government-sponsored pension insurer. Previously, the Labor Department had requested information on the investments in and governance of Putnam's own profit-sharing retirement plan.  Separately, Marsh agreed to sell 3.7 million shares of Axis Capital Holdings Ltd., half its 4.8% direct stake in the Bermuda reinsurance company, to Merrill Lynch & Co., which will resell the shares, Axis said late yesterday. Marsh also owns Axis shares through a limited partnership it manages. Critics have pointed to potential conflicts of interest for insurance brokers that own stakes in reinsurers; Marsh has called its ties to Axis appropriate. Spokeswomen for Marsh and Axis declined to comment on the sale. ---
