 A Sea Change in Shopping; A Columnist Realizes How Thoroughly The Net Has Changed His Shopping Habits   By Fry, Jason, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 3, 2006  The Internet's taken over grocery-shopping, too -- FreshDirect arrives most every Sunday with the staples we need for the next week. (And their produce is better than what we used to get shopping ourselves.) If I go to the store, it's because I'm looking for our few favorites FreshDirect doesn't stock yet (Buitoni Mozzarella & Herb Tortelloni, please) or because we've forgotten something. For lunch I eat PowerBars, which I purchase by the case online and have delivered to my office.  It's not like the new way can't be kind of fun. For example, I used to write down the names of books that sounded intriguing in my weekly planner. Not a bad idea, except months later I wouldn't be able to read my own handwriting, or wind up staring at a months-old, now- cryptic title. Now, when I hear about an intriguing book, I add it to my Amazon wish list. I can wait for the paperback edition or a used copy to show up -- or look at my wish list and decide to reward myself. Think of it as the TiVoization of shopping: Instead of window- shopping, I put stuff aside for later. But I put aside enough stuff that it feels like I'm window-shopping -- only everything in the window is something that interests me.  Brand consultants, your golden age is at hand. As for the rest of us, maybe we could have the best of both worlds: We'll do most of our routine shopping online, from established retailers that have migrated to the Web. And with the time we've freed up, we'll stroll around city and town centers from which these ubiquitous, one-in-every-town brands have largely disappeared, replaced by small, unique retailers competing ruthlessly for our loyalty and our dollars. Maybe I'll even look forward to real-world Christmas shopping instead of fearing it.
