 Anheuser Tries Low-Carb Beer To Tap Diet Buzz   By By Christopher Lawton, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 13, 2002  Anheuser won't make any health or weight-loss claims for Ultra. But there is little doubt they expect weight-conscious consumers to embrace the low-carb claim. "Watching your carbs has become the symbol of a balanced diet," says Dave Peacock, vice president, high-end brands for Anheuser-Busch, based in St. Louis. "We're following consumer trends and reacting to consumer demand." Although Mr. Peacock stresses that Ultra is not a diet beer, it has only 95 calories, making it one of the lowest-calorie beers on store shelves.  Rivals have noticed Ultra. A spokesman for Miller Brewing Co., a unit of London-based SABMiller PLC, says it introduced a low-carb beer decades ago with Miller Lite, which has 96 calories and 3.2 grams of carbohydrates per 12-ounce serving. Miller began making a low-carb claim in print ads for Miller Lite earlier this summer. A spokesman for Adolph Coors Co.'s Coors Brewing unit says they have no plans to introduce a low-carb beer.  Strategically, Ultra is critical to Anheuser's bid to boost sales of higher-end beers. "It's the one area where the company needs improvement," says Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst at Morgan Stanley. In late August, Anheuser-Busch announced new packaging and a $50 million ad campaign to attract 21- to 27-year-old beer drinkers to Michelob, which was popular in the 1980s.
