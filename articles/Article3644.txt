 U.S. Probes Ocean Chemical Shippers   By By James Bandler and John R. Wilke, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 21, 2003  The reporting also disclosed that Stolt's outside lawyers in Britain told the company early last year that they believed there was evidence of a cartel in the European inland-barge chemicals-shipping market, in which Stolt also operates. The attorneys reportedly said that Stolt could be violating European antitrust rules in that market. Stolt and the law firm, London-based Linklaters, declined to comment on the matter.  A person close to the board said that Richard Fisher, formerly Stolt's only American director, resigned from the board in December amid deep concerns about the way the company was handling Mr. [Paul O'Brien]'s allegations and the Treasury probe. Mr. Fisher, a former deputy U.S. trade representative, demanded an independent investigation after first learning about the Treasury Department probe in The Wall Street Journal last year, according to a person close to the board. The probe was more than a year old before the article appeared.  Eventually Stolt agreed to an independent probe and hired the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom LP, according to people familiar with the matter. But Mr. Fisher resigned anyway, concerned that proper procedures weren't in place to conduct a thorough review. Richard Lemanski, a Stolt spokesman, declined to comment on the matter. Mr. Fisher, reached yesterday, referred comments to Stolt.
