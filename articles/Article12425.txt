 Pediatrix Medical Billing Information Is Sought by 2 State Attorneys General   By By Ann Carrns, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 6, 1999  Mr. (Bob) Kneeley said Pediatrix on Thursday received a subpoena for information relating to its operations in Arizona. Pediatrix operates eight hospital-based intensive-care units for infants in Arizona. Mr. Kneeley said it is likely the request for information relates to the company's billing practices under Medicaid, the federalstate health-care program for the needy. A spokeswoman for the Arizona attorney general's office said she couldn't confirm or deny an investigation of Pediatrix.  In Colorado, Mr. Kneeley said, Pediatrix doctors were questioned last week by representatives of the state attorney general's office about the company's billing processes, but the company has received no formal request for documents. Pediatrix manages 12 intensive-care units for infants in Colorado. A spokesman for the Colorado attorney general confirmed an inquiry into Pediatrix's Medicaid billings, but said he couldn't be more specific. No subpoena has been issued, the spokesman said, adding that Pediatrix had voluntarily contacted authorities and offered its cooperation.
