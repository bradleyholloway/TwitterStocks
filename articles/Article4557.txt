 Leucadia Suggests Dropping Condition Of Offer to Acquire National Intergroup   By By Terence Roth and Thomas F. O'Boyle, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 12, 1985  Leucadia National Corp., amending its takeover offer for National Intergroup Inc., suggested it would drop its condition that the metal manufacturer abandon its acquisition of Permian Corp., a Houston-based crude-oil shipping company.  The amended offer, however, isn't expected to enhance Leucadia's chances of successfully completing its hostile takeover bid. Terms of the Permian acquisition agreement and an option granted Permian owners to acquire a 21% stake in National Intergroup anytime over the next year continued to pose obstacles.  In a letter to National Intergroup's chairman, Howard M. Love, Leucadia reiterated its earlier offer to acquire the 91% of National Intergroup's stock it doesn't already own at $35 a share, a transaction valued at $750 million. Leucadia's original proposal was conditioned, however, on National Intergroup's sale of its First Nationwide Financial Corp. thrift unit to Ford Motor Co. for an estimated $400 million and the abandonment of its acquisition of Permian for $172 million in cash and stock.
