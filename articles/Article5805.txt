 Drilling Outfits Expected to Post Robust Results --- Oil-Services Sector Gains From a Strong Demand In Exploration Activity   By By Loren Fox, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1996  "The oil companies are essentially seeking ways to increase their own valuation and the best way to do that is to explore for oil and gas," said Kurt Hallead, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw Inc. He said exploration activity has been increasing since mid-1995.  Exploration activity hasn't increased evenly everywhere. Terry Darling, an analyst at Dillon Read & Co., estimates that the average number of drilling rigs in use world-wide -- a benchmark for oil service companies' performance -- dropped by about 4% from the year-earlier quarter.  Rowan Cos., another offshore-drilling company, is expected to post earnings of three cents a share for its fourth quarter, according to First Call Inc., which tracks analyst estimates. Mr. Hallead expects earnings of seven cents. In the year-earlier quarter, Rowan incurred a loss of 20 cents a share.
