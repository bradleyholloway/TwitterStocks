 Growth Hormone Given to Children For Unapproved Uses --- Survey Finds 40% of Patients Without Deficiency Get Genentech and Lilly Drug   By By Robert Langreth, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 21, 1996  Human growth hormone is approved by the FDA for treating short stature in children, only if they are deficient in the hormone, with one minor exception. Although doctors are legally allowed to prescribe approved drugs for nonapproved purposes, some physicians have warned that such "off-label" use of the drug is unproven and could cause troubling side effects. Genentech Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co. are the largest makers of these drugs.  In particular, potential side effects of growth-hormone treatment may include breast enlargement, high cholesterol, displaced bones, allergies, and even leukemia. The drug could also cause "potential psychological damage" by giving children unrealistic expectations of how much they will grow, said Barry Bercu, a Florida endocrinologist. Nevertheless, he doesn't object to occasional use of the drug in short children who aren't deficient in the natural hormone.
