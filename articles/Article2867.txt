 Letters to the Editor: Time to Revive Hippocratic Oath   The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2001  It may come as a surprise in certain circles to learn that the Hippocratic Oath has already enjoyed a revival here in the U.S. In 1995, the late Dr. Joseph Stanton, together with other members of the Value of Life Committee, authored the 1995 Restatement of the Oath of Hippocrates. The 1995 oath has provided a unique opportunity to open dialogue with medical school students about the ethical implications of the life-and-death decisions they will face as physicians. The 1995 oath has been distributed throughout the U.S., Europe and Australia; it has also been translated into Spanish.
