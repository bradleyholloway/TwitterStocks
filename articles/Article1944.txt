 Pillsbury's Smith Will Make Tidy Profit On the Takeover, Even as Earnings Sag   By By Richard Gibson, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 21, 1988  During that time, the company waged an ineffectual takeover defense against Grand Metropolitan PLC and, as Pillsbury's earnings report disclosed yesterday, it continued to stumble financially. But Mr. Smith stands to reap nearly $8 million, according to merger papers and other filings. That doesn't include a pledge Mr. Smith won from Pillsbury this month, guaranteeing the equity in his $1.53 million house.  Mr. Smith faced enormous problems when he arrived at Pillsbury. The company's restaurants were in bad shape and Pillsbury was a rumored takeover candidate. Indeed, it was only a matter of weeks before Grand Met launched its hostile bid -- and the ensuing fight occupied much of his energies and gave him little opportunity to focus on operating problems. Had he succeeded in keeping the company independent and addressing its performance, Mr. Smith's rewards would have been long term. His stock options, for example, would have phased in.  Now, with the acquisition by Grand Met, Mr. Smith will get even more. As a Pillsbury stockholder, Mr. Smith will be able to tender 75,000 shares to Grand Met. At $66 apiece, that holding would gross $4.95 million. Company documents indicate that Mr. Smith had purchased 3,000 of those shares before joining the company. Upon the acquisition, Mr. Smith will be able to sell the other 72,000 shares, which had been awarded as long-term incentives, a Pillsbury spokesman confirmed. The merger agreement provides that restrictions on stock options for all Pillsbury executives would lapse.
