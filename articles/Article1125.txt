 New Literature: 'Poor White Trash'   By By Helen Dudar, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 13, 1989  Mermer Blakeslee lives and works in the northern Catskills of New York State. In the cold months, she teaches skiing. Offseason, she writes and sometimes depends on food stamps for meals. Last winter, after she had sold her first novel, she was persuaded to give a public reading. Her audience for "Same Blood" was a Catskill group she classifies as "city friends" or "second homers," the well-off urban dwellers who gobble up local real estate for weekend places.  "Same Blood" (Houghton Mifflin, 224 pages, $16.95), published this month, is narrated in rural vernacular, the speech of the people Ms. Blakeslee grew up with. They use "ain't" a lot and say "I seen" instead of "I saw" and have no prospects to speak of. When Ms. Blakeslee, a terrific performer, had finished her reading, the reactions she heard stunned her. The first thing her city friends wanted to know was, "Where does this story take place?"  With loyalty and affection, Ms. Blakeslee calls her part of the country, "the hick world." Inside publishing, her kind of novel is also referred to, with respect, as "the new poor white trash literature," a genre that is not quite a wave but is more than a ripple. It has produced some talented novels lately.
