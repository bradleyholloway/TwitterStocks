 Nickel's Rally May Be Turned on Its Head --- Inco Surprises Market By Output Decision   By By Aaron Lucchetti and Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 12, 1998  The metal, widely used in stainless steel, rose $75, or 1.3%, to $5,710 a metric ton yesterday on the London Metal Exchange. (The metal, incidentally, makes up only 25% of the U.S. nickel coin, the rest being copper.) Since hitting a 3 1/2-year low on Jan. 28, nickel prices have moved 6.9% higher. "We've seen a turnaround" in nickel, says Helen Williamson, research analyst for Brandeis Brokers Ltd. "There's actually some buying coming through."  Meanwhile, allegations of the unfolding trading scam in Japan has caught the attention of traders and analysts. Last week, Engelhard Corp., the Iselin, N.J., specialty-chemicals manufacturer and nickel consumer, said it had lost $55 million in what it described as a nickel fraud that possibly involved theft of the metal and the substitution of its metal with cheaper, lower-grade nickel products. The company said a half dozen other nickel-market participants may have lost $145 million in the alleged scheme.  Engelhard itself says it is investigating and attempting to recover some of its losses, but market participants are still dealing with the question of how much nickel was lost and how much will need to be replaced. An Engelhard spokesman declined to comment on the amount of nickel involved in the alleged scam. Analysts estimate that between 2,000 and 10,000 metric tons of ferro-nickel scrap and nickel cathode is involved for Engelhard alone, given the extent of its announced financial losses.
