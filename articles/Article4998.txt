 Perot Is Dealt Setback as Judge Limits Raids on Staff of EDS to Dec. 1, 1991   By By Joseph B. White, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 12, 1989  Mr. Perot's lawyers had asked the judge to allow Mr. Perot freedom to hire EDS employees for a minimum of 20 to 25 years. But Judge William G. Plummer ruled that while the non-compete agreement that gives Mr. Perot special rights to hire EDS people is vague about how long that right lasts, it wasn't reasonable to extend the raiding privileges forever.  Instead, the judge chose to terminate the free-hire rights on the same day that Mr. Perot is free from certain other provisions of the agreement. "That gives him two years to cherry-pick" EDS personnel, once Mr. Perot's company, Perot Systems Corp., is free to work for profit starting Dec. 1, Judge Plummer said. During that time, Mr. Perot may hire any EDS employee who joined the company before Dec. 1, 1986 -- a population estimated at about 40,000 people. That date is when Mr. Perot signed the non-compete agreement that is the subject of the Virginia litigation, and took $700 million from GM to leave EDS and GM's board.  For EDS officials, who are locked in a bitter battle against their former leader, Judge Plummer's ruling put what they called a "manageable" limit on the damage Mr. Perot can do. After Dec. 1, 1991, EDS workers who want to join Mr. Perot will be subject to stiff financial penalties under their individual non-competition agreements with EDS.
