 Novartis Net Income Increases 18%; Favorable Exchange Rates, Heart Drugs Drive Results; Earnings Outlook Is Raised   By Jeanne Whalen and Anita Greil, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 21, 2004  Novartis shares were up 5.6%, or $2.42, to $45.72 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Novartis stock has lagged behind the Dow Jones Stoxx Healthcare Index this year because investors fear Chief Executive Daniel Vasella has ambitions to acquire a rival. Big drug-industry mergers haven't always served shareholders well.  While Mr. Vasella isn't ruling out an acquisition -- indeed, two months ago he nearly placed a bid for Franco-German rival Aventis SA -- he said yesterday's results showed Novartis doesn't necessarily need a big transaction to grow. "I will not be locked into either an acquisition strategy or an abstention from an acquisition strategy," he said. "One has to keep the freedom to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders."  Citing data from IMS Health, Novartis said its share of the global health-care market rose to 4.44% in the first five months of the year, from 4.37% in the year-earlier period. Mr. Vasella said Novartis now has raised its market share for 10 consecutive quarters.
