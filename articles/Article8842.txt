 Spanish TV Booms, Luring Top Talent   By By Julio Laboy, The Wall Street Journal,  May 7, 1997  It didn't take long, though, for Mr. [Martin] Dugan to find out. Looking at market-share numbers and growth projections, he became convinced that Spanish-language television was about to boom. "The writing was on the wall," he says, and he moved to Los Angeles from New York to take a job at Univision's flagship KMEX/Channel 34. He is now the general manager of KWHY/Channel 22, an independent station in Hollywood that offers eight hours of Spanish-language programming daily.  Increasingly, other professionals are making the same switch. Spanish-language TV stations once served as a second-tier training ground for general-market stations. But now, many researchers, sales-account executives, technicians and others with experience at English-language stations are finding enticing opportunities there.  The trend isn't unique to Los Angeles. Throughout the Southwest, Florida and some cities in the Northeast, the local broadcast industry is being similarly shaken up. But with three Spanish-language channels here -- each vying to win over some 5.5 million Latinos, or 38% of the area's population -- Los Angeles is clearly at the fore of this movement.
