 Deals & Deal Makers: Bids & Offers   By Compiled by Randall Smith, with contributions from Steven Lipin, Aaron Elstein of WSJ.com and Paul Beckett, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2000  It's not surprising that UBS didn't want to use an investment or commercial-banking rival, so it turned to Wasserstein Perella & Co. PaineWebber tapped longtime advisers at Blackstone Group, whose chairman Pete Peterson is close to PaineWebber's Donald Marron. The one bulge-bracket firm involved was Goldman Sachs Group, where banker Ken Wilson is also close to Mr. Marron.  No such fate awaits "PaineWebber," says John Costas, chief operating officer of UBS Warburg, the global investment bank of UBS. He said PaineWebber will become the brand name for that unit's U.S. private-client operations, with UBS Warburg remaining the comparable brand in Europe. This all became an issue when UBS announced Wednesday that it is acquiring PaineWebber Group Inc. for more than $10 billion.  With UBS-PaineWebber still weak in U.S. stock underwriting and merger advice, Mr. Costas said, UBS is likelier to try to remedy that with smaller "boutique"-size U.S. acquisitions and hiring selected teams of bankers than by trying to acquire a larger firm whose non-U.S. operations might overlap with what UBS Warburg already has. It sounds like that could rule out Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., for example.
