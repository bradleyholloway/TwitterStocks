 Black-Owned Firms in U.S. Are Increasing at Rapid Pace --- Census Data Show Surge In Less Traditional Areas -- but Not in Sales   By By Eugene Carlson, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 12, 1990  The Census Bureau said the number of black-owned companies in the U.S. jumped 38% in the five years ending in 1987, the bureau's newest figures, to 424,000 companies. That's roughly 2 1/2 times faster than the 14% growth rate of total new business formations in the same period.  While the bulk of black-owned companies remain tiny, owner-operated "mom and pop" retail and service outlets, the Census report showed an 87% jump to 70,815 in the number of black-owned companies with paid employees. The number of companies with workers had remained virtually unchanged in the previous five years ending in 1982.  Timothy Bates, professor of urban policy at the New School for Social Research in New York, says the increase in total black-owned companies is "pretty impressive," but less significant than the sharp rise in less traditional areas of black business activity such as business services and construction. The Census figures show the number of black general contractors with paid workers doubling in the five years ending in 1987, and business-service concerns with employees more than tripling.
