 PURSUITS; Leisure & Arts -- Sightings: No Orchids for Ella and Sarah; A contrarian view of two jazz greats   By Teachout, Terry, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 4, 2006  In [Sarah Vaughan]'s case, this lack of interest was so total as to be startling. To hear her near-abstract rendering of, say, the first two lines of Carolyn Leigh's deftly crafted lyric to "Witchcraft" ("Tho- ose fingers uh-in my hairrrr/That suh-llie come-a-hitha starrrre") is to realize that for her, the words of a song, good or bad, had no meaning in and of themselves. They were merely a pretext for the emission of interesting sounds -- and, as Gustav Mahler wisely said, "Interesting is easy, beautiful is difficult."  [Ella Fitzgerald], by contrast, sang with the clean articulation of a swing-era canary who wanted her listeners to understand the lyrics, or at least be able to make them out. But did she care about them? I wonder. She got nothing, for instance, out of the juxtaposition of "roaming" and "Romeo" in the verse of Irving Berlin's "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket," a neat half-rhyme on which Fred Astaire (for whom Berlin wrote the song) never failed to put the sliest of spins. It's as if she hadn't even noticed.  I do play a few of Fitzgerald's recordings fairly frequently, most of all the exquisite mid-'50s duets with the peerless pianist Ellis Larkins collected on "Pure Ella" (GRP). And on occasion I pull out "The Complete Roulette Sarah Vaughan Studio Sessions" (Mosaic) and listen to "After Hours" and "Sarah + 2," on which Vaughan is backed by just a guitar and bass, an intimate setting that nudged her in the direction of the emotional directness she more often shunned. Those, however, are the exceptions, and I expect they'll remain so.
