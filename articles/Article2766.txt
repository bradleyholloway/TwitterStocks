 Software Developers Race to Create New Movie-Download Format   By By Lee Gomes, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2000  DivX started life as a piece of video software called a "codec" -- short for compression-decompression -- that was included inside a Microsoft product aimed at software developers. But last year, a French movie buff named Jerome Rota helped rewrite the codec so that it would work with all sorts of computer file formats, not just the one that had been selected by Microsoft, making it easier for the video files to be passed around the Web. Mr. Rota also applied the name "DivX," a snide reference to a failed movie-disk format that now has become almost synonymous with advanced video compression.  Mr. Rota did his original rewriting of DivX using only the handle "Gej," since he was worried about Microsoft tracking him down. (In the end, the Redmond, Wash., software giant never did take any action against him.) Now, Mr. Rota is working with a San Diego-based company, Divx Networks Inc., whose working name had been Project Mayo, to create a version of the software that contains no Microsoft technology and so could be sold legally.  DivX and the other compression systems now under development are variations on a set of technical specifications known as MPEG-4, which has been created in recent years by a collection of international technology companies. Mr. [Eric Scheirer] said that since most video researchers know what other researchers are working on, it is unlikely that any one implementation of MPEG-4 will be dramatically better than any other. A bigger challenge than the technical one, he said, will be sorting through the patent and licensing issues and other complex legal matters associated with MPEG-4.
