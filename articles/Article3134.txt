 Watching for a Postwar Bounce --- Instead of Tracking the Battles, Investors Again Track Economy; Homing in on the Refinancings   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 2003  There are several such confidence surveys that can be tracked, the two best-known of which are published monthly by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan. They have shown consumer expectations rising lately, but not as strongly as they did in 1991 after the previous Gulf War. Mr. [Ian Shepherdson] says he thinks economists will see another dramatic jump in the expectations indicators now, which will be an early sign that the economy, and the stock market, are due for a jump.  For the moment, at least, that kind of optimism is scant. On Friday, in fact, even though the Michigan consumer-sentiment numbers came in stronger than most economists expected, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its recent slump, falling 17.92 points, or 0.22%, to 8203.41. That means that during the week that American troops stormed into Baghdad, effectively ending Saddam Hussein's control of Iraq, the Dow industrials fell 73.74 points, a little less than 1%.  Juniper Networks (Nasdaq) gained 68 cents, or 8.1%, to 9.09 after reporting first-quarter operating earnings of two cents a share, a penny higher than analysts' expectations. Ciena (Nasdaq), another network-equipment maker, rose two cents, or 0.5%, to 4.38 while Nortel Networks gained two cents, or 0.9%, to 2.19.
