 As Johnny Most Tells It, Basketball Pits Good vs. Evil --- Broadcaster Sees His Celtics As the Galahads, Mugged By Furtively Fouling Foes   By By William M. Bulkeley, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 21, 1989  In an era when sportscasters are trained to be impartial reporters, the 65-year-old Mr. Most is a throw-back, the most rabid home-team booster in sportscasting. To him, every game is a morality play: Christians vs. Lions, White Hats vs. Black Hats. In this world, vicious opponents and perfidious referees conspire to snatch victory from pure-hearted Celtics. "Objectivity is baloney," Mr. Most says. "I wear rose-colored -- make that green-colored -- glasses."  To Mr. Most, a loss by the Celtics reverses the natural order; he can scarcely stand it. The Celts were National Basketball Association champs a record 16 times, three of them in the 1980s. But this season, the Celtics' record is mediocre, with a 41-38 win-loss record up to yesterday, and they still aren't assured of a spot in the NBA playoffs. Many experts doubt that the team could make it past the first round anyway.  In one-third of a century broadcasting Celtics games on radio, Mr. Most has become a bigger celebrity than many players. Fans as diverse as Harvard professors and Maine lobstermen watch televised games with the sound turned off and Mr. Most's radio broadcasts turned up loud.
