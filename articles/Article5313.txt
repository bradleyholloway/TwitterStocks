 Composite Index Declines 2.59 Points Amid Profit-Taking by Institutions   By By Dave Pettit Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 12, 1991  Traders said institutional investors helped to depress the Nasdaq market as they sold shares ahead of the year end. Some winning issues were jettisoned to lock in paper profits, while underperformers were shed to remove them from portfolios, which will be evaluated after Dec. 31.  "There was a lot of cleaning house. It seems as if portfolio managers want to get rid of the deadwood that they don't want to show in the portfolios at the end of the quarter," said George Jennison, co-manager of OTC trading at Wheat FirstButcher & Singer.  The Nasdaq Composite Index closed with a loss of 2.59, or 0.48%, at 531.64. While the index finished well off its intraday low of about 529, the Nasdaq market couldn't match the bounce that Big Board stocks posted.
