BOSTON, Oct. 21â€” A hormonal deficiency appears to be a major contributor to shortness among pygmies, according to research conducted by scientists from the University of Florida.  The pygmies of the African jungles have far less than the usual amounts of an obscure body chemical called insulinlike growth factor I, or IGF-I, the researchers found.  The deficiency occurs in other ethnic groups as well, they said. About 150,000 pygmies live in the tropical rain forests of Africa. Most range in height from 4 feet to 4 feet 8 inches. Until now, the reason for their short stature has been a mystery.  Doctors from the university conducted blood tests on 11 pygmies from the Central African Republic and compared the results with blood from 31 normal-size people.  Their report, published in the issue of The New England Journal of Medicine due out tomorrow, found that pygmies had the usual amounts of a body chemical called human growth hormone, but their blood carried only a third as much IGF-I as the ordinary-size people.  The doctors theorize that IGF-I is the principal regulator of growth. However, its precise function is still not known. The study was directed by Dr. Thomas J. Merimee, who said in an interview that he has discovered two short people in the United States with the same hormonal defect as the pygmies.  Now that scientists are aware of the importance of IGF-I, Dr. Merimee said, it may be possible to regulate its production in the body.  He said it might also be possible to manufacture IGF-I in laboratories and to administer it to people who cannot produce enough on their own.  IGF-I is different from human growth hormone, a natural body chemical sometimes given to slow-growing children. The various functions of these and other hormones that affect growth are still being studied.
