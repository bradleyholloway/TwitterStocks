 Stocks Weather a Burst of Selling As Industrials Close Above 2200   By By John R. Dorfman, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 6, 1987  Stock prices weathered a burst of nervous selling early yesterday afternoon on the way to several more records as the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 2200 for the first time.  Several market sources said the selling followed an unconfirmed report in a West German newspaper that hostage negotiator Terry Waite had been shot in Lebanon. The report apparently sparked fears of a worsening of Mideast tensions. However, other reports said Mr. Waite had been seen alive and apparently unharmed in the Beirut area.  Several broad market indexes also posted records. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.05 to 160.36; the Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 1.52 to 281.16; and the American Stock Exchange index rose 3.58 to 314.98, its eighth consecutive record close. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 405.70, up 2.58, approaching its high of 411.16 set last July 3.
