 New Assessment Of Iran Redraws Political Lines; Key Powers Are Averse To Further Sanctions; Clinton Faces Attacks   By Jay Solomon and Siobhan Gorman, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 5, 2007  President [Bush] said the findings wouldn't change American policy toward Iran. At a news conference yesterday, he vowed to press ahead with coercive measures aimed at forcing Iran to suspend its nuclear activities. Mr. Bush sought to refute charges his administration oversold Iran's nuclear capabilities in recent months, saying he only learned of the intelligence community's conclusions last week.  The president said the report underscored the need for the international community to prevent Iran from developing nuclear materials that could be converted to military use. He said he and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have been calling leaders in China, Russia and elsewhere to make this point. "I think the NIE makes it clear that Iran needs to be taken seriously as a threat to peace," Mr. Bush said. "My opinion hasn't changed."  "If I had to describe one word from the Gulf today, it would be confusion," said Emile El-Hokayem, a Persian Gulf analyst at Washington's Henry L. Stimson Center, an independent research institute. Without a consensus in the U.S. on confronting Iran, he said, "there's likely to be a growing willingness now to accommodate Iran, as a result of the report."
