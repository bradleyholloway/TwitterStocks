 Airlines Compete for New China Routes   By Souder, Elizabeth, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 2004  AMR Corp.'s American Airlines quickly said it wants to fly between Chicago and Shanghai, but the airline, which doesn't currently fly to China, will have to wait until the Department of Transportation can add another passenger carrier to China service in 2005.  American called on the department to allow all airlines to apply for the 14 frequencies to be offered this year, in order for the department to have a sense of how it might also bequeth the next year's frequencies, which may go to new entrants. The airline further said there's no guarantee Northwest or United would begin those routes this year.  That left no one flying nonstop between Chicago and Shanghai. Northwest Airlines, for its part, serves Shanghai, but only through its hub in Tokyo. Northwest doesn't offer nonstop service to China from the U.S.
