 Americas: Clinton's Sugar Daddy Games Now Threaten Nafta's Future   By By Mary Anastasia O'Grady, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 20, 2002  That "side letter" says that Mexico can export surplus sugar to the U.S. only after it reduces what is considered a "surplus" by the amount of high-fructose corn syrup that it consumes. Since under Nafta Mexico imports and consumes large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup from the U.S., the amount of surplus sugar that qualifies for duty-free export under the U.S. side letter drops precipitously. The letter also caps duty-free Mexican sugar at 250,000 metric tons per year.  The increase in Mexican sugar production was predictable. To understand why, it's important to remember that U.S. price supports in sugar are maintained through the use of high tariffs. That meant that if Mexico was going to have open trade with the U.S. its tariffs had to be the same as U.S. tariffs. In other words, North America had to form a customs union with a common external tariff on sugar. This raised the price of sugar in Mexico, creating an incentive to produce more.  Last year the Mexican congress slapped a 20% import tariff on U.S. high-fructose corn syrup as retaliation for U.S. sugar protection. That's harming a whole line of U.S. producers of corn-based products, along with Mexican consumers. Sen. Charles Grassley, and seven other Corn Belt senators are raising cane about this with President [Bush]. But they should be going after their colleagues protecting sugar.
