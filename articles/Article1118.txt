 U.S. Is Pressing Drexel to Accept Settlement Totaling $750 Million --- Firm Would Plead Guilty To Felonies to Avoid Racketeering Indictment   By By Laurie P. Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1988  In the high stakes game of chicken that Drexel has played with the government in recent weeks, the two sides have been close before only to have talks break down. One person close to Drexel maintained late yesterday that any payment might still be as low as $450 million, but in no event more than $750 million. A Drexel spokesman declined to comment.  As part of any settlement, Drexel is understood to be trying to obtain an agreement that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani won't seek indictments of individuals at Drexel who haven't been targeted already by the government's probe. Such an agreement would free numerous Drexel executives of fears that they would become part of an investigation later.  The government was able to toughen its negotiating stance in the last week after two key employees who worked in Drexel's high-yield bond department became witnesses for the government. Terren Peizer, a Drexel trader, agreed last Wednesday to cooperate with federal prosecutors in return for a grant of immunity. Earlier last week, Cary Maultasch, a Drexel equities and bond trader, also became a witness in return for an agreement by the government to defer a decision to charge Mr. Maultasch with a felony.
