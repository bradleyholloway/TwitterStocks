 Politics & Economics; CAPITAL: Fed's Ideal Rate of Growth Could Be Slower in the Future   By Wessel, David, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 2007  Today, Fed officials are relieved that the economy has been slower than what is sometimes called "trend" or "potential." They wanted slower growth to avoid an outbreak of inflation. But a big question is what speed limit the Fed should anticipate for the rest of this decade. Lately, Fed officials have been speculating that the safe growth rate for the U.S. economy in the future may be slightly slower than the 3% annual growth rate of the past five years.  The Fed doesn't disclose its precise projection for the safe speed limit. A public summary of Fed officials' October meeting noted that "the staff . . . had again reduced its projection for potential . . . growth." The comment followed a research paper that argued that something significant is happening to the U.S. labor force: Growth is slowing, and the phenomenon isn't temporary. The aging of the big baby-boom generation is bringing it to the brink of retirement, and the proportion of women who work seems to have peaked.  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made the call of his career when he saw, before nearly anyone else, that productivity was taking off in the mid-1990s. His successor hasn't, yet, joined the productivity pessimists. "I remain optimistic," Mr. [Ben Bernanke] said in November, "that the recent favorable [productivity] trends will continue." He pointed to the continued decline in the price of computer power and said that was spurring on biotechnology and other new industries, while increasing the efficiency of old ones.
