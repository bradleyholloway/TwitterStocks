 How Two TV People Researching a Show Got Into a Gunfight --- The Cops, a Gang Member And Screenwriters Lived; `Dude! He's Got a Gun'   By By Michael M. Phillips, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2003  Officer [Bob Deamer] then noticed Mark Castillo, an alleged member of the Happy Valley street gang, standing by a bus bench that read, "Keep Our City Clean & Safe." The intersection was Eastlake gang turf, and Officer Deamer wondered why Mr. Castillo, a two-time felon, was several blocks into rival territory. The cops made a U-turn and drove toward him.  While Officer [Floyd Curry] fired, Officer Deamer drove the cruiser toward Mr. Castillo, got out and took aim from behind the driver's door. He fired several shots with his 9mm Beretta at Mr. Castillo, who was weaving his way across the road. "Got him!" Officer Deamer said triumphantly, as he watched Mr. Castillo fall.  In fact, he had missed, and Mr. Castillo got up again and headed away at a run. Officer Curry ran after him but soon saw more muzzle flashes from Mr. Castillo's gun. The officer shot his way across the street and took cover behind a telephone pole. Officer Curry then advanced to another palm tree as Mr. Castillo headed back toward him, turning to fire at Officer Deamer, the officers say.
