 Mixed Earnings Are Estimated For Restaurants   By By Meera Somasundaram, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1997  "It's not going to be an especially pretty quarter, particularly in the casual-dining sector," said NatWest Securities analyst Damon Brundage. Soft sales and mounting labor and food costs "have put margins under pressure. In general, earnings are going to be mixed at best."  The much-publicized price cut on McDonald's Corp.'s Big Mac and Egg McMuffin sandwiches -- effective in the second quarter -- didn't affect earnings in the first quarter, although the publicity surrounding the cut might have slightly benefited the company, according to Bear Stearns & Co. analyst Joe Buckley.  Higher labor costs and an increase in beef prices during the last few weeks of the first quarter hurt Wendy's margins, analysts said. Higher beef prices are likely to affect Wendy's more so than McDonald's, because only about 70% of Wendy's restaurants are franchises, compared with 85% for McDonald's.
