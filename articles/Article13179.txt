 Conservative Ire Could Aid Gonzales In High-Court Bid   By Anne Marie Squeo and Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 6, 2005  Social conservatives moved quickly after Friday's announcement of a Supreme Court opening, vocally criticizing Mr. [Alberto Gonzales] as an unknown on hot-button cultural issues -- such as affirmative action and separation of church and state -- important to them and perhaps insufficiently opposed to abortion. President Bush himself yesterday rebuked Mr. Gonzales's detractors and called for an end to the criticism.  President Bush has said he won't name a replacement for the court seat vacated by Justice O'[Connor] until next week at the earliest. But he has made it clear that he is intrigued with the idea of putting his longtime confidant and political ally on the high court. Asked about the criticisms of Mr. Gonzales in an interview with USA Today, Mr. Bush defended his attorney general, calling him "a great friend." And he warned: "I'm the kind of person, when a friend gets attacked, I don't like it."  After serving a stint as Texas secretary of state, Mr. Gonzales was chosen by Mr. Bush to serve on the Texas Supreme Court, where he ruled in a series of opinions limiting the breadth of a state law requiring parental notification for minors seeking to end pregnancies. One opinion in particular is cited by social conservatives. In a 2000 ruling, Mr. Gonzales voted with the majority that an unidentified 17- year-old was eligible for an exemption from the state's parental- notification law signed by Mr. Bush as governor. In a concurring opinion in that 6-3 ruling, Mr. Gonzales suggested the dissenters' interpretation of the state law "would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism" by creating hurdles not found in law. Democrats used these words to try to stymie the appointment of Priscilla Owen, one of the dissenters, to the Fifth Circuit appeals court. She was recently confirmed.
