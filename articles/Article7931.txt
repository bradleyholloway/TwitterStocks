 London Shares Fall Sharply as Interest Rates Go Up; Tokyo Posts Its Second Successive Gain ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup   The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1989  In Tokyo, interest rate worries were muted and stocks rolled up their second consecutive gain, helped by institutional and investment trust fund buying near the close. Most other major European exchanges also were steady to higher despite a round of interest-rate increases in several countries.  The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 30.5 at 2281.6; it was down more than 40 at its intraday low. The Financial Times 30-share index fell 23.0 to 1867.2. Volume was 491.4 million shares, compared with 472.1 million Wednesday.  The moves were led by the West German Bundesbank, which raised its discount and Lombard rates a full point to 6% and 8%, respectively. The West German discount rate is the fee the central bank charges member banks for loans, and the Lombard rate is the effective ceiling on overnight loans.
