 New York Rushes To Spend Grants For Counseling   By By Lucette Lagnado, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 2001  On top of the initial FEMA grant, state officials are scurrying to apply for additional funds. FEMA is vowing to give New York even more in the months ahead. "We will pretty much give them whatever is required," says Michael Byrne, who is helping run FEMA's New York operation. The city is in discussions with the United Way of New York City for millions of additional dollars for psychological care.  Much of the responsibility for managing the bonanza falls on Neal Cohen, New York City's health commissioner and, as it happens, a psychiatrist. "The impact on eight million New Yorkers has created a mental health crisis of epidemic proportions," Dr. Cohen says. He argues that any risk of misadventure pales in contrast to the need. "We are getting people who don't want to return to their offices in lower Manhattan," he says. "They don't want to be in tall buildings or even next to tall buildings."  In prior disasters, as many as 20% to 30% of the people affected developed post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition with symptoms including flashbacks, an inability to perform routine activities and severe anxiety. "Those are big numbers, and particularly in this case, we are talking about numbers of a magnitude that is almost unprecedented," says John Oldham, a Columbia University psychiatrist who is helping to oversee the clinical rescue effort for New York State. "It sounds like a lot of money" but it isn't, he says, "when you look at the number of people who will need definitive treatment and will develop problems as time goes by."
