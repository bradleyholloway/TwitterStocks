 Bayer Says Profit Slid But Cheers Investors With Better Outlook   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 14, 2002  Investors cheered Bayer's profit projection for 2002 -- part of the increase will reflect divestments -- and the better-than-expected results. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American depositary shares of Bayer rose 30 cents to $34.42.  Mr. [Werner Wenning], who will succeed Mr. [Manfred Schneider] in the role of chairman next month, said Bayer's drugs business wouldn't achieve its goal of a 22% operating margin mainly because of the problems related to Baycol and Kogenate.
