 Dell Computer Posts 21% Increase in Earnings   By By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2000  The Round Rock, Texas, personal-computer maker reported net income for the quarter ended April 28 of $525 million, or 19 cents a diluted share, compared with $434 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. The results exceeded analysts' expectations for profit of 16 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The latest results include a two-penny-a-share gain from investment sales, a penny more than expected, Dell said.  Dell's stock rose $3 to $47.6875 in after-hours trading following the release of the results. Earlier, its shares were off in heavy trading despite the market's climb. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Dell shares were down 25 cents at $44.6875.  Dell's vice chairman, Kevin B. Rollins, said an emphasis on sales of servers and workstations, in addition to the lower component costs, aided earnings. Gross margins rose to 20.5% of revenue, the highest level in four quarters. Mr. Rollins said Dell's costs for memory chips and flat-panel displays, which had hurt profits late last year, declined during the period. Sales of server computers and workstations climbed 52% from year-earlier levels, and notebook-PC sales jumped 67%.
