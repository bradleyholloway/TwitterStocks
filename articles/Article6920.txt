 Is Your Retirement Money Safe?; UAL's Move to Default Highlights Range of Risks and Protections For Different Types of Plans   By Jeff D. Opdyke and Kelly Greene, The Wall Street Journal,  May 12, 2005  It's with traditional pension plans, like the ones that United Airlines parent UAL Corp. wants to default on, where most of the problems occur. Companies terminate pension plans all the time, either because of a bankruptcy, a merger or a conversion into a 401(k)-type system. The problem is that pension money doesn't technically belong to an employee until it's paid out, and thus is sometimes vulnerable to the company's fortunes. Benefits are guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a quasi-government agency that takes over failed pensions. Currently, it protects only up to $45,614 a year.  By contrast, defined-contribution accounts like 401(k)s legally belong to the employee. That means that you're generally protected even if your employer goes bankrupt. But there have been cases of fraud. In some situations, for example, an employer collects 401(k) contributions from workers' paychecks, then fails to deposit the money in the workers' investment accounts. There were 1,269 cases of missing 401(k) money reported last year, a sharp increase from the 34 cases reported in 1995.  How to protect yourself: Make sure you're getting all your defined- contribution statements, and make sure the amount deducted from your paycheck matches the amount deposited into your 401(k) account. (There's a list of warning signs that pension contributions are being misused at www.dol.gov/ebsa.) Another option is to roll your money into an individual retirement account when you retire so you're no longer in jeopardy if something goes awry with a company plan.
