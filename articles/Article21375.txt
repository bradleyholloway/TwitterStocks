 Mourners Gather Over Third Quarter --- Many Analysts Cut Profit Estimates   By By Douglas R. Sease, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 1989  International Business Machines Corp.'s announcement last week that it will fall far short of analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit was only the tip of the disappointment iceberg. Yesterday, Kellogg Co. and Rochester Telephone Corp. proclaimed similarly gloomy news about their forthcoming earnings reports, and their stocks, like IBM's last week, responded by tanking.  "What people are finally recognizing is that the thrill is gone out of corporate earnings," says Abby Joseph Cohen, a portfolio strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert. "Sure, 1989 earnings will be a record, but the problem is that the rate of gain is decelerating." A year ago, overall corporate earnings were growing at about 25% in the fourth quarter; this year the gain is more likely to be about 10%, she says.  Benjamin Zacks, a Zacks Investment principal, says that in the last 30 days some 70% of all earnings-forecast revisions were downward, a peak for the year. Currently, he said, analysts are expecting the 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's index to post a 4.8% drop in profits from their 1988 third-quarter results, caused largely by some big banks adding several billion dollars to reserves against shaky Third World loans. And for the fourth quarter, they're expecting an 8.9% increase this year.
