 A Zoo With a View: Fort Worth Presents Animals as Fair Game --- With `Texas Wild!,' a Socialite Promotes Nature, Nurture -- And the Benefits of the Hunt   By By Susan Warren, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 14, 2001  The Basses consider themselves ardent wildlife conservationists. They are also hunting enthusiasts who banned the movie "Bambi" in their household because it portrays hunters as evil. Mr. Bass is chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the state agency that regulates hunting and fishing. Mrs. Bass comes from an old Texas ranching family.  Inside the exhibit's 13,000-square-foot educational center, visitors are told that hunting and fishing-related funds contributed $130 million last year to wildlife conservation efforts in Texas. By contrast, the exhibit points out, hiking and camping contributed nothing. Another display lectures that conservation can't just look at each individual animal -- it must consider an entire population. For instance, hunting deer helps keep them from overpopulating and running out of food or habitat.  Michael Fouraker, the Fort Worth Zoo director and former chief of animal programs, led the design effort and tried to incorporate his belief that recognizing the economic value of wildlife gives humans more incentive to help preserve species. For example, a computer game in the exhibit shows how ranchers can sometimes make more money by nurturing deer populations and selling hunting leases than by grazing cattle on their land.
