 Volvo Planning Big Investment In New Models --- Aim Is to Boost Sales 25% Over 5 Years in Drive To Remain Independent   By Moore, Stephen D, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 7, 1995  Luring them away will be crucial to reaching Volvo's ambitious sales target of 500,000 new cars by the year 2000. That's an increase of 100,000 units, or 25%, from Volvo's projected sales this year.  Saab, which is jointly owned by General Motors Corp. and Swedish holding company Investor AB, has annual sales of only 100,000 cars. Many analysts insist that volume is too low for sustained profitability. Volvo annual sales are about four times Saab's -- but some analysts also question if Volvo is big enough to survive as an independent manufacturer.  Befitting the car-division chief's background as a marketing whiz at Sweden's Tetra Pak group before joining Volvo, he's moving to overhaul Volvo's sales organization across Europe. Besides better demographics, Mr. [Tuve Johannesson] has targeted a heavily populated region that extends east from London through the heart of Continental Europe.
