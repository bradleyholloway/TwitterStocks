BOSTON, April 5â€” Vanessa Redgrave said the Boston Symphony Orchestra should not bow to the pressure of threats by canceling her scheduled performance with the orchestra.  ''If such threats and tactics are successful, it can happen to others, the actress said Friday.  ''I'm sure supporters of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and millions of Americans -if they knew the situation - would uphold the right of the Boston Symphony Orchestra to engage me or any artist that they see fit to.''  Miss Redgrave, whose support of the Palestine Liberation Organization has raised controversy in the past, said in response to a question that she would sue for breach of contract if the orchestra went ahead with the cancellation.  Although she was not personally informed of the reasons behind the cancellation, Miss Redgrave said in an interview from London on CBS News that her lawyer was told Friday that ''threats had been made.'' ''He wasn't told what kind of threats or who made them,'' she added.  The performance was canceled, apparently after the orchestra had received protests over her support of the P.L.O. Miss Redgrave was to have narrated Stravinsky's opera-oratorio ''Oedipus Rex,'' scheduled for April 15-17 in Boston and April 21-22 in Carnegie Hall, in New York City.  Thomas W. Morris, director of the symphony, announced last Thursday that the program would be replaced, citing ''causes and circumstances beyond reasonable control.''
