 Heard in the Southeast: Investors' Gloom Over Economy Shows in Region's Smaller Stocks   By By Nikhil Deogun, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1994  As of Friday, the Southeast Stock Index, compiled for Southeast Journal by Wilshire Associates, Santa Monica, Calif., was down 5.5% from the start of the year. Another regional stock index, Robinson-Humphrey Co.'s Southeastern Composite Index, which tracks 125 stocks from 12 Southern states, has dropped even further, declining 7.7% through the end of November.  Though analysts often dismiss the stock market as an indicator of economic performance, William Hackney, chief investment officer of First Union Corp.'s First Union National Bank of North Carolina in Charlotte, says: "There could be a message in what {the Southeast} index is telling us. The Southeast smiled through the last recession. This index signals that the Southeast is about to get its comeuppance."  A major reason for the recent decline in the Southeast Stock Index in particular is the preponderance of interest-rate-sensitive companies and small-capitalization firms located in the Southeast. Banks and electric utilities -- both reeling from rising interest rates -- together account for 30% of the total market value of stocks in the index. Weak stock prices of other prominent Southeast industries -- such as home builders and textile and apparel makers -- also have dragged down the index.
