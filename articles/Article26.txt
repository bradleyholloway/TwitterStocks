 On Sports: Something's Fishy in Eagle River   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  May 23, 1986  Sure, I'd seen those huge, waxy, mounted fish labeled as muskies, their backs arched orgasmically in trophy pose. Every hardware and bait store hereabouts has one. But my lack of firsthand confirmation of the beast's existence led me to suspect that there's a factory somewhere turning them out to entice the tourists.  My contacts with the natives served only to heighten my suspicions. Whenever I chose to fish was the wrong time to catch a muskie; wherever I chose to fish was the wrong place. The times and places they recommended were, invariably, inconvenient and unpleasant. I mean, when you're on vacation, who wants to get up at 4 a.m. and sit in a boat on a weedy lake, surrounded by biting insects?  Rizzo told me that he certainly was an expert on muskies. He said he'd caught about 1,300 of them in his 26 years as a fishing guide here. He'd even written a book titled "Secrets of a Muskie Guide." He sent me a copy. The photo on the cover showed a dark-haired, smiling Rizzo, T-shirt peeking from his open collar, hoisting a thick-bodied, long-nosed fish that looked about 5 feet long. That was a muskie, I presumed.
