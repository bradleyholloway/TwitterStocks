 The Americas: Colombia's President Doesn't Walk on the Wild Side   By By Peter Nares, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 1987  A member of a patrician family from the Cucuta region, Mr. Barco, aged 66, is the antithesis of his populist predecessor. Ex-President Belisario Betancur (1982-86) was a flamboyant Conservative Party politician who manifested his anti-American nationalism by taking Colombia into the Non-Aligned Group of Nations. Mr. Barco, on the other hand, has thrown open virtually all sectors of the economy to foreign investment. With gross domestic product expected to grow by 4% or more this year, Mr. Barco's economic program continues to attain its objectives.  Also, no end is in sight for the 23-year guerrilla war. Three of the country's guerrilla organizations -- "M-19," the pro-Castro National Liberation Army (ELN), and the Maoist Popular Liberation Army (EPL) -- continue their armed struggle. In the first quarter of 1987, 72 soldiers and policemen and 70 rebels were killed in gun battles. Colombia's fourth guerrilla movement, the Soviet-aligned Revolutionary Armed Forces Organization (FARC), still theoretically observes the truce it signed with the authorities in 1984. But in the field, FARC insurgents regularly clash with the military, and the truce soon may end. After FARC rebels killed 26 soldiers in a June ambush, Mr. Barco warned he would terminate the cease-fire in any zone where the guerrillas attacked security forces.
