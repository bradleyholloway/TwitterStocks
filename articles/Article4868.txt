 Japan's Surplus In Trade Falls As Imports Rise   By By Jeremy Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 11, 1988  Japan's trade surplus narrowed from a year earlier for the 10th consecutive month in February, as imports continued to rise sharply.  "We are going to see a very rapid contraction in Japan's overall trade and current-account surplus in the next few months," said David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley. The current account combines merchandise trade with trade in services and some unilateral transfers.  The overall trade surplus fell 26.5% in February from a year earlier, to $5.24 billion from $7.13 billion. Imports increased 48%, to a record $14.97 billion, outpacing a 17.2% rise in exports, to $20.2 billion.
