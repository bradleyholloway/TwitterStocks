 Stocks Rise 49.82 Points to Topple 9000 Barrier   By By Suzanne McGee, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1998  Relief spread across Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally managed to close above the psychologically important 9000 milestone for the first time, leaving the blue-chip index with a gain of more than 14% so far this year.  The Dow industrials ended a day of heavy trading 49.82 points higher at 9033.23. The announcement of the $82.9 billion merger pact between Travelers Group and Citicorp was responsible for 45.84 points of that gain, reflecting the 11.31-point Big Board gain in Travelers, a Dow industrials component (each $1 move in a Dow component adds four points to the index). To many market participants, that was only fitting, marking the growing impact of mergers and acquisitions, stock buybacks and mutual-fund cash flowing into the long-lived bull market.  Analysts weren't surprised that the Dow industrials finally reached 9000 in the midst of what could only be called a half-hearted rally. Certainly, the blue-chip index's ascent to 9000 from 8000 was a far more troublesome, protracted and often perilous affair than its march to 8000 from 7000 last summer. Back then, stock prices benefited not just from stable interest rates, but from the expectation of solid earnings gains. Then came the Asian stock-market meltdown, halting the U.S. market's climb and eventually triggering last October's slide. While market psychology has improved and interest rates have remained below 6% for most of the year, the Asian economic debacle continues to exert downward pressure on earnings, at least for the short-term.
