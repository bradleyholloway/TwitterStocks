The BBDO West unit of BBDO Worldwide announced a substantial reorganization yesterday that included several executive changes.  Operations at the Los Angeles and San Francisco offices will be realigned into three divisions -- BBDO Brand Services, BBDO Media Services and BBDO Systems -- and will report to Steve Hayden, chairman of BBDO West.  As part of the restructuring, Mr. Hayden said, "some downsizing was necessary in response to decreased billings in the West," involving 10 positions in Los Angeles and 6 in San Francisco.  Also, Bruce Mowery and Jim Ward, general managers in San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively, resigned. Mr. Hayden said their departures were "unrelated to the reorganization." Mr. Ward, 34, will join Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., as a senior management representative. Mr. Mowery, 47, will return to the client side as vice president of marketing at Music Net Interactive in San Francisco.  The brand services unit, focusing on strategic and creative assignments for clients' brands, reports to David Lubars, 35, executive vice president and executive creative director at BBDO West in Los Angeles, who was promoted to president. Steve Sanchez, 49, senior vice president of client services in San Francisco, was named senior vice president of Brand Services there. Until his counterpart in Los Angeles is named, Mr. Lubars will serve as acting head.  BBDO Media Services will coordinate media functions with other BBDO units. Kristina Allen, 37, senior vice president and media director at BBDO West in Los Angeles, was promoted to head the unit as executive vice president and director of media services and business development.  BBDO Systems will handle the daily operations, computers and new technologies of both offices. Steve Dolcemaschio, 38, senior vice president and chief financial officer of BBDO West in Los Angeles, was named to head the unit as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
