 For the Rangers, Yanks Are the Lone Stars   By By Frederick C. Klein, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 25, 1998  Arlington, Texas -- The current New York Yankees may or may not be the best baseball team ever, but they were the best in this part of Texas last weekend. Coming off an uncharacteristic two-game losing streak in Minneapolis, they beat the Texas Rangers two of three to put their American League East lead at 18u games.  At the rate they're going, the Yanks will clinch their divisional title around the first week in September. That'd leave the Chicago Cubs as their only rivals for the rest of the scheduled campaign. Those wouldn't be the present-day Cubs, who are, among other things, in the other league, but the high-collared, 1906 ones, whose 116 regular-season wins is the record.  Past Yankee winners had lineups that bristled with long-ball muscle, but this one has nobody who matches Mickey, Joe (Torre) or The Babe for that. Past Yankee winners had locker rooms that rivaled those of the Met (the opera, not the baseball Mets) for prima donnas, but no one among the current cast can preen like Reggie Jackson, scowl like Thurman Munson or play the harmonica like Phil Linz. Derek Jeter, the current Yanks' live-wire shortstop, dates the singer Mariah Carey, and leading-hitter Bernie Williams is said to play a mean classical guitar, but they do those things on their own time.
