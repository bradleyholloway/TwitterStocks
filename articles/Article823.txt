 Iranians Ruthlessly Wring Concessions From U.S., Saudis, Despite Weaknesses   By By Youssef M. Ibrahim, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 1986  These include the French release of millions of dollars of frozen Iranian funds, the U.S.-sanctioned supply of crucial parts for American-made weapons and a Saudi oil-policy reversal to favor higher prices, enhancing Iran's crucial export revenues.  Iraqi military pressure, spearheaded by heavy air raids on Iranian oil-loading facilities, refineries and important economic facilities, has choked Iranian oil exports. That and lower oil prices have halved Iran's petroleum revenues from last year, to an estimated $6 billion for 1986. The continued stalemate in Iran's six-year-old war with Iraq, after half a million casualties, has increased discontent at home.  But Iran's success in turning these setbacks to its advantage, say Arab, Iranian and U.S. experts, derives from the country's enduring strategic importance in a crucial and volatile region. "In the end," says Thomas L. McNaugher, an oil and weapons specialist at Washington's Brookings Institution, "Iran is the Gulf's superpower."
