 Lee Loves Quotas, Just as the Senate Feared   By By Roger Clegg, The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 14, 1998  One year ago tomorrow, President Clinton made Bill Lann Lee "acting" head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division when Mr. Lee's nomination failed to clear the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Lee failed to make it through Judiciary because of concerns that he favors the use of classifications based on race, ethnicity and sex. Set out below is a chronology of some actions taken by Mr. Lee (or by the division without him if he was disqualified from a case) during his 365 days in office.  Jan. 7: Files motion to affirm with the Supreme Court in King v. State Board of Elections, citing an expert's testimony that the aim of the litigation is to create a "Hispanic-majority district that would not violate the integrity of three existing African-American majority districts."  Feb. 9: Division files reply brief, seeking to intervene on Colorado's behalf in the Adarand litigation challenging the state's role in a contracting-preference program. (The Supreme Court's 1995 decision in Adarand held all government racial classifications to be presumptively unconstitutional; Mr. Lee said at his hearings that he disagreed with the decision.)
