 Financing Small Business: Stocks of Many Small Firms Languish Despite Profits   By By Michael Selz, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 14, 1998  Small companies often watch their share prices languish even as their earnings rise, a new survey shows. The stock of nearly half of 1,700 small companies that went public over the last decade sold for less than the initial offering price, according to a study by Piper Jaffray Inc., a Minneapolis investment bank. It didn't matter that the per-share earnings of such firms grew over the last three years at an average annual rate of nearly 19%, greater than the 17.5% comparable growth rate of all Nasdaq companies, the study found.  One orphaned concern Mr. Donoghue cites is ice-cream bar maker Eskimo Pie Corp., in Richmond, Va., whose shares remain below its initial offering price despite significant recent improvements in operating performance. Another such company is Middleby Corp., a Rolling Meadows, Ill., producer of cooking equipment. Despite projections that its earnings per share will grow 20% annually in the foreseeable future, the company's shares are trading at only eight times Middleby's operating income, well below the level of larger public companies, Mr. Donoghue says.  And Glencoe Capital, a Chicago buyout group, has invested $36 million in playground-equipment maker Swing-N-Slide Corp. to expand the company to a size where it may attract elusive institutional investors and analysts, says David Evans, Glencoe's president and chief executive officer. After buying a 60% stake in the Janesville, Wis., concern, Mr. Evans's firm merged it with a similar company whose commercial market for playground equipment is growing much faster than the consumer market Swing-N-Slide served. Glencoe hopes over the next few years to triple Swing-N-Slide's annual sales to $250 million, Mr. Evans says. "That's the size when these companies start to get analysts' attention."
