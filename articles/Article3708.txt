 Behind Alcoa's Bid for Alcan, a Test of Mettle   By Glader, Paul, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2007  Others believe the Alcan deal, if it goes through, could be Mr. [Alain Belda]'s effort to preserve Alcoa as a standalone company and leave on a high, and historic, note -- although Mr. Belda hasn't said anything publicly about retiring. "I'm sure he'd like to have it on the record that he accomplished this acquisition," says Leo Larkin, a metals analyst with Standard & Poor's. "He would probably like to be the one to get the credit for this particular acquisition if it actually happens."  Some analysts believe there could be a bid for Alcoa despite Mr. Belda's move. John Tumazos, a metals analyst at Prudential Equity Group, says Alcoa is "in play," with a 50% chance it successfully buys Alcan, a 10% chance it stays by itself and a 40% chance it is purchased by another company that sells off underperforming assets. One activist hedge fund and minor Alcoa shareholder, Jana Partners LLC, called for Alcoa to put itself up for sale. Jana says it purchased 3.29 million shares in Alcoa in the first quarter, or 0.38% of the company's outstanding shares.  Although CEOs at Alcoa often retire at age 65, according to longtime industry analysts, the company says its policies don't dictate such a retirement age. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, when Mr. Belda was in negotiations with Alcan for a friendly "merger of equals" last fall, the companies had discussed that Mr. Belda would be chairman of the combined firm until he retired and Alcan CEO Richard Evans would become CEO of the combined firm. Alcan, in December, rejected the idea of merging. Stewar1t Spector, a retired aluminum industry analyst and minor shareholder in Alcoa and Alcan, points out that there is no obvious successor to Mr. Belda within Alcoa, but that hasn't stopped industry observers from speculating about a replacement.
