 Lockheed to Buy Comsat for $2.7 Billion --- Move Seeks to Gain Access To Satellite Network; U.S. Approvals Needed   By By Bryan Gruley, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 21, 1998  Lockheed Martin, the big aerospace and defense concern, hopes to take advantage of Comsat's control of key access to the global satellite network and its long experience in satellite communications. Like many telecommunications giants around the world, Lockheed Martin hopes to offer business customers bundled offerings of local and long-distance phone, video and Internet service.  But the deal is certain to face tough sledding in Washington, where it must be approved by antitrust regulators and the Federal Communications Commission. Comsat, which was created by Congress in 1962, controls access to key portions of the global satellite network. Rivals say that constitutes a monopoly and are certain to lobby for regulators and lawmakers to delay or block the deal.  Officials for Lockheed Martin and Comsat said the deal will bring more competition to the telecommunications business, not less. "We think this will enhance competition, not in any way stifle it," said John V. Sponyoe, chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin's new global telecommunications subsidiary. He said the merger would help Lockheed Martin "quickly become a premier global communications network-service provider, a market expected to grow from some $50 billion today to $120 billion by the year 2002."
