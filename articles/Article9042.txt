 Salomon Had Credit Dispute For M&A Role   By By Patrick McGeehan, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 7, 1999  That may be why the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc. tried to get credit for advising a company on a big merger even though the company has repudiated Salomon. It is the latest twist to the strange case of the off-again, on-again $14 billion combination of McKesson Corp., a drug wholesaler, and HBO & Co., a supplier of software to the health-care industry.  Salomon Smith Barney initially received credit for advising HBO, despite a legal battle between HBO and the firm over whether Salomon deserves a fee for the deal. But after Salomon's controversial role was challenged by a competitor, the firm was removed yesterday from the official list of advisers on the deal by one key list keeper, Securities Data Co. Salomon declined to comment on the decision.  But that mission was complicated by 11th-hour efforts by investment bankers to snag or hang on to at least a shred of credit for some of the year's biggest deals. Late in the day, Securities Data executives still couldn't say how many firms would be allowed to claim an advisory role in the $40.5 billion merger of auto makers Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG months after the deal was completed.
