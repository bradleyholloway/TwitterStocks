 Tech Stocks Plug Back In, and Blue Chips Rally 169.74 Points   By By E.S. Browning, The Wall Street Journal,  May 14, 2002  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.71%, or 169.74 points, to 10109.66, up 0.9% so far this year. The pros noted, however, that this marked the 17th time that the Dow industrials have moved above the 10000 level. After each of the 16 previous moves, they retreated. That means that the blue chips haven't made any lasting gains since first crossing the 10000 mark on March 29, 1999, more than three years ago.  After last week's weak finish, traders remained uncertain about the week's outlook. "It is a pleasant surprise that we are up as much as we are after the way we ended last week," said Bob Basel, senior listed trader at New York brokerage firm Salomon Smith Barney. But since barely one billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, "it was pretty uninspiring, to be honest."  Outside the U.S., stocks were almost unchanged in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.01%, or 0.01 point, to 126.63.
