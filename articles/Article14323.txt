 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): DoD Stakes Its Claim   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 5, 1987  The White House today will unveil its budget outline for fiscal year 1988, and advance word has it calling for an increase of less than 1% over expected spending this year. The president is trying to hold the fiscal 1988 federal deficit within the Gramm-Rudman limit. But he wants a 3% real increase in defense spending.  Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger says defense spending actually will fall in real terms this fiscal year, after two years of essentially no growth. The $312 billion Mr. Weinberger wants for fiscal 1988 is $100 billion less than the budget authority envisioned only two years ago for FY '88. Only a year ago, the defense secretary was expecting funding of more than $332 billion.  The cost of federal benefit programs, meanwhile, has been rising much faster than expected. Social-welfare programs now account for nearly half of all federal spending. The Congressional Budget Office last August predicted social spending would rise from $467 billion in the current fiscal year, 1987, to $499 billion in 1988 and eventually to $593 billion in 1991. CBO now says that new estimates are $10 billion to $15 billion higher for 1987 and 1988, and more than $20 billion higher for 1991.
