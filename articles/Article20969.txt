 Tip: If This Guy Plans Pyramids, Binney & Smith Could Take Off   By By Lisa Grace Lednicer, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 3, 1986  The New Yorker takes eggs of the stretchy material and turns them into collages and other Silly Putty art -- which sells at very serious prices. At a recent exhibit at a Chicago gallery named Feature, for instance, Mr. Horner's "Muse," a Silly Putty-covered reproduction of a Constantin Brancusi sculpture, sold to a Boston collector for $1,250.  Mr. Horner has worked with Silly Putty 10 years, the last two devoted exclusively to it. His biggest problem, he says, is buying the stuff. At about $1.39 an egg, Silly Putty is expensive to work with as he does, and cashiers get incredulous when he buys several hundred at once. He finally persuaded Binney & Smith Inc., the maker of Silly Putty, to sell him a 50-pound box.
