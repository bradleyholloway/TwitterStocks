 Depression Sufferers Might Benefit From MRI   By Landers, Peter, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 2, 2004  McLean researchers have designed a low-cost scanner to deliver the magnetic waves and they are fine-tuning the treatment in rats, said the hospital's president, Bruce Cohen. Dr. Cohen, who is a specialist in brain imaging and bipolar disorder, is a co-author of the study. The lead author is Michael Rohan, a physicist at McLean's Brain Imaging Center. McLean researchers won a patent in June 2003 for the use of their brain scan to treat mental disorders, and the hospital wants to sell its technology.
