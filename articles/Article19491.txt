 Israelis, Palestinians Open a New Dialogue --- Officials Meet in New York To Discuss Peace Process; First Such Talks in Month   By By Karby Leggett, The Wall Street Journal,  Feb 4, 2002  Just how tentative is likely to be a topic of discussion between Mr. [Bush] and Mr. [Ariel Sharon] later this week. Mr. Sharon is expected to press Mr. Bush to officially halt all contacts with Yasser Arafat, the head of the Palestinian Authority. Such a move, some Israeli officials say, is justified by Mr. Arafat's reluctance -- or even inability, some believe -- to halt suicide attacks on Israeli citizens. On Friday, armed militants linked to Hamas, a Palestinian extremist group, attacked a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip; Israel responded by attacking a Palestinian Authority Naval base. "We still don't see serious efforts to stop terrorism," another senior Israeli government official said.
