 A Pretty Good Deal For America   By Cohen, William S, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 5, 2006  In the U.S.-India Joint Statement of July 18, 2005, the two countries set a course toward increasing ties in the arena of civilian nuclear cooperation. The agreement is important to India and the U.S. because it helps India meet its growing energy needs, but current U.S. policy and law prevent the U.S. from implementing it. India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and will not agree to sign it, because to do so would mean giving up existing weapons that it deems necessary for security. Some argue that carving out an exception for India in the civilian nuclear sphere sets a bad precedent by rewarding India for developing its own nuclear weapons. Critics would liken India's behavior to Iran's or North Korea's and suggest that this agreement will encourage bad behavior by others.  In exchange for changing U.S. policy, law and international agreement, India has made numerous commitments to us. It has committed to separate civilian and military nuclear programs and put the majority of its civilian programs under IAEA supervision and safeguards. These safeguards would prevent diversion of materials to India's existing military program. Moreover, India also has committed to maintain its exemplary record regarding global nonproliferation and is expressing interest in possibly joining the [Bush] administration's Proliferation Security Initiative. India has passed a national export control law, bringing its law and legal practice into conformity with international standards. New Delhi has reiterated its commitment to maintain a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. Finally, and possibly most importantly, India has agreed to work with the U.S. toward achieving a fissile material cutoff treaty.
