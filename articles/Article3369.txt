 Moving the Market -- Tracking the Numbers / Street Sleuth ITG Chief's Pact Might Induce a Sale; CEO May Get Bigger Bonus If Company Is Acquired, No Matter at What Price   By Richardson, Karen, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2005  In an Oct. 28 conference call, Mr. [RAYMOND KILLIAN] said ITG would benefit more from his efforts at the New York company over the next two years than from a sale, even though ITG was "open" to good offers. Still, there has been persistent speculation on a sale because of ITG's declining position in a competitive market, and Mr. Killian's return as CEO last year -- and the terms of his contract -- are feeding that speculation, analysts say.  If ITG is sold, Mr. Killian's contract says he'll receive a bonus amounting to 1.7% of ITG's pretax income in the 12 months immediately preceding that "change of control."  ITG will also reward Mr. Killian more for selling the company sooner rather than later: The contract states that if ITG is sold any day this year, the company will double that bonus. If it is sold any day in 2006 -- at the end of which his contract expires -- he'll get only the 1.7%-of-pretax-income bonus. It is unclear how much he would make this year if he sold, as 2004 results haven't been released. In 2003, ITG had pretax income of about $70 million. Business may have suffered since then, but by way of rough illustration only, a doubling of a 1.7%-of-pretax-income bonus based on 2003 pretax income would be about $2.4 million.
