 Political Steel   The Wall Street Journal,  Dec 6, 2001  It sure beats the current alternative: Earlier this year, with the 18th U.S. steel company declaring bankruptcy, the Bush Administration launched an investigation of steel "dumping" under the Section 201 trade laws. Dumping is when foreigners sell steel here at prices the U.S. industry can't compete with. This week the International Trade Commission will make its own 201 finding, and then Mr. Bush will have to decide whether to impose towering new import duties that would punish every part of the U.S. economy that uses steel.  Siding with hope over experience, we hope this steel gambit proves shrewder than just another case of a Republican dumping his principles to woo hardhat votes in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Some whisperings do suggest a strategy is in play to reduce global steel overcapacity. Now would be a good time for the Bush Administration to put its shoulder behind the U.S. industry merger, and not be shy about encouraging more. At last count there were still some 70 U.S. steel companies, and the old-line "integrated" mills are hopelessly uncompetitive.
