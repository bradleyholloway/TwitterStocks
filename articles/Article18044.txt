 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Judges vs. U.S. Attorneys   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 4, 1990  Prosecutors demanded a jail sentence for Salim "Sandy" Lewis, for example, but New York Federal Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said no. Another federal judge refused to order any punishment under the infamous RICO counts brought against officials of Princeton/Newport. We await learning what Judge Lowe, who also had to sit through three GAF trials, will do with James Sherwin, convicted the third time around. Or how Pierre Leval will punish Robert Freeman for "Your Bunny has a good nose."  The case against Sandy Lewis is a perfect example of the thin gruel federal judges found they were offered by Rudolph Giuliani and his successors. Mr. Lewis's crime essentially was having the wrong motive for arranging the purchase of a stock. In 1986, Mr. Lewis promised to reimburse his broker for any trading losses incurred while buying Fireman's Fund stock the afternoon before a public offering. Mr. Lewis had his broker buy 410,000 shares, which prosecutors said boosted the share price by as much as 12.5 cents, to close at $38 instead of $37 7/8.
