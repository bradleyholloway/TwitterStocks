 FRIDAY JOURNAL --- The Home Front: Searching for Serenity In the Hamptons --- A Manhattan couple create a spare, modern home designed to handle their busy work lives while allowing for peaceful nights   By Jackson, Candace, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 14, 2012  The open space has a warm, muted color palette, with a Terzani bronze chain-mail chandelier over the dining-room table and a mahogany bar with dark leather loop handles. On a street filled with mostly traditional shingle-style homes, the home of Ms. Brod and her husband, Andy, a 48-year-old investment manager, is highly contemporary, made up of six adjoining glass boxes of various sizes that are wrapped in mahogany wood planks and shingle-stone tile.
