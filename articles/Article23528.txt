 CVRD Gains on Iron Ore's Rise   By Fick, Jeff, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 3, 2007  "I think it's important everyone realizes that contract prices will likely rise for the rest of the decade," said analyst Paul Cliff of London-based Nomura International PLC. Mr. Cliff said next year's price increase is already priced into CVRD shares.  "CVRD has two of the most-attractive commodity exposures and growth profiles in the industry," Mr. Cliff said. "We think it's a growth stock, sustainable for the next five to 10 years."  "In the mining sector, the larger diversified companies trade at higher multiples," Mr. Cliff said. "Right now, they only have two commodities. To truly be diversified and take the re-rating story further, CVRD needs one more commodity."
