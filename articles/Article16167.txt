 Peru's Finance Minister Sticks To His Guns on Fiscal Overhaul   By By Pamela Druckerman, The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 2002  Mr. [Pedro Pablo Kuczynski] said in an interview that the government belt-tightening and privatizations he has spearheaded since taking office 10 months ago still need time to translate into jobs and higher wages. He vowed that Peru's president, Alejandro Toledo, will resist pressure to take populist measures like boosting state spending to rev up Peru's lackluster economy.  Peru's economy has grown only moderately for the past four years. Mr. Kuczynski said that this year it will expand 3.5% to 4%, powered in part by the privatizations and the possibility of exporting more if the global economy picks up in the second half. Late yesterday, Mr. Kuczynski said Peru's economy grew 7.5%, on an annual basis, in April, more than twice the government's official forecast.
