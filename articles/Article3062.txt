 China's Deadly Blood Trade --- Pay-per-Pint Facilities Supply Desperate Hospitals, Propelling Spread of AIDS   By By Leslie Chang, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2002  A wall poster reads, "Thank you for your tremendous support to Beijing's health system." Another poster promises a "nutrition fee" of $26 for either a half-pint of plasma or three quarters of a pint of platelets. At the Red Cross Society of China, Wang Baoming, head of the information department, says the society "advocates voluntary blood donation" but the ministry of health manages the blood stations. Officials at the ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.  In villages like Wanzi, blood selling remains a way of life. On steep terraced hillsides that tumble into the valley below, the farmers live a life that is almost medieval. Far from being an act of desperation, selling blood comes from the desire to move up in the world. In the neighboring village of Gan'goutan, farmer Liu Shuyao says he first sold blood in 1973 to pay for his wedding; later in the 1970s, and into the 1990s, he sold his blood to pay his children's school fees. A pint these days brings $29.  This past spring, some domestic newspapers ran articles about the farmers in Qinghai province selling blood for a living. The government announced it was setting up a poverty-alleviation committee to help the families. Some area hospitals that had been buying blood stopped. The provincial blood center in Qinghai also stopped accepting blood sellers, villagers say. The Qinghai blood center did not respond to requests for comment.
