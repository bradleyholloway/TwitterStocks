 The Inauguration (A Special Report) --- To Our Readers...   The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 20, 1989  To examine these complex issues, we have called upon the talents of the men and women of The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau. Day in and day out, these journalists have provided insightful coverage of Washington and of the new administration -- on the Journal's front page, on the Politics & Policy page and throughout the newspaper. For this Report, we have asked them to step back a bit from the normal press of daily events, to take a slightly longer view of the issues facing Mr. Bush, and of the challenges and opportunities that await him.
