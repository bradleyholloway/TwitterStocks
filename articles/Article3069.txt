 When Companies Cut the Fat, Turkeys Are Often Last to Go --- A Holiday Tradition Survives In Lean Economic Times; A Perk That's Still Cheap   By By Carlos Tejada, The Wall Street Journal,  Nov 14, 2002  In Worcester, Mass., Norton Co., a maker of abrasives and ceramics, has been a big employer for more than a century. The company's founder, John Jeppson, and his wife, Thilda, cooked Christmas turkeys for their largely Scandinavian work force until the 1890s. When employees grew too numerous (there are about 1,850 now), managers began handing out turkeys.  Last year, employees of Home Interiors & Gifts Inc. of Carrollton, Texas, took home ready-to-eat smoked turkeys, only to discover they weren't cooked enough. The bloody birds prompted a recall by Texas state health officials of more than 1,000 turkeys. There will be no smoked turkeys this year.  Still, Federal-Mogul plans to give employees at the former Fel-Pro plant Christmas turkeys this year. That provides a bit of solace to Bennie Gulley, a former Fel-Pro human resources employee laid off after the acquisition. His job included handing out December turkeys and keeping employees who aren't Jewish from making off with all the kosher turkeys.
