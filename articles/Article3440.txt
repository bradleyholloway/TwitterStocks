 Stocks Edge Up On Trade Data, Budget Forecast   By Anand, Shefali, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 14, 2005  "The market seems to be poised to want to look for good news," said Richard Madigan, an investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The fact that some of the macro [economic] data looks a little bit better in the U.S. and that there seems to be positive momentum still in earnings, is what's giving the market its pace right now." Mr. Madigan added that most of the companies reporting earnings after Tuesday's close beat projections, though that was partly because expectations for many companies had fallen in recent days.  Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.4%, or 0.75 point, to 172.30.
