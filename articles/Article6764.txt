 Leading the News: Military Lawyers To Contest Rules For the Tribunals   By Jess Bravin and Robert S. Greenberger, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 2004  "We think the arguments go too far on both sides," said Mr. [Neal Katyal], a Justice Department adviser on national-security law during the Clinton administration. The military lawyers don't "dispute, in any way, the president's power to wage war" or how, on the battlefield, "to take custody of enemy combatants . . . until the war ends and repatriation is possible," the brief argues. But "the moment the president ventures beyond detaining enemy combatants as war prisoners to actually adjudicating their guilt and meting out punishment," he places himself under the ultimate review of the courts, the brief contends.  President [Bush]'s November 2001 order authorizing the tribunals directed "full and fair" trials, but barred the federal courts from any jurisdiction over them. In July, Mr. Bush designated six Guantanamo prisoners as eligible for trial before the tribunals, which can impose death sentences by a two-thirds vote. Although none formally have been charged, two prisoners -- Australian David Hicks and Salim Ahmed Hamdan of Yemen -- were assigned military defense lawyers, Marine Maj. Michael Mori and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift, respectively. Three other lawyers, Air Force Lt. Col. Sharon Shaffer, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Philip Sundel and Army Maj. Mark Bridges, are awaiting assignment to specific clients.
