 Leading the News: International Steel Offer Is Likely --- Ailing Bethlehem Is Expected To See About $1 Billion Bid For Most of Its Resources   By By Robert Guy Matthews, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 6, 2003  Mr. Ross wouldn't discuss details of the transaction or the specific assets expected to be included in the International Steel proposal. But people familiar with the matter said Mr. Ross is likely to pay between $900 million and $1.1 billion for Bethlehem's major plants -- one in Indiana, just southeast of Chicago, and another near Baltimore. Other smaller operations are likely to be included, but it isn't clear which ones. Mr. Ross indicated that he wasn't going to bid for all of Bethlehem's assets. Bethlehem Steel said it wouldn't comment until a deal, if any, is announced. But Robert S. Miller, Bethlehem's CEO, previously said he wants to complete a deal with International Steel.  Indeed, if Mr. Ross clinches Bethlehem, it would save a nearly 100-year-old steel company and thousands of jobs that were expected to vanish under the company's crushing debt. But Mr. Ross would still likely trim between 30% and 40% of Bethlehem Steel's 12,000-member work force and significantly reduce health benefits for 67,000 Bethlehem retirees. Managers at Bethlehem Steel, International Steel and the USWA worked during the weekend to address how to significantly reduce the work force.  The only other steelmaker with enough cash to purchase Bethlehem is Nucor Corp., Charlotte, N.C., the country's second-largest and most cash-rich steelmaker. But Nucor prefers to remain a nonunionized company and hasn't pursued Bethlehem. Some foreign steelmakers have shown an interest in some of Bethlehem's assets but none have been negotiating with the USWA.
