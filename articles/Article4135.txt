 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Soft on the Pentagon   The Wall Street Journal,  Mar 10, 1986  The Pentagon is headed toward its most fundamental reorganization since Robert McNamara's "whiz kids" of the early 1960s. Within the past week, a presidential commission has recommended strengthening the role of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, slashing Pentagon bureaucracy and streamlining procurement procedures. And the Senate Armed Services Committee unanimously approved legislation incorporating many of these proposed reforms. Our worry is whether the reforms go far enough.  The Defense Department obviously needs reorganization, though perhaps in ways opposite to first instincts. The last thing the Pentagon needs is more layers of bureaucratic overseers. It needs responsibility and accountability. The defense establishment is a huge socialistic enterprise badly in need of deregulation.  The Packard Commission -- the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management chaired by David Packard of Hewlett-Packard Co. -- issued its interim report last week. It suggested a reorganization to strengthen Joint Chiefs of Staff control over the unwieldy Pentagon bureaucracy. In terms of equipment acquisition, it recommended smaller staffs with better communications and coordination. Most important, it stressed a stable environment for planning and funding, especially cost-cutting multiyear procurement for high-priority systems.
