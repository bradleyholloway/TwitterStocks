 Should Electricity Ever Be De-Regulated?   The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 6, 2007  They do this by ironically claiming that "a totally free electricity market" would be "a world of deregulated vertically integrated firms" where "both firms and consumers would likely prefer long-term contracts, an arrangement that meets consumers' interest in price protection and firms' interest in cost recovery" and where "both producers and consumers would almost certainly resist spot market relationships" that the authors correctly criticize as "encouraged" by deregulation "rules."
