 German Chancellor Makes Push to Slow Unemployment to Help Re-Election Bid   By By William Boston, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 16, 2002  The conservative alliance of the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, is gaining in the polls and appears to be rallying around Edmund Stoiber. As governor of Bavaria, Mr. Stoiber has a strong economic record and is already thrashing Mr. [Gerhard Schroder]'s record on unemployment. Mr. Stoiber won the backing of his CSU party last week and is expected to win the support of the CDU later this month.  When Mr. Schroder took office in 1998, forming a center-left coalition government between his SPD and the environmentalist Green Party, more than four million Germans, or more than 10% of the work force, were unemployed. Mr. Schroder vowed that the success of his government would be measured by his ability to lower unemployment significantly. For a while that even looked possible.  The chancellor hopes to persuade labor and union officials to back the plan when they meet for high-level talks this month. At the next round of Mr. Schroder's so-called Alliance for Jobs, which could take place Jan. 25, he is hoping to demonstrate that his government is taking action against unemployment. The supplemental wage plan looks a lot easier to achieve than the politically treacherous move of cutting Germany's generous welfare system to provide incentives to work.
