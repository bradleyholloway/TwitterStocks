 Macmillan Charges Bass, Others Broke Securities Laws   By By Johnnie L. Roberts, The Wall Street Journal,  Jul 7, 1988  Backers and investment partners of Robert M. Bass "secretly" accumulated a large Macmillan Inc. stake that wasn't disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the company charged.  In a lawsuit filed in federal court here yesterday and in a letter to Gary Lynch, SEC enforcement chief, the publishing and information concern alleged a takeover conspiracy and violations of securities laws by Mr. Bass, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., American Express Co. and Wells Fargo Bank. It urged an investigation by the SEC.  In the letter, Beverly C. Chell, Macmillan's general counsel, said Mr. Bass failed to disclose that he, the financial services concerns and his lead lender, Wells Fargo Bank, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co., owned more than 13% of Macmillan shares in his first SEC filing on his Macmillan holdings last Oct. 21. In that filing, Mr. Bass only disclosed that he owned 7.5%.
