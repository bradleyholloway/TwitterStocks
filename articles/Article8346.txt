 Output Data Bolster OPEC's Pricing Stance --- Oil Futures Drop on Report Of Kuwait's Complaints About Overproduction   By By James Tanner, The Wall Street Journal,  Apr 7, 1993  The International Energy Agency yesterday estimated that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced slightly less than 24.4 million barrels a day in March. That was down substantially from February output of 25.5 million barrels a day.  Oil prices dropped yesterday nevertheless. In futures trading, crude oil for May delivery fell 32 cents a barrel in New York and 28 cents in London. Traders generally cited a technical correction after recent price gains, though some selling was triggered by reports Kuwait had protested to OPEC about overproduction by some other members.  Meanwhile, Alirio Parra, OPEC's president and Venezuela's oil minister, and OPEC's Secretary-General Subroto said in interviews here that internal reports by the oil exporters suggest total output is even lower than the International Energy Agency and industry estimates. Both were in London to address the annual conference of the Centre for Global Energy Studies, an energy think tank founded by Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former oil minister of Saudi Arabia.
