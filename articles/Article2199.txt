 Religious Schism at Baptist College Mirrors Turmoil in the Sect Itself   By By Greg Jaffe, The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1996  Fundamentalists celebrated the decision. But it left professors in the undergraduate religion department and moderate students fuming. "It was an embarrassment for myself and the entire religion department," says the Rev. Karen Joines, who has taught at Samford for 30 years. "It's not the way Samford should work."  Since Mr. Corts took the reins at Samford in 1983, college entrance exam scores for freshmen have soared 25%. This year, the school's freshman class will boast 22 valedictorians, up from zero during the president's first four years. Meanwhile, Samford's endowment has increased 20-fold to $160 million, ranking it in the top 4% of accredited universities nationwide.  For the next 50 years, a few dollars from every collection plate in Alabama went to keep Samford running. The donations helped the Baptists develop a sense of ownership toward Samford, so much so that congregations took trips to the campus to tour the school they had saved from financial ruin. Meanwhile, Samford reflected the homey values of its backers. Virtually all of the students and faculty came from Alabama. And, until the 1980s, there wasn't even a formal tenure process for professors, who usually received a contract in the mail marked "tenured" after seven years. "The university was run like a family," says Morgan Ponder, who teaches chemistry at Samford.
