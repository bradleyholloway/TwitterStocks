Tuesday's nonpartisan mayoral election in Newark is not an inspiring contest.  The major candidates, Mayor Kenneth Gibson and City Council President Earl Harris, were recently indicted on charges that they gave a former Councilman a no-show job.  Even without this legal trouble, it would be hard to work up much enthusiasm for either.  Mr. Gibson, once a preeminent spokesman for urban America, has used the assets of incumbency to build a strong political organization. But in recent years he has become aloof, and the quality of his administration has declined.  Mr. Harris, a former county Freeholder, has served on the Council for 12 years. Lacking even the administrative experience of Mr. Gibson, he offers no other outstanding qualifications for mayor.  Two other candidates seem unlikely to poll enough votes to make even a runoff. Joseph Frisina, the city's tax assessor and the only white in the race, has not demonstrated much more than congeniality.  Junius Williams is a former president of the National Bar Association who managed Newark's Model Cities program during Mayor Gibson's first term. He was dismissed after a year, following a critical Federal audit of his management. But political considerations seem to have given that critique excessive weight.  Mr. Gibson still banks on his national reputation, and Mr. Harris enjoys formidable local support. Mr. Williams alone has tried to use this campaign to educate the voters about Newark's current problems. In an unpromising lot, he is the most promising.
