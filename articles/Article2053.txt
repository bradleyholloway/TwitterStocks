 World-Wide [9]  The Wall Street Journal,  Aug 14, 1995  Prodded to act after Croatia's reconquest of its Krajina region from secessionist Serbs, the U.S., Russia and European nations began a series of peace talks. The U.S. won crucial Russian support for a new set of high-level meetings involving the warring parties. Progress on the diplomatic front came as Muslim-led Bosnian government forces pressed forward against Serb-held military positions in central Bosnia.  President Clinton used his veto Friday to short-circuit a congressional move to end U.S. compliance with the U.N. arms embargo on Bosnia, saying that such a policy would make the war there "an American responsibility."  Iraq offered to reveal new details of its weapons program that it claimed were suppressed by Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Hassan Majid, who defected to Jordan along with another son-in-law and their wives. On Saturday, Gen. Kamel announced a campaign to topple the Baghdad regime.
