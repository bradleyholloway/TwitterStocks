 Executives on Trial: Tyco Jury Hears About Huge Fee   By Maremont, Mark, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 14, 2004  "I remember this conversation like it occurred yesterday," Mr. [Leon Cooperman] testified under questioning by assistant district attorney Connie Fernandez. The hedge-fund manager testified that Mr. [L. Dennis Kozlowski] gave a timeline surrounding the fee, saying that he had originally been "uncomfortable" with a request by Mr. [Frank Walsh] for the payment, but had told Mr. Walsh it would be all right if the "full board goes along with it." During the conversation, the witness testified, Mr. Kozlowski also said "unequivocally" that the "board of directors approved the payment."  Based on that information, Mr. Cooperman said he spent about $50 million on another 1,360,000 shares of Tyco stock on Jan. 29 and Jan. 30. Mr. Cooperman said Mr. Kozlowski's assurance that the board had approved the fee was "pivotal" in that investment decision. Had the board not approved the fee, he said, it would have indicated a company that was "out of control."  Austin Campriello, a defense attorney for Mr. Kozlowski, started his cross-examination with a sarcastic comment that seemed intended to draw the jury's attention to Mr. Cooperman's sometimes bombastic personality on the witness stand. "Are you sure Mr. Kozlowski had a chance to say anything in that conversation?" the defense attorney asked. "Objection," a prosecutor quickly shouted. "Sustained," the judge said.
