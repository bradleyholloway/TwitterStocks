 Chemical Unit Of USX Is Said To Be for Sale --- Sources See Possible Yield Of $500 Million or More For Embattled Concern   By By Daniel Hertzberg and Mark Russell, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 6, 1986  USX Corp., buffeted by continued takeover speculation, is seeking a sale or similar transaction involving its chemical business, Wall Street sources said.  Wall Street sources said that Mr. Icahn has been talking to investment bankers to weigh the chances of financing a takeover bid for USX. Mr. Icahn, who took control of Trans World Airlines in a bitter takeover fight last year, declined comment.  Mr. Icahn is required to make a disclosure to the SEC, indicating his intentions, within 10 days after acquiring a 5% stake in USX. Such a filing could disclose whether Mr. Icahn has hired an investment banker. There is speculation Mr. Icahn might employ Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the largest underwriter of high-yield, low-rated "junk" bonds, if he attempts a takeover of USX.
