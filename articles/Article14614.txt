 Mortgage Rates Fell Last Week, Fueled By Friday Bond Rally   The Wall Street Journal,  Jun 5, 1989  Rates on fixed and adjustable mortgages continued to decline last week, fueled largely by Friday's bond rally. The decline, economists said, will help to boost flagging home sales.  The weekly average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages purchased by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. fell Friday to 10.66% from 10.76% late last month. Rates on fully indexed one-year adjustable loans, the most popular ARM, fell to 11% from 11.78% in late May.
