 Close Vote on Chile's President Is Seen, Raising the Specter of Increased Strife   By By Roger Cohen, The Wall Street Journal,  Oct 5, 1988  SANTIAGO, Chile -- A bright rainbow has been the symbol of the disciplined campaign to vote 'no' today to Gen. Augusto Pinochet's proposal to extend his rule until 1997. Increasingly, this campaign has seemed to catch the ruling junta off balance and it has responded with an escalating barrage of nastiness and vitriol.  New government posters, for example, show three rainbows and describe them as "the emblems of homosexuals" who could bring AIDS to Chile. Such campaigning has led many to the view that the junta is worried. "The fact the government is so desperate leads us to believe we may be on the verge of proving that you can oust a dictatorship with a vote," says Jorge Schaulsohn, secretary-general of the center-left Party for Democracy, or PPD. If the 'no' vote wins, Gen. Pinochet, who has ruled for 15 years, must call open presidential elections by the end of next year. The new president would take office in March 1990.  Western diplomats and several opinion polls concur that the opposition's forward-looking campaign may have given it an edge of perhaps 55% to 45%. The junta, by contrast, has dwelt on the specter of communism and a return to the strife experienced under Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in the 1973 military coup that brought Gen. Pinochet to power. It has had less to say about the future.
