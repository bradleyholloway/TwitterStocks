 Reading the Euro Tea Leaves in Britain --- Currency Traders Divine Scenarios on Adoption, Big Money at Stake   By By Marc Champion and Michael R. Sesit, The Wall Street Journal,  Sep 4, 2001  That leaves traders and analysts searching for clues. One event they're watching is the Conservative Party's current election of a new leader. Any early indication that Kenneth Clarke has won the contest, the result of which will be announced Sept. 12, might cause the market to briefly bid up the value of the euro and mark down the pound. That's because Mr. Clarke is among the few senior Conservatives who think Britain eventually should adopt the euro. "The market will tend to buy the rumor" if Mr. Clarke seems likely to win, says Citibank's Mr. Wells.  If the pro-euro Mr. Clarke becomes head of the opposition Conservative Party, it may be easier for Mr. [Tony Blair] to try to persuade Britons to accept the euro, some analysts believe. But Mr. [Michael Saunders] says it isn't that simple. Mr. Clarke is far more popular nationally than his rival in the party election, Iain Duncan Smith, who bitterly opposes the euro. If Mr. Duncan Smith wins, the Labour Party may feel even more secure in power and thus more willing to take the risk of calling a referendum on the euro.
