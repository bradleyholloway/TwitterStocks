 Tricky Ledgers: To Hide Huge Losses, Financial Officials Use Accounting Gimmicks --- Farm Credit System Plans Two Sets of Its Books; Insolvent S&Ls Stay Open --- But Few Expect a Real Crisis   By By Jeff Bailey and Charles F. McCoy, The Wall Street Journal,  Jan 12, 1987  From the troubled Southwest to the nation's capital, government and banking officials are resorting to new extremes of balance-sheet gimmickry to avoid facing up to huge losses on loans made by banks, thrifts and federal farm lenders.  The Farm Credit System plans to keep two sets of books -- one a rose-tinted version indicating that the big farm lender doesn't need a bailout. Mexico is to get $12 billion in new loans even though it can't repay the $98 billion it already owes. And the U.S. government keeps open more than 100 insolvent savings and loan associations at a cost of $5 million a day.  As a result, tens of billions of dollars of already-deferred losses on farm, energy, real-estate and foreign loans are snowballing faster than ever. Keeping the losses from spilling across financial markets increasingly requires action by regulators, the administration and Congress. But the delaying tactics are clearly weakening the nation's banking system. And taxpayers face more and more of the cleanup cost.
