CHICAGO, Jan. 16â€” Bob Kennedy, the general manager of the Chicago Cubs, said today that he had no plans to trade Dave Kingman, adding that Kingman had recovered ''satisfactorily'' from a shoulder injury suffered last season.  Kennedy squelched rumors that Kingman would go to the New York Mets. Kingman underwent a physical examination by the Mets earlier this month, prompting speculation the Cubs were ready to deal him.
